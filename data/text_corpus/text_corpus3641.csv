18205,while the significance of arcobacter in clinical settings grows the ecological dynamics of potentially pathogenic arcobacter in coastal marine environments remains unclear in this study we monitored the temporal dynamics of arcobacter at an urban beach subject to significant stormwater input and wet weather sewer overflows wwso weekly monitoring of bacterial communities over 24 months using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing revealed large intermittent peaks in the relative abundance of arcobacter quantitative pcr was subsequently employed to track absolute abundance of arcobacter 23s rrna gene copies revealing peaks in abundance reaching up to 108 gene copies l 1 with these increases statistically correlated with stormwater and wwso intrusion notably peaks in arcobacter abundance were poorly correlated with enterococci plate counts and remained elevated for one week following heavy rainfall using oligotyping we discriminated single nucleotide variants snvs within the arcobacter population revealing 10 distinct clusters of snvs that we defined as arcobacter ecotypes with each displaying distinct temporal dynamics the most abundant ecotype during stormwater and modelled wwso events displayed 16s rrna sequence similarity to a cryaerophilius a species previously implicated in human illness our findings highlight the diverse environmental drivers of arcobacter abundance within coastal settings and point to a potentially important yet overlooked exposure risk of these potential pathogens to humans keywords arcobacter stormwater pathogens oligotyping microbial ecology 1 introduction twenty three percent of the human population lives within 100 km of the coastline nicholls and small 2002 and as a consequence coastal environments are heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities reviewed in clark and johnston 2017 stewart et al 2008 in particular intensive urbanisation has amplified the need for stormwater drainage and wastewater removal which has led to many estuaries and beaches becoming key receiving points for a range of anthropogenic pollutants including domestic and industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and human faecal waste sidhu et al 2013 coastal beaches are also key tourist attractions and are frequently visited by humans for swimming surfing and boating users of beaches that are also receiving waters for stormwater drainage are therefore at risk of pollutant and pathogen exposure during and following heavy rainfall chemicals from human waste streams including organic and inorganic nutrients that are washed into marine receiving waters may alter the physico chemical state of marine habitats and disrupt the balance of indigenous microbial communities zhang et al 2009 potentially leading to blooms of harmful algae hallegraeff 1993 howarth et al 2000 and pathogenic bacteria e g vibrio spp thompson and polz 2006 however from a human health perspective the major microbiological consequence of urban waste streams involves the input of enteric bacteria e g escherichia coli and salmonella spp shuval 2006 viruses e g noroviruses adenoviruses echoviruses and hepatitis a sinclair et al 2009 and protozoan pathogens collier et al 2012 this allochthonous input of enteric microbes can have significant consequences for human health with waterborne infections contracted from coastal waters causing approximately 120 million cases of gastrointestinal illness and over 50 million cases of serious respiratory disease annually shuval 2003 the public health risks from aquatic pathogens are often enabled or exacerbated by urban infrastructure designed to divert stormwater into coastal waters stormwater infrastructure introduces water from urban surfaces and drains into environmental waters in many urban centres stormwater systems are also used to divert wet weather sewer overflows wwso into natural waterways during periods of heavy rainfall or following sewer system failures bickford et al 1999 as a consequence stormwater systems represent a key conduit for the spread of human pathogens into natural aquatic settings sidhu et al 2013 notably recent studies investigating microbes present in stormwater and sewer infrastructure e g pipes and drains has revealed that these environments support a microbiome dominated by only a few key bacterial groups mclellan et al 2015 vandewalle et al 2012 one of the most abundant and widespread of these groups are bacteria that belong to the genus arcobacter fisher et al 2014 arcobacter are a highly metabolically diverse genus of enteric and environmental bacteria of which many species harbour specific physiological features e g biofilm production which enable adherence to pipe surfaces assanta et al 2002 and genes that confer resistance to anthropogenic chemicals including biocides antibiotics and disinfectants mclellan et al 2015 public health and environmental monitoring practices typically involve the detection of key indicator microbes as a measure of impact from stormwater and sewage overflows specifically the cultivation of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as faecal coliforms and enterococci is routinely used to detect the presence of faecal contamination in coastal waters and estimate the risk of exposure to human health boehm and sassoubre 2014 however these culture based approaches can miss the occurrence of other non targeted pathogens that are not reliably predicted by fib including microbes that can be virulent even at low concentrations ralph and currie 2007 or have physiological capacity to persist in marine habitats for longer periods than fibs such as acinetobacter or arcobacter newton et al 2013 in light of these limitations it has become apparent that culture independent molecular methods have the advantages of identifying community level signatures of faecal pollution sauer et al 2011 detecting the presence of pathogens that are not easily cultured newton et al 2013 and potentially discovering new or previously overlooked emerging pathogens with the aid of approaches including 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics new and emerging human pathogens are being detected more frequently within natural and urbanised aquatic environments leading to an increased recognition of their potential ecological importance and public health relevance for instance bacteria belonging to the arcobacter genus have recently gained attention as emerging pathogens ramees et al 2017 largely due to their association with sewage fisher et al 2014 food contamination girbau et al 2015 and disease in a broad range of hosts douidah et al 2012 in light of this growing body of evidence implicating some arcobacter spp in illness and disease the identification of the sources transport vectors and reservoirs of arcobacter within natural environments has substantial public health relevance ramees et al 2017 in particular aquatic habitats represent a key interface for direct human contact with these potential pathogens here after observing the intermittent prominence of arcobacter in 16s rrna gene surveys we tracked weekly changes in the abundance and diversity of arcobacter spp at a public beach frequently subjected to allochthonous inputs from stormwater and sewer overflow discharge this study aimed to understand how the diversity of arcobacter in beach water changes temporally and in response to different types and magnitudes of inputs from urban runoff we hypothesised that different arcobacter populations will occupy temporal niches resulting from changes in environment driven by seasonal conditions and rainfall events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling protocols a high resolution microbial time series site was established at foreshore beach 33 95 s 151 9 e botany bay on the east coast of sydney australia foreshore beach is frequently subject to inputs of stormwater from a highly urbanised and industrial watershed see map in figure supplementary information fig 1 electrical conductivity ec was used as a proxy for water salinity with decreases in ec by 10 below mean levels used as a criteria for identifying periods of significant fresh stormwater input using this approach we discriminated stormwater impacted and dry period sampling points water quality at foreshore beach is also frequently impacted by faecal pollution from intermittent sewer overflow events released at mill pond a discharge point situated 1 2 km upstream from foreshore beach the mill pond overflow point is one of over 1000 sewer overflow points in sydney s wastewater system which diverts incompletely treated wastewater into environmental waterways during heavy rainfall nsw office of environment and heritage 2015 modelled wet weather sewer overflow wwso rates were generated using the model for urban sewers mouse package and obtained from sydney water the water authority responsible for operation of sydney s wastewater systems rates were provided by sydney water as m3 of overflow 15 min 1 which we converted to total m3 day 1 and summed across each sample date and the six preceding days to provide a measure of modelled wwso integrated over the previous week total modelled wwso was used to differentiate stormwater events from modelled wwso events water samples were collected from 1 5 m depth on a weekly basis every friday morning between 0800 and 1100 aest for 24 months beginning on the 2nd of may 2014 providing a high temporal resolution time series comprising 104 time points physicochemical parameters including temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ using a wtw multiprobe meter multi 3430 germany triplicate 5 l samples were collected to provide material for nutrient analysis flow cytometry and molecular microbiological analysis from these samples triplicate 50 ml sub samples were filtered through 0 45 μm sartorius minisart filters sartorius stedim biotech kept in

dna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing dna was extracted from filters using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions dna quantity and purity was evaluated using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific d e u s a we employed 16s rrna amplicon sequencing to characterise patterns in bacterial community diversity and composition throughout the 24 month time series the v1 v3 variable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the 27f 5 agrgtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and 519r 5 gtnttacngcggckgctg 3 primer pair nadkarni et al 2002 with a barcode on the forward primer sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq platform at molecular research lp shallowater tx usa following the manufacturer s guidelines raw data files in fastq format were deposited in ncbi sequence read archive sra with the study accession number srp143624 under bioproject number prjna420901 the 16s rrna gene sequences were analysed using the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2010 kuczynski et al 2012 and analysed using current gold standard approaches and best practice guidelines knight et al 2018 briefly paired end dna sequences were joined and de novo operational taxonomic units otus were defined at 97 sequence identity using uclust edgar et al 2011 chimeric sequences were detected using chimeraslayer haas et al 2011 and filtered from the dataset taxonomy was assigned against the silva v128 database using blast altschul et al 1990 samples were then rarefied to the same sequencing depth to remove the effect of uneven sampling effort upon downstream analyses 2 5 quantitative pcr qpcr observed peaks in the relative abundance of 16s rrna amplicon sequences matching arcobacter suggested that members of this genus were of quantitative importance following stormwater events prompting further investigation quantitative pcr qpcr was used and reported in accordance with miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 to track patterns in the absolute abundance of bacteria belonging to the arcobacter genus the oligonucleotide primers arco1 5 gtcgtgccaagaaaagcca 3 and arco2 5 ttcgcttgcgctgacat 3 were used to amplify a 331 bp segment of the arcobacter 23s rrna gene bastyns et al 1995 qpcr analyses were run in technical triplicate amounting to a total of 936 reactions measured across the 24 month time series quantification of the absolute abundance of arcobacter gene copies was achieved by normalisation of gene copies per reaction to volume of sample water filtered pcr product standards for the arcobacter qpcr assay were created by amplification of the 23s rrna segment using the arco1 and arco2 primers from an arcobacter strain isolated from foreshore beach on a modified marine agar medium of 0 01 g peptone 0 01 g yeast extract 2 8 g sea salts into 240 ml of filtered purified water dna from the isolate was extracted using a phenol chloroform extraction method briefly arcobacter cells grown on a marine agar plate were chemically lysed using a lysis buffer solution containing 30 5 na2hpo4 solution 19 5 nah2po4 solution 200 mm 8 77 nacl 2 povidone k30 1 ctab and 0 5 lysozyme into purified water to make up final volume dna was isolated and purified using phenol chloroform precipitated using isopropanol and eluted into 30 μl te buffer solution the isolate was confirmed to be a strain of arcobacter using sanger sequencing performed at the australian genomics research facility using the universal 16s rrna primers 27f 5 gagtttgatc ac tggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 the closest taxonomic match 97 similar to this isolate in the ncbi database was determined to be arcobacter venerupis ncbitaxonomic id 1054033 qpcr was performed using the bio rad cfx384 touch real time pcr detection system and arcobacter gene copies were calculated by plotting against a standard curve using bio rad cfx manager software each sample was run using three technical replicates consisting of 5 μl reaction volumes containing 2 5 μl itaq universybr green smx 2500 0 1 μl nuclease free water 0 2 μm for each forward and reverse primers and 2 μl of diluted 1 10 dna template to confirm that pcr inhibitors did not interfere with qpcr assays multiple samples were chosen and qpcr was conducted at different sample dilutions following this examination all dna was diluted 1 10 before any qpcr analysis calibration curves and negative control samples were run within every plate with all reagent and plate preparation conducted using an epmotion 5075l automated liquid handling system a 16s rrna qpcr assay nadkarni et al 2002 was also run for all samples to confirm that inhibitors were not preventing amplification of genes and that non detections were genuine to quantify temporal patterns in the arcobacter 23s rdna gene the qpcr cycling parameters described in gonzález and suski 2010 were used to confirm that the primer pair produced a single specific product a melting curve was added to the end of the first plate cycle conditions efficiency limit of detection limit of quantification and the r2 of calibration curves are reported in supplementary information table 1 2 6 characterisation of arcobacter otu diversity using oligotyping oligotyping is a computational method for measuring subtle single nucleotide variations among 16s rrna gene sequences allowing for the discrimination of otherwise concealed diversity within otus eren et al 2013 we used this approach to track patterns in arcobacter community diversity throughout the time series the q2oligo py python pipeline inside the qiime v1 9 environment was used to filter 410 427 sequence reads matching the arcobacter genus from the 16s rrna dataset supervised minimum entropy decomposition was employed using the oligotyping 2 0 pipeline available from https pypi python org pypi oligotyping 2 0 until each oligotype had converged whereby the remaining entropy was attributable only to noise the mean was taken for each sample triplicate set leaving 90 sample time points across the time series containing a sufficient quantity of arcobacter sequences for inclusion from these samples a further 47 538 sequences were discarded as noise resulting in 3076 oligotype raw nodes which were further refined to 181 final oligotypes after removing rare nodes 500 total sequences across all 90 samples upon completion of oligotyping analysis observation counts number of sequences of each oligotype expressed as a percentage of all arcobacter sequences were multiplied by the absolute abundance of total arcobacter gene copies measured using qpcr to produce estimates of absolute abundance for each oligotype both relative and absolute abundances were used in downstream analyses of arcobacter diversity and abundance 2 7 network analysis the maximal information based nonparametric exploration mine pipeline reshef et al 2011 was used to measure co occurrence patterns between arcobacter oligotypes which were subsequently visualised using the edge weighted spring embedded function in cytoscape 3 4 0 this allowed for arcobacter oligotypes to be clustered into discrete ecotype modules based on co occurrence representative sequences within each ecotype module were chosen using the pick rep set py command in qiime 1 9 and taxonomy was assigned to these sequences by referencing against a curated database of arcobacter sequences extracted from the silvav128 database a phylogenetic tree was created using figtree rambaut 2007 with campylobacter employed as an outgroup and representative oligotypes from each ecotype module were compared to the closest matching species from the curated database to uncover significant correlations between environmental conditions and arcobacter ecotype modules the mine pipeline was further employed to link ecotypes to measured environmental parameters statistically significant correlation patterns between arcobacter ecotypes absolute arcobacter abundance water chemistry parameters stormwater input and sewage discharge volume were measured across the 104 week time series only pairwise interactions that occurred across 10 or more of the time points were included and interactions with a maximal information coefficient mic value below 0 379 estimated to be equivalent to p 0 001 after correction for multiple tests were removed remaining interactions were visualised using the edge weighted spring embedded function in cytoscape 3 4 0 selected pairwise co occurrence and time lagged correlations were measured in r using cross correlation factor ccf to determine temporal relationships between input of stormwater and runoff and the absolute abundance of arcobacter using qpcr quantitative abundance data resultant data was visualised in a ccf graph showing the temporal correlation relationships across the 104 week time series 2 8 phylogenetic relationship of arcobacter oligotypes a maximum likelihood phylogeny was built to investigate the relationship of representative arcobacter oligotypes to known arcobacter strains a data set of 20 selected arcobacter oligotypes from this study was aligned with the 16s ribosomal nucleotide sequences of 19 representative arcobacter strains previously used in a similar study fisher et al 2014 additionally the 16s sequence of campylobacter jejuni was included in the data set as an outgroup the representative arcobacter sequences as well as the sequence of c jejuni were extracted from the silva v128 quast et al 2012 the complete data set was aligned using mafft v7 03 katoh and standley 2013 with default parameters the alignment was subsequently curated and positions with more than 2 gaps were removed resulting in a final alignment of 374 positions in all 40 sequences the approximate maximum likelyhood phylogeny was inferred using fasttree 2 price et al 2010 2 9 enterococci counts historical enterococci colony forming unit cfu count data from foreshore beach was retrieved from the nsw office of environment and heritage beachwatch website http www environment nsw gov au beachapp report enterococci aspx this data was used to compare a standard fib monitoring approach to our qpcr measurements of arcobacter however samples for measurement of enterococci were often collected on different days and at varied time intervals compared to our data prohibiting a direct statistical comparison of these datasets therefore data were log 1 x transformed and confirmed that the assumption of normality was satisfied pearson s correlation was then used to test for significant correlations between enterococci counts and arcobacter abundance and population composition using the closest preceding or proceeding enterococci value within three days to compare with each arcobacter absolute abundance and oligotype relative abundance value enterococci counts were partitioned into 4 microbial assessment categories mac a b c and d the mac is a method established by the world health organisation for calculating the risk of illness in swimmers dependant on the concentration of a fib nsw office of environment and heritage 2015 each category represents a different escalating level of risk of illness based upon epidemiological studies in comparable environments for example enterococci counts 40 cfu ml 1 are assigned to category a whereby the risk of a water user contracting a gastrointestinal illness gi is estimated to be 1 or an acute fever or rash afr 0 3 estimated risk escalates with higher enterococci counts values up to category d see table 1 3 results during the 2 year time series foreshore beach was frequently subjected to inputs of stormwater from a highly urbanised and industrial watershed which were detected following periods of intense rainfall and correlated with drops in electrical conductivity ec supplementary information fig 2 in most cases ec values returned to baseline levels seen during dry periods by the subsequent sampling occasion a total of 16 stormwater events were observed during the two year time series of which 10 events coincided with modelled wet weather sewer overflows wwso these modelled wwso events ranged in magnitude from 4193 m3 week 1 to 465 438 m3 week 1 supplementary information fig 3 relative to dry periods the input of stormwater at foreshore beach led to significantly higher levels of nh4 f 6 65 df 1 76 p 0 01 fig 1 while modelled wwsos led to significantly higher levels of nh4 f 9 51 df 1 80 p 0 01 and po4 f 8 05 df 1 80 p 0 01 the highest nutrient concentrations were recorded following modelled wwsos when up to 22 fold higher concentrations of nh4 were observed relative to baseline conditions fig 1 stormwater input and modelled wwso events also led to 1 2 order of magnitude increases in total bacterial abundance fig 1 peaks in enterococci counts also coincided with these events with counts increasing from 40 cfu ml 1 during dry periods to 200 cfu ml 1 during all 10 modelled wwso events and 4 stormwater only events supplementary information fig 4 3 1 rainfall runoff drives shifts in the diversity of bacterial communities stormwater and modelled wwso events led to pronounced and statistically significant changes in the diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages at foreshore beach as determined using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing input of stormwater and modelled wwso following precipitation led to compositional shifts in bacterial assemblage structure from a characteristic marine community i e dominated by organisms such as sar11 synechococcus and flavobacteria during dry periods to a community that often included high proportions of enteric bacteria such as aeromonas acinetobacter arcobacter and lachnospiraceae transported into the environment from the stormwater system fig 2 notably only stormwater events that coincided with wwso led to a significant increase in diversity compared to dry periods anova f 4 8 df 1 80 p 0 03 shannon s diversity index supplementary information fig 5 among the most notable shifts in bacterial assemblage structure involved the presence of large spikes in the relative abundance of otus assigned to the arcobacter genus fig 3 peaks in arcobacter sequences often coincided with peaks in the relative abundance of other potential pathogens and faecal indicators detected in other studies of sewage bacterial communities mclellan et al 2015 vandewalle et al 2012 with positive significant p 0 001 correlations revealed in the mine analysis observed between arcobacter and acinetobacter two otus aeromonadaceae two otus aeromonas three otus bacteroides two otus cloacibacterium one otu lachnospiraceae one otu and streptococcus one otu during dry periods arcobacter otus comprised on average only 5 of all 16s sequences but increased significantly p 0 01 in relative abundance following input of stormwater and modelled wwso with the strongest peaks in abundance reaching 37 and 66 relative abundance respectively fig 3 3 2 spikes in the abundance of arcobacter fuelled by inputs of stormwater and wwso the large increases in relative abundance of arcobacter otus were corroborated by qpcr quantification of the arcobacter 23s rrna gene whereby arcobacter was detected in 97 of 104 samples consistent with the patterns observed in the amplicon sequencing data mean absolute abundance of arcobacter was lowest during dry periods when mean background concentrations were 2 2 106 copies l 1 s d 6 36 106 but increased during stormwater input to mean concentrations of 7 8 106 gene copies l 1 s d 1 25 106 and further again during wwso events to mean concentrations of 1 8 107 copies l 1 s d 2 45 107 supplementary fig 6 when compared to dry periods mean arcobacter abundance was not significantly higher during stormwater input p 0 05 but was during wwso anova f 5 5 df 1 83 p 0 02 cross correlation factor ccf analysis confirmed that peaks in arcobacter abundance generally persisted for an additional week after intense rainfall supplementary fig 7a and the subsequent input of stormwater and modelled wwso supplementary fig 7b 3 3 arcobacter populations display distinct temporal dynamics an oligotyping approach eren et al 2013 was used to discriminate diversity of snvs within arcobacter populations in the 16s rrna sequencing data we detected the presence of 181 discrete arcobacter oligotypes during the 2 year study period we subsequently used network analysis to cluster these oligotypes into 10 distinct modules each containing between 5 and 31 closely coupled nodes fig 4 oligotypes within these nodes exhibited highly correlated temporal dynamics and relationships with environmental parameters and we therefore consider these clusters of oligotypes to be distinct groups of ecotypes that occupy a common environmental niche ecotype 1 comprised 31 tightly clustered oligotypes fig 4 with the most similar sequence match which was based on a short base pair read length 95 sequence similarity for all of these oligotypes being a cryaerophilus ncbi accession no u25805 supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned as aliiarcobacter cryaerophilus comb nov perez cataluna et al 2018 ecotype 1 was the most abundant arcobacter ecotype during the study period representing 56 of the arcobacter community when relative arcobacter sequence abundances were normalised to arcobacter gene copies defined using qpcr fig 5 however the abundance of ecotype 1 was highly variable across the time series ranging between 1 and 98 of all arcobacter sequences fig 5 reaching a maximum abundance of 1 62 108 gene copies l 1 ecotype 1 was most abundant during the summer when water temperatures ranged between 19 5 and 26 5 c and stormwater and modelled wwso events occurred most frequently indeed ecotype 1 abundance was statistically correlated with stormwater events mic 0 47 p 0 01 fig 6 when it comprised 33 of arcobacter sequences fig 5 and modelled wwso input mic 0 35 p 0 01 fig 6 when it comprised 66 of arcobacter sequences fig 5 ecotype 2 comprised 18 oligotypes fig 4 with all most closely matching 96 sequence similarity a nitrofigilis ncbi accession no l14627 supplementary fig 8 this ecotype represented a modest contribution to total arcobacter abundance 3 9 of normalised sequence reads but was most prevalent during dry periods 2 15 105 s d 5 63 105 gene copies l 1 and during the winter 5 63 105 s d 6 65 105 gene copies l 1 fig 5 when the total abundance of arcobacter populations was low relative to other periods sequences belonging to ecotype groups 3 4 and 5 fig 4 were all most similar to a molluscorum each with 95 sequence similarity to ncbi accession no 117055 supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned as malacobacter molluscorum comb nov perez cataluna et al 2018 but displayed contrasting occurrence and abundance to one another between seasons and under different environmental conditions for example ecotype 3 was the second most abundant group of arcobacter over the course of the study contributing over 24 of normalised sequence reads and was most abundant in winter 5 02 106 s d 9 05 106 gene copies l 1 and during dry periods 1 83 106 s d 5 03 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 in contrast ecotypes 4 and 5 were the least abundant each contributing under 1 of all arcobacter sequence reads or 1 2 orders of magnitude less gene copies l 1 compared with ecotype 3 and were often absent or rare not detected from 50 of samples fig 5 ecotype 3 and 4 were most abundant during dry periods in winter with their abundance negatively correlated to temperature mic 0 67 p 0 01 fig 6 and highest abundances occurring when water temperatures and inorganic nutrient concentrations were low temperature 13 1 18 8 c in contrast the majority of normalised sequence reads belonging to ecotype 5 58 24 occurred during stormwater impacted periods in spring fig 5 ecotypes 6 7 8 and 9 fig 4 all displayed highest sequence similarity with a venerupis 95 sequence similarities to ncbi accession no 117569 supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned to pseudoarcobacter venerupis comb nov and were each comprised of between 5 and 23 tightly clustered arcobacter oligotypes fig 4 ecotype 8 was the third most abundant ecotype contributing 10 of sequence reads across the entire time series due to its prominence during periods impacted by wwso 2 90 106 s d 4 13 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 conversely ecotypes 6 7 and 9 were less abundant 0 9 2 3 and 1 5 of sequence reads respectively and differed significantly p 0 05 across seasons fig 5 with ecotypes 7 8 and 9 most abundant in spring 2 24 105 s d 5 53 106 1 41 106 s d 8 40 105 and 1 44 105 s d 8 14 104 gene copies l 1 respectively and ecotype 6 most abundant in summer 1 24 105 s d 7 65 104 fig 5 these ecotypes were also most prominent during periods impacted by wwso increasing by 1 2 orders of magnitude compared to dry periods 104 105 and 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 as indicated by strong correlations with wwso volume mic 0 31 0 30 0 43 and 0 38 respectively p 0 01 fig 6 notably however these groups were not correlated with stormwater events alone the relative abundance of all four ecotypes with sequence reads affiliated with a venerupis groups 6 9 correlated significantly with ecotype 10 mic 0 36 0 55 p 0 01 which consisted of 11 oligotypes fig 4 however ecotype 10 had a highest taxonomic match to a cloacae 97 sequence similarity supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned to pseudoarcobacter cloacae comb nov this group coincided almost exclusively with modelled wwso with over 90 of normalised sequence reads belonging to samples collected during modelled wwso events across the entire time series ecotype 10 was the least abundant arcobacter ecotype comprising less than 1 of all arcobacter sequence reads fig 5 and was not detected within 50 of samples however following stormwater input on 3 occassions during spring this ecotype spiked in abundance by 3 orders of magnitude when normalised to qpcr counts reaching concentrations 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 notably there was no statistically significant correlation between either absolute arcobacter abundance or the relative abundance of any arcobacter oligotypes and enterococci counts 4 discussion urbanised coastal habitats are often exposed to high levels of terrestrial runoff ferguson et al 2003 including stormwater and wet weather sewer overflow wwso following rainfall newton et al 2011 sidhu et al 2013 that can lead to shifts in microbial community composition cunha and almeida 2006 and the transport of human pathogens from waste stream environments into marine surface waters sauer et al 2011 standard approaches for monitoring these events include the enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as faecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococci boehm and sassoubre 2014 however while these approaches quantify the extent of contamination according to the detection of specific marker microbes other potentially pathogenic microbes can display different levels of occurrence and persistence to fib bradshaw et al 2016 in our high temporal resolution coastal time series 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed dramatic shifts in the composition of bacterial communities at a stormwater impacted beach located near to sydney australia sydney is the most densely populated city in australia with more than 4 6 million people at 2015 and growing rapidly gsc 2016 sydney s climate is warm temperate to sub tropical with precipitation patterns characterised by intermittent periods of intense and heavy rainfall which is often strongest during the late summer leading to large and intense inputs of runoff and stormwater discharge into the coastal marine environment the most notable shifts in the composition of bacterial communities at foreshore beach following stormwater and wwso inputs were associated with large and rapid increases in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the arcobacter genus with sequences assigned to this group increasing from background levels of 1 of 16s rrna sequences up to 70 these increases in arcobacter following stormwater and wwso intrusions are consistent with observations from other regions that have demonstrated high levels of arcobacter within aquatic environments including lake eerie lee et al 2012 and lake michigan newton et al 2013 following periods of significant rainfall these observations could be of public health concern given the status of this genus as an emerging environmental pathogen ferreira et al 2016 4 1 stormwater and wwso fuels peaks in arcobacter abundance investigations into the occurrence of arcobacter in human and animal gut microbiomes indicate that this genus generally comprises less than 0 001 of the total microbial consortium gevers et al 2012 however in wastewater treatment facilities where imposed treatment conditions supress all but the most resilient enteric microbes the relative abundance of arcobacter can be much higher 5 11 of bacterial communities fisher et al 2014 within natural marine and freshwater environments arcobacter generally occur in low abundances below 1 lee et al 2012 but may increase in abundance in environments subject to influence from human and animal waste streams however to date investigations to determine whether intrusions of wastewater can lead to increases in the environmental abundance of this group are lacking earlier studies have confirmed the reliability of applying a pcr approach to amplify conserved regions on the 23s rrna gene to quantify the total abundance of arcobacter gonzález and suski 2010 hausdorf et al 2013 lee et al 2012 using this approach five orders of magnitude from 103 to 108 gene copies l 1 increase in the absolute abundance of arcobacter occurred at foreshore beach during and following rainfall notably the highest concentrations of arcobacter detected in this study were 100 fold greater than those reported by lee et al 2012 whom employed the same qpcr assay to investigate arcobacter abundance at lake eerie beach an environment similarly impacted by faecal contamination while peaks in arcobacter abundance were tightly coupled with the input of stormwater modelled wwso discharge produced the highest concentrations of arcobacter gene copies and it is notable that arcobacter abundance was not generally well predicted by fib in this case enterococci count data supplementary fig 4 in particular four of the highest observed peaks in total arcobacter abundance corresponded with low enterococci counts which according to fib guidelines would not on their own trigger warnings to swimmers or beach closures furthermore it was observed in the 16s bacterial community profile that several other enteric and potentially pathogenic bacteria acinetorbacter aeromonas bacteroides cloacibacterium and streptococcus did covary with total arcobacter and may also be poorly indicated by standard fib methods 4 2 arcobacter diversity is temporally dynamic understanding the ecology of arcobacter in coastal marine environments is important because arcobacter are increasingly associated with disease in animals and humans collado and figueras 2011 yet not all species are pathogenic levels of virulence and niche preferences vary between arcobacter species douidah et al 2012 but the temporal dynamics of this group are not well understood within coastal environments where contact with humans may be significant this study has used an oligotyping approach eren et al 2013 to discriminate single nucleotide differences within the v1 v3 region of the 16s rrna gene to identify potentially ecologically meaningful patterns eren et al 2013 in the diversity of 16s rrna sequence reads matched to arcobacter among culture independent techniques 16s rrna sequencing has been widely used to characterise bacterial community diversity and composition but for many bacterial groups such as vibrio bacillus and others it delivers poor species level resolution janda and abbott 2007 moreover this limitation becomes more relevant when only part of the 16s rrna has been sequenced such as in short read sequencing platforms nevertheless the sequence depth and accuracy afforded by this technique allows us to identify and assess temporal patterns across multiple oligotype clusters without resolving their species identity we found a high level of micro diversity within arcobacter populations however it is important to note that this approach does not allow for specific phylogenetic inference of individual oligotypes we report only the closest taxonomic match to oligotypes grouped into arcobacter ecotypes this does not mean that the species of these ecotypes have been identified furthermore oligotyping does not confirm whether these ecotypes display any of the biological or pathogenic characteristics of their closest sequence match sampling at weekly intervals enabled detection of clear shifts in assemblage structure at both seasonal and episodic time periods which would not have been achievable using only a snapshot sampling approach most pronounced were sharp shifts in arcobacter populations that coincided with stormwater and modelled wwso events by using network analysis to cluster oligotypes into ecotype groups we observed a total of 181 oligotypes distributed across 10 dominant ecotypes with these groups showing clearly different temporal dynamics and environmental preferences to one another this approach allowed for the further partitioning of the arcobacter community into 2 distinct populations marine ecotypes that persist in surface waters at low abundances during dry conditions and waste stream ecotypes that dominate during periods impacted by stormwater and wwso input but occur in low abundances or disappear completely outside of these events several environmental species of arcobacter have also been isolated from marine organisms including a nitrofigilis which was first identified as a nitrogen fixing symbiont of seagrass pati et al 2010 and arcobacter species isolated from bivalves clams mussels and oysters including a elissii figueras et al 2011b a molluscorium figueras et al 2011a and a bivavlorium levican et al 2012 a number of other arcobacter species including a butzleri a skirrowi and a cryaerophilus have been isolated from organisms harvested for seafoods such as shell fish mottola et al 2016 and have also been implicated in waterborne gastrointestinal diseases kopilović et al 2008 nieva echevarria et al 2013 rice et al 1999 in fact it appears that many species of arcobacter found in water share a propensity for inhabiting shellfish which may be attributed to genes that confer production of adhesion enzymes that facilitate adherence and invasion of gut epithelial cells girbau et al 2015 which could indicate the ability to also invade the gut epithelials of human water users additionally arcobacter spp can tolerate a broad range of temperatures van driessche and houf 2008 oxygen snelling et al 2006 and salinity levels salas masso et al 2016 which might enable them to survive in coastal waters for longer periods than other enteric microbes which provides increased opportunity to encounter human water users although detection of arcobacter in marine organisms has been reported figueras et al 2011a 2011b the origin distribution and persistence of these arcobacter species in the surface waters of coastal marine environments remains poorly characterised moreover it has been noted previously that while several species culture readily eg a butzleri some species are more difficult to culture or remain uncultivated to date fisher et al 2014 consequently studies that rely solely on culture based methods risk over representing some arcobacter species and under representing others therefore in this study next generation sequencing was used to characterise arcobacter populations which includes uncultured species and is independent of culture bias this approach revealed strong seasonal partitioning of dry period arcobacter communities for example 3 arcobacter ecotypes exhibiting sequence similarity closest to a molluscorium were the dominant arcobacter populations during dry periods in winter when total arcobacter abundance was lowest alternatively ecotype 10 most closely matched to a cloacae which has been previously isolated and associated with sewage was not correlated with stormwater or modelled wwso input and instead was one of the more dominant ecotypes during dry periods in summer other arcobacter populations enter the surface waters of coastal habitats in high abundances via fecal pollution collado et al 2008 in this study ecotypes 6 7 and 8 which exhibited closest sequence identity to a venerupis 95 similarity were strongly correlated with both stormwater input and modelled wwso this was an unexpected observation because to date arcobacter displaying 16s rrna sequence reads similar to a venerupis has not previously been linked to sewage from human waste streams on the other hand the strong correlation observed between ecotype 1 which showed high sequence similarity to a cryaerophilus and stormwater and modelled wwso inputs suggests an association with sewage pollution collado et al 2008 across the entire time series this ecotype contributed the highest absolute abundance of all 10 ecotypes when normalised to qpcr data this group peaked in abundance when more than 24 000 m3 of modelled wwso was discharged from the upstream mill pond overflow point the high levels of occurrence of this ecotype in the coastal environment is potentially significant because a cryaerophilus is the second most after a butzleri reported arcobacter species to be associated with water and food borne diseases van den abeele et al 2014 with evidence that this species is responsible for outbreaks of gastroenteritis and clinical cases of bacteraemia collado and figueras 2011 notably oligotypes exhibiting high sequence similarity with a cryaerophilus were most abundant during the summer periods when more water users particularly swimmers use beaches in sydney and may therefore be at risk of exposure to pathogens in marine waters curiously the influence of sewage pollution at foreshore beach did not result in detection of oligotypes that were similar to the arcobacter species most frequently isolated from sewage and clinical samples a butzleri arguello et al 2015 indeed none of the arcobacter oligotypes identified in this study exhibited high sequence similarity to this species similarly fisher et al 2014 noted in their study of arcobacter populations across 37 sewer locations in the u s a and spain that a butzleri was only the eleventh most abundant oligotype detected the previous apparent prominence of a butzleri in sewage communities may be due to an over representation of this species in culture based approaches which has been noted in previous studies of arcobacter populations fisher et al 2014 gilbert et al 2014 salas masso et al 2016 4 3 implications for pathogen monitoring in coastal environments there are several implications to consider in light of the observations made in this study firstly our data demonstrates that weekly sampling resolution at least is required to fully capture rapid shifts in the abundance and diversity of arcobacter and potentially other enteric microbes in coastal waters subject to the highly dynamic influence of stormwater and wwso secondly discrete rainfall events and waste stream inputs that lead to peaks in arcobacter abundance may result in variable levels of risk to public health because the composition and diversity of arcobacter communities shifts between seasons and perturbation events for instance our data indicates that total peaks in arcobacter abundance were highest during summer at foreshore beach when beaches are most frequented by swimmers and other water users but the arcobacter community was also comprised of the highest proportion of oligotypes that exhibited high sequence similarity with the emerging pathogen species a cryaerophilus at this time thirdly our data revealed that peaks in the abundance of arcobacter can remain elevated for up to one week following intense rainfall and importantly can remain high for periods that significantly exceed the time that fib levels are elevated survival of arcobacter in marine environments beyond that of fib such as e coli is likely owed to halotolerance exhibited in several species salas masso et al 2016 although e coli has been shown to predict arcobacter in shellfish salas masso et al 2018 filter feeders that function like passive samplers of their environment the data presented here shows that arcobacter in the ambient water of coastal environments are not well predicted by fib this could have serious implications for public health as standard recommendations by water quality organisations suggest avoiding water use for 1 3 days after rainfall given that we detected numerous peaks in the total abundance of arcobacter 107 gene copies l 1 that occurred within 3 days of category a low risk enterococci counts water users may be exposed to high levels of arcobacter and other stormwater and sewage bacteria during periods when fib based monitoring suggest low levels of risk at present it is unclear what health risks may be associated with swimmer exposure to arcobacter in coastal water as studies that provide data on infective dose or probability of infection following human exposure to environmental arcobacter are lacking banting et al 2019 5 conclusion this study has resolved the fine scale temporal dynamics of arcobacter entering and persisting within the marine receiving waters for urban runoff with evidence for an important role of stormwater and wwso given that many arcobacter species are i human pathogens ii have the capacity to accumulate in marine organisms that are consumed by humans oysters clams and mussels iii are rarely monitored in swimming locations and iv survive in marine waters longer than other enteric microbes targeted in standard fib based testing routines these organisms could pose a significant yet largely overlooked risk to the public health in coastal environments in this study the application of 16s rrna gene sequencing with quantitative pcr allowed us to initially identify and then focus our analyses on a potential microbial pathogen which would have been overlooked using standard culture dependant methods demonstrating the need for inclusion of modern molecular microbiological tools in environmental monitoring programs author contributions this study

18205,while the significance of arcobacter in clinical settings grows the ecological dynamics of potentially pathogenic arcobacter in coastal marine environments remains unclear in this study we monitored the temporal dynamics of arcobacter at an urban beach subject to significant stormwater input and wet weather sewer overflows wwso weekly monitoring of bacterial communities over 24 months using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing revealed large intermittent peaks in the relative abundance of arcobacter quantitative pcr was subsequently employed to track absolute abundance of arcobacter 23s rrna gene copies revealing peaks in abundance reaching up to 108 gene copies l 1 with these increases statistically correlated with stormwater and wwso intrusion notably peaks in arcobacter abundance were poorly correlated with enterococci plate counts and remained elevated for one week following heavy rainfall using oligotyping we discriminated single nucleotide variants snvs within the arcobacter population revealing 10 distinct clusters of snvs that we defined as arcobacter ecotypes with each displaying distinct temporal dynamics the most abundant ecotype during stormwater and modelled wwso events displayed 16s rrna sequence similarity to a cryaerophilius a species previously implicated in human illness our findings highlight the diverse environmental drivers of arcobacter abundance within coastal settings and point to a potentially important yet overlooked exposure risk of these potential pathogens to humans keywords arcobacter stormwater pathogens oligotyping microbial ecology 1 introduction twenty three percent of the human population lives within 100 km of the coastline nicholls and small 2002 and as a consequence coastal environments are heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities reviewed in clark and johnston 2017 stewart et al 2008 in particular intensive urbanisation has amplified the need for stormwater drainage and wastewater removal which has led to many estuaries and beaches becoming key receiving points for a range of anthropogenic pollutants including domestic and industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and human faecal waste sidhu et al 2013 coastal beaches are also key tourist attractions and are frequently visited by humans for swimming surfing and boating users of beaches that are also receiving waters for stormwater drainage are therefore at risk of pollutant and pathogen exposure during and following heavy rainfall chemicals from human waste streams including organic and inorganic nutrients that are washed into marine receiving waters may alter the physico chemical state of marine habitats and disrupt the balance of indigenous microbial communities zhang et al 2009 potentially leading to blooms of harmful algae hallegraeff 1993 howarth et al 2000 and pathogenic bacteria e g vibrio spp thompson and polz 2006 however from a human health perspective the major microbiological consequence of urban waste streams involves the input of enteric bacteria e g escherichia coli and salmonella spp shuval 2006 viruses e g noroviruses adenoviruses echoviruses and hepatitis a sinclair et al 2009 and protozoan pathogens collier et al 2012 this allochthonous input of enteric microbes can have significant consequences for human health with waterborne infections contracted from coastal waters causing approximately 120 million cases of gastrointestinal illness and over 50 million cases of serious respiratory disease annually shuval 2003 the public health risks from aquatic pathogens are often enabled or exacerbated by urban infrastructure designed to divert stormwater into coastal waters stormwater infrastructure introduces water from urban surfaces and drains into environmental waters in many urban centres stormwater systems are also used to divert wet weather sewer overflows wwso into natural waterways during periods of heavy rainfall or following sewer system failures bickford et al 1999 as a consequence stormwater systems represent a key conduit for the spread of human pathogens into natural aquatic settings sidhu et al 2013 notably recent studies investigating microbes present in stormwater and sewer infrastructure e g pipes and drains has revealed that these environments support a microbiome dominated by only a few key bacterial groups mclellan et al 2015 vandewalle et al 2012 one of the most abundant and widespread of these groups are bacteria that belong to the genus arcobacter fisher et al 2014 arcobacter are a highly metabolically diverse genus of enteric and environmental bacteria of which many species harbour specific physiological features e g biofilm production which enable adherence to pipe surfaces assanta et al 2002 and genes that confer resistance to anthropogenic chemicals including biocides antibiotics and disinfectants mclellan et al 2015 public health and environmental monitoring practices typically involve the detection of key indicator microbes as a measure of impact from stormwater and sewage overflows specifically the cultivation of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as faecal coliforms and enterococci is routinely used to detect the presence of faecal contamination in coastal waters and estimate the risk of exposure to human health boehm and sassoubre 2014 however these culture based approaches can miss the occurrence of other non targeted pathogens that are not reliably predicted by fib including microbes that can be virulent even at low concentrations ralph and currie 2007 or have physiological capacity to persist in marine habitats for longer periods than fibs such as acinetobacter or arcobacter newton et al 2013 in light of these limitations it has become apparent that culture independent molecular methods have the advantages of identifying community level signatures of faecal pollution sauer et al 2011 detecting the presence of pathogens that are not easily cultured newton et al 2013 and potentially discovering new or previously overlooked emerging pathogens with the aid of approaches including 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics new and emerging human pathogens are being detected more frequently within natural and urbanised aquatic environments leading to an increased recognition of their potential ecological importance and public health relevance for instance bacteria belonging to the arcobacter genus have recently gained attention as emerging pathogens ramees et al 2017 largely due to their association with sewage fisher et al 2014 food contamination girbau et al 2015 and disease in a broad range of hosts douidah et al 2012 in light of this growing body of evidence implicating some arcobacter spp in illness and disease the identification of the sources transport vectors and reservoirs of arcobacter within natural environments has substantial public health relevance ramees et al 2017 in particular aquatic habitats represent a key interface for direct human contact with these potential pathogens here after observing the intermittent prominence of arcobacter in 16s rrna gene surveys we tracked weekly changes in the abundance and diversity of arcobacter spp at a public beach frequently subjected to allochthonous inputs from stormwater and sewer overflow discharge this study aimed to understand how the diversity of arcobacter in beach water changes temporally and in response to different types and magnitudes of inputs from urban runoff we hypothesised that different arcobacter populations will occupy temporal niches resulting from changes in environment driven by seasonal conditions and rainfall events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling protocols a high resolution microbial time series site was established at

taken for each sample triplicate set leaving 90 sample time points across the time series containing a sufficient quantity of arcobacter sequences for inclusion from these samples a further 47 538 sequences were discarded as noise resulting in 3076 oligotype raw nodes which were further refined to 181 final oligotypes after removing rare nodes 500 total sequences across all 90 samples upon completion of oligotyping analysis observation counts number of sequences of each oligotype expressed as a percentage of all arcobacter sequences were multiplied by the absolute abundance of total arcobacter gene copies measured using qpcr to produce estimates of absolute abundance for each oligotype both relative and absolute abundances were used in downstream analyses of arcobacter diversity and abundance 2 7 network analysis the maximal information based nonparametric exploration mine pipeline reshef et al 2011 was used to measure co occurrence patterns between arcobacter oligotypes which were subsequently visualised using the edge weighted spring embedded function in cytoscape 3 4 0 this allowed for arcobacter oligotypes to be clustered into discrete ecotype modules based on co occurrence representative sequences within each ecotype module were chosen using the pick rep set py command in qiime 1 9 and taxonomy was assigned to these sequences by referencing against a curated database of arcobacter sequences extracted from the silvav128 database a phylogenetic tree was created using figtree rambaut 2007 with campylobacter employed as an outgroup and representative oligotypes from each ecotype module were compared to the closest matching species from the curated database to uncover significant correlations between environmental conditions and arcobacter ecotype modules the mine pipeline was further employed to link ecotypes to measured environmental parameters statistically significant correlation patterns between arcobacter ecotypes absolute arcobacter abundance water chemistry parameters stormwater input and sewage discharge volume were measured across the 104 week time series only pairwise interactions that occurred across 10 or more of the time points were included and interactions with a maximal information coefficient mic value below 0 379 estimated to be equivalent to p 0 001 after correction for multiple tests were removed remaining interactions were visualised using the edge weighted spring embedded function in cytoscape 3 4 0 selected pairwise co occurrence and time lagged correlations were measured in r using cross correlation factor ccf to determine temporal relationships between input of stormwater and runoff and the absolute abundance of arcobacter using qpcr quantitative abundance data resultant data was visualised in a ccf graph showing the temporal correlation relationships across the 104 week time series 2 8 phylogenetic relationship of arcobacter oligotypes a maximum likelihood phylogeny was built to investigate the relationship of representative arcobacter oligotypes to known arcobacter strains a data set of 20 selected arcobacter oligotypes from this study was aligned with the 16s ribosomal nucleotide sequences of 19 representative arcobacter strains previously used in a similar study fisher et al 2014 additionally the 16s sequence of campylobacter jejuni was included in the data set as an outgroup the representative arcobacter sequences as well as the sequence of c jejuni were extracted from the silva v128 quast et al 2012 the complete data set was aligned using mafft v7 03 katoh and standley 2013 with default parameters the alignment was subsequently curated and positions with more than 2 gaps were removed resulting in a final alignment of 374 positions in all 40 sequences the approximate maximum likelyhood phylogeny was inferred using fasttree 2 price et al 2010 2 9 enterococci counts historical enterococci colony forming unit cfu count data from foreshore beach was retrieved from the nsw office of environment and heritage beachwatch website http www environment nsw gov au beachapp report enterococci aspx this data was used to compare a standard fib monitoring approach to our qpcr measurements of arcobacter however samples for measurement of enterococci were often collected on different days and at varied time intervals compared to our data prohibiting a direct statistical comparison of these datasets therefore data were log 1 x transformed and confirmed that the assumption of normality was satisfied pearson s correlation was then used to test for significant correlations between enterococci counts and arcobacter abundance and population composition using the closest preceding or proceeding enterococci value within three days to compare with each arcobacter absolute abundance and oligotype relative abundance value enterococci counts were partitioned into 4 microbial assessment categories mac a b c and d the mac is a method established by the world health organisation for calculating the risk of illness in swimmers dependant on the concentration of a fib nsw office of environment and heritage 2015 each category represents a different escalating level of risk of illness based upon epidemiological studies in comparable environments for example enterococci counts 40 cfu ml 1 are assigned to category a whereby the risk of a water user contracting a gastrointestinal illness gi is estimated to be 1 or an acute fever or rash afr 0 3 estimated risk escalates with higher enterococci counts values up to category d see table 1 3 results during the 2 year time series foreshore beach was frequently subjected to inputs of stormwater from a highly urbanised and industrial watershed which were detected following periods of intense rainfall and correlated with drops in electrical conductivity ec supplementary information fig 2 in most cases ec values returned to baseline levels seen during dry periods by the subsequent sampling

modelled wwso events and 4 stormwater only events supplementary information fig 4 3 1 rainfall runoff drives shifts in the diversity of bacterial communities stormwater and modelled wwso events led to pronounced and statistically significant changes in the diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages at foreshore beach as determined using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing input of stormwater and modelled wwso following precipitation led to compositional shifts in bacterial assemblage structure from a characteristic marine community i e dominated by organisms such as sar11 synechococcus and flavobacteria during dry periods to a community that often included high proportions of enteric bacteria such as aeromonas acinetobacter arcobacter and lachnospiraceae transported into the environment from the stormwater system fig 2 notably only stormwater events that coincided with wwso led to a significant increase in diversity compared to dry periods anova f 4 8 df 1 80 p 0 03 shannon s diversity index supplementary information fig 5 among the most notable shifts in bacterial assemblage structure involved the presence of large spikes in the relative abundance of otus assigned to the arcobacter genus fig 3 peaks in arcobacter sequences often coincided with peaks in the relative abundance of other potential pathogens and faecal indicators detected in other studies of sewage bacterial communities mclellan et al 2015 vandewalle et al 2012 with positive significant p 0 001 correlations revealed in the mine analysis observed between arcobacter and acinetobacter two otus aeromonadaceae two otus aeromonas three otus bacteroides two otus cloacibacterium one otu lachnospiraceae one otu and streptococcus one otu during dry periods arcobacter otus comprised on average only 5 of all 16s sequences but increased significantly p 0 01 in relative abundance following input of stormwater and modelled wwso with the strongest peaks in abundance reaching 37 and 66 relative abundance respectively fig 3 3 2 spikes in the abundance of arcobacter fuelled by inputs of stormwater and wwso the large increases in relative abundance of arcobacter otus were corroborated by qpcr quantification of the arcobacter 23s rrna gene whereby arcobacter was detected in 97 of 104 samples consistent with the patterns observed in the amplicon sequencing data mean absolute abundance of arcobacter was lowest during dry periods when mean background concentrations were 2 2 106 copies l 1 s d 6 36 106 but increased during stormwater input to mean concentrations of 7 8 106 gene copies l

significantly higher during stormwater input p 0 05 but was during wwso anova f 5 5 df 1 83 p 0 02 cross correlation factor ccf analysis confirmed that peaks in arcobacter abundance generally persisted for an additional week after intense rainfall supplementary fig 7a and the subsequent input of stormwater and modelled wwso supplementary fig 7b 3 3 arcobacter populations display distinct temporal dynamics an oligotyping approach eren et al 2013 was used to discriminate diversity of snvs within arcobacter populations in the 16s rrna sequencing data we detected the presence of 181 discrete arcobacter oligotypes during the 2 year study period we subsequently used network analysis to cluster these oligotypes into 10 distinct modules each containing between 5 and 31 closely coupled nodes fig 4 oligotypes within these nodes exhibited highly correlated temporal dynamics and relationships with environmental parameters and we therefore consider these clusters of oligotypes to be distinct groups of ecotypes that occupy a common environmental niche ecotype 1 comprised 31 tightly clustered oligotypes fig 4 with the most similar sequence match which was based on a short base pair read length 95 sequence similarity for all of these oligotypes being a cryaerophilus ncbi accession no u25805 supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned as aliiarcobacter cryaerophilus comb nov perez cataluna et al 2018 ecotype 1 was the most abundant arcobacter ecotype during the study period representing 56 of the arcobacter community when relative arcobacter sequence abundances were normalised to arcobacter gene copies defined using qpcr fig 5 however the abundance of ecotype 1 was highly variable across the time series ranging between 1 and 98 of all arcobacter sequences fig 5 reaching a maximum abundance of 1 62 108 gene copies l 1 ecotype 1 was most abundant during the summer when water temperatures ranged between 19 5 and 26 5 c and stormwater and modelled wwso events occurred most frequently indeed ecotype 1 abundance was statistically correlated with stormwater events mic 0 47 p 0 01 fig 6 when it comprised 33 of arcobacter sequences fig 5 and modelled wwso input mic 0 35 p 0 01 fig 6 when it comprised 66 of arcobacter sequences fig 5 ecotype 2 comprised 18 oligotypes fig 4 with all most closely matching 96 sequence similarity a nitrofigilis ncbi accession no l14627 supplementary fig 8 this ecotype represented a modest contribution to total arcobacter abundance 3 9 of normalised sequence reads but was most prevalent during dry periods 2 15 105 s d 5 63 105 gene copies l 1 and during the winter 5 63 105 s d 6 65 105 gene copies l 1 fig 5 when the total abundance of arcobacter populations was low relative to other periods sequences belonging to ecotype groups 3 4 and 5 fig 4 were all most similar to a molluscorum each with 95 sequence similarity to ncbi accession no 117055 supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned as malacobacter molluscorum comb nov perez cataluna et al 2018 but displayed contrasting occurrence and abundance to one another between seasons and under different environmental conditions for example ecotype 3 was the second most abundant group of arcobacter over the course of the study contributing over 24 of normalised sequence reads and was most abundant in winter 5 02 106 s d 9 05 106 gene copies l 1 and during dry periods 1 83 106 s d 5 03 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 in contrast ecotypes 4 and 5 were the least abundant each contributing under 1 of all arcobacter sequence reads or 1 2 orders of magnitude less gene copies l 1 compared with ecotype 3 and were often absent or rare not detected from 50 of samples fig 5 ecotype 3 and 4 were most abundant during dry periods in winter with their abundance negatively correlated to temperature mic 0 67 p 0 01 fig 6 and highest abundances occurring when water temperatures and inorganic nutrient concentrations were low temperature 13 1 18 8 c in contrast the majority of normalised sequence reads belonging to ecotype 5 58 24 occurred during stormwater impacted periods in spring fig 5 ecotypes 6 7 8 and 9 fig 4 all displayed highest sequence similarity with a venerupis 95 sequence similarities to ncbi accession no 117569 supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned to pseudoarcobacter venerupis comb nov and were each comprised of between 5 and 23 tightly clustered arcobacter oligotypes fig 4 ecotype 8 was the third most abundant ecotype contributing 10 of sequence reads across the entire time series due to its prominence during periods impacted by wwso 2 90 106 s d 4 13 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 conversely ecotypes 6 7 and 9 were less abundant 0 9 2 3 and 1 5 of sequence reads respectively and differed significantly p 0 05 across seasons fig 5 with ecotypes 7 8 and 9 most abundant in spring 2 24 105 s d 5 53 106 1 41 106 s d 8 40 105 and 1 44 105 s d 8 14 104 gene copies l 1 respectively and ecotype 6 most abundant in summer 1 24 105 s d 7 65 104 fig 5 these ecotypes were also most prominent during periods impacted by wwso increasing by 1 2 orders of magnitude compared to dry periods 104 105 and 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 as indicated by strong correlations with wwso volume mic 0 31 0 30 0 43 and 0 38 respectively p 0 01 fig 6 notably however these groups were not correlated with stormwater events alone the relative abundance of all four ecotypes with sequence reads affiliated with a venerupis groups 6 9 correlated significantly with ecotype 10 mic 0 36 0 55 p 0 01 which consisted of 11 oligotypes fig 4 however ecotype 10 had a highest taxonomic match to a cloacae 97 sequence similarity supplementary fig 8 recently re assigned to pseudoarcobacter cloacae comb nov this group coincided almost exclusively with modelled wwso with over 90 of normalised sequence reads belonging to samples collected during modelled wwso events across the entire time series ecotype 10 was the least abundant arcobacter ecotype comprising less than 1 of all arcobacter sequence reads fig 5 and was not detected within 50 of samples however following stormwater input on 3 occassions during spring this ecotype spiked in abundance by 3 orders of magnitude when normalised to qpcr counts reaching concentrations 106 gene copies l 1 fig 5 notably there was no statistically significant correlation between either absolute arcobacter abundance or the relative abundance of any arcobacter oligotypes and enterococci counts 4 discussion urbanised coastal habitats are often exposed to high levels of terrestrial runoff ferguson et al 2003 including stormwater and wet weather sewer overflow wwso following rainfall newton et al 2011 sidhu et al 2013 that can lead to shifts in microbial community composition cunha and almeida 2006 and the transport of human pathogens from waste stream environments into marine surface waters sauer et al 2011 standard approaches for monitoring these events include the enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as faecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococci boehm and sassoubre 2014 however while these approaches quantify the extent of contamination according to the detection of specific marker microbes other potentially pathogenic microbes can display different levels of occurrence and persistence to fib bradshaw et al 2016 in our high temporal resolution coastal time series 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed dramatic shifts in the composition of bacterial communities at a stormwater impacted beach located near to sydney australia sydney is the most densely populated city in australia with more than 4 6 million people at 2015 and growing rapidly gsc 2016 sydney s climate is warm temperate to sub tropical with precipitation patterns characterised by intermittent periods of intense and heavy rainfall which is often strongest during the late summer leading to large and intense inputs of runoff and stormwater discharge into the coastal marine environment the most notable shifts in the composition of bacterial communities at foreshore beach following stormwater and wwso inputs were associated with large and rapid increases in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the arcobacter genus with sequences assigned to this group increasing from background levels of 1 of 16s rrna sequences up to 70 these increases in arcobacter following stormwater and wwso intrusions are consistent with observations from other regions that have demonstrated high levels of arcobacter within aquatic environments including lake eerie lee et al 2012 and lake michigan newton et al 2013 following periods of significant rainfall these observations could be of public health concern given the status of this genus as an emerging environmental pathogen ferreira et al 2016 4 1 stormwater and wwso fuels peaks in arcobacter abundance investigations into the occurrence of arcobacter in human and animal gut microbiomes indicate that this genus generally comprises less than 0 001 of the total microbial consortium gevers et al 2012 however in wastewater treatment facilities where imposed treatment conditions supress all but the most resilient enteric microbes the relative abundance of arcobacter can be much higher 5 11 of bacterial communities fisher et al 2014 within natural marine and freshwater environments arcobacter generally occur in low abundances below 1 lee et al 2012 but may increase in abundance in environments subject to influence from human and animal waste streams however to date investigations to determine whether intrusions of wastewater can lead to increases in the environmental abundance of this group are lacking earlier studies have confirmed the reliability of applying a pcr approach to amplify conserved regions on the 23s rrna gene to quantify the total abundance of arcobacter gonzález and suski 2010 hausdorf et al 2013 lee et al 2012 using this approach five orders of magnitude from 103 to 108 gene copies l 1 increase in the absolute abundance of arcobacter occurred at foreshore beach during and following rainfall notably the highest concentrations of arcobacter detected in this study were 100 fold greater than those reported by lee et al 2012 whom employed the same qpcr assay to investigate arcobacter abundance at lake eerie beach an environment similarly impacted by faecal contamination while peaks in arcobacter abundance were tightly coupled with the input of stormwater modelled wwso discharge produced the highest concentrations of arcobacter gene copies and it is notable that arcobacter abundance was not generally well predicted by fib in this case enterococci count data supplementary fig 4 in particular four of the highest observed peaks in total arcobacter abundance corresponded with low enterococci counts which according to fib guidelines would not on their own trigger warnings to swimmers or beach closures furthermore it was observed in the 16s bacterial community profile that several other enteric and potentially pathogenic bacteria acinetorbacter aeromonas bacteroides cloacibacterium and streptococcus did covary with total arcobacter and may also be poorly indicated by standard fib methods 4 2 arcobacter diversity is temporally dynamic understanding the ecology of arcobacter in coastal marine environments is important because arcobacter are increasingly associated with disease in animals and humans collado and figueras 2011 yet not all species are pathogenic levels of virulence and niche preferences vary between arcobacter species douidah et al 2012 but the temporal dynamics of this group are not well understood within coastal environments where contact with humans may be significant this study has used an oligotyping approach eren et al 2013 to discriminate single nucleotide differences within the v1 v3 region of the 16s rrna gene to identify potentially ecologically meaningful patterns eren et al 2013 in the diversity of 16s rrna sequence reads matched to arcobacter among culture independent techniques 16s rrna sequencing has been widely used to characterise bacterial community diversity and composition but for many bacterial groups such as vibrio bacillus and others it delivers poor species level resolution janda and abbott 2007 moreover this limitation becomes more relevant when only part of the 16s rrna has been sequenced such as in short read sequencing platforms nevertheless the sequence depth and accuracy afforded by this technique allows us to identify and assess temporal patterns across multiple oligotype clusters without resolving their species identity we found a high level of micro diversity within arcobacter populations however it is important to note that this approach does not allow for specific phylogenetic inference of individual oligotypes we report only the closest taxonomic match to oligotypes grouped into arcobacter ecotypes this does not mean that the species of these ecotypes have been identified furthermore oligotyping does not confirm whether these ecotypes display any of the biological or pathogenic characteristics of their closest sequence match sampling at weekly intervals enabled detection of clear shifts in assemblage structure at both seasonal and episodic time periods which would not have been achievable using only a snapshot sampling approach most pronounced were sharp shifts in arcobacter populations that coincided with stormwater and modelled wwso events by using network analysis to cluster oligotypes into ecotype groups we observed a total of 181 oligotypes distributed across 10 dominant ecotypes with these groups showing clearly different temporal dynamics and environmental preferences to one another this approach allowed for the further partitioning of the arcobacter community into 2 distinct populations marine ecotypes that persist in surface waters at low abundances during dry conditions and waste stream ecotypes that dominate during periods impacted by stormwater and wwso input but occur in low abundances or disappear completely outside of these events several environmental species of arcobacter have also been isolated from marine organisms including a nitrofigilis which was first identified as a nitrogen fixing symbiont of seagrass pati et al 2010 and arcobacter species isolated from bivalves clams mussels and oysters including a elissii figueras et al 2011b a molluscorium figueras et al 2011a and a bivavlorium levican et al 2012 a number of other arcobacter species including a butzleri a skirrowi and a cryaerophilus have been isolated from organisms harvested for seafoods such as shell fish mottola et al 2016 and have also been implicated in waterborne gastrointestinal diseases kopilović et al 2008 nieva echevarria et al 2013 rice et al 1999 in fact it appears that many species of arcobacter found in water share a propensity for inhabiting shellfish which may be attributed to genes that confer production of adhesion enzymes that facilitate adherence and invasion of gut epithelial cells girbau et al 2015 which could indicate the ability to also invade the gut epithelials of human water users additionally arcobacter spp can tolerate a broad range of temperatures van driessche and houf 2008 oxygen snelling et al 2006 and salinity levels salas masso et al 2016 which might enable them to survive in coastal waters for longer periods than other enteric microbes which provides increased opportunity to encounter human water users although detection of arcobacter in marine organisms has been reported figueras et al 2011a 2011b the origin distribution and persistence of these arcobacter species in the surface waters of coastal marine environments remains poorly characterised moreover it has been noted previously that while several species culture readily eg a butzleri some species are more difficult to culture or remain uncultivated to date fisher et al 2014 consequently studies that rely solely on culture based methods risk over representing some arcobacter species and under representing others therefore in this study next generation sequencing was used to characterise arcobacter populations which includes uncultured species and is independent of culture bias this approach revealed strong seasonal partitioning of dry period arcobacter communities for example 3 arcobacter ecotypes exhibiting sequence similarity closest to a molluscorium were the dominant arcobacter populations during dry periods in winter when total arcobacter abundance was lowest alternatively ecotype 10 most closely matched to a cloacae which has been previously isolated and associated with sewage was not correlated with stormwater or modelled wwso input and instead was one of the more dominant ecotypes during dry periods in summer other arcobacter populations enter the surface waters of coastal habitats in high abundances via fecal pollution collado et al 2008 in this study ecotypes 6 7 and 8 which exhibited closest sequence identity to a venerupis 95 similarity were strongly correlated with both stormwater input and modelled wwso this was an unexpected observation because to date arcobacter displaying 16s rrna sequence reads similar to a venerupis has not previously been linked to sewage from human waste streams on the other hand the strong correlation observed between ecotype 1 which showed high sequence similarity to a cryaerophilus and stormwater and modelled wwso inputs suggests an association with sewage pollution collado et al 2008 across the entire time series this ecotype contributed the highest absolute abundance of all 10 ecotypes when normalised to qpcr data this group peaked in abundance when more than 24 000 m3 of modelled wwso was discharged from the upstream mill pond overflow point the high levels of occurrence of this ecotype in the coastal environment is potentially significant because a cryaerophilus is the second most after a butzleri reported arcobacter species to be associated with water and food borne diseases van den abeele et al 2014 with evidence that this species is responsible for outbreaks of gastroenteritis and clinical cases of bacteraemia collado and figueras 2011 notably oligotypes exhibiting high sequence similarity with a cryaerophilus were most abundant during the summer periods when more water users particularly swimmers use beaches in sydney and may therefore be at risk of exposure to pathogens in marine waters curiously the influence of sewage pollution at foreshore beach did not result in detection of oligotypes that were similar to the arcobacter species most frequently isolated from sewage and clinical samples a butzleri arguello et al 2015 indeed none of the arcobacter oligotypes identified in this study exhibited high sequence similarity to this species similarly fisher et al 2014 noted in their study of arcobacter populations across 37 sewer locations in the u s a and spain that a butzleri was only the eleventh most abundant oligotype detected the previous apparent prominence of a butzleri in sewage communities may be due to an over representation of this species in culture based approaches which has been noted in previous studies of arcobacter populations fisher et al 2014 gilbert et al 2014 salas masso et al 2016 4 3 implications for pathogen monitoring in coastal environments there are several implications to consider in light of the observations made in this study firstly our data demonstrates that weekly sampling resolution at least is required to fully capture rapid shifts in the abundance and diversity of arcobacter and potentially other enteric microbes in coastal waters subject to the highly dynamic influence of stormwater and wwso secondly discrete rainfall events and waste stream inputs that lead to peaks in arcobacter abundance may result in variable levels of risk to public health because the composition and diversity of arcobacter communities shifts between seasons and perturbation events for instance our data indicates that total peaks in arcobacter abundance were highest during summer at foreshore beach when beaches are most frequented by swimmers and other water users but the arcobacter community was also comprised of the highest proportion of oligotypes that exhibited high sequence similarity with the emerging pathogen species a cryaerophilus at this time thirdly our data revealed that peaks in the abundance of arcobacter can remain elevated for up to one week following intense rainfall and importantly can remain high for periods that significantly exceed the time that fib levels are elevated survival of arcobacter in marine environments beyond that of fib such as e coli is likely owed to halotolerance exhibited in several species salas masso et al 2016 although e coli has been shown to predict arcobacter in shellfish salas masso et al 2018 filter feeders that function like passive samplers of their environment the data presented here shows that arcobacter in the ambient water of coastal environments are not well predicted by fib this could have serious implications for public health as standard recommendations by water quality organisations suggest avoiding water use for 1 3 days after rainfall given that we detected numerous peaks in the total abundance of arcobacter 107 gene copies l 1 that occurred within 3 days of category a low risk enterococci counts water users may be exposed to high levels of arcobacter and other stormwater and sewage bacteria during periods when fib based monitoring suggest low levels of risk at present it is unclear what health risks may be associated with swimmer exposure to arcobacter in coastal water as studies that provide data on infective dose or probability of infection following human exposure to environmental arcobacter are lacking banting et al 2019 5 conclusion this study has resolved the fine scale temporal dynamics of arcobacter entering and persisting within the marine receiving waters for urban runoff with evidence for an important role of stormwater and wwso given that many arcobacter species are i human pathogens ii have the capacity to accumulate in marine organisms that are consumed by humans oysters clams and mussels iii are rarely monitored in swimming locations and iv survive in marine waters longer than other enteric microbes targeted in standard fib based testing routines these organisms could pose a significant yet largely overlooked risk to the public health in coastal environments in this study the application of 16s rrna gene sequencing with quantitative pcr allowed us to initially identify and then focus our analyses on a potential microbial pathogen which would have been overlooked using standard culture dependant methods demonstrating the need for inclusion of modern molecular microbiological tools in environmental monitoring programs author contributions this study

point is one of over 1000 sewage overflow points in sydney s wastewater system which diverts incompletely treated wastewater into environmental waterways during heavy rainfall modelled wet weather sewer overflow wwso rates were obtained from sydney water the water authority responsible for operation of sydney s wastewater systems rates of sewage overflow quantified in m3 15 min 1 were converted to total m3 and summed across each sample date and the six preceding days to provide a measure of modelled wwso integrated over the previous week total modelled wwso was used to differentiate stormwater events from modelled wwso events supplementary information fig 1 supplementary information fig 2 cross correlation function ccf was used to measure patterns of co occurrence and time shifted correlation between two variables in this case rainfall series 1 and electrical conductivity ec series 2 at foreshore beach weekly time intervals were plotted across the horizontal axis where

time lag values on the vertical axis represent the cross correlation function ccf of each time lag which is considered as a correlation co efficient between the two series at different time lags where a vertical line value crosses the broken blue horizontal line 95 confidence interval this indicates a statistically significant correlation at this given time lag a strong negative and significant co occurrence at time lag 0 is evident as well as a weaker but significant 1 week time lag suggesting that rainfall leads to decreases in ec at foreshore beach lasting for up to 1 week following the

vertical bars indicate values of electrical conductivity where drops in ec are represented by darker shades of green are indicative of runoff and stormwater input supplementary information fig 6 supplementary information fig 7 cross correlation function was employed to measure the co occurrence and time lagged association between a rainfall variable 1 and the absolute abundance of arcobacter qpcr gene copy numbers variable 2 and b electrical conductivity variable 1 and the absolute abundance of arcobacter variable 2 values across the x axis represent the time lag in weeks where 0 is co occurrence negative values represent weeks at which variable 1 predicts variable 2 and positive values represent correlations where variable 2 predicts variable 1 values across the y axis represent the strength of the correlation and its orientation as positive or negative above or below the central horizontal line respectively instances where horizontal lines intersect the perforated blue lines the 95 confidence threshold indicate a significant 0 05 correlation supplementary information fig 6a shows a significant positive correlation at time lag 0 and 1 indicating that rainfall events lead to elevated arcobacter abundance during and 1 week following the rainfall supplementary information fig 6b reveals a significant and strong negative co occurrence between ec and arcobacter abundance suggesting that when ec levels drop arcobacter abundance is increased supplementary information fig 7 supplementary information fig 8 maximum likelihood phylogeny of representative arcobacter

for the removal of contaminants from drinking water treatment systems biofilm microbiomes in the biofilter media play essential roles in biotransformation of contaminants but is not comprehensively understood this study reports on mn ii oxidation and the core microbiomes in magnetite sand rsbf mags rsbf and manganese sand rsbf mns rsbf mns rsbf showed a relatively higher mn ii removal rate 40 91 2 than mags rsbf during the start up mags rsbf and mns rsbf had similar mn ii removal rates 94 13 and 99 16 over stable operation for 80 days mn ii removal rates at different depths in the mns rsbf reactor significantly changed with operation time and the filter in the upper layer of mns rsbf made the largest contribution to mn ii oxidation once operation had stabilized pacbio single molecule sequencing of full length 16s rrna gene indicated that biofilter medium had a significant impact on the core microbiomes of the biofilms from the two biofilters the magnetite sand biofilter facilitated the enrichment of mn ii oxidizing biofilms the dominant populations consisted of pedomicrobium pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium in the rsbf which have been affiliated with putative manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob the relative abundance of pedomicrobium manganicum increased with operation time in both rsbf reactors in addition nordella oligomobilis and derxia gummosa were statistically correlated with mn ii oxidation species species co occurrence networks indicated that the microbiome of mns rsbf had more complex correlations than that of mags rsbf implying that biofilter medium substantially shaped the microbial community in the rsbf hyphomicrobium and nitrite oxidizing nitrospira moscoviensis were positively correlated the core microbiomes composition of both rsbf reactors converged over operation time a hybrid biofilter medium with magnetite sand and manganese sand may therefore be best in rapid sand filtration for mn ii oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords single molecule sequencing microbiome manganese oxidation biofiltration network drinking water 1 introduction rapid sand biofiltration rsbf is widely used around the world for treatment of drinking water from surface water and groundwater bouwer and crowe 1988 white et al 2012 gülay et al 2016 ammonia iron and soluble manganese mn ii contaminants in groundwater gülay et al 2014 can be oxidized by microorganisms in rsbf tebo et al 2004 microbial ecology plays an essential role in managing processes in environmental biotechnology including wastewater treatment bioenergy generation and drinking water purification systems rittmann 2006 although some manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob have been isolated from drinking water systems cerrato et al 2010 the processes by which these microbes work have not been well characterized due to the lack of understanding the physiological ecology and interspecies interactions of uncultured microorganisms groundwater chemistry can be a crucial factor in determining the microbial community structure of biofilms as shown in a sand filtration system albers et al 2015 biofilter media as the primary component of the biofiltration process also affect the conversion of contaminants and influence biofilm formation and microbial community structure oh et al 2018 vignola et al 2018 different kinds of biofilter media including anthracite quartz sand manganese sand gravel pumice stone and granulated activated carbon gac have been used in rapid sand filtration rsbf katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 gülay et al 2014 hoyland et al 2014 yang et al 2014 albers et al 2015 cai et al 2015 bai et al 2016 double layer biofilters pumice stone or gac and quartz sand anthracite and manganese sand have been studied to improve mn ii removal lautenschlager et al 2014 cheng et al 2017 manganese sand has been used as biofilter medium in drinking water treatment plants in china qin et al 2009 li et al 2013 given its relatively high adsorption ability qin et al 2009 li et al 2016 and autocatalytic oxidation of mn ii in the presence of manganese oxides sahabi et al 2009 a batch test showed that when mnox s coated magnetic particles were used as adsorbents removal of mn ii was enhanced funes et al 2014 conductive magnetite fe3o4 and magnetic fields have been reported to facilitate the growth of iron reducing bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer kato et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 magnetite or its nanoparticle can mediate direct interspecies electron transfer diet between electroactive bacteria and methanogens inaba et al 2019 in addition magnetite as one of mixed valent iron oxide minerals plays an important role in microbial extracellular respiration biogeochemical cycling of elements trace metal sequestration and pollutant transformation peng et al 2019 however the effect of magnetic filter medium on mn ii removal and the enrichment of mnob in rsbf has not been investigated next generation sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and metagenomic analyses have identified that the dominant microbes in sand biofilter populations were closely related to those capable of oxidizing ammonium nitrite iron manganese and methane white et al 2012 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 the core microbiomes were dominated by the lineages within the genera of nitrosomonas and nitrospira cao et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 there may also be microbial interactions between mnob and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria as soluble microbial products smp which are produced by nitrifying microbes can support growth of heterotrophs such as manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob kindaichi et al 2004 cao et al 2015 community analyses showed that leptothrix pseudomonas hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium may play roles in the biological oxidation of mn ii in sand biofiltration li et al 2013 yang et al 2014 albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 however the relationship between the abundance of identified mnob and mn ii oxidation in sand filtration is still unclear previous studies have speculated that uncultured populations in the sand biofilters might have the ability to oxidize mn ii but were not affiliated with identified mnob cao et al 2015 nitzsche et al 2015 these results suggested that there are unknown bacteria that may participate in mn ii oxidation moreover there are even fewer studies that have focused on the effects of the biofilter media on the microbiome of biofilms next generation dna sequencing technology has greatly increased our comprehension of the ecology of microorganisms however the short reads 500 bp provide limited information regarding species discrimination and taxonomic assignment third generation sequencing technology such as pacbio single molecule real time smrt dna sequencing and oxford nanopore sequencing are able to capture full length 16s rrna gene which allows high resolution taxonomic identification at the species level the aim of this study was to explore the effects of different biofilter media on manganese oxidation in rsbf and to identify the core contributors to mn ii oxidation in biofilms using pacific bioscience s smrt sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and determine the interactions between biofilter medium magnetite sand and manganese sand and microbiomes of biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 rapid sand biofiltration reactor and operation magnetite sand mags and manganese sand mns were used as biofilter mediums in rapid sand biofiltration rsbf reactors which were purchased from hengxin filter plant gongyi china and the size of particles ranged from 0 5 to 2 cm two polymethyl methacrylate pmma column bioreactors with an inner diameter of 60 cm and a height of 130 cm were constructed for the experiments the two reactors had an active depth of 85 cm on top with 20 cm of coarse grain support material below and were operated at an average hydraulic loading rate of 3 m h because mn ii and fe ii often co occur in metal contaminated surface and groundwaters the synthetic water containing 0 9 2 3 mg l mn ii and 0 3 mg l fe ii was used as the influent to the rsbf the filters were operated in down flow mode and backwashed when the flow rate slowed down to less than 3 m h due to choking by air bubbles all rsbf reactors were operated at 25 1 c room temperature the influent ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were stably around 6 7 15 c and 9 3 respectively to assess the contribution of biofilms at different filter depths to mn ii oxidation in the rsbf reactors water samples collected along the depth were analyzed for mn ii oxidation at given intervals 40 80 and 120 days to investigate the effects of environmental factors filter medium filter depth and operation time on microbial community structure for every 9 samples samples of filter sands were collected from the upper 5 cm middle 45 cm and bottom 85 cm layers of each reactor on days 40 80 and 120 2 2 dna extraction genomic dna of biofilms on the different biofilter media were extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 80 c for further analysis the quantity and quality of extracted dna were measured using a nanodrop nd 8000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively 2 3 pcr amplification and single molecule sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons pcr amplification of the nearly full length bacterial 16s rrna genes was performed using the forward primer 27f 5 agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and the reverse primer 1492r 5 accttgttacgactt 3 the total of pcr amplicons were purified with agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter indianapolis in and quantified using the picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen carlsbad ca usa after the individual quantification step amplicons were pooled in equal amounts and single molecule real time smrt sequencing technology was performed using the pacific bioscience s sequel platform at shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china 2 4 bioinformatics and statistical analysis the sequencing data were analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 8 0 pipeline as previously described caporaso et al 2010 the remaining high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence identity by uclust edgar 2010 otu taxonomic classification was conducted by blast searching the representative sequences set against the ncbi 16s ribosomal rna database using the best hit with a confidence threshold of 90 altschul et al 1997 alpha diversity indices chao 1 richness estimator abundance based coverage estimator ace and shannon and simpson indices were calculated based on otus using qiime beta diversity analysis was performed to investigate the structural variation of microbial communities across samples using unifrac distance metrics lozupone and knight 2005 lozupone et al 2007 and visualized via principal coordinate analysis pcoa and arithmetic means upgma hierarchical clustering a venn diagram was generated to visualize the shared and unique otus among samples or groups using the r package venn diagram based on the occurrence of otus across samples groups regardless of their relative abundances zaura et al 2009 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to identify the relationships among the top 50 bacterial species environmental parameters and mn ii removal rate spearman s correlation indices were calculated using the r software version 2 15 3 the differences of microbial communities in mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors needed to be taken into account so spearman correlations of the top 50 bacterial species were calculated separately for each reactor to elucidate microbial interactions in different biofilters phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens based on otus were constructed in a molecular ecological network analysis pipeline mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena deng et al 2012 the gephi 0 9 2 and cytoscape 3 6 1 were applied to generate the network between putative manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob and their correlated bacterial species shannon et al 2003 bastian et al 2009 to estimate the potential functional contributions of the observed shifts in microbial diversity functional profiles were predicted using a phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust from otus based on 16s rrna gene sequences langille et al 2013 the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and clusters of orthologous groups cog databases were employed to analyze metabolic pathways the contributions of medium type depth and operational time to the variations of bacterial communities were assessed with variance partitioning analysis using the rda r package v3 2 0 all raw sequences were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number prjna541102 3 results 3 1 mn ii oxidation in rsbf with different biofilter media manganese sand rsbf mns rsbf had a higher mn ii removal rate of 40 91 2 than magnetite sand rsbf mags rsbf during the first 30 days fig 1 a mn ii removal rate of mags rsbf increased during the period from 30 days to 70 days and exceeded those obtained by mns rsbf during the same period it stabilized in both mns and mags rsbf reactors after operating for 80 days the mn ii removal rates were 94 13 and 99 16 in mags rsbf and mns rsbf on 120th day respectively mn ii concentration of effluent treated with mns rsbf quickly decreased at the beginning of treatment but increased within 80 days fig 1b suggesting that the highly effective physical adsorption and chemical oxidation of mn ii in mns rsbf took place during the first 30 days by contrast the mn ii concentration of effluent in mags rsbf significantly decreased to 0 08 mg l after 32 days of operation then the mn ii concentration of effluent of mags rsbf increased to higher than 0 43 mg l from day 32 67 above 50 of mn ii was removed which was still higher than that in mns rsbf 30 42 49 05 mn ii concentration of effluent in both rsbf reactors decreased to 0 09 mg l on day 80 mn ii concentration of effluent of mns rsbf was maintained under 0 021 mg l after 80 days which was significantly lower p 0 01 than in mags rsbf which had a mean concentration of 0 079 mg l the mn ii concentrations of the effluents of both rsbf reactors were much lower than drinking water standards 0 1 mg l mn depth profiles for the mn ii removal rate in mags rsbf at three time points had similar patterns and mn ii removal rate increased linearly with increasing depth in the biofilter fig 2 by contrast mn ii removal rates at different depths in mns rsbf changed substantially over time the removal rate in the top 25 cm of the biofilter progressively increased from 12 2 on day 40 and 45 65 on day 80 to 93 04 on day 120 indicating that the upper layer of the biofilter in mns rsbf made the largest contribution to mn ii oxidation 3 2 community diversity of microbial biofilms on different biofilter media pacbio sequel sequencing showed that 6058 to 11 350 high quality effective sequences with full length 16s rrna gene for each sample were obtained and 354 to 573 operational taxonomic units otus were determined at 97 identity fig s1 rarefaction curves indicated that sequencing depth was sufficient to capture most of the predominant bacterial populations in all samples fig s1 the chao 1 ace estimator simpson index and shannon index increased after day 40 indicating that microbial communities of biofilms in mags rsbf and mns rsbf were shaped over time table s1 the chao 1 435 48 534 32 and shannon indices 6 96 7 57 of mns rsbf were relatively higher than those of mags rsbf chao1 of 354 444 68 and shannon of 6 64 6 95 on day 40 the diversity of microbial communities in mns rsbf were slightly higher than in mags rsbf the mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors shared 433 otus on day 40 accounting for 57 3 and 56 5 of total otus fig s2a respectively the number of shared otus in both rsbf reactors increased to 651 on day 80 and 658 on day 120 figs s2b and s2c furthermore the biofilms in the upper layer of biofilters shared the largest number of otus fig s2d making up 63 6 and 63 3 of the total otus in the mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors respectively principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance showed a clear separation between magnetite sand and manganese sand biofilters fig 3 a indicating that there were differences in the microbiomes of the biofilms from the mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors the differences between the two microbial communities in the two reactors reduced gradually from day 40 to day 120 the samples from the two filters were clustered hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that microbial communities in the upper layer of mns and mags reactors on day 80 and day 120 were clustered closely fig 3b otherwise the bacterial communities in the middle and bottom layers of each reactor were more similar 3 3 core microbiome in the biofilms of rsbf with different biofilter media proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in all samples accounting for 67 94 91 79 followed by actinobacteria 1 87 8 72 acidobacteria 1 17 7 86 planctomycetes 0 63 14 44 bacteroidetes 0 66 6 93 and gemmatimonadetes 0 34 4 78 figs s3a and s3b the relative abundance of proteobacteria in all samples reach to around 70 on day 120 the relative abundance of planctomycetes 14 44 was highest in biofilms of the bottom layer of mags rsbf on day 40 fig s3a and it was much higher than that of mns rsbf 2 32 fig s3b at the class level alphaproteobacteria 33 35 41 46 dominated in biofilms on the upper layers of both rsbf reactors figs s3c and s3d the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria 26 99 39 12 was higher in the mns rsbf reactor while gammaproteobacteria 8 43 33 19 was the predominant class in the mags rsbf reactor additionally the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria in biofilms in the upper layers of both reactors decreased from 29 56 to 15 25 on day 40 to 8 95 and 4 26 on day 120 respectively hierarchical cluster analysis and heatmap based on predominant genera illustrated the distinct clusters between different samples from the rsbf indicating that temporal and spatial dynamics existed in the microbiomes of rsbf with different filter media fig 4 the core microbiomes in the rsbf reactors with different biofilter media were more distinct by day 40 however the core microbiome of mags rsbf on day 120 and mns rsbf on day 80 and 120 were clustered together which was also true for mn ii oxidation the predominant populations from the middle and bottom layers in mns rsbf were located in a branch on day 40 80 and 120 while the predominant populations in the upper layer in both rsbf reactors on day 120 were clustered together the succession of predominant populations took place over spatial and temporal scales predominant populations including pseudomonas hyphomicrobium pedomicrobium and leptothrix were affiliated with putative mn ii oxidizing bacteria fig 4 the relative abundance of pseudomonas was relatively high in both reactors on day 40 6 49 19 73 and decreased to 1 64 7 09 by day 120 in contrast the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium increased from 0 69 9 44 to 8 22 13 62 on day 40 and day 120 respectively the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium was higher in mns rsbf 3 85 13 62 than that in mags rsbf 0 69 9 56 the maximum abundance of leptothrix occurred in the biofilms of the upper layer of mags rsbf 4 48 and mns rsbf 1 93 in addition the relative abundances of oxalicibacterium gemmatinonas and gaiella in both rsbf reactors increased on day 120 3 4 predominant species in the biofilms of rsbf pedomicrobium manganicum capable of mn ii oxidation was enriched in the upper layer it s abundance increased from 0 5 to 2 2 in the mags rsbf reactor from day 40 to day 120 while it increased from 0 9 to 1 5 in the mns rsbf reactor fig 5 hyphomicrobium nitrativorans and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii in the mns rsbf reactor increased significantly from 0 95 to 1 09 and 0 83 2 76 to 3 03 3 79 and 3 92 5 28 respectively over time similar trends of increase were also found in the mags rsbf reactor the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum increased in the mags rsbf reactor from 0 28 2 49 to 2 88 4 32 but decreased in the mns rsbf reactor from 0 83 4 5 to 0 85 2 73 with operational time the relative abundances of both species in the mns rsbf reactor 0 83 5 28 was consistently higher than those in the mags rsbf reactor 0 12 2 96 during operation the relative abundances of pseudomonas veronii pseudomonas multiresinivorans and pseudomonas citronellolis varied with rsbf depth and operation time the relative abundance of pseudomonas veronii in the mags rsbf reactor 2 04 17 09 was higher than that in the mns rsbf reactor 0 97 2 57 and slightly increased with depth over time except in the upper layer of the mags rsbf reactor furthermore the mn ii removal rate of mags rsbf 98 99 was higher than that of mns rsbf reactor 44 98 on day 40 suggesting that p veronii may have the capacity to oxidize mn ii the relative abundances of p multiresinivorans 0 41 3 82 and p citronellolis 0 49 4 44 in both rsbf reactors were substantially decreased from 1 07 to 3 82 and 1 27 4 44 on day 40 to 0 0 96 and 0 04 1 12 on day 120 respectively in addition acidiferrobacter thiooxydans and sulfurifustis variabilis were unique and predominant species in mags rsbf their abundances ranged from 0 47 to 10 22 and 0 32 5 3 respectively noviherbaspirillum massiliense 4 11 7 42 massilia timonae 0 89 5 63 and noviherbaspirillum canariense 0 4 4 83 showed higher relative abundances in the mns rsbf reactor compared to the mags rsbf reactor the increases of relative abundances of denitratisoma oestradiolicum oxalicibacterium solurbis and gaiella occulta were observed over time in both rsbf reactors 3 5 correlation between bacterial species and abiotic factors the majority of bacterial species abundances were related to biofilter medium type and operation time fig 6 correlation analysis indicated that hyphomicrobium zavarzinii hyphomicrobium nitrativorans noviherbaspirillum massiliense and massilia timonae had positive relation with the mns biofilter while acidiferrobacter thiooxydans and sulfurifustis variabilis positively related with the mags biofilter p 0 01 rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris and hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum were positively correlated with biofilter depth pseudomonas citronellolis and pseudomonas multiresinivorans on the other hand were negatively correlated with operational time while denitratisoma oestradiolicum and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii were positively correlated with operation time nordella oligomobilis and derxia gummosa had positive correlations with mn ii oxidation while leptothrix mobilis was negatively correlated with mn ii oxidation fig 6 these results were confirmed by variance partitioning analysis vpa fig s4 which concluded that biofilter medium type and operation time explained 33 and 25 respectively of microbial community composition when spearman correlations were separately analyzed in the two reactors derxia gummosa was the sole species that had a positive correlation with mn ii oxidation in both rsbf reactors taken separately thiobacillus thiophilus and nitrosospira multiformis were positively correlated with mn ii oxidation in mags rsbf and clostridium cylindrosporum and sideroxydans lithotrophicus had positive correlations with mn ii oxidation in mns rsbf 3 6 species species co occurrence network of the biofilms in rsbf network analysis based on otus showed that biofilter medium induced different co occurrence patterns in microbial communities the two empirical networks were significantly different from random networks p 0 05 indicating that bacterial community assembly assemblages in the rsbf reactors was nonrandom fig 7 the species species co occurrence network of biofilms in mns rsbf was more complex than that in mags rsbf as was indicated by a higher average connectivity avgk 8 245 vs 4 355 shorter average path gd 3 049 vs 3 767 and smaller modularity 0 595 vs 0 763 table s2 the network in the mns rsbf reactor consisted of 319 nodes and 1315 edges both of which were higher than in the mags rsbf reactor 259 nodes and 564 edges fig 7 the proportion of the network connections that were negative was 40 6 in the mns rsbf reactor while it was 12 9 in the mags rsbf reactor network the majority of otus in the network structure of the mags rsbf reactor belonged to hyphomicrobium pedomicrobium and pseudomonas and had positive relationships fig 7a two clear subclusters in the network of mns rsbf showed complicated correlations of the putative manganese oxidizing hyphomicrobium spp and pseudomonas spp with other species fig 7b hyphomicrobium spp had complex correlations with other species in the microbiome of both rsbf reactors while pseudomonas spp had more correlations in mns rsbf than that in mags rsbf fig 7c and d pseudomonas spp had more positive correlations with other species in the mns rsbf network than hyphomicrobium spp nordella oligomobilis was positively correlated with pseudomonas veronii hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum and pedomicrobium manganicum in mags rsbf while in mns rsbf it had positive correlations with hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum hyphomicrobium zavarzinii pseudomonas multiresinivorans and rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris denitratisoma oestradiolicum and derxia gummosa were positively correlated in both rsbf reactors additionally nitrosospira multiformis was also positively correlated with derxia gummosa in mags rsbf which was found to be positively related to mn ii oxidation in the mags rsbf reactor fig s5 moreover nitrospira moscoviensis was positively correlated with hyphomicrobium spp hyphomicrobium zararzinii and hyphomicrobium nitrativorans in both rsbf reactors 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of biofilter media on mn ii oxidation in rsbf there were differences in mn ii oxidation between mns rsbf and mags rsbf during different operation periods mn ii oxidation of mns rsbf was higher than that of mags rsbf during first 30 days fig 1a suggesting that manganese sand mags has a higher adsorption capability of mn ii which was consistent with a previous study qin et al 2009 magnetite sand s mags weaker adsorption ability of mn ii during the first 30 days was similar to anthracite greenstein et al 2018 and quartz sand qin et al 2009 interestingly a sharp increase of mn ii oxidation in mags rsbf was observed on day 30 fig 1 presumably because mags facilitated the enrichment of mn ii oxidizing bacteria better than mns mns showed relatively slower acclimation of mnob presumably the surface characterization or natural oxides impacted the cell attachment mn ii oxidation by mns rsbf 99 16 was slightly higher than that by mags rsbf 94 13 after operation for 80 days presumably because manganese was further oxidized by manganese oxides derived from mns fig s6 x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps analysis showed that biogenic manganese oxides of both rsbf were the 3 4 valence manganese zhao et al 2018 manganese oxides accumulated on the surface of the biofilter medium fig s6 lead to autocatalytic oxidation of mn ii bargar et al 2005 bruins et al 2014 xps analysis also indicated that mns was more suited to the retention of manganese oxides fig s6b which might explain why the mn ii oxidation rate increased on top layer of the mns rsbf reactor over time fig 2 the manganese sand biofilter exhibited better mn ii oxidation later in operation than at the beginning the magnetite manganese sand biofilter on the other hand had higher mn ii oxidation initially before operation stabilized therefore a mixture of equal amounts of biofilter medium or double layers of mns mags may be beneficial for mn ii oxidation in drinking water treatment hybrid biofilter mediums should be further investigated in the future 4 2 the effects of biofilter medium on microbial community structure pcoa and hierarchical clustering results showed that biofilter medium significantly affected the succession of microbial communities in rsbf fig 3 an area of study which was neglected in previous studies on sand filtration qin et al 2009 wu et al 2011 in this study the microbial diversity increased and the community structure shifted towards being more similar as the rsbf reactors reached stable operation especially the convergence of microbiomes in the upper layers of both rsbf implied that a consistent correlation might occur between the selection pressure of mn ii and the succession of manganese oxidizing bacteria fig 3 operation time was found to be the second most important factor explaining 25 of the communities structures moreover mineral coating and metal oxides aggregated on the surface of biofilter material along with other cationic species positively affected the activity and structures of microbiota gülay et al 2014 the increase of biogenic manganese oxides might also have played a role in the shaping the microbial communities microbiomes in the middle layer of mns rsbf and the bottom layer of mags rsbf still diverged from that in other layers of corresponding rsbf the divergence and the convergence of microbial communities co occurred at the different layers indicated that community assembly in rsbf was more complicated and depended upon different environmental conditions in addition the effect of filter medium on community assembly should be further studied under different physicochemical conditions such as ph redox conditions temperature and humic acid magnetite sand mags rsbf facilitated the enrichment of pseudomonas veronii while hyphomicrobium spp dominated in mns rsbf for example the relative abundances of hyphomicrobium zavarzinii and hyphomicrobium nitrativorans were higher in the mns rsbf reactor in addition two representative 16s rrna sequences which were affiliated with acidiferrobacter thiooxydans an acidophilic iron and sulfur oxidizing bacterium hallberg et al 2011 dominated in the mags rsbf reactor however mn ii oxidation by a thiooxydans is not fully understood and should be further investigated mn ii and biofilter medium as primary selection pressures influenced community assembly and microbiome compositions the differences in the microbiome compositions of rsbf with different filter media implicated that the microbiome in rsbf could be manipulated by selecting or optimizing environmental variables when keystone species and its metabolic networks are identified in rsbf for manganese removal it will shed light on the design of reactor microbiome or synthetic community to enhance the efficiency of rsbf 4 3 putative manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob previous investigations have speculated that hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium are affiliated with manganese oxidizing bacteria in sand filtration systems li et al 2013 albers et al 2015 matsushita et al 2018 and that pseudomonas and leptothrix play important roles in drinking water treatment systems burger et al 2008 matsushita et al 2018 to date previous studies have not provided direct evidence to support a positive correlation between well known mnob and mn ii oxidation which might due to limitations in detection methods at the species level resolution and the lack of direct functional validation based on mn ii oxidation related genes the identification of uncultivated mnob are yet more challenging because the mechanisms by which mnob oxidize mn ii are diverse multicopper oxidase mco and heme containing manganese peroxidases mnps derived from different species have different capabilities to directly oxidize mn ii francis and tebo 2001 zhao et al 2018 it is difficult to identify unknown mnob based on orthologous genes that encode mn oxidizing proteins using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches indirect oxidation by uncultivated mnob through modification of redox environments ph increase eh free radicals and reactive oxygen species is also difficult to identify without pure culture tests in this study pedomicrobium manganicum was identified as a mnob based on the sequencing of full length of 16s rrna gene no correlation was observed between pedomicrobium manganicum and mn ii oxidation based on the change of relative abundances fig 6 but this does not mean pedomicrobium manganicum did not contribute to mn oxidation phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna sequences showed 25 otu sequences were closely related to manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob fig s7 these otus formed two main clusters one cluster was affiliated with pedomicrobium sp acm 3067 larsen et al 1999 while the other was familiar with pseudomonas sp pcp2 francis and tebo 2001 both otu 3755 and otu 2672 were close to pseudomonas putida mnb1 caspi et al 1998 and otu 2672 was familiar with pseudomonas sp gb1 brouwers et al 1999 overall this showed that diverse and uncultivated mnob were abundant in rsbf until now the ability of mn ii oxidation by various pseudomonas spp is not fully understood for instance it was known that p putida gb 1 p putida mnb1 and several other p putida strains atcc12633 and atcc 33015 were capable of oxidizing mn ii while other pseudomonas species i e p fluorescens atcc 13525 p stutzeri jm300 could not oxidize mn ii francis and tebo 2001 p putida gb 1 was identified to not only possess two kinds of multicopper oxidase mnxg and mcoa but also an animal heme peroxidase mopa indicating the two pathways for regulating the oxidation of mn ii geszvain et al 2016 additionally some of species like p aeruginosa pao1 could perform denitrification under anaerobic condition schreiber et al 2007 suggesting a possible role on the process of manganese and nitrogen cycle the mn ii oxidation capacity of p veronii p citronellolis and p multiresinivorans which were abundant in both biofilters is still unclear determination of mn ii oxidation capability by different species within the genera hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium still needs direct evidence based on pure culture tests furthermore previous studies have reported that no mnob or only one clone affiliated with bacillus subtilis were identified in biofilters for mn ii removal cai et al 2015 cao et al 2015 nitzsche et al 2015 based on those results it is difficult to conclude that the abundances of those known mnob alone can explain the mn ii removal mn ii oxidation by putative mnob in the microbiomes needs further investigation through multi omics approaches and pure culture analyses 4 4 microbial interactions in the two biofilters nitrospira moscoviensis capable of nitrite oxidation had a positive relationship with hyphomicrobium spp fig 7 nitrospira was enriched in oligotrophic waters such as drinking water treatment plants and distribution networks regan et al 2002 pinto et al 2012 palomo et al 2016 vignola et al 2018 the processes of the nitrogen cycle have a close connection with mn ii oxidation correlation analysis also revealed the ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosospira multiformis was positively correlated with mn ii oxidation in mags rsbf previous studies have implied that mnob could not prevail in autotrophic conditions cao et al 2015 mnob growth in oligotrophic water depends on soluble microbial products smps that are produced by nitrifiers aob and nob or methane oxidizing bacteria mob cao et al 2015 matsushita et al 2018 smps are usually classified into two distinct groups utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps barker and stuckey 1999 ni et al 2011 however the contribution of smps to different sources should be further analyzed the greater complexity of the network in the mns reactor table s2 might be one of the key contributors to the stable mn ii removal after 80 days because the diversity of interaction types seemed effective at stabilizing the microbial communities mougi and kondoh 2012 more research on temporal factors in interspecific relationships in rsbf must be conducted to validate the possibility 4 5 multiple pathways of mn ii oxidation picrust showed that the relative abundance of the multicopper oxidase mco gene was higher than that of the peroxidase gene fig s8 the gene abundance was not consistent with mn ii oxidation suggesting that mn ii oxidation relied on the expression of mn ii oxidation related genes and other pathways not revealed by gene abundances the reason was the limited information from the cog and kegg databases where a large portion of the microbial taxa in this study could not be found metagenomic analysis found that a member affiliated with burkholderiales in the sand biofilter contained multicopper oxidase palomo et al 2016 ncbi blast results found that a large number of the abundant populations harbored cota which encodes spore coat protein with the activities of mco and laccase therefore apart from model strains of mnob there might be other species that processed mco for mn ii oxidation in this study cota from bacillus pumilus wh4 exhibited manganese oxidase activity su et al 2013 but cota from bacillus subtilis was unable to oxidize mn ii hullo et al 2001 however whether cota possessed the capability of mn ii oxidation was uncertain and metagenomics derived protein data should be further analyzed to predict more accurate mechanism of mn ii oxidation in biofiltration systems moreover microbial function and metabolic pathway the microbial community possess will be further investigated by metagenomics it has been demonstrated that mn ii oxidation carried out by arthrobacter whose mn ii oxidizing potential was inactive in monoculture was activated in response to the presence of sphingopyxis liang et al 2017 arthrobacter spp and sphingopyxis spp were both enriched in the biofilms of the rsbf opening the possibility that cooperative mn ii oxidation might have occurred in the rsbf a positive correlation between denitratisoma oestradiolicum and derxia gummosa was identified in both rsbf reactors suggesting that they may have a similar cooperative mechanism for mn ii oxidation additionally stenotrophomonas and lysinibacillus might indirectly oxidize mn ii via a nonenzymatic pathway barboza et al 2015 these results suggested that multiple pathways of mn ii oxidation may work in concert in rsbf 5 conclusions this study reports on mn ii oxidation and the dynamics of the core microbiomes of biofilms in rapid sand biofiltration rsbf systems with two different types of filter media for drinking water treatment biofilter medium which has previously been overlooked had a significant effect on mn ii oxidation and biofilm microbiome during the start up and operation periods manganese sand rsbf mns rsbf facilitated the faster initial operation compared to magnetite sand rsbf mags rsbf mn ii oxidation profile along depth was significantly different in the two rsbf reactors the mn ii removal rate at different depths of the mags rsbf reactor changed little while mn ii removal shifted towards the upper layer of mns rsbf over time the initial microbiomes were shaped by biofilter media but converged over operational time various genera affiliated to putative manganese oxidizing bacteria were identified by pacbio single molecule sequencing however pedomicrobium manganicum was the only species known to be a mnob nordella oligomobilis and derxia gummosa were statistically correlated with mn ii oxidation and several dominant species of hyphomicrobium pseudomonas and denitratisoma the species species co occurrence network of mns rsbf was more complex than mags rsbf therefore the mags rsbf was better able to form a microbiome conducive to mn ii oxidation via facilitating a higher proportion of positive biological interactions among the putative keystone

for the removal of contaminants from drinking water treatment systems biofilm microbiomes in the biofilter media play essential roles in biotransformation of contaminants but is not comprehensively understood this study reports on mn ii oxidation and the core microbiomes in magnetite sand rsbf mags rsbf and manganese sand rsbf mns rsbf mns rsbf showed a relatively higher mn ii removal rate 40 91 2 than mags rsbf during the start up mags rsbf and mns rsbf had similar mn ii removal rates 94 13 and 99 16 over stable operation for 80 days mn ii removal rates at different depths in the mns rsbf reactor significantly changed with operation time and the filter in the upper layer of mns rsbf made the largest contribution to mn ii oxidation once operation had stabilized pacbio single molecule sequencing of full length 16s rrna gene indicated that biofilter medium had a significant impact on the core microbiomes of the biofilms from the two biofilters the magnetite sand biofilter facilitated the enrichment of mn ii oxidizing biofilms the dominant populations consisted of pedomicrobium pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium in the rsbf which have been affiliated with putative manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob the relative abundance of pedomicrobium manganicum increased with operation time in both rsbf reactors in addition nordella oligomobilis and derxia gummosa were statistically correlated with mn ii oxidation species species co occurrence networks indicated that the microbiome of mns rsbf had more complex correlations than that of mags rsbf implying that biofilter medium substantially shaped the microbial community in the rsbf hyphomicrobium and nitrite oxidizing nitrospira moscoviensis were positively correlated the core microbiomes composition of both rsbf reactors converged over operation time a hybrid biofilter medium with magnetite sand and manganese sand may therefore be best in rapid sand filtration for mn ii oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords single molecule sequencing microbiome manganese oxidation biofiltration network drinking water 1 introduction rapid sand biofiltration rsbf is widely used around the world for treatment of drinking water from surface water and groundwater bouwer and crowe 1988 white et al 2012 gülay et al 2016 ammonia iron and soluble manganese mn ii contaminants in groundwater gülay et al 2014 can be oxidized by microorganisms in rsbf tebo et al 2004 microbial ecology plays an essential role in managing processes in environmental biotechnology including wastewater treatment bioenergy generation and drinking water purification systems rittmann 2006 although some manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob have been isolated from drinking water systems cerrato et al 2010 the processes by which these microbes work have not been well characterized due to the lack of understanding the physiological ecology and interspecies interactions of uncultured microorganisms groundwater chemistry can be a crucial factor in determining the microbial community structure of biofilms as shown in a sand filtration system albers et al 2015 biofilter media as the primary component of the biofiltration process also affect the conversion of contaminants and influence biofilm formation and microbial community structure oh et al 2018 vignola et al 2018 different kinds of biofilter media including anthracite quartz sand manganese sand gravel pumice stone and granulated activated carbon gac have been used in rapid sand filtration rsbf katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 gülay et al 2014 hoyland et al 2014 yang et al 2014 albers et al 2015 cai et al 2015 bai et al 2016 double layer biofilters pumice stone or gac and quartz sand anthracite and manganese sand have been studied to improve mn ii removal lautenschlager et al 2014 cheng et al 2017 manganese sand has been used as biofilter medium in drinking water treatment plants in china qin et al 2009 li et al 2013 given its relatively high adsorption ability qin et al 2009 li et al 2016 and autocatalytic oxidation of mn ii in the presence of manganese oxides sahabi et al 2009 a batch test showed that when mnox s coated magnetic particles were used as adsorbents removal of mn ii was enhanced funes et al 2014 conductive magnetite fe3o4 and magnetic fields have been reported to facilitate the growth of iron reducing bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer kato et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 magnetite or its nanoparticle can mediate direct interspecies electron transfer diet between electroactive bacteria and methanogens inaba et al 2019 in addition magnetite as one of mixed valent iron oxide minerals plays an important role in microbial extracellular respiration biogeochemical cycling of elements trace metal sequestration and pollutant transformation peng et al 2019 however the effect of magnetic filter medium on mn ii removal and the enrichment of mnob in rsbf has not been investigated next generation sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and metagenomic analyses have identified that the dominant microbes in sand biofilter populations were closely related to those capable of oxidizing ammonium nitrite iron manganese and methane white et al 2012 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 the core microbiomes were dominated by the lineages within the genera of nitrosomonas and nitrospira cao et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 there may also be microbial interactions between mnob and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria as soluble microbial products smp which are produced by nitrifying microbes can support growth of heterotrophs such as manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob kindaichi et al 2004 cao et al 2015 community analyses showed that leptothrix pseudomonas hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium may play roles in the biological oxidation of mn ii in sand biofiltration li et al 2013 yang et al 2014 albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 however the relationship between the abundance of identified mnob and mn ii oxidation in sand filtration is still unclear previous studies have speculated that uncultured populations in the sand biofilters might have the ability to oxidize mn ii but were not affiliated with identified mnob cao et al 2015 nitzsche et al 2015 these results suggested that there are unknown bacteria that may participate in mn ii oxidation moreover there are even fewer studies that have focused on the effects of the biofilter media on the microbiome of biofilms next generation dna sequencing technology has greatly increased our comprehension of the ecology of microorganisms however the short reads 500 bp provide limited information regarding species discrimination and taxonomic assignment third generation sequencing technology such as pacbio single molecule real time smrt dna sequencing and oxford nanopore sequencing are able to capture full length 16s rrna gene which allows high resolution taxonomic identification at the species level the aim of this study was to explore the effects of different biofilter media on manganese oxidation in rsbf and to identify the core contributors to mn ii oxidation in biofilms using pacific bioscience s smrt sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and determine the interactions between biofilter medium magnetite sand and manganese sand and microbiomes of biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 rapid sand biofiltration reactor and operation magnetite sand mags and manganese sand mns were used as biofilter mediums in rapid sand biofiltration rsbf reactors which were purchased from hengxin filter plant gongyi china and the size of particles ranged from 0 5 to 2 cm two polymethyl methacrylate pmma column bioreactors with an inner diameter of 60 cm and a height of 130 cm were constructed for the experiments the two reactors had an active depth of 85 cm on top with 20 cm of coarse grain support material below and were operated at an average hydraulic loading rate of 3 m h because mn ii and fe ii often co occur in metal contaminated surface and groundwaters the synthetic water containing 0 9 2 3 mg l mn ii and 0 3 mg l fe ii was used as the influent to the rsbf the filters were operated in down flow mode and backwashed when the flow rate slowed down to less than 3 m h due to choking by air bubbles all rsbf reactors were operated at 25 1 c room temperature the influent ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were stably around 6 7 15 c and 9 3 respectively to assess the contribution of biofilms at different filter depths to mn ii oxidation in the rsbf reactors water samples collected along the depth were analyzed for mn ii oxidation at given intervals 40 80 and 120 days to investigate the effects of environmental factors filter medium filter depth and operation time on microbial community structure for every 9 samples samples of filter sands were collected from the upper 5 cm middle 45 cm and bottom 85 cm layers of each reactor on days 40 80 and 120 2 2 dna extraction genomic dna of biofilms on the different biofilter media were extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 80 c for further analysis the quantity and quality of extracted dna were measured using a nanodrop nd 8000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively 2 3 pcr amplification and single molecule sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons pcr amplification of the nearly full length bacterial 16s rrna genes was performed using the forward primer 27f 5 agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and the reverse primer 1492r 5 accttgttacgactt 3 the total of pcr amplicons were purified with agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter indianapolis in and quantified using the picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen carlsbad ca usa after the individual quantification step amplicons were pooled in equal amounts and single molecule real time smrt sequencing technology was performed using the pacific bioscience s sequel platform at shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china 2 4 bioinformatics and statistical analysis the sequencing data were analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 8 0 pipeline as previously described caporaso et al 2010 the remaining high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence identity by uclust edgar 2010 otu taxonomic classification was conducted by blast searching the representative sequences set against the ncbi 16s ribosomal rna database using the best hit with a confidence threshold of 90 altschul et al 1997 alpha diversity indices chao 1 richness estimator abundance based coverage estimator ace and shannon and simpson indices were calculated based on otus using qiime beta diversity analysis was performed to investigate the structural variation of microbial communities across samples using unifrac distance metrics lozupone and knight 2005 lozupone et al 2007 and visualized via principal coordinate analysis pcoa and arithmetic means upgma hierarchical clustering a venn diagram was generated to visualize the shared and unique otus among samples or groups using the r package venn diagram based on the occurrence of otus across samples groups regardless of their relative abundances zaura et al 2009 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to identify the relationships among the top 50 bacterial species environmental parameters and mn ii removal rate spearman s correlation indices were calculated using the r software version 2 15 3 the differences of microbial communities in mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors needed to be taken into account so spearman correlations of the top 50 bacterial species were calculated separately for each reactor to elucidate microbial interactions in different biofilters phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens based on otus were constructed in a molecular ecological network analysis pipeline mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena deng et al 2012 the gephi 0 9 2 and cytoscape 3 6 1 were applied to generate the network between putative manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob and their correlated bacterial species shannon et al 2003 bastian et al 2009 to estimate the potential functional contributions of the observed shifts in microbial diversity functional profiles were predicted using a phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust from otus based on 16s rrna gene sequences langille et al 2013 the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and clusters of orthologous groups cog databases were employed to analyze metabolic pathways the contributions of medium type depth and operational time to the variations of bacterial communities were assessed with variance partitioning analysis using the rda r package v3 2 0 all raw sequences were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number prjna541102 3 results 3 1 mn ii oxidation in rsbf with different biofilter media manganese sand rsbf mns rsbf had a higher mn ii removal rate of 40 91 2 than magnetite sand rsbf mags rsbf during the first 30 days fig 1 a mn ii removal rate of mags rsbf increased during the period from 30 days to 70 days and exceeded those obtained by mns rsbf during the same period it stabilized in both mns and mags rsbf reactors after operating for 80 days the mn ii removal rates were 94 13 and 99 16 in mags rsbf and mns rsbf on 120th day respectively mn ii concentration of effluent treated with mns rsbf quickly decreased at the beginning of treatment but increased within 80 days fig 1b suggesting that the highly effective physical adsorption and chemical oxidation of mn ii in mns rsbf took place during the first 30 days by contrast the mn ii concentration of effluent in mags rsbf significantly decreased to 0 08 mg l after 32 days of operation then the mn ii concentration of effluent of mags rsbf increased to higher than 0 43 mg l from day 32 67 above 50 of mn ii was removed which was still higher than that in mns rsbf 30 42 49 05 mn ii concentration of effluent in both rsbf reactors decreased to 0 09 mg l on day 80 mn ii concentration of effluent of mns rsbf was maintained under 0 021 mg l after 80 days which was significantly lower p 0 01 than in mags rsbf which had a mean concentration of 0 079 mg l the mn ii concentrations of the effluents of both rsbf reactors were much lower than drinking water standards 0 1 mg l mn depth profiles for the mn ii removal rate in mags rsbf at three time points had similar patterns and mn ii removal rate increased linearly with increasing depth in the biofilter fig 2 by contrast mn ii removal rates at different depths in mns rsbf changed substantially over time the removal rate in the top 25 cm of the biofilter progressively increased from 12 2 on day 40 and 45 65 on day 80 to 93 04 on day 120 indicating that the upper layer of the biofilter in mns rsbf made the largest contribution to mn ii oxidation 3 2 community diversity of microbial biofilms on different biofilter media pacbio sequel sequencing showed that 6058 to 11 350 high quality effective sequences with full length 16s rrna gene for each sample were obtained and 354 to 573 operational taxonomic units otus were determined at 97 identity fig s1 rarefaction curves indicated that sequencing depth was sufficient to capture most of the predominant bacterial populations in all samples fig s1 the chao 1 ace estimator simpson index and shannon index increased after day 40 indicating that microbial communities of biofilms in mags rsbf and mns rsbf were shaped over time table s1 the chao 1 435 48 534 32 and shannon indices 6 96 7 57 of mns rsbf were relatively higher than those of mags rsbf chao1 of 354 444 68 and shannon of 6 64 6 95 on day 40 the diversity of microbial communities in mns rsbf were slightly higher than in mags rsbf the mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors shared 433 otus on day 40 accounting for 57 3 and 56 5 of total otus fig s2a respectively the number of shared otus in both rsbf reactors increased to 651 on day 80 and 658 on day 120 figs s2b and s2c furthermore the biofilms in the upper layer of biofilters shared the largest number of otus fig s2d making up 63 6 and 63 3 of the total otus in the mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors respectively principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance showed a clear separation between magnetite sand and manganese sand biofilters fig 3 a indicating that there were differences in the microbiomes of the biofilms from the mags rsbf and mns rsbf reactors the differences between the two microbial communities in the two reactors reduced gradually from day 40 to day 120 the samples from the two filters were clustered hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that microbial communities in the upper layer of mns and mags reactors on day 80 and day 120 were clustered closely fig 3b otherwise the bacterial communities in the middle and bottom layers of each reactor were more similar 3 3 core microbiome in the biofilms of rsbf with different biofilter media proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in all samples accounting for 67 94 91 79 followed by actinobacteria 1 87 8 72 acidobacteria 1 17 7 86 planctomycetes 0 63 14 44 bacteroidetes 0 66 6 93 and gemmatimonadetes 0 34 4 78 figs s3a and s3b the relative abundance of proteobacteria in all samples reach to around 70 on day 120 the relative abundance of planctomycetes 14 44 was highest in biofilms of the bottom layer of mags rsbf on day 40 fig s3a and it was much higher than that of mns rsbf 2 32 fig s3b at the class level alphaproteobacteria 33 35 41 46 dominated in biofilms on the upper layers of both rsbf reactors figs s3c and s3d the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria 26 99 39 12 was higher in the mns rsbf reactor while gammaproteobacteria 8 43 33 19 was the predominant class in the mags rsbf reactor additionally the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria in biofilms in the upper layers of both reactors decreased from 29 56 to 15 25 on day 40 to 8 95 and 4 26 on day 120 respectively hierarchical cluster analysis and heatmap based on predominant genera illustrated the distinct clusters between different samples from the rsbf indicating that temporal and spatial dynamics existed in the microbiomes of rsbf with different filter media fig 4 the core microbiomes in the rsbf reactors with different biofilter media were more distinct by day 40 however the core microbiome of mags rsbf on day 120 and mns rsbf on day 80 and 120 were clustered together which was also true for mn ii oxidation the predominant populations from the middle and bottom layers in mns rsbf were located in a branch on day 40 80 and 120 while the predominant populations in the upper layer in both rsbf reactors on day 120 were clustered together the succession of predominant populations took place over spatial and temporal scales predominant populations including pseudomonas hyphomicrobium pedomicrobium and leptothrix were affiliated with putative mn ii oxidizing bacteria fig 4 the relative abundance of pseudomonas was relatively high in both reactors on day 40 6 49 19 73 and decreased to 1 64 7 09 by day 120 in contrast the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium increased from 0 69 9 44 to 8 22 13 62 on day 40 and day 120 respectively the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium was higher in mns rsbf 3 85 13 62 than that in mags rsbf 0 69 9 56 the maximum abundance of leptothrix occurred in the biofilms of the upper layer of mags rsbf 4 48 and mns rsbf 1 93 in addition the relative abundances of oxalicibacterium gemmatinonas and gaiella in both rsbf reactors increased on day 120 3 4 predominant species in the biofilms of rsbf pedomicrobium manganicum capable of mn ii oxidation was enriched in the upper layer it s abundance increased from 0 5 to 2 2 in the mags rsbf reactor from day 40 to day 120 while it increased from 0 9 to 1 5 in the mns rsbf reactor fig 5 hyphomicrobium nitrativorans and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii in the mns rsbf reactor increased significantly from 0 95 to 1 09 and 0 83 2 76 to 3 03 3 79 and 3 92 5 28 respectively over time similar trends of increase were also found in the mags rsbf reactor the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum increased in the mags rsbf reactor from 0 28 2 49 to 2 88 4 32 but decreased in the mns rsbf reactor from 0 83 4 5 to 0 85 2 73 with operational time the relative abundances of both species in the mns rsbf reactor 0 83 5 28 was consistently higher than those in the mags rsbf reactor 0 12 2 96 during operation the relative abundances of pseudomonas veronii pseudomonas multiresinivorans and pseudomonas citronellolis varied with rsbf depth and operation time the relative abundance of pseudomonas veronii in the mags rsbf reactor 2 04 17 09 was higher than that in the mns rsbf reactor 0 97 2 57 and slightly increased with depth over time except in the upper layer of the mags rsbf reactor furthermore the mn ii removal rate of mags rsbf 98 99 was higher than that of mns rsbf reactor 44 98 on day 40 suggesting that p veronii may have the capacity to oxidize mn ii the relative abundances of p multiresinivorans 0 41 3 82 and p citronellolis 0 49 4 44 in both rsbf reactors were substantially decreased from 1 07 to 3 82 and 1 27 4 44 on day 40 to 0 0 96 and 0 04 1 12 on day 120 respectively in addition acidiferrobacter thiooxydans and sulfurifustis variabilis were unique and predominant species in mags rsbf their abundances ranged from 0 47 to 10 22 and 0 32 5 3 respectively noviherbaspirillum massiliense 4 11 7 42 massilia timonae 0 89 5 63 and noviherbaspirillum canariense 0 4 4 83 showed higher relative abundances in the mns rsbf reactor compared to the mags rsbf reactor the increases of relative abundances of denitratisoma oestradiolicum oxalicibacterium solurbis and gaiella occulta were observed over time in both rsbf reactors 3 5 correlation between bacterial species and abiotic factors the majority of bacterial species abundances were related to biofilter medium type and operation time fig 6 correlation analysis indicated that hyphomicrobium zavarzinii hyphomicrobium nitrativorans noviherbaspirillum massiliense and massilia timonae had positive relation with the mns biofilter while acidiferrobacter thiooxydans and sulfurifustis variabilis positively related with the mags biofilter p 0 01 rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris and hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum were positively correlated with biofilter depth pseudomonas citronellolis and pseudomonas multiresinivorans on the other hand were negatively correlated with operational time while denitratisoma oestradiolicum and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii were positively correlated with operation time nordella oligomobilis and derxia gummosa had positive correlations with mn ii oxidation while leptothrix mobilis was negatively correlated with mn ii oxidation fig 6 these results were confirmed by variance partitioning analysis vpa fig s4 which concluded that biofilter medium type and operation time explained 33 and 25 respectively of microbial community composition when spearman correlations were separately analyzed in the two reactors derxia gummosa was the sole species that had a positive correlation with mn ii oxidation in both rsbf reactors taken separately thiobacillus thiophilus and nitrosospira multiformis were positively correlated with mn ii oxidation in mags rsbf and clostridium cylindrosporum and sideroxydans lithotrophicus had positive correlations with mn ii oxidation in mns rsbf 3 6 species species co occurrence network of the biofilms in rsbf network analysis based on otus showed that biofilter medium induced different co occurrence patterns in microbial communities the two empirical networks were significantly different from random networks p 0 05 indicating that bacterial community assembly assemblages in the rsbf reactors was nonrandom fig 7 the species species co occurrence network of biofilms in mns rsbf was more complex than that in mags rsbf as was indicated by a higher average connectivity avgk 8 245 vs 4 355 shorter average path gd 3 049 vs 3 767 and smaller modularity 0 595 vs 0 763 table s2 the network in the mns rsbf reactor consisted of 319 nodes and 1315 edges both of which were higher than in the mags rsbf reactor 259 nodes and 564 edges fig 7 the proportion of the network connections that were negative was 40 6 in the mns rsbf reactor while it was 12 9 in the mags rsbf reactor network the majority of otus in the network structure of the mags rsbf reactor belonged to hyphomicrobium pedomicrobium and pseudomonas and had positive relationships fig 7a two clear subclusters in the network of mns rsbf showed complicated correlations of the putative manganese oxidizing hyphomicrobium spp and pseudomonas spp with other species fig 7b hyphomicrobium spp had complex correlations with other species in the microbiome of both rsbf reactors while pseudomonas spp had more correlations in mns rsbf than that in mags rsbf fig 7c and d pseudomonas spp had more positive correlations with other species in the mns rsbf network than hyphomicrobium spp nordella oligomobilis was positively correlated with pseudomonas veronii hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum and pedomicrobium manganicum in mags rsbf while in mns rsbf it had positive correlations with hyphomicrobium facile subsp ureaphilum hyphomicrobium zavarzinii pseudomonas multiresinivorans and rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris denitratisoma oestradiolicum and derxia gummosa were positively correlated in both rsbf reactors additionally nitrosospira multiformis was also positively correlated with derxia gummosa in mags rsbf which was found to be positively related to mn ii oxidation in the mags rsbf reactor fig s5 moreover nitrospira moscoviensis was positively correlated with hyphomicrobium spp hyphomicrobium zararzinii and hyphomicrobium nitrativorans in both rsbf reactors 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of biofilter media on mn ii oxidation in rsbf there were differences in mn ii oxidation between mns rsbf and mags rsbf during different operation periods mn ii oxidation of mns rsbf was higher than that of mags rsbf during first 30 days fig 1a suggesting that manganese sand mags has a higher adsorption capability of mn ii which was consistent with a previous study qin et al 2009 magnetite sand s mags weaker adsorption ability of mn ii during the first 30 days was similar to anthracite greenstein et al 2018 and quartz sand qin et al 2009 interestingly a sharp increase of mn ii oxidation in mags rsbf was observed on day 30 fig 1 presumably because mags facilitated the enrichment of mn ii oxidizing bacteria better than mns mns showed relatively slower acclimation of mnob presumably the surface characterization or natural oxides impacted the cell attachment mn ii oxidation by mns rsbf 99 16 was slightly higher than that by mags rsbf 94 13 after operation for 80 days presumably because manganese was further oxidized by manganese oxides derived from mns fig s6 x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps analysis showed that biogenic manganese oxides of both rsbf were the 3 4 valence manganese zhao et al 2018 manganese oxides accumulated on the surface of the biofilter medium fig s6 lead to autocatalytic oxidation of mn ii bargar et al 2005 bruins et al 2014 xps analysis also indicated that mns was more suited to the retention of manganese oxides fig s6b which might explain why the mn ii oxidation rate increased on top layer of the mns rsbf reactor over time fig 2 the manganese sand biofilter exhibited better mn ii oxidation later in operation than at the beginning the magnetite manganese sand biofilter on the other hand had higher mn ii oxidation initially before operation stabilized therefore a mixture of equal amounts of biofilter medium or double layers of mns mags may be beneficial for mn ii oxidation in drinking water treatment hybrid biofilter mediums should be further investigated in the future 4 2 the effects of biofilter medium on microbial community structure pcoa and hierarchical clustering results showed that biofilter medium significantly affected the succession of microbial communities in rsbf fig 3 an area of study which was neglected in previous studies on sand filtration qin et al 2009 wu et al 2011 in this study the microbial diversity increased and the community structure shifted towards being more similar as the rsbf reactors reached stable operation especially the convergence of microbiomes in the upper layers of both rsbf implied that a consistent correlation might occur between the selection pressure of mn ii and the succession of manganese oxidizing bacteria fig 3 operation time was found to be the second most important factor explaining 25 of the communities structures moreover mineral coating and metal oxides aggregated on the surface of biofilter material along with other cationic species positively affected the activity and structures of microbiota gülay et al 2014 the increase of biogenic manganese oxides might also have played a role in the shaping the microbial communities microbiomes in the middle layer of mns rsbf and the bottom layer of mags rsbf still diverged from that in other layers of corresponding rsbf the divergence and the convergence of microbial communities co occurred at the different layers indicated that community assembly in rsbf was more complicated and depended upon different environmental conditions in addition the effect of filter medium on community assembly should be further studied under different physicochemical conditions such as ph redox conditions temperature and humic acid magnetite sand mags rsbf facilitated the enrichment of pseudomonas veronii while hyphomicrobium spp dominated in mns rsbf for example the relative abundances of hyphomicrobium zavarzinii and hyphomicrobium nitrativorans were higher in the mns rsbf reactor in addition two representative 16s rrna sequences which were affiliated with acidiferrobacter thiooxydans an acidophilic iron and sulfur oxidizing bacterium hallberg et al 2011 dominated in the mags rsbf reactor however mn ii oxidation by a thiooxydans is not fully understood and should be further investigated mn ii and biofilter medium as primary selection pressures influenced community assembly and microbiome compositions the differences in the microbiome compositions of rsbf with different filter media implicated that the microbiome in rsbf could be manipulated by selecting or optimizing environmental variables when keystone species and its metabolic networks are identified in rsbf for manganese removal it will shed light on the design of reactor microbiome or synthetic community to enhance the efficiency of rsbf 4 3 putative manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob previous investigations have speculated that hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium are affiliated with manganese oxidizing bacteria in sand filtration systems li et al 2013 albers et al 2015 matsushita et al 2018 and that pseudomonas and leptothrix play important roles in drinking water treatment systems burger et al 2008 matsushita et al 2018 to date previous studies have not provided direct evidence to support a positive correlation between well known mnob and mn ii oxidation which might due to limitations in detection methods at the species level resolution and the lack of direct functional validation based on mn ii oxidation related genes the identification of uncultivated mnob are yet more challenging because the mechanisms by which mnob oxidize mn ii are diverse multicopper oxidase mco and heme containing manganese peroxidases mnps derived from different species have different capabilities to directly oxidize mn ii francis and tebo 2001 zhao et al 2018 it is difficult to identify unknown mnob based on orthologous genes that encode mn oxidizing proteins using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches indirect oxidation by uncultivated mnob through modification of redox environments ph increase eh free radicals and reactive oxygen species is also difficult to identify without pure culture tests in this study pedomicrobium manganicum was identified as a mnob based on the sequencing of full length of 16s rrna gene no correlation was observed between pedomicrobium manganicum and mn ii oxidation based on the change of relative abundances fig 6 but this does not mean pedomicrobium manganicum did not contribute to mn oxidation phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna sequences showed 25 otu sequences were closely related to manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob fig s7 these otus formed two main clusters one cluster was affiliated with pedomicrobium sp acm 3067 larsen et al 1999 while the other was familiar with pseudomonas sp pcp2 francis and tebo 2001 both otu 3755 and otu 2672 were close to pseudomonas putida mnb1 caspi et al 1998 and otu 2672 was familiar with pseudomonas sp gb1 brouwers et al 1999 overall this showed that diverse and uncultivated mnob were abundant in rsbf until now the ability of mn ii oxidation by various pseudomonas spp is not fully understood for instance it was known that p putida gb 1 p putida mnb1 and several other p putida strains atcc12633 and atcc 33015 were capable of oxidizing mn ii while other pseudomonas species i e p fluorescens atcc 13525 p stutzeri jm300 could not oxidize mn ii francis and tebo 2001 p putida gb 1 was identified to not only possess two kinds of multicopper oxidase mnxg and mcoa but also an animal heme peroxidase mopa indicating the two pathways for regulating the oxidation of mn ii geszvain et al 2016 additionally some of species like p aeruginosa pao1 could perform denitrification under anaerobic condition schreiber et al 2007 suggesting a possible role on the process of manganese and nitrogen cycle the mn ii oxidation capacity of p veronii p citronellolis and p multiresinivorans which were abundant in both biofilters is still unclear determination of mn ii oxidation capability by different species within the genera hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium still needs direct evidence based on pure culture tests furthermore previous studies have reported that no mnob or only one clone affiliated with bacillus subtilis were identified in biofilters for mn ii removal cai et al 2015 cao et al 2015 nitzsche et al 2015 based on those results it is difficult to conclude that the abundances of those known mnob alone can explain the mn ii removal mn ii oxidation by putative mnob in the microbiomes needs further investigation through multi omics approaches and pure culture analyses 4 4 microbial interactions in the two biofilters nitrospira moscoviensis capable of nitrite oxidation had a positive relationship with hyphomicrobium spp fig 7 nitrospira was enriched in oligotrophic waters such as drinking water treatment plants and distribution networks regan et al 2002 pinto et al 2012 palomo et al 2016 vignola et al 2018 the processes of the nitrogen cycle have a close connection with mn ii oxidation correlation analysis also revealed the ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosospira multiformis was positively correlated with mn ii oxidation in mags rsbf previous studies have implied that mnob could not prevail in autotrophic conditions cao et al 2015 mnob growth in oligotrophic water depends on soluble microbial products smps that are produced by nitrifiers aob and nob or methane oxidizing bacteria mob cao et al 2015 matsushita et al 2018 smps are usually classified into two distinct groups utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps barker and stuckey 1999 ni et al 2011 however the contribution of smps to different sources should be further analyzed the greater complexity of the network in the mns reactor table s2 might be one of the key contributors to the stable mn ii removal after 80 days because the diversity of interaction types seemed effective at stabilizing the microbial communities mougi and kondoh 2012 more research on temporal factors in interspecific relationships in rsbf must be conducted to validate the possibility 4 5 multiple pathways of mn ii oxidation picrust showed that the relative abundance of the multicopper oxidase mco gene was higher than that of the peroxidase gene fig s8 the gene abundance was not consistent with mn ii oxidation suggesting that mn ii oxidation relied on the expression of mn ii oxidation related genes and other pathways not revealed by gene abundances the reason was the limited information from the cog and kegg databases where a large portion of the microbial taxa in this study could not be found metagenomic analysis found that a member affiliated with burkholderiales in the sand biofilter contained multicopper oxidase palomo et al 2016 ncbi blast results found that a large number of the abundant populations harbored cota which encodes spore coat protein with the activities of mco and laccase therefore apart from model strains of mnob there might be other species that processed mco for mn ii oxidation in this study cota from bacillus pumilus wh4 exhibited manganese oxidase activity su et al 2013 but cota from bacillus subtilis was unable to oxidize mn ii hullo et al 2001 however whether cota possessed the capability of mn ii oxidation was uncertain and metagenomics derived protein data should be further analyzed to predict more accurate mechanism of mn ii oxidation in biofiltration systems moreover microbial function and metabolic pathway the microbial community possess will be further investigated by metagenomics it has been demonstrated that mn ii oxidation carried out by arthrobacter whose mn ii oxidizing potential was inactive in monoculture was activated in response to the presence of sphingopyxis liang et al 2017 arthrobacter spp and sphingopyxis spp were both enriched in the biofilms of the rsbf opening the possibility that cooperative mn ii oxidation might have occurred in the rsbf a positive correlation between denitratisoma oestradiolicum and derxia gummosa was identified in both rsbf reactors suggesting that they may have a similar cooperative mechanism for mn ii oxidation additionally stenotrophomonas and lysinibacillus might indirectly oxidize mn ii via a nonenzymatic pathway barboza et al 2015 these results suggested that multiple pathways of mn ii oxidation may work in concert in rsbf 5 conclusions this study reports on mn ii oxidation and the dynamics of the core microbiomes of biofilms in rapid sand biofiltration rsbf systems with two different types of filter media for drinking water treatment biofilter medium which has previously been overlooked had a significant effect on mn ii oxidation and biofilm microbiome during the start up and operation periods manganese sand rsbf mns rsbf facilitated the faster initial operation compared to magnetite sand rsbf mags rsbf mn ii oxidation profile along depth was significantly different in the two rsbf reactors the mn ii removal rate at different depths of the mags rsbf reactor changed little while mn ii removal shifted towards the upper layer of mns rsbf over time the initial microbiomes were shaped by biofilter media but converged over operational time various genera affiliated to putative manganese oxidizing bacteria were identified by pacbio single molecule sequencing however pedomicrobium manganicum was the only species known to be a mnob nordella oligomobilis and derxia gummosa were statistically correlated with mn ii oxidation and several dominant species of hyphomicrobium pseudomonas and denitratisoma the species species co occurrence network of mns rsbf was more complex than mags rsbf therefore the mags rsbf was better able to form a microbiome conducive to mn ii oxidation via facilitating a higher proportion of positive biological interactions among the putative keystone

18207,in this study the fo crystallization ro hybrid process was analyzed comprehensively including experimentation modeling and energy and cost estimation to examine and improve its feasibility to seawater desalination a new operating strategy by heating the fo process to 45 c was suggested and a detailed process design was conducted a comparative analysis with the conventional seawater reverse osmosis swro process was performed in terms of specific energy consumption sec and specific water cost swc the hybrid process can produce fresh water with swc of 0 6964 m3 electrical sec of 2 71 kwh m3 and thermal sec of 14 684 kwh m3 compared to the conventional swro process swc of 0 6890 m3 and electrical sec of 2 674 kwh m3 the hybrid process can produce water with comparable cost and energy

reduced to 0 6435 m3 with free waste heat energy the permeate water quality of the hybrid process was about half that of the conventional swro process on molar basis the results revealed that the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can be utilized as a competitive process for seawater desalination with high recovery and high water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater desalination modeling economic analysis forward osmosis reverse osmosis 1 introduction with the continuous increase in human population the water scarcity problem is expected to worsen over time rogers 2008 although there are many candidates for overcoming this problem seawater desalination is regarded as the best solution because more than 97 of water on earth is seawater esfahani et al 2016 the seawater desalination technology can be categorized into two groups thermal process and membrane process even before the thermal process was widely used it was substituted by the membrane process because it has lower energy consumption than the thermal process semiat 2008 the most widely utilized technology in the membrane process is reverse osmosis ro kim and hong 2018b lee et al 2010 malaeb and ayoub 2011 it has some desirable characteristics for seawater desalination such as low energy consumption and easy scalability lee et al 2011 although these characteristics have led the ro process to be the most popular technology for seawater desalination some undesirable virtues such as low water quality and high membrane fouling demand further research on more attractive processes elimelech and phillip 2011 goosen et al 2005 forward osmosis fo is one of the most promising candidates as an alternative to the ro process for seawater desalination cath et al 2006 after the fo was conceptually designed and suggested numerous studies have investigated its feasibility for seawater desalination choi et al 2009 liu et al 2011 martinetti et al 2009 mccutcheon et al 2005 phuntsho et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 to secure the feasibility of the fo process for seawater desalination an efficient draw solution recovery process followed by the fo process should be designed in recent years a considerable number of studies have been performed to develop a more efficient draw solution recovery process and to find a novel draw solute cath et al 2006 mccutcheon and elimelech 2007 even though some processes have been verified to have lower energy consumption than the conventional ro process there is still a very limited number of reports confirming their economic feasibility recently the efforts for finding a new competitive process for seawater desalination have been extended into integrated hybrid processes the advantages of using integrated hybrid processes can be categorized into two types membrane fouling reduction and cost energy saving ang et al 2015 by replacing the pre treatment process with ultrafiltration uf kamp et al 2000 nanofiltration nf hassan et al 1998 and ion exchange huang et al 2011 higher resistivity towards toxic chemical compounds and less fouling possibility could be obtained to improve energy and cost efficiencies various hybrid processes have been suggested integrated membrane separation crystallization was designed and compared with conventional nf ro processes drioli et al 2002 despite the increase in capital and operating costs the specific water cost of the process can be reduced to 0 52 m3 owing to its 100 water recovery another hybrid ion exchange nf separation process was reported sarkar and sengupta 2008 the energy consumption of this process is approximately 0 89 kwh m3 which is very low compared to that of the conventional ro 3 02 kwh m3 morin 1993 although the proposed processes have proved their feasibility most of the studies have only focused on the laboratory scale performance and their applicability in the industrial scale has not been investigated recently kim et al suggested a new hybrid process integrating fo crystallization and ro kim et al 2013a in that research using sodium periodate as the draw solute the energy consumption was estimated at approximately 2 15 kwh m3 it was reported that this new process is very attractive and competitive with respect to the conventional ro process in addition the constituted units except the fo are already widely used in the industrial scale thus the scale up analysis of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can be easily approached compared to that of the other hybrid processes however the previous report was only a theoretical analysis not validated by experimental data in addition even though the low energy consumption of the hybrid process was verified a cost analysis should be performed because additional equipment for the hybrid process would raise its capital cost after that study a new operating strategy was suggested by raising the temperatures in the fo and ro processes for reducing energy consumption park et al 2018 even though this operating strategy was validated by experimental results its long term stability has not been investigated in addition the operating temperature of 70 c cannot be confirmed by membrane manufacturers hence a new operating mode with a lower operating temperature should be investigated in the present study comprehensive experimental theoretical energy efficiency and economic feasibility analyses were performed for validation of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process we suggested new operating modes with different temperatures and equipment for investigating the most energy and cost efficient operating conditions for the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the results were compared with those from the conventional swro process to assess an alternative process for seawater desalination finally economic feasibility assessments considering the future development of the fo membrane technology and waste heat energy utilization were conducted to improve the economic potential of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process 2 process description 2 1 operating modes of the hybrid fo crystallization and ro process in this study the operating mode of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process was designed considering two cases in the first case the fo is operated with 40 c saturated draw solution and it is referred to as the fo with 40 c saturated draw solution mode fo 40ds mode in the other case the fo is operated with 30 c saturated draw solution and it will be referred to as fo with 30 c saturated draw solution mode fo 30ds mode in both cases the crystallization temperatures are the same 0 c as the water flux in the fo process is determined by the concentration difference between the draw and feed solutions the amount of water flux in the fo process can be enhanced by heating the draw solution to increase its maximum concentration however an excessively high operating temperature of the fo process is not recommendable because of the fo membrane stability thus in this study fo operation temperature t fo of the fo 40ds mode was set at 45 c except sodium sulfate which will be explained in section 2 3 while t fo of the fo 30ds mode was set at 35 c the fo operating temperature is the same as the seawater feed solution and the draw solution temperatures in other words the seawater feed and the draw solutions are placed upon the same temperature condition the operation temperature is above 5 c than the saturated solubility for securing a margin for the operation of the fo process without clogging we assumed that the fo 30ds mode can be easily operated by waste heat energy and heat energy recovery is not required however it is worth to recover the heat energy in the fo 40ds mode therefore in the fo 40ds mode two different cases can be designed depending on the existence of a heat exchanger between the seawater feed stream and the fo process as shown in fig 1 although the limited heat energy requirement of the hybrid process does not need a heat exchanger the heat exchanger could be utilized effectively not because it can recover the heat energy but because it can reduce the inlet temperature of the crystallizer as the inlet temperature of the crystallizer is directly correlated to the amount of required cooling energy of the refrigerator the reduced inlet temperature can decrease the energy consumption of the refrigerator significantly however the capital cost would increase owing to the existence of the heat exchanger thus a cost analysis should be carried out to investigate which configuration would be cost efficient for producing fresh water to operate this hybrid process efficiently the selection of draw solute is very important in the next section several essential factors for the selection of draw solutes will be discussed and the selection criteria will be suggested 2 2 screening of appropriate draw solutes for this hybrid process the draw solute should have the following characteristics the draw solute should have high solubility at t fo for high water flux in the fo process in addition the temperature dependence of the solubility should be as high as possible for energy efficient operation the osmotic pressure of the diluted draw solution after the crystallizer should be lower than that of seawater finally toxicity and instability problems of the draw solute must be avoided and the economic feasibility of the draw solute should be also considered based on these essential factors a very high number of draw solutes more than 640 were screened for finding the appropriate draw solutes haynes 2014 perry et al 1984 speight 2005 the draw solutes selected in this study however are different from those in our previous study kim et al 2013a this is because we investigated more draw solutes and found much better ones from the selection criteria two candidates which are sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate were selected as appropriate draw solutes for this fo crystallization ro hybrid process as can be seen in fig 2 the detailed information of the selected draw solutes is listed in table 1 disodium phosphate has very low solubility at 0 c and thus the required pressure in the ro process is very low however the operating temperature in the fo process should be higher than 40 c to obtain a high osmotic pressure difference therefore disodium phosphate is an appropriate draw solute in the fo 40ds mode in contrast the concentration of sodium sulfate solution is sufficiently high at 30 c in other words sodium sulfate is more suitable for the fo 30ds mode 2 3 operating conditions in each unit of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the operating temperatures in each unit for the hybrid process should be designed for a smooth operation the operating temperatures were maintained at 45 c fo 40ds mode and 35 c fo 30ds mode respectively each operating temperature was set 5 c above the saturated solubility temperature of each draw solute to secure operating stability without clogging in the tube for draw solution circulation however the operating temperatures in both the fo 40ds and fo 30ds modes were fixed at 35 c only in the case of sodium sulfate this is because the solubility of sodium sulfate increases as the operating temperature is raised until approximately 35 c and it decreases over 35 c owing to its hydrated phase change from decahydrate to anhydrite linke 1958 the temperature of the crystallizer is fixed at 0 c the operating temperature of the ro process should be higher than that of the crystallizer in this study the ro temperature is fixed at 30 c regardless of the operating mode because we assumed that this temperature can be reached without any additional heat source or could be easily obtained from waste heat therefore the operating temperatures in each unit can be summarized as in table 2 3 materials and experimental procedure in this study only fo and ro experiments were conducted in the crystallization part of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process it is enough to separate the draw solute from the draw solution regardless of amorphous form or crystalline form in other words the crystallization part is operated closer to precipitation rather than tightly controlled crystallization therefore the crystallization experiment would not be required to conduct energy and cost analysis we assumed that if the draw solution would be reached to the crystallization temperature 0 c in this study the draw solution would become 0 c saturated draw solution and all the excess amount of draw solute would be salted out 3 1 chemicals and membranes the draw and feed solutions in the fo and ro processes were prepared by dissolving each draw solute in deionized water sodium chloride nacl daejung chemical co 99 sodium sulfate na2so4 daejung chemical co 99 and disodium phosphate na2hpo4 daejung chemical co 99 were used in this study a thin film composite tfc membrane provided by porifera and a cellulose tri acetate cta membrane provided by hydration technologies inc hti were utilized in the fo experiments for the ro experiments a polyamide tfc membrane swc6 nitto denko japan was obtained from the manufacturer 3 2 fo experiments all fo membrane tests were performed with a laboratory scale module which had an effective membrane area of 15 cm2 magnetic pumps iwaki company tokyo japan were used to circulate the draw and feed solutions at a flow rate of 1 2 0 1 l min the temperatures of the draw and the feed solutions were maintained at 35 0 2 c fo 30ds mode and sodium sulfate in fo 40ds mode and 45 0 2 c disodium phosphate in fo 40ds mode respectively the flow direction of both solutions in the fo membrane module was countercurrent the active layer of the fo membrane was facing the feed solution al fs mode the water flux performance was determined by measuring the changes in the weight of the feed solution during the fo experiments and dividing by the effective membrane area each experiment was carried out for at least 1 h and no more than 2 h 3 3 ro experiments a laboratory scale ro module with an effective membrane area of 16 62 cm2 was used in this study the feed flow rate and temperature were maintained at 0 72 0 1 l min and 30 0 2 c respectively the applied pressure on the feed side was changed from 20 to 50 bar the water flux in the ro experiments was determined from the amount of water permeate over time and the effective ro membrane area the feed concentration was set at the 0 c saturated solubility of each draw solute given that the feed solution in the ro process is assumed as the effluent solution after the crystallizer whose temperature is maintained at 0 c the salt rejection was calculated as r 100 1 c p c f where c p is the permeate concentration and c f is the feed concentration choi et al 2017 the permeate concentration was measured with a conductivity meter lutron taiwan 4 mathematical models 4 1 fo and ro processes in typical fo and ro processes the water and salt fluxes through the membrane are usually described as a proportionality of the difference in osmotic pressure and applied pressure in the fo process the water and salt fluxes are calculated as follows tang et al 2010 1 j w a π d π f 2 j s b c d c f where j w is the water permeate flux j s is the salt flux π d and π f are the osmotic pressure of the draw and feed solutions c d and c f denote the concentration of the draw and feed solutions a is the water permeability and b is the salt permeability the osmotic pressure can be calculated by the following modified van t hoff equation johnson et al 2018 3 π φ i c r t where φ is the osmotic coefficient i is the ideal ionization number r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the ideal ionization number of both draw solutions is 3 the water flux equation of the ro process should consider the applied pressure the flux equations in the ro process can be described as follows kim et al 2013b 4 j w a δ p δ π 5 j s b c f c p where δp is the applied pressure δπ is the osmotic pressure difference between the feed solution and the permeate and c p is the concentration of the permeate there are two types of concentration polarization external concentration polarization ecp and internal concentration polarization icp gu et al 2011 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 2007 the concentration polarization should be carefully considered and modeled to estimate the water flux in the fo and ro processes precisely by using the boundary layer film theory the ecp can be modeled as follows mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 6 π f m π f b exp j w k ro process and al fs mode in fo process 7 π d m π d b exp j w k al ds mode in fo process where π f m and π f b are the osmotic pressure of the feed solution on the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively π d m and π d b are the osmotic pressure of draw solution on the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively j w is the water flux k is the mass transfer coefficient al fs denotes the active layer facing feed solution and al ds denotes the active layer facing draw solution the mass transfer coefficient can be obtained from the calculation of the sherwood number in a rectangular channel mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 8 k s h d d h 9 d h 4 w h 2 w h 10 s h 1 85 re s c d h l 0 33 laminar

reynolds number sc is the schmidt number and l is the length of the channel the icp effect should be considered in the fo process because the porous support layer in the asymmetric membrane hinders the salts from diffusing freely thus the effective osmotic pressure difference across the membrane is significantly reduced the convection diffusion transport mechanism was used for modeling the icp effect as follows gu et al 2011 lee et al 1981 loeb et al 1997 12 c d m c f m c f m c d b exp k j w 1 b j w exp k j w 1 al fs mode 13 c f m c d m c d m c f b exp k j w 1 b j w exp k j w 1 al ds mode 14 k t τ d ε where k is the salt resistivity to diffusion and t τ and ε are the thickness tortuosity and porosity of the porous support layer respectively mass balance equations were considered to simulate transport phenomena in a membrane module in the ro process velocity and concentration changes along the module length can be described by differential equations as follows kim et al 2013b 15 d u d l j w h 16 d c d l j s c j w u h where u is the linear velocity and μ is the viscosity these equations can be reasonable assuming that the concentration of the feed solution in the ro process is sufficiently low to neglect the volume change by dissolving the solute in the fo process as the concentration of the draw solution is substantially high the mass balance equations should consider the effect of volume change by dissolving the solute these equations can be described as follows park et al 2018 17 d u d d x j w ρ w h j s h 1 d ρ d d c d ρ d c d d ρ d d c d draw side fo module 18 d c d

energy and economic modeling energy models of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process were developed in this study the detailed derivation and solution algorithm are described in the supporting information the energy consumptions of all units in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process were considered and calculated in terms of specific energy consumption sec 21 s e c w h e a t w r o w r e f w f o f p where w is the energy consumption kwh d and the subscripts heat ro ref and fo denote the heat energy ro refrigerator and fo respectively f p is the water production rate per day m3 d in cost estimation the capital and operating costs of all units were considered in the crystallization system we assumed that the operating condition of the crystallizer is like precipitation owing to the rapid cooling in the crystallizer because the precipitation speed is very rapid compared to the crystallization speed jarvenin 2008 the crystallizer design without considering the crystallization kinetics of the draw solutes is acceptable and reasonable in this study in this study an internal draft tube crystallizer was assumed for the crystallizer in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the cost estimation model in this study is developed based on several cost functions couper et al 2009 lu et al 2007 sassi and mujtaba 2013 the cost functions considered in this study are based on the installed cost the multipliers in front of each equation denote the cost increase for installation of each equipment including pipe valve fitting electrical equipment structural supports and miscellaneous items construction labor buildings and engineering and supervision couper et al 2009 the draw solute make up cost was neglected in this study because the prices of sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate are very cheap and the impact of the draw solute make up cost can be neglected lower than 1 of total cost specific water production cost is calculated by summation of annual operating costs and annualized capital cost 1 capital cost seawater intake and pretreatment 22 c c s w i p 0 8 996 f f e e d 0 8 where f feed is the feed flow rate fed into the fo process m3 d because this cost function was developed for applying to the conventional ro process the pretreatment cost is quite overestimated for the fo process altaee et al 2014 in addition the seawater feed stream in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is not pressurized unlike the fo ro hybrid process the seawater feed stream is just fed into the fo process and rejected from the hybrid process therefore in this study the pretreatment cost for the seawater feed stream is assumed as less required pretreatment cost in the conventional ro process from the reference cardona et al 2005 we assumed the ratio of pretreatment cost compared to the conventional swro may be 0 8 regarding to the operation margin fo membrane 23 c c m e m b f o 30 a m e m b f o where a memb fo is the fo membrane area m2 the fo

process the reduced size of membrane equipment of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process might also decrease the labor and maintenance cost as well therefore in order to simplify the cost estimation we assumed the labor and maintenance cost equation can be applied similarly in both fo crystallization ro hybrid process and the conventional swro process then total annualized cost tac and specific water cost swc can be calculated as follows kim and hong 2018a lu et al 2007 sassi and mujtaba 2013 43 tac t a c c o c e l e c o c s t e a m o c m e m b o c c h o c i n s u r e o c l a b e r 44 swc tac f p l f 365 all parameters and variables for the cost and energy estimation are summarized in table 3 as reported by many researchers the specific reverse salt flux in the fo process is almost independent on the concentration of the draw solution achilli et al 2010 kwon et al 2019b and the reverse salt flux of sodium sulfate is much smaller than that of sodium chloride in the recent advanced fo membrane the specific reverse salt flux is lower than 0 15 g l for sodium chloride as a draw solution kwon et al 2019b because our selected draw solutes have larger molecular size and molecular weight the reverse salt flux may be much lower than sodium chloride therefore we assumed that the reverse salt flux of sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate would be negligible by applying the advanced fo membrane however it should be considered that the sulfate and phosphate ions can cause significant fouling problem because calcium ions in the seawater feed stream can produce scaling of calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate on the fo membrane although the fouling propensity should be carefully clarified in the detailed design of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in this study for the sake of brevity we assumed that the effects of fouling can be relieved by considering anti scalant supply and membrane replacement in the developed cost model cost optimization problem was solved by changing fo and ro recoveries independently the fo and ro processes can be dealt with as two independent processes with the crystallization process in between because the total amounts of water permeating through the fo and ro processes are equal the recoveries of the fo and ro processes can be changed by its feed flow rates therefore the fo and ro recoveries can be changed independently however it requires too much computational burden to solve the fo and ro processes at every simulation so the swc of fo and ro processes as changing fo and ro recoveries were fitted by appropriate functions as shown in figs s3 s10 then the swc of fo process and the swc of ro process are summed with the swc of crystallization process to calculate the overall swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the optimization results can be seen in figs s11 s14 5 results and discussion 5 1 flux measurements and parameter estimation in the fo process 5 1 1 ro test for water and salt permeability of the fo membrane ro tests have been widely used for identifying water and salt permeabilities of membranes choi et al 2018 kim et al 2018 kwon et al 2017 2019a to investigate the water and salt permeabilities of the fo membranes hti cta and porifera with high temperatures 35 c and 45 c an ro test was carried out because the water permeability of the hti cta membrane was already revealed by a previous study the ro test was conducted with only the porifera membrane the ro test results in fig s1 show an r2 over 0 99 the identified characteristics of the fo membranes are listed in table 4 5 1 2 osmotic coefficient estimation because the concentration of the draw solution is very high the ideal van t hoff equation cannot be utilized in this study thus the osmotic coefficients in each draw solution should be identified by experimental data the osmotic coefficients were determined at the point of zero water flux by increasing the feed concentration park et al 2018 the estimated osmotic coefficients in each operation mode are summarized in table 5 and the detailed estimation of the osmotic coefficients is explained in appendix c in supporting information 5 1 3 water flux measurement and salt resistivity estimation the fo process simulation can be conducted using the developed model of eqs 1 20 and the estimated parameters in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 however the salt resistivity in eqs 12 14 should also be identified to calculate the degree of icp the salt resistivity was estimated by using the least square method of error between the experimental water flux and simulated results the results are displayed in fig 3 the simulation results adequately described the experimental data as shown in fig 3 in addition the estimated salt resistivities are listed in table 6 the water flux with the porifera membrane always has a higher value than that with the hti cta membrane at the feed concentration of 35 g l 0 59 mol l which is assumed as the seawater feed concentration the fo water flux was around 25 30 l m2 h in the fo 40ds mode with the disodium phosphate solution and in both the fo 40ds and fo 30ds modes with the sodium sulfate solution the water flux is high enough to operate the fo process for seawater desalination because the water flux value is comparable to that with the conventional swro process the estimated parameters in this section will be utilized for the energy and cost analyses in the following sections 5 2 flux measurements and parameter estimation in the ro process 5 2 1 ro test for water permeability of the ro membrane to determine the water permeability of the ro membrane an ro test was carried out using deionized water by increasing the applied pressure from 10 to 50 bar the water flux at each applied pressure was measured the water permeability of the ro membrane can be calculated from the slope of the linear regression between the water flux and the applied pressure as shown in fig s2 the water permeability was determined as 2 19 l m2 h bar 6 08 10 12 m pa s which is comparable with that obtained in the previous study nir et al 2016 5 2 2 ro flux measurement and osmotic coefficient determination as mentioned in table 2 the concentration of the inlet solution of the ro process in the hybrid system is a 0 c saturated solution of each draw solute and its temperature is approximately 30 c even though the concentration is not high it is not easy to apply the ideal van t hoff equation because the draw solute is a strong electrolyte rard and miller 1981 reschke et al 2012 robinson and stokes 2002 scatchard and breckenridge 1954 therefore the osmotic coefficient of each inlet solution should be identified in addition the salt permeability of the ro membrane is required for simulation of the ro process the osmotic coefficient of each inlet solution and the salt permeability of the ro membrane was determined by minimizing the error between the experimental values and simulation results the values are included in table 7 fig 4 shows the ro simulation results obtained from the estimated parameters and the comparison with the experimental water flux and salt rejection in the ro process according to the species of draw solutes the estimated osmotic coefficients are comparable with those in the references rard and miller 1981 reschke et al 2012 robinson and stokes 2002 scatchard and breckenridge 1954 the simulation can represent the actual water flux and salt rejection of the ro process in the water flux the simulation can estimate the experimental data of the ro process with higher than 0 97 of r2 in the salt rejection however the simulation results are not well matched compared to the water flux nevertheless root mean squared error rmse of salt rejection is quite low so the simulation has not deviated from the experimental data seriously in the case with disodium phosphate the r2 of minus value was even obtained because the experimental data is almost flat against the applied pressure the most important aspect of fig 4 is that salt rejection is over 99 except only in the case of sodium sulfate under 20 bars the results support that these two draw solutes sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate can be utilized in the hybrid process for seawater desalination because the draw solutes can be easily treated by the ro process with a high rejection rate the only case with 95 salt rejection is due to the very low water flux under low applied pressure therefore it was experimentally proved that high quality fresh water can be produced by the fo crystallization ro hybrid process 5 3 energy and cost evaluation energy and cost estimation models for the fo crystallization ro hybrid process and the conventional swro process were developed as shown in section 4 2 and supporting information the used process parameters and variables for energy and cost estimation are summarized in table 3 the plant capacity was fixed at 1000 m3 d which is applied in both the fo crystallization ro hybrid and the conventional swro processes 5 3 1 conventional swro process the swc and sec of the conventional swro process were calculated from the developed energy and cost estimation models as shown in fig 5 the swc can be minimized at 59 of ro recovery the minimum value was 0 6686 m3 however the applied pressure at 59 ro recovery was 80 55 bar the maximum applied pressure in the catalog of the swc6 membrane is 82 7 bar in other words this condition is too harsh for operating the swro process robustly therefore many swro plants have been operated at around 50 recovery for securing the margin of pressure range peñate and garcía rodríguez 2011 petry et al 2007 redondo 2001 stover and martin 2009 at 50 recovery the swc sec and applied pressure were 0 689 m3 2 674 kwh m3 and 67 72 bar respectively these values will be reference points for the assessment of economic and energy feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in the following sections 5 3 2 fo crystallization ro hybrid process using the estimated fo and ro membrane parameters in sections 5 1 and 5 2 the sec and swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process were calculated by using the developed models after finding the minimum swc by changing fo and ro recoveries independently the sec at the point of minimum swc was calculated the detailed optimization results are shown in figs s11 s14 the optimum results are summarized in fig 6 even though the operating temperatures in the fo 40ds and fo 30ds modes are the same only in the case of sodium sulfate the heat energy requirement was considered only in the fo 40ds mode for convenience of the comparative analysis as we assumed in section 2 1 no additional heat energy is required in the fo 30ds mode overall the swc and sec of the cases with sodium sulfate were higher than those with disodium phosphate regardless of operation modes this revealed that disodium phosphate is more appropriate as a draw solute for the fo process than sodium sulfate the main reason for the high swc and sec of the case with sodium sulfate is that the high osmotic pressure of the 0 c saturated sodium sulfate solution requires high energy consumption in the ro process in contrast the osmotic pressure of the 0 c saturated disodium phosphate solution is very low thus the required energy consumption in the ro process is very low which leads to lower swc due to lower operating costs in addition the higher water flux with disodium phosphate is also the reason for the lower swc than the case with sodium sulfate because the higher water flux can reduce the required membrane area the reduced fo membrane cost contributed to the lower swc in case of disodium phosphate as the draw solute when analyzing the results of the fo 40ds mode according to the existence of a heat exchanger the case with heat exchanger is more favorable than without one even though the existence of a heat exchanger increases the capital cost the requirements of thermal and electrical energies can be reduced significantly as shown in fig 6 the reduction in operating cost is larger than the increase in capital cost which results in a reduced swc in both cases of sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate furthermore the importance of heat exchanger can be confirmed more apparently by comparing the swc of the fo 40ds with heat exchanger mode and the fo 30ds mode in fig 6 the swc of the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger is similar or less than the swc of fo 30ds mode this result revealed that even though the heat energy cost and the capital cost of heat exchanger were included in the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger mode the electrical energy saving in the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger mode is very significant by the existence of heat exchanger which lowers the outlet temperature of the draw solution after the fo process in other words we can conclude that it is of paramount importance to place the heat exchanger between the fo process and the crystallization process when using sodium sulfate as a draw solute the fo 30ds mode can produce permeate water with a lower cost than the fo 40ds mode however the sec and swc at the lowest case fo 30ds mode porifera membrane were 4 261 kwh m3 and 0 8284 m3 respectively both the sec and swc are higher than those in the conventional swro process in the case of disodium phosphate as a draw solute in the fo process the lowest swc 0 6964 m3 can be obtained in the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger and porifera membrane at these conditions the electrical and thermal sec were 2 71 kwh m3 and 14 684 kwh m3 respectively the electrical energy consumption and the swc are comparable with those of the conventional swro process 0 6890 m3 and 2 674 kwh m3 therefore the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with the fo 40ds mode can be a competitive seawater desalination process in terms of swc when using disodium phosphate as a draw solute the detailed cost breakdown data are listed in table 8 the capital cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is lower than that of the conventional swro process while the operating cost of the hybrid process is to some extent higher the low cost of the hybrid process is attributed to the lower intake and pretreatment high pressure pump and erd costs the higher overall recovery and reduced pretreatment load by applying the fo process can reduce the intake and pretreatment cost significantly in the intake and pretreatment cost it should be noted that the fo crystallization ro hybrid process shows a 68 recovery which is higher than the conventional swro process 50 recovery considering that the fo process can be regarded as a part of the pretreatment system of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the overall intake and pretreatment cost of this hybrid process is 348 685 when normalizing the pretreatment cost by feed flow rate the normalized pretreatment costs are 237 11 m3 d for the hybrid process and 217 80 m3 d for the conventional swro process which are comparable or higher than the conventional swro because the conventional swro should be treated considering its high pressure condition the reduced intake and pretreatment cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process would not be exaggerated in addition the lower pressure and higher ro recovery in the ro process make the high pressure pump and erd costs to become lower however the higher operating cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is caused by higher electricity membrane replacement and steam costs higher electricity consumption and the requirement of heat energy make the operating cost be higher than the conventional swro process in overall the minimum swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with disodium phosphate is comparable to the conventional swro process this makes the fo crystallization ro hybrid process to become a feasible process for seawater desalination furthermore the hybrid process has another advantage lower operating pressure than the conventional swro process the applied pressure according to ro recovery is shown in fig 7 at 50 recovery the applied pressure of the conventional swro process is 67 72 bar in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the pressure requirement in the case of sodium sulfate as a draw solute is not much different from the conventional swro process however the applied pressure in the case of disodium phosphate is very low at 79 ro recovery at the point of minimum swc the applied pressure is only 38 97 bar therefore by utilizing the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with disodium phosphate seawater desalination can be carried out under very low operating pressure and at low cost in addition the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can conduct the seawater desalination with very high recovery the maximum recovery of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with both draw solutes are 68 therefore this hybrid process can reduce the amount of brine disposal and can be utilized to seawater desalination system with high salinity seawater condition this advantage can extend the applicability of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in the high saline region such as middle east countries 5 4 economic feasibility assessment with future development 5 4 1 fo membrane development we fixed the process parameters of ro and crystallization at the values of state of the art technology as shown in table 3 it is because the ro and crystallization are mature processes so these processes could not be easily improved further however because the fo process has been regarded as one of the emerging technologies there is enough space for developing the fo membrane further therefore case studies need to be conducted for assessing the economic potential of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process by developing the fo membrane technology water flux in the fo process is affected by water permeability and salt resistivity in other words the development of fo membrane technology can be simulated by changing the water permeability and salt resistivity respectively in this section only the case of the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger was considered because it showed the lowest swc in all cases in section 5 3 the simulation results are included in fig 8 with increasing water permeability and decreasing salt resistivity of the fo membrane the specific water cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process decreases the amount of cost reduction is affected to a greater extent by salt resistivity than by water permeability however the swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is nearly not reduced even if the water permeability and salt resistivity of the fo membrane will be improved further for instance if the water permeability of the fo membrane would be increased by about 111 and the salt resistivity of the fo membrane would be reduced by about 32 the benefits of swc by the improvement of the fo membrane are just 0 36 and 1 97 respectively this is because the fo membrane cost is not a large part of the overall cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process therefore it can be concluded that considering the improvement of the fo membrane performance has only limited influence on overall swc current commercial fo membranes such as porifera fo membrane or the other ones with similar water permeability and salt resistivity would be adequate to operate the fo crystallization ro hybrid process effectively 5 4 2 utilization of low grade thermal energy the thermal energy required for driving the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with the fo 40ds mode does not need to be a high quality heat source the operating temperature of the fo 40ds mode is just 45 c in the case of disodium phosphate as the draw solute which can be reached by waste heat or low grade heat source schwantes et al 2013 thu et al 2013 therefore the steam cost considered in section 5 3 can be reduced or removed if low grade thermal energy could be utilized at very low price or waste heat energy could be utilized freely the cost estimation results by changing the steam cost are shown in fig 9 only the fo 40ds mode was analyzed in this section because it is assumed that the heat energy is only required in the fo 40ds mode by decreasing the thermal cost the swc in each case is reduced as expected the minimum swc in all cases was obtained in the case of disodium phosphate with heat exchanger which is the same result as that in section 5 3 at this point the minimum swc was 0 6435 m3 compared to the conventional swro process 0 6890 m3 the swc could be reduced by approximately 7 when utilizing the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with free waste heat energy therefore these analysis results confirm the economic feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in other cases even though the swc can be reduced significantly with the assumption of free heat energy the swc is still higher than that of the conventional swro process this revealed that disodium phosphate as a draw solute and the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger must be required for making the fo crystallization ro hybrid process economically feasible 5 5 permeate water quality permeate water quality is also an important index for identifying an appropriate seawater desalination method from the obtained membrane parameters in this study the permeate water quality was simulated as shown in fig 10 the conventional swro process showed 271 mg l of remained salt concentration in the permeate water in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the permeate concentrations were 155 mg l in the case of sodium sulfate and 332 mg l in the case of disodium phosphate respectively considering that the permeate quality regulation for drinking water is around 500 mg l lee et al 2009 mohammadi and kaviani 2003 the hybrid process can satisfy the drinking water regulation in both draw solute cases in addition the permeate water regulation of less than 500 mg l was designed for nacl concentration when changing the permeate qualities to molar concentrations the permeate from the fo crystallization ro hybrid process showed lower concentration than that of the conventional swro process as shown in fig 10 considering the safety of the selected draw solutes as presented in table 1 the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can produce permeate water with higher quality than the conventional swro process 6 conclusions this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with different operating modes for assessing its applicability to seawater desalination processes the operating modes fo 40ds and fo 30ds were designed based on the solubility data of the selected draw solutes process design and mathematical modeling for each operation mode were carried out to perform the process simulation with a large scale operation the required membrane parameters for simulating the fo and ro processes were obtained from the experimental study in addition energy and cost estimation models were developed for assessing the economic and energetic feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the results showed that with disodium phosphate as a draw solute the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger is the best for operating the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with the lowest cost of seawater desalination the swc and sec were 0 6964 m3 2 71 kwh m3 electrical energy and 14 684 kwh m3 thermal energy because the calculated swc and sec of the conventional swro process are 0 6890 m3 and 2 674 kwh m3 with the same basis the fo crystallization ro process can produce fresh water from seawater with comparable cost and energy consumption to the case of the conventional swro process another advantage of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is that it can be driven by lower pressure 38 97 bar than the conventional swro process 67 72 bar in addition the economic feasibility assessments by changing fo membrane parameters and thermal energy cost revealed that the fo crystallization ro process has the economic potential of being a more cost effective process for seawater desalination if low grade thermal energy could be utilized freely especially the free waste heat can reduce the swc of the fo crystallization ro process to 0 6435 m3 which is 7 lower than that of the conventional swro process considering that the operating temperature of the fo 40ds mode is just 45 c the required waste heat can be easily obtained thus the cost feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process would be easily improved in addition the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can perform seawater desalination with 68 recovery therefore the amount of brine disposal can be minimized finally the permeate water quality in both processes was simulated the produced water quality by the fo crystallization ro hybrid process was comparable mg l basis and superior mmol l basis than that of the conventional swro process from all the above results the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with disodium phosphate and fo 40ds mode was confirmed to be very competitive for seawater desalination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18207,in this study the fo crystallization ro hybrid process was analyzed comprehensively including experimentation modeling and energy and cost estimation to examine and improve its feasibility to seawater desalination a new operating strategy by heating the fo process to 45 c was suggested and a detailed process design was conducted a comparative analysis with the conventional seawater reverse osmosis swro process was performed in terms of specific energy consumption sec and specific water cost swc the hybrid process can produce fresh water with swc of 0 6964 m3 electrical sec of 2 71 kwh m3 and thermal sec of 14 684 kwh m3 compared to the conventional swro process swc of 0 6890 m3 and electrical sec of 2 674 kwh m3 the hybrid process can produce water with comparable cost and energy consumption an economic feasibility study that utilized the waste heat and the developed fo technology was also carried out to investigate future developments of the hybrid process the swc can be reduced to 0 6435 m3 with free waste heat energy the permeate water quality of the hybrid process was about half that of the conventional swro process on molar basis the results revealed that the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can be utilized as a competitive process for seawater desalination with high recovery and high water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater desalination modeling economic analysis forward osmosis reverse osmosis 1 introduction with the continuous increase in human population the water scarcity problem is expected to worsen over time rogers 2008 although there are many candidates for overcoming this problem seawater desalination is regarded as the best solution because more than 97 of water on earth is seawater esfahani et al 2016 the seawater desalination technology can be categorized into two groups thermal process and membrane process even before the thermal process was widely used it was substituted by the membrane process because it has lower energy consumption than the thermal process semiat 2008 the most widely utilized technology in the membrane process is reverse osmosis ro kim and hong 2018b lee et al 2010 malaeb and ayoub 2011 it has some desirable characteristics for seawater desalination such as low energy consumption and easy scalability lee et al 2011 although these characteristics have led the ro process to be the most popular technology for seawater desalination some undesirable virtues such as low water quality and high membrane fouling demand further research on more attractive processes elimelech and phillip 2011 goosen et al 2005 forward osmosis fo is one of the most promising candidates as an alternative to the ro process for seawater desalination cath et al 2006 after the fo was conceptually designed and suggested numerous studies have investigated its feasibility for seawater desalination choi et al 2009 liu et al 2011 martinetti et al 2009 mccutcheon et al 2005 phuntsho et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 to secure the feasibility of the fo process for seawater desalination an efficient draw solution recovery process followed by the fo process should be designed in recent years a considerable number of studies have been performed to develop a more efficient draw solution recovery process and to find a novel draw solute cath et al 2006 mccutcheon and elimelech 2007 even though some processes have been verified to have lower energy consumption than the conventional ro process there is still a very limited number of reports confirming their economic feasibility recently the efforts for finding a new competitive process for seawater desalination have been extended into integrated hybrid processes the advantages of using integrated hybrid processes can be categorized into two types membrane fouling reduction and cost energy saving ang et al 2015 by replacing the pre treatment process with ultrafiltration uf kamp et al 2000 nanofiltration nf hassan et al 1998 and ion exchange huang et al 2011 higher resistivity towards toxic chemical compounds and less fouling possibility could be obtained to improve energy and cost efficiencies various hybrid processes have been suggested integrated membrane separation crystallization was designed and compared with conventional nf ro processes drioli et al 2002 despite the increase in capital and operating costs the specific water cost of the process can be reduced to 0 52 m3 owing to its 100 water recovery another hybrid ion exchange nf separation process was reported sarkar and sengupta 2008 the energy consumption of this process is approximately 0 89 kwh m3 which is very low compared to that of the conventional ro 3 02 kwh m3 morin 1993 although the proposed processes have proved their feasibility most of the studies have only focused on the laboratory scale performance and their applicability in the industrial scale has not been investigated recently kim et al suggested a new hybrid process integrating fo crystallization and ro kim et al 2013a in that research using sodium periodate as the draw solute the energy consumption was estimated at approximately 2 15 kwh m3 it was reported that this new process is very attractive and competitive with respect to the conventional ro process in addition the constituted units except the fo are already widely used in the industrial scale thus the scale up analysis of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can be easily approached compared to that of the other hybrid processes however the previous report was only a theoretical analysis not validated by experimental data in addition even though the low energy consumption of the hybrid process was verified a cost analysis should be performed because additional equipment for the hybrid process would raise its capital cost after that study a new operating strategy was suggested by raising the temperatures in the fo and ro processes for reducing energy consumption park et al 2018 even though this operating strategy was validated by experimental results its long term stability has not been investigated in addition the operating temperature of 70 c cannot be confirmed by membrane manufacturers hence a new operating mode with a lower operating temperature should be investigated in the present study comprehensive experimental theoretical energy efficiency and economic feasibility analyses were performed for validation of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process we suggested new operating modes with different temperatures and equipment for investigating the most energy and cost efficient operating conditions for the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the results were compared with those from the conventional swro process to assess an alternative process for seawater desalination finally economic feasibility assessments considering the future development of the fo membrane technology and waste heat energy utilization were conducted to improve the economic potential of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process 2 process description 2 1 operating modes of the hybrid fo crystallization and ro process in this study the operating mode of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process was designed considering two cases in the first case the fo is operated with 40 c saturated draw solution and it is referred to as the fo with 40 c saturated draw solution mode fo 40ds mode in the other case the fo is operated with 30 c saturated draw solution and it will be referred to as fo with 30 c saturated draw solution mode fo 30ds mode in both cases the crystallization temperatures are the same 0 c as the water flux in the fo process is determined by the concentration difference between the draw and feed solutions the amount of water flux in the fo process can be enhanced by heating the draw solution to increase its maximum concentration however an excessively high operating temperature of the fo process is not recommendable because of the fo membrane stability thus in this study fo operation temperature t fo of the fo 40ds mode was set at 45 c except sodium sulfate which will be explained in section 2 3 while t fo of the fo 30ds mode was set at 35 c the fo operating temperature is the same as the seawater feed solution and the draw solution temperatures in other words the seawater feed and the draw solutions are placed upon the same temperature condition the operation temperature is above 5 c than the saturated solubility for securing a margin for the operation of the fo process without clogging we assumed that the fo 30ds mode can be easily operated by waste heat energy and heat energy recovery is not required however it is worth to recover the heat energy in the fo 40ds mode therefore in the fo 40ds mode two different cases can be designed depending on the existence of a heat exchanger between the seawater feed stream and the fo process as shown in fig 1 although the limited heat energy requirement of the hybrid process does not need a heat exchanger the heat exchanger could be utilized effectively not because it can recover the heat energy but because it can reduce the inlet temperature of the crystallizer as the inlet temperature of the crystallizer is directly correlated to the amount of required cooling energy of the refrigerator the reduced inlet temperature can decrease the energy consumption of the refrigerator significantly however the capital cost would increase owing to the existence of the heat exchanger thus a cost analysis should be carried out to investigate which configuration would be cost efficient for producing fresh water to operate this hybrid process efficiently the selection of draw solute is very important in the next section several essential factors for the selection of draw solutes will be discussed and the selection criteria will be suggested 2 2 screening of appropriate draw solutes for this hybrid process the draw solute should have the following characteristics the draw solute should have high solubility at t fo for high water flux in the fo process in addition the temperature dependence of the solubility should be as high as possible for energy efficient operation the osmotic pressure of the diluted draw solution after the crystallizer should be lower than that of seawater finally toxicity and instability problems of the draw solute must be avoided and the economic feasibility of the draw solute should be also considered based on these essential factors a very high number of draw solutes more than 640 were screened for finding the appropriate draw solutes haynes 2014 perry et al 1984 speight 2005 the draw solutes selected in this study however are different from those in our previous study kim et al 2013a this is because we investigated more draw solutes and found much better ones from the selection criteria two candidates which are sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate were selected as appropriate draw solutes for this fo crystallization ro hybrid process as can be seen in fig 2 the detailed information of the selected draw solutes is listed in table 1 disodium phosphate has very low solubility at 0 c and thus the required pressure in the ro process is very low however the operating temperature in the fo process should be higher than 40 c to obtain a high osmotic pressure difference therefore disodium phosphate is an appropriate draw solute in the fo 40ds mode in contrast the concentration of sodium sulfate solution is sufficiently high at 30 c in other words sodium sulfate is more suitable for the fo 30ds mode 2 3 operating conditions in each unit of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the operating temperatures in each unit for the hybrid process should be designed for a smooth operation the operating temperatures were maintained at 45 c fo 40ds mode and 35 c fo 30ds mode respectively each operating temperature was set 5 c above the saturated solubility temperature of each draw solute to secure operating stability without clogging in the tube for draw solution circulation however the operating temperatures in both the fo 40ds and fo 30ds modes were fixed at 35 c only in the case of sodium sulfate this is because the solubility of sodium sulfate increases as the operating temperature is raised until approximately 35 c and it decreases over 35 c owing to its hydrated phase change from decahydrate to anhydrite linke 1958 the temperature of the crystallizer is fixed at 0 c the operating temperature of the ro process should be higher than that of the crystallizer in this study the ro temperature is fixed at 30 c regardless of the operating mode because we assumed that this temperature can be reached without any additional heat source or could be easily obtained from waste heat therefore the operating temperatures in each unit can be summarized as in table 2 3 materials and experimental procedure in this study only fo and ro experiments were conducted in the crystallization part of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process it is enough to separate the draw solute from the draw solution regardless of amorphous form or crystalline form in other words the crystallization part is operated closer to precipitation rather than tightly controlled crystallization therefore the crystallization experiment would not be required to conduct energy and cost analysis we assumed that if the draw solution would be reached to the crystallization temperature 0 c in this study the draw solution would become 0 c saturated draw solution and all the excess amount of draw solute would be salted out 3 1 chemicals and membranes the draw and feed solutions in the fo and ro processes were prepared by dissolving each draw solute in deionized water sodium chloride nacl daejung chemical co 99 sodium sulfate na2so4 daejung chemical co 99 and disodium phosphate na2hpo4 daejung chemical co 99 were used in this study a thin film composite tfc membrane provided by porifera and a cellulose tri acetate cta membrane provided by hydration technologies inc hti were utilized in the fo experiments for the ro experiments a polyamide tfc membrane swc6 nitto denko japan was obtained from the manufacturer 3 2 fo experiments all fo membrane tests were performed with a laboratory scale module which had an effective membrane area of 15 cm2 magnetic pumps iwaki company tokyo japan were used to circulate the draw and feed solutions at a flow rate of 1 2 0 1 l min the temperatures of the draw and the feed solutions were maintained at 35 0 2 c fo 30ds mode and sodium sulfate in fo 40ds mode and 45 0 2 c disodium phosphate in fo 40ds mode respectively the flow direction of both solutions in the fo membrane module was countercurrent the active layer of the fo membrane was facing the feed solution al fs mode the water flux performance was determined by measuring the changes in the weight of the feed solution during the fo experiments and dividing by the effective membrane area each experiment was carried out for at least 1 h and no more than 2 h 3 3 ro experiments a laboratory scale ro module with an effective membrane area of 16 62 cm2 was used in this study the feed flow rate and temperature were maintained at 0 72 0 1 l min and 30 0 2 c respectively the applied pressure on the feed side was changed from 20 to 50 bar the water flux in the ro experiments was determined from the amount of water permeate over time and the effective ro membrane area the feed concentration was set at the 0 c saturated solubility of each draw solute given that the feed solution in the ro process is assumed as the effluent solution after the crystallizer whose temperature is maintained at 0 c the salt rejection was calculated as r 100 1 c p c f where c p is the permeate concentration and c f is the feed concentration choi et al 2017 the permeate concentration was measured with a conductivity meter lutron taiwan 4 mathematical models 4 1 fo and ro processes in typical fo and ro processes the water and salt fluxes through the membrane are usually described as a proportionality of the difference in osmotic pressure and applied pressure in the fo process the water and salt fluxes are calculated as follows tang et al 2010 1 j w a π d π f 2 j s b c d c f where j w is the water permeate flux j s is the salt flux π d and π f are the osmotic pressure of the draw and feed solutions c d and c f denote the concentration of the draw and feed solutions a is the water permeability and b is the salt permeability the osmotic pressure can be calculated by the following modified van t hoff equation johnson et al 2018 3 π φ i c r t where φ is the osmotic coefficient i is the ideal ionization number r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the ideal ionization number of both draw solutions is 3 the water flux equation of the ro process should consider the applied pressure the flux equations in the ro process can be described as follows kim et al 2013b 4 j w a δ p δ π 5 j s b c f c p where δp is the applied pressure δπ is the osmotic pressure difference between the feed solution and the permeate and c p is the concentration of the permeate there are two types of concentration polarization external concentration polarization ecp and internal concentration polarization icp gu et al 2011 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 2007 the concentration polarization should be carefully considered and modeled to estimate the water flux in the fo and ro processes precisely by using the boundary layer film theory the ecp can be modeled as follows mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 6 π f m π f b exp j w k ro process and al fs mode in fo process 7 π d m π d b exp j w k al ds mode in fo process where π f m and π f b are the osmotic pressure of the feed solution on the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively π d m and π d b are the osmotic pressure of draw solution on the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively j w is the water flux k is the mass transfer coefficient al fs denotes the active layer facing feed solution and al ds denotes the active layer facing draw solution the mass transfer coefficient can be obtained from the calculation of the sherwood number in a rectangular channel mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 8 k s h d d h 9 d h 4 w h 2 w h 10 s h 1 85 re s c d h l 0 33 laminar

reynolds number sc is the schmidt number and l is the length of the channel the icp effect should be considered in the fo process because the porous support layer in the asymmetric membrane hinders the salts from diffusing freely thus the effective osmotic pressure difference across the membrane is significantly reduced the convection diffusion transport mechanism was used for modeling the icp effect as follows gu et al 2011 lee et al 1981 loeb et al 1997 12 c d m c f m c f m c d b exp k j w 1 b j w exp k j w 1 al fs mode 13 c f m c d m c d m c f b exp k j w 1 b j w exp k j w 1 al ds mode 14 k t τ d ε where k is the salt resistivity to diffusion and t τ and ε are the thickness tortuosity and porosity of the porous support layer respectively mass balance equations were considered to simulate transport phenomena in a membrane module in the ro process velocity and concentration changes along the module length can be described by differential equations as follows kim et al 2013b 15 d u d l j w h 16 d c d l j s c j w u h where u is the linear velocity and μ is the viscosity these equations can be reasonable assuming that the concentration of the feed solution in the ro process is sufficiently low to neglect the volume change by dissolving the solute in the fo process as the concentration of the draw solution is substantially high the mass balance equations should consider the effect of volume change by dissolving the solute these equations can be described as follows park et al 2018 17 d u d d x j w ρ w h j s h 1 d ρ d d c d ρ d c d d ρ d d c d draw side fo module 18 d c d

energy and economic modeling energy models of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process were developed in this study the detailed derivation and solution algorithm are described in the supporting information the energy consumptions of all units in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process were considered and calculated in terms of specific energy consumption sec 21 s e c w h e a t w r o w r e f

estimation the capital and operating costs of all units were considered in the crystallization system we assumed that the operating condition of the crystallizer is like precipitation owing to the rapid cooling in the crystallizer because the precipitation speed is very rapid compared to the crystallization speed jarvenin 2008 the crystallizer design without considering the crystallization kinetics of the draw solutes is acceptable and reasonable in this study in this study an internal draft tube crystallizer was assumed for the crystallizer in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the cost estimation model in this study is developed based on several cost functions couper et al 2009 lu et al 2007 sassi and mujtaba 2013 the cost functions considered in this study are based on the installed cost the multipliers in front of each equation denote the cost increase for installation of each equipment including pipe valve fitting electrical equipment structural supports and miscellaneous items construction labor buildings and engineering and supervision couper et al 2009 the draw solute make up cost was neglected in this study because the prices of sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate are very cheap and the impact of the draw solute make up cost can be neglected lower than 1 of total cost specific water production cost is calculated by summation of annual operating costs and annualized capital cost 1 capital cost seawater intake and pretreatment 22 c c s w i p 0 8 996 f f e e d 0 8 where f feed is the feed flow rate fed into the fo process m3 d because this cost function was developed for applying to the conventional ro process the pretreatment cost is quite overestimated for the fo process altaee et al 2014 in addition the seawater feed stream in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is not pressurized unlike the fo ro hybrid process the seawater feed stream is just fed into the fo process and rejected from the hybrid process therefore in this study the pretreatment cost for the seawater feed stream is assumed as less required pretreatment cost in the conventional ro process from the reference cardona et al 2005 we assumed the ratio of pretreatment cost compared to the conventional swro may be 0 8 regarding to the operation margin fo membrane 23 c c m e m b f o 30 a m e m b f o where a memb fo is the fo membrane area m2 the fo

process the reduced size of membrane equipment of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process might also decrease the labor and maintenance cost as well therefore in order to simplify the cost estimation we assumed the labor and maintenance cost equation can be applied similarly in both fo crystallization ro hybrid process and the conventional swro process then total annualized cost tac and specific water cost swc can be calculated as follows kim and hong 2018a lu et al 2007 sassi and mujtaba 2013 43 tac t a c c o c e l e c o c s t e a m o c m e m b o c c h o c i n s u r e o c l a b e r 44 swc tac f p l f 365 all parameters and variables for the cost and energy estimation are summarized in table 3 as reported by many researchers the specific reverse salt flux in the fo process is almost independent on the concentration of the draw solution achilli et al 2010 kwon et al 2019b and the reverse salt flux of sodium sulfate is much smaller than that of sodium chloride in the recent advanced fo membrane the specific reverse salt flux is lower than 0 15 g l for sodium chloride as a draw solution kwon et al 2019b because our selected draw solutes have larger molecular size and molecular weight the reverse salt flux may be much lower than sodium chloride therefore we assumed that the reverse salt flux of sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate would be negligible by applying the advanced fo membrane however it should be considered that the sulfate and phosphate ions can cause significant fouling problem because calcium ions in the seawater feed stream can produce scaling of calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate on the fo membrane although the fouling propensity should be carefully clarified in the detailed design of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in this study for the sake of brevity we assumed that the effects of fouling can be relieved by considering anti scalant supply and membrane replacement in the developed cost model cost optimization problem was solved by changing fo and ro recoveries independently the fo and ro processes can be dealt with as two independent processes with the crystallization process in between because the total amounts of water permeating through the fo and ro processes are equal the recoveries of the fo and ro processes can be changed by its feed flow rates therefore the fo and ro recoveries can be changed independently however it requires too much computational burden to solve the fo and ro processes at every simulation so the swc of fo and ro processes as changing fo and ro recoveries were fitted by appropriate functions as shown in figs s3 s10 then the swc of fo process and the swc of ro process are summed with the swc of crystallization process to calculate the overall swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the optimization results can be seen in figs s11 s14 5 results and discussion 5 1 flux measurements and parameter estimation in the fo process 5 1 1 ro test for water and salt permeability of the fo membrane ro tests have been widely used for identifying water and salt permeabilities of membranes choi et al 2018 kim et al 2018 kwon et al 2017 2019a to investigate the water and salt permeabilities of the fo membranes hti cta and porifera with high temperatures 35 c and 45 c an ro test was carried out because the water permeability of the hti cta membrane was already revealed by a previous study the ro test was conducted with only the porifera membrane the ro test results in fig s1 show an r2 over 0 99 the identified characteristics of the fo membranes are listed in table 4 5 1 2 osmotic coefficient estimation because the concentration of the draw solution is very high the ideal van t hoff equation cannot be utilized in this study thus the osmotic coefficients in each draw solution should be identified by experimental data the osmotic coefficients were determined at the point of zero water flux by increasing the feed concentration park et al 2018 the estimated osmotic coefficients in each operation mode are summarized in table 5 and the detailed estimation of the osmotic coefficients is explained in appendix c in supporting information 5 1 3 water flux measurement and salt resistivity estimation the fo process simulation can be conducted using the developed model of eqs 1 20 and the estimated parameters in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 however the salt resistivity in eqs 12 14 should also be identified to calculate the degree of icp the salt resistivity was estimated by using the least square method of error between the experimental water flux and simulated results the results are displayed in fig 3 the simulation results adequately described the experimental data as shown in fig 3 in addition the estimated salt resistivities are listed in table 6 the water flux with the porifera membrane always has a higher value than that with the hti cta membrane at the feed concentration of 35 g l 0 59 mol l which is assumed as the seawater feed concentration the fo water flux was around 25 30 l m2 h in the fo 40ds mode with the disodium phosphate solution and in both the fo 40ds and fo 30ds modes with the sodium sulfate solution the water flux is high enough to operate the fo process for seawater desalination because the water flux value is comparable to that with the conventional swro process the estimated parameters in this section will be utilized for the energy and cost analyses in the following sections 5 2 flux measurements and parameter estimation in the ro process 5 2 1 ro test for water permeability of the ro membrane to determine the water permeability of the ro membrane an ro test was carried out using deionized water by increasing the applied pressure from 10 to 50 bar the water flux at each applied pressure was measured the water permeability of the ro membrane can be calculated from the slope of the linear regression between the water flux and the applied pressure as shown in fig s2 the water permeability was determined as 2 19 l m2 h bar 6 08 10 12 m pa s which is comparable with that obtained in the previous study nir et al 2016 5 2 2 ro flux measurement and osmotic coefficient determination as mentioned in table 2 the concentration of the inlet solution of the ro process in the hybrid system is a 0 c saturated solution of each draw solute and its temperature is approximately 30 c even though the concentration is not high it is not easy to apply the ideal van t hoff equation because the draw solute is a strong electrolyte rard and miller 1981 reschke et al 2012 robinson and stokes 2002 scatchard and breckenridge 1954 therefore the osmotic coefficient of each inlet solution should be identified in addition the salt permeability of the ro membrane is required for simulation of the ro process the osmotic coefficient of each inlet solution and the salt permeability of the ro membrane was determined by minimizing the error between the experimental values and simulation results the values are included in table 7 fig 4 shows the ro simulation results obtained from the estimated parameters and the comparison with the experimental water flux and salt rejection in the ro process according to the species of draw solutes the estimated osmotic coefficients are comparable with those in the references rard and miller 1981 reschke et al 2012 robinson and stokes 2002 scatchard and breckenridge 1954 the simulation can represent the actual water flux and salt rejection of the ro process in the water flux the simulation can estimate the experimental data of the ro process with higher than 0 97 of r2 in the salt rejection however the simulation results are not well matched compared to the water flux nevertheless root mean squared error rmse of salt rejection is quite low so the simulation has not deviated from the experimental data seriously in the case with disodium phosphate the r2 of minus value was even obtained because the experimental data is almost flat against the applied pressure the most important aspect of fig 4 is that salt rejection is over 99 except only in the case of sodium sulfate under 20 bars the results support that these two draw solutes sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate can be utilized in the hybrid process for seawater desalination because the draw solutes can be easily treated by the ro process with a high rejection rate the only case with 95 salt rejection is due to the very low water flux under low applied pressure therefore it was experimentally proved that high quality fresh water can be produced by the fo crystallization ro hybrid process 5 3 energy and cost evaluation energy and cost estimation models for the fo crystallization ro hybrid process and the conventional swro process were developed as shown in section 4 2 and supporting information the used process parameters and variables for energy and cost estimation are summarized in table 3 the plant capacity was fixed at 1000 m3 d which is applied in both the fo crystallization ro hybrid and the conventional swro processes 5 3 1 conventional swro process the swc and sec of the conventional swro process were calculated from the developed energy and cost estimation models as shown in fig 5 the swc can be minimized at 59 of ro recovery the minimum value was 0 6686 m3 however the applied pressure at 59 ro recovery was 80 55 bar the maximum applied pressure in the catalog of the swc6 membrane is 82 7 bar in other words this condition is too harsh for operating the swro process robustly therefore many swro plants have been operated at around 50 recovery for securing the margin of pressure range peñate and garcía rodríguez 2011 petry et al 2007 redondo 2001 stover and martin 2009 at 50 recovery the swc sec and applied pressure were 0 689 m3 2 674 kwh m3 and 67 72 bar respectively these values will be reference points for the assessment of economic and energy feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in the following sections 5 3 2 fo crystallization ro hybrid process using the estimated fo and ro membrane parameters in sections 5 1 and 5 2 the sec and swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process were calculated by using the developed models after finding the minimum swc by changing fo and ro recoveries independently the sec at the point of minimum swc was calculated the detailed optimization results are shown in figs s11 s14 the optimum results are summarized in fig 6 even though the operating temperatures in the fo 40ds and fo 30ds modes are the same only in the case of sodium sulfate the heat energy requirement was considered only in the fo 40ds mode for convenience of the comparative analysis as we assumed in section 2 1 no additional heat energy is required in the fo 30ds mode overall the swc and sec of the cases with sodium sulfate were higher than those with disodium phosphate regardless of operation modes this revealed that disodium phosphate is more appropriate as a draw solute for the fo process than sodium sulfate the main reason for the high swc and sec of the case with sodium sulfate is that the high osmotic pressure of the 0 c saturated sodium sulfate solution requires high energy consumption in the ro process in contrast the osmotic pressure of the 0 c saturated disodium phosphate solution is very low thus the required energy consumption in the ro process is very low which leads to lower swc due to lower operating costs in addition the higher water flux with disodium phosphate is also the reason for the lower swc than the case with sodium sulfate because the higher water flux can reduce the required membrane area the reduced fo membrane cost contributed to the lower swc in case of disodium phosphate as the draw solute when analyzing the results of the fo 40ds mode according to the existence of a heat exchanger the case with heat exchanger is more favorable than without one even though the existence of a heat exchanger increases the capital cost the requirements of thermal and electrical energies can be reduced significantly as shown in fig 6 the reduction in operating cost is larger than the increase in capital cost which results in a reduced swc in both cases of sodium sulfate and disodium phosphate furthermore the importance of heat exchanger can be confirmed more apparently by comparing the swc of the fo 40ds with heat exchanger mode and the fo 30ds mode in fig 6 the swc of the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger is similar or less than the swc of fo 30ds mode this result revealed that even though the heat energy cost and the capital cost of heat exchanger were included in the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger mode the electrical energy saving in the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger mode is very significant by the existence of heat exchanger which lowers the outlet temperature of the draw solution after the fo process in other words we can conclude that it is of paramount importance to place the heat exchanger between the fo process and the crystallization process when using sodium sulfate as a draw solute the fo 30ds mode can produce permeate water with a lower cost than the fo 40ds mode however the sec and swc at the lowest case fo 30ds mode porifera membrane were 4 261 kwh m3 and 0 8284 m3 respectively both the sec and swc are higher than those in the conventional swro process in the case of disodium phosphate as a draw solute in the fo process the lowest swc 0 6964 m3 can be obtained in the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger and porifera membrane at these conditions the electrical and thermal sec were 2 71 kwh m3 and 14 684 kwh m3 respectively the electrical energy consumption and the swc are comparable with those of the conventional swro process 0 6890 m3 and 2 674 kwh m3 therefore the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with the fo 40ds mode can be a competitive seawater desalination process in terms of swc when using disodium phosphate as a draw solute the detailed cost breakdown data are listed in table 8 the capital cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is lower than that of the conventional swro process while the operating cost of the hybrid process is to some extent higher the low cost of the hybrid process is attributed to the lower intake and pretreatment high pressure pump and erd costs the higher overall recovery and reduced pretreatment load by applying the fo process can reduce the intake and pretreatment cost significantly in the intake and pretreatment cost it should be noted that the fo crystallization ro hybrid process shows a 68 recovery which is higher than the conventional swro process 50 recovery considering that the fo process can be regarded as a part of the pretreatment system of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the overall intake and pretreatment cost of this hybrid process is 348 685 when normalizing the pretreatment cost by feed flow rate the normalized pretreatment costs are 237 11 m3 d for the hybrid process and 217 80 m3 d for the conventional swro process which are comparable or higher than the conventional swro because the conventional swro should be treated considering its high pressure condition the reduced intake and pretreatment cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process would not be exaggerated in addition the lower pressure and higher ro recovery in the ro process make the high pressure pump and erd costs to become lower however the higher operating cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is caused by higher electricity membrane replacement and steam costs higher electricity consumption and the requirement of heat energy make the operating cost be higher than the conventional swro process in overall the minimum swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with disodium phosphate is comparable to the conventional swro process this makes the fo crystallization ro hybrid process to become a feasible process for seawater desalination furthermore the hybrid process has another advantage lower operating pressure than the conventional swro process the applied pressure according to ro recovery is shown in fig 7 at 50 recovery the applied pressure of the conventional swro process is 67 72 bar in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the pressure requirement in the case of sodium sulfate as a draw solute is not much different from the conventional swro process however the applied pressure in the case of disodium phosphate is very low at 79 ro recovery at the point of minimum swc the applied pressure is only 38 97 bar therefore by utilizing the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with disodium phosphate seawater desalination can be carried out under very low operating pressure and at low cost in addition the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can conduct the seawater desalination with very high recovery the maximum recovery of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with both draw solutes are 68 therefore this hybrid process can reduce the amount of brine disposal and can be utilized to seawater desalination system with high salinity seawater condition this advantage can extend the applicability of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in the high saline region such as middle east countries 5 4 economic feasibility assessment with future development 5 4 1 fo membrane development we fixed the process parameters of ro and crystallization at the values of state of the art technology as shown in table 3 it is because the ro and crystallization are mature processes so these processes could not be easily improved further however because the fo process has been regarded as one of the emerging technologies there is enough space for developing the fo membrane further therefore case studies need to be conducted for assessing the economic potential of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process by developing the fo membrane technology water flux in the fo process is affected by water permeability and salt resistivity in other words the development of fo membrane technology can be simulated by changing the water permeability and salt resistivity respectively in this section only the case of the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger was considered because it showed the lowest swc in all cases in section 5 3 the simulation results are included in fig 8 with increasing water permeability and decreasing salt resistivity of the fo membrane the specific water cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process decreases the amount of cost reduction is affected to a greater extent by salt resistivity than by water permeability however the swc of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is nearly not reduced even if the water permeability and salt resistivity of the fo membrane will be improved further for instance if the water permeability of the fo membrane would be increased by about 111 and the salt resistivity of the fo membrane would be reduced by about 32 the benefits of swc by the improvement of the fo membrane are just 0 36 and 1 97 respectively this is because the fo membrane cost is not a large part of the overall cost of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process therefore it can be concluded that considering the improvement of the fo membrane performance has only limited influence on overall swc current commercial fo membranes such as porifera fo membrane or the other ones with similar water permeability and salt resistivity would be adequate to operate the fo crystallization ro hybrid process effectively 5 4 2 utilization of low grade thermal energy the thermal energy required for driving the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with the fo 40ds mode does not need to be a high quality heat source the operating temperature of the fo 40ds mode is just 45 c in the case of disodium phosphate as the draw solute which can be reached by waste heat or low grade heat source schwantes et al 2013 thu et al 2013 therefore the steam cost considered in section 5 3 can be reduced or removed if low grade thermal energy could be utilized at very low price or waste heat energy could be utilized freely the cost estimation results by changing the steam cost are shown in fig 9 only the fo 40ds mode was analyzed in this section because it is assumed that the heat energy is only required in the fo 40ds mode by decreasing the thermal cost the swc in each case is reduced as expected the minimum swc in all cases was obtained in the case of disodium phosphate with heat exchanger which is the same result as that in section 5 3 at this point the minimum swc was 0 6435 m3 compared to the conventional swro process 0 6890 m3 the swc could be reduced by approximately 7 when utilizing the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with free waste heat energy therefore these analysis results confirm the economic feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process in other cases even though the swc can be reduced significantly with the assumption of free heat energy the swc is still higher than that of the conventional swro process this revealed that disodium phosphate as a draw solute and the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger must be required for making the fo crystallization ro hybrid process economically feasible 5 5 permeate water quality permeate water quality is also an important index for identifying an appropriate seawater desalination method from the obtained membrane parameters in this study the permeate water quality was simulated as shown in fig 10 the conventional swro process showed 271 mg l of remained salt concentration in the permeate water in the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the permeate concentrations were 155 mg l in the case of sodium sulfate and 332 mg l in the case of disodium phosphate respectively considering that the permeate quality regulation for drinking water is around 500 mg l lee et al 2009 mohammadi and kaviani 2003 the hybrid process can satisfy the drinking water regulation in both draw solute cases in addition the permeate water regulation of less than 500 mg l was designed for nacl concentration when changing the permeate qualities to molar concentrations the permeate from the fo crystallization ro hybrid process showed lower concentration than that of the conventional swro process as shown in fig 10 considering the safety of the selected draw solutes as presented in table 1 the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can produce permeate water with higher quality than the conventional swro process 6 conclusions this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with different operating modes for assessing its applicability to seawater desalination processes the operating modes fo 40ds and fo 30ds were designed based on the solubility data of the selected draw solutes process design and mathematical modeling for each operation mode were carried out to perform the process simulation with a large scale operation the required membrane parameters for simulating the fo and ro processes were obtained from the experimental study in addition energy and cost estimation models were developed for assessing the economic and energetic feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process the results showed that with disodium phosphate as a draw solute the fo 40ds mode with heat exchanger is the best for operating the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with the lowest cost of seawater desalination the swc and sec were 0 6964 m3 2 71 kwh m3 electrical energy and 14 684 kwh m3 thermal energy because the calculated swc and sec of the conventional swro process are 0 6890 m3 and 2 674 kwh m3 with the same basis the fo crystallization ro process can produce fresh water from seawater with comparable cost and energy consumption to the case of the conventional swro process another advantage of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process is that it can be driven by lower pressure 38 97 bar than the conventional swro process 67 72 bar in addition the economic feasibility assessments by changing fo membrane parameters and thermal energy cost revealed that the fo crystallization ro process has the economic potential of being a more cost effective process for seawater desalination if low grade thermal energy could be utilized freely especially the free waste heat can reduce the swc of the fo crystallization ro process to 0 6435 m3 which is 7 lower than that of the conventional swro process considering that the operating temperature of the fo 40ds mode is just 45 c the required waste heat can be easily obtained thus the cost feasibility of the fo crystallization ro hybrid process would be easily improved in addition the fo crystallization ro hybrid process can perform seawater desalination with 68 recovery therefore the amount of brine disposal can be minimized finally the permeate water quality in both processes was simulated the produced water quality by the fo crystallization ro hybrid process was comparable mg l basis and superior mmol l basis than that of the conventional swro process from all the above results the fo crystallization ro hybrid process with disodium phosphate and fo 40ds mode was confirmed to be very competitive for seawater desalination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18208,phosphorus p is one of the essential elements needed for global food security however the phosphate life cycle is currently predominantly linear from p rock mining to fertiliser production agriculture and food consumption with the p excess ending up in soil and runoff eutrophication coupled with limited global commercial phosphorus reserves call for increased efforts toward creating a circular economy for p in many populated drainage basins such as the baltic sea region to identify barriers and opportunities for such a transition we employ an analytical framework that merges an innovation systems perspective with elements from the socio technical transitions literature combining a literature review with key informant interviews we find that lack of appropriate policy steering and insufficient knowledge on the performance of technologies for reuse remain key obstacles for closing the p loop there are however structural opportunities presented by the new eu fertilising products regulation that are likely to level the playing field between conventional and waste derived fertilisers and thereby improve the market opportunities for recovered p however the system currently appears to be moving towards a narrow focus on a few new technologies for p recovery and reuse which could lead to new lock ins solutions need to address users acceptability of the technologies and waste derived products while the vision of a circular economy needs to be better articulated through government interventions to capture environmental externalities of phosphate mining the paper further highlights knowledge gaps and proposes recommendations for policy and research related to the circular economy of p keywords agriculture environmental policy innovation nutrient recovery and reuse socio technical transitions wastewater treatment 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential and finite element building the foundation for global food security however the phosphate life cycle is currently predominantly linear from p rock mining to fertiliser production agriculture food consumption and waste with the excess p ending up in soil and runoff haas et al 2015 most of the world s large remaining commercial p rock reserves are in geopolitically sensitive locations and there are significant ca 80 p losses along the entire value chain from mine to fork schröder et al 2011 thus there is a need to transition towards a circular economy closing the p loop a circular economy is characterised by maintaining the value of products materials and resources within the economy for as long as possible and minimizing the generation of waste european commission 2015 it is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design emf 2015 p 2 this approach translated into the management of p implies the recovery of p from waste and further reuse of the recovered products in other sectors including agriculture guest et al 2009 macura et al 2019 peccia and westerhoff 2015 macura et al 2019 circularity however requires a transformation within the nutrient supply and use system putting agriculture reuse at the centre indeed this has been explored for ireland macintosh et al 2019 and north america jacobs et al 2017 in the baltic sea region bsr home to over 90 million people swain 2017 eutrophication is affecting more than 90 of the baltic sea proper due to past and present excessive inputs of nitrogen n and p helcom 2018 n and p are crucial for agriculture but highly problematic when entering water bodies in the bsr the 1900s were characterised by excessive fertiliser use particularly between the 1950s and 1990s svanbäck and mccrackin 2018 despite reductions in chemical fertiliser use over the past 20 25 years agriculture is still the single largest anthropogenic source of nutrients to the baltic sea according to helcom helcom 2015 agriculture is responsible for 70 90 of n and 60 80 of p from diffuse sources making up almost half of the total waterborne nutrient inputs to the baltic sea the current level of eutrophication in the baltic sea has resulted in nerve toxic algal blooms reduced water clarity altered species composition and reduced oxygen concentrations in bottom waters svanbäck and mccrackin 2016 the baltic sea therefore is one of the most sensitive large open sea systems in the world responding negatively to excessive p and is a prime candidate for a transition towards a circular p economy to our knowledge there is no overview of barriers and opportunities for increased reuse of p focusing strictly on this region the resource limitations surrounding commercial p rock reserves schröder et al 2011 on the one hand and the surplus of p in water streams on the other constitute economic and political incentives for p recovery and reuse indeed advanced extraction of p from waste products is predicted to be able to competitively substitute within the eu by 2030 up to 30 of the p currently derived from p rock tonini et al 2019 sewage sludge and animal manure are significant sources of p that can be returned to agriculture powers et al 2019 tonini et al 2019 recovery and reuse of p is not only fundamental for closing the p loop but also for improving the environmental performance of food systems including the solid and liquid waste systems from farms food processing and urban wastewater systems in addition by optimizing the use of fertilisers and animal manure on croplands and re utilising legacy p stored in soils withers et al 2018 the amounts of p introduced into agriculture can be minimised while maintaining desired agricultural output nevertheless turning p rich waste into a resource is a considerable task it requires a social and technical transition from waste management to resource recovery and circular economy thinking and action this includes substantial changes in systems design food production and consumption reuse technologies and practices market incentives as well as the moral economy that defines the right and wrong ways of shaping the circulation gregson et al 2015 this transition would need to redefine the interplay between technology policy and markets geels 2011 at present notions of circular economy within the eu are captured through the eu s circular economy package launched in 2015 which operates as a concept representing a desired state for a future economy geissler et al 2018 but which lacks proper analysis of what its operationalisation would entail lazarevic and valve 2017 the dynamics between innovations policy structures and markets in circular economies are not well understood and as a response some question if transitions to certain forms of a circular economy should happen at all gregson et al 2015 despite apparent challenges several technologies have been developed to recover p as well as other nutrients and energy from different waste streams haddaway et al 2019a 2019b macura et al 2018 macura et al 2019 some of these technologies are now able to produce p rich products for application in agriculture as fertilisers macura et al 2019 however large scale implementation of these technologies remains scattered with only a few successful examples of full commercialization ohtake and tsuneda 2019 the question remains what is needed to accelerate the transition toward a circular p economy in the baltic sea r egion often the analysis of barriers and opportunities for a circular economy of nutrients is reduced to policy and institutional obstacles winans et al 2017 or the technical feasibility of innovations jedelhauser and binder 2018 however issues related to world views market linkages product development values and attitudes concerning the innovations needed to trigger a transition are less well explored metson et al 2015 this paper analyses the barriers and opportunities affecting development and uptake of innovations for nutrient reuse in the agricultural and wastewater sectors in the bsr with a special focus on p unpacking general assumptions on where the problem lies for closing the loop can provide better insights about possible ways forward and can help motivate the transformation towards a global governance of p rosemarin and ekane 2016 combining key informant interviews and a literature review we assess barriers and opportunities across the system from the generation of p rich material to its markets and subsequent use for food production and consumption 2 methods in this paper we have combined and synthesised findings from two main sources published research and key informant interviews we followed rapid review approaches khangura et al 2014 to conduct searches and eligibility screening of literature within limited resources while remaining procedurally objective repeatable and transparent at all stages of the review process haddaway et al 2015 synthesis of data collected from interviews and literature was conducted using principles of framework synthesis below we described in detail all methodological steps 2 1 search strategy we searched for literature using the web of science core collections woscc and google scholar during september and october 2018 searches were restricted to articles published between 2008 and 2018 table 1 shows the search terms used in the woscc this search combined 3 substrings with the boolean operator and using search terms connected to 1 technology and reuse 2 nutrients and 3 barriers and opportunities as 1 and 2 and 3 this search yielded 6843 results but we downloaded the first 500 records sorted by relevance the following english language search terms were used for google scholar searches conducted on full texts policy regulations instruments barriers recycle reuse nutrients phosphorus carbon as woscc and google scholar have different search facilities search string for google scholar had to be simplified out of 3760 search results the first 70 sorted by relevance were downloaded and extracted as citations 2 2 article screening and study eligibility criteria the search results from woscc and google scholar were combined and downloaded to eppi reviewer 4 thomas et al 2010 where they were screened for eligibility after removal of 5 duplicates at three levels title abstract and full text the following eligibility criteria were applied to all levels of screening 1 setting studies published in english from and relevant to the bsr including denmark estonia finland germany latvia lithuania poland russia and sweden relevant studies without a location were included we included studies describing reuse in the agricultural and wastewater sectors since this scope is part of the bonus return project within which this research was conducted forestry textile and food processing industries were excluded since they were outside of this scope 2 reuse studies on p recovery and reuse studies that focused on p reduction or recovery only were not included 3 outcomes studies that described policy markets or technological barriers and opportunities for p reuse studies that described a technology without mentioning any of the above were excluded cost benefit analyses of abatement measures studies without innovation focus and only on the benefits of reducing eutrophication were excluded 2 3 semi structured key informant interviews to supplement the literature review during october 2018 we interviewed ten experts from within the bsr sweden finland denmark germany as well as the netherlands including innovators in the private and public sector n 4 scientists 4 a representative of a wastewater management group 1 and a farmer 1 these interviewees were selected to represent different geographical and sectoral perspectives the interview guide included questions across the areas of innovation policy and markets including e g policy coherence societal perceptions and awareness of new technologies for reuse of p financing of and markets for technological innovations interviews lasted between 60 and 90 min and were recorded and thereafter summarised summaries of the interviews are in supplementary material 1 and overview of interview questions that guided interviews are in supplementary material 2 2 4 data extraction and synthesis apart from the interview data and after the title abstract and full text screening we included findings from 29 scientific articles reviews and reports in the synthesis see supplementary material 3 for a full list of included literature data synthesis was guided by the framework synthesis approach dixon woods 2011 first we identified an analytical framework weber and rohracher 2012 which merges an innovation systems perspective hekkert and negro 2009 with elements of socio technical transitions geels 2010 2004 we adapted the framework based on the understanding of the study system and refer to it as a multidimensional framework for the analysis of barriers and opportunities table 2 the adapted framework consists of seven analytical dimensions designed to capture barriers and opportunities towards a transition the dimensions include 1 physical financial and institutional structures 2 coordination of processes and system components 3 interactions between actors via exchange of information and resources 4 directionality and common vision 5 actor s capabilities to monitor learn and act upon knowledge 6 their values and worldviews and 7 the system s ability to articulate problems or opportunities anticipate and act upon them second we used the multidimensional framework to extract our data from primary research reviews and interviews all data regardless of source were extracted directly to a spreadsheet and mapped on the seven dimensions of the framework data from primary research were extracted from the results and discussion sections and consisted of study findings reported by authors data from interviews included verbatim quotations or rich summaries from interview notes data were classified as either a barrier or an opportunity third within each analytical dimension data explaining the same or related concepts or issues were grouped into sub themes using an inductive approach this was done for barriers and opportunities separately in several iterations by two researchers in parallel where overlapping or redundant sub themes were removed fourth as a part of the interpretation and final synthesis the sub themes were grouped according to different actors and processes into three overarching themes linking the data more closely to the studied system see results section 3 results we identified barriers and opportunities for development and uptake of innovative technologies to close the p loop in the bsr within the three overarching themes 1 innovations for generating nutrient rich material for reuse 2 markets for the uptake of p rich material and 3 food production and consumption 3 1 innovations for generating nutrient rich material for reuse we identified key barriers and opportunities for innovations that generate nutrient rich material for reuse within four areas 1 capabilities knowledge about the performance of technologies for p recovery and reuse 2 structure lock in effects and slow rate of system change 3 coordination the connection between livestock and crop production systems and 4 directionality policy steering towards nutrient reuse key actors related to the generation of nutrient rich material include wastewater treatment plants that produce sewage sludge and effluent animal farms that produce manure and animal slaughter by products such as meat and bone and innovators that develop and apply technologies for p recovery from waste and develop recovered products such as fertilisers for further reuse the barriers and opportunities are further discussed below a first capability barrier is that the performance of technologies for p reuse across economic agricultural and environmental criteria remains understudied there is a lack of full field trials and longer term tests for p recovery and reuse technologies amann et al 2018 egle et al 2016 melia et al 2017 withers et al 2018 interview 8 for example there is a lack of reliable data on the performance of novel manure processing techniques oster et al 2018 struvite melia et al 2017 and source separation in sanitation and wastewater systems mcconville et al 2017a 2017b robust and integrated assessments of the potential combined impact on the whole p cycle in terms of the amount of phosphate rock saved and benefits to the environment and human health are lacking for many reuse technologies withers et al 2018 in addition there is large variability in levels of p recovery and reuse variations in associated emissions energy demand contaminants in the waste derived product such as heavy metals and obtained co benefits during recovery such as other nutrients and carbon amann et al 2018 egle et al 2016 further as the market for recovered nutrients is still emerging egle et al 2016 large uncertainties remain regarding their price amann et al 2018 egle et al 2016 interview 8 at present many waste derived fertilisers are not competitive on the market given the cost of the recovery process and martinez and pellerin 2016 argue that reducing this cost is probably the main challenge to tackle in coming years there are however opportunities in the sense that several technologies are already established or underway in many places melia et al 2017 this includes struvite and mono incineration which are technologically well developed and already in operation in a number of wwtps egle et al 2016 melia et al 2017 a second directionality barrier is related to the slow rate of change in the system that can support p recovery and create waste derived products the literature and interviewees note that the wastewater sector is characterised by large scale infrastructure with long term investment horizons which create lock in effects fam et al 2010 mcconville et al 2017b interview 9 this lock in also stems from a paradigm that portrays centralized systems as superior and more efficient in comparison to small scale and decentralised systems ashley et al 2011 cordell et al 2011 as a result alternative infrastructure that could support decentralised systems such as source separation is rarely established fam et al 2010 mcconville et al 2017b a key opportunity for more widespread adoption of decentralised and source separating systems is that niche markets exist particularly in sparsely populated areas in rapidly growing cities another niche market is newly constructed housing where the economic burden of changing infrastructure is reduced since source separating solutions can be installed from the outset an additional opportunity for source separating and decentralised solutions is the current ageing infrastructure in many parts of the bsr which may push existing water and sanitation systems towards a turning point and open up for alternative solutions cordell et al 2011 a third coordination barrier is within the agricultural sector where manure is an abundant yet under utilised source of nutrient rich material farm specialisation and geographical mismatch between livestock farms and crop production systems limit the use of manure as a fertiliser and are a cause of n and p surplus in animal husbandry regions martinez and pellerin 2016 an interviewee explained that animal husbandry and crop farms do not cooperate enough to transfer the manure from one site to the other there have been several attempts to create some system to facilitate trade taking stock of manure availability and manure demand despite the availability of new technologies we still cannot get the neighbouring farms to cooperate interview 11 thus the large volumes of generated manure in relation to the available land area remain a major barrier to sustainable nutrient re cycling oster et al 2018 at present the cost of transporting manure is high compared to purchasing and applying conventional fertilisers ehlert and schoumans 2015 other logistical challenges for manure include storage handling and spreading martinez and pellerin 2016 processing manure into products with low water content facilitates transport and can often contribute to waste reduction and energy production from renewable wastes ehlert and schoumans 2015 however only about 8 of all manure generated in the eu is processed and there are simple technologies to reduce volumes and transportation expenses available such as liquid and solid separation or dewatering techniques which constitute a potential opportunity that could offer intermediate levers martinez and pellerin 2016 a fourth and major structural barrier is related to the lack of policy steering for reusing nutrient rich material at the global level the importance of p management was long lacking in food and agriculture policy debates cordell et al 2009 withers et al 2015 the debate on peak phosphorus gained traction around a decade ago and the focus has since broadened to the wider meaning of p stewardship including its environmental health and quality dimensions ulrich 2019 phosphate rock is since 2014 officially listed by the eu as a critical raw material because of the eu s high dependency on foreign sources of phosphate and the need to secure sovereign sources for instance through recycling european commission 2017 growing awareness of the p dependency issue and in particular its geopolitical significance is recognised as an opportunity that could drive further policy changes ashley et al 2011 among the general public however awareness remains low regarding the importance of nutrient management and the environmental impacts associated with dietary preferences i e the high proportion of meat and dairy products in european diets de boer et al 2018 withers et al 2015 at the eu level we find some evidence of directionality opportunities related to the eu s circular economy action plan withers et al 2018 and structural opportunities linked to the recently updated eu fertilising products regulationzing products regulation europees parlement 2018 nättorp et al 2018 withers et al 2018 however interviewees point out that the eu s circular economy vision still needs to be translated into national and local level policies and action at the moment there is no awareness of circular economy approaches there are underlying principles and mental models in society such as the waste management hierarchy this should instead be seen as a resource hierarchy which is a more circular model interview 1 another interviewee further noted that in finland there is some level of policy support for circular approaches but a common vision is lacking there is a big goal towards the circular economy but it is unclear how to achieve it interview 9 most policies relating to p and n management have focused on reducing nutrient loads into receiving water bodies to limit eutrophication rather than on returning the nutrients to productive use dawson and hilton 2011 an informant explains that policies for cleaning point sources have achieved good results particularly to reduce phosphate in wastewater treatment but the aluminium and iron phosphate floc produced in sludge is not easily absorbed by plants so the current system of treating wastewater is not designed with reuse in mind interview 2 the wastewater sector as defined by the eu urban wastewater treatment directive eea 2019 aims primarily to reduce nutrient loads not to produce a well fitted product for the fertiliser market dawson and hilton 2011 de boer et al 2018 cordell et al 2009 further point to a divide between the agriculture sector that views nutrients as a fertiliser commodity and the wastewater sector that views nutrients as pollutants this dichotomy hinders circular and integrated solutions since reuse solutions typically require collaboration across sectors and since several technologies are often needed for producing a final nutrient rich reuse product carraresi et al 2018 carraresi et al 2018 identify a lack of access to appropriate networks among actors along the value chain since most nutrient recovery technologies are not yet scaled up and value chains are only emerging further they state that the greatest challenge for firms to overcome is represented by the mutual dependence of different technologies involved carraresi et al 2018 p 93 there is a need for bridging actors that can connect across the wastewater and agriculture sectors interview 7 as well as new business models that involve novel combinations of actors carraresi et al 2018 novel circular business models may however be met with internal resistance within companies interview 1 or require high levels of trust among cooperating partners interview 9 lack of appropriate policy steering for nutrient reuse has hindered technology development and commercialisation mcconville et al 2017a nättorp et al 2018 interviews 1 and 8 however the introduction of new legislation in switzerland and germany is perceived as an opportunity to innovate as they provide long term strategies for p management and include targets for p recovery as well as a ban on agricultural use of raw sludge hukari et al 2016 denmark and sweden have set more general targets for recycling of nutrients in sludge and other wastes nättorp et al 2018 although sweden is also investigating the introduction of similar legislation as germany a swedish informant explains that the clarity provided by the german legislation is an important market driver it was a door opener when germany introduced new legislation in 2017 the new german legislation creates a tech race where the private sector competes to come up with an attractive technology for wastewater treatment plants interview 1 while the legislation that germany has introduced roskosch and heidecke 2018 provides a clear direction and may generate new business opportunities others point out that this legislation poses new risks since it seems to promote a single type of technology i e mono incineration followed by phosphoric acid production that requires large infrastructural investments has high energy demand leases greenhouse gas emissions and does not recover n and carbon interviews 6 and 8 3 2 markets for the uptake of p rich material this section reviews barriers and opportunities related to the market for the uptake of p rich material originating from the wastewater and agricultural sectors and identifies several key barriers and opportunities related to 1 structure the legal recognition of reuse products 2 interactions the uneven playing field between reuse and conventional fertilisers and 3 articulation the price of phosphate ore key actors include the fertiliser industry as well as innovators who seek to act as intermediaries between e g wastewater treatment plants and farms there are several target sectors for recycled p including high tech industries nättorp et al 2018 however for the bulk of recycled p rich material a primary market is the fertiliser industry by fertiliser industry we refer to any actor producing any type of fertiliser whether conventional or derived from recovered nutrients regarding the first structure barrier nutrient rich products originating from wastewater treatment processes have traditionally been treated as waste for which transport and trade are strictly regulated by the eu waste framework directive to lift the status of waste and allow its possible reuse a product needs to fulfil a range of end of waste criteria in the case of recovered nutrients and their reuse as fertilisers the fulfilment of the technical requirements of the fertilisers regulation or national fertiliser acts is necessary the fertilisers regulation of the eu sets requirements on fertilisers regarding environmental and human health impacts if fertilisers meet all requirements they can be labelled as ce fertilisers i e safe and effective fertilisers on the eu market this label significantly improves a fertiliser s marketing position since only labelled fertilisers can be traded freely in the eu de boer et al 2018 ehlert and schoumans 2015 however the fertilisers regulations have traditionally only regulated primary mineral compounds de boer et al 2018 ehlert and schoumans 2015 interview 8 the revised eu fertilising products regulation adopted by the european council in 2019 is expected to bring waste derived fertilisers onboard and grant access to the ce label which constitutes an important opportunity as it will significantly improve the market position of many waste derived fertiliser products europees parlement 2018 withers et al 2018 for products where end of waste criteria are lacking at the eu level member states have national regulations in place which are difficult costly and time consuming for producers of reuse products to comply with de boer et al 2018 hukari et al 2016 the eu sewage sludge directive 86 278 eec dates back to 1986 and countries have since developed diverging national policies most wastewater treatment plants are formally classified as waste management facilities and to gain status as fertiliser producer extra permits and new installations are needed which translate into increased costs registering a new fertiliser type can take up to 7 years and wastewater treatment plants consequently often choose to sell recovered nutrients as waste instead of turning them into fertilisers de boer et al 2018 further actors working in the nutrient recovery and reuse sector e g wastewater treatment plants innovators farmers have to navigate a complex set of policies including the nitrates directive the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulation reach the fertiliser regulation the animal by products regulations and the waste framework directive ehlert and schoumans 2015 as further explained below recovery and reuse actors are a heterogeneous group that is challenging to regulate effectively hukari et al 2016 producers and importers of recovered nutrient products need to register their product with reach which is a costly and lengthy administrative process that they are currently not well organised to handle whereas conventional fertiliser products are jointly registered by the fertiliser industry ehlert and schoumans 2015 currently fertilisers from recovered p cannot either be used in organic agriculture according to the eu s organic farming regulation the second interactions barrier relates to the uneven playing field between waste derived and conventional fertilisers due to existing legislation waste derived products are often more variable in their composition and production processes which would require more flexible regulations ehlert and schoumans 2015 the eu s ec label requires highly concentrated products and quite often fertilisers recovered from waste cannot meet the minimum requirements ehlert and schoumans 2015 further the eu nitrates directive limits the use of animal manure including processed products on agricultural land to a maximum of 170 kg n per ha per year whereas application of conventional fertilisers does not have a strict upper limit ehlert and schoumans 2015 oster et al 2018 further the eu fertilisers regulation contains strict requirements on certain heavy metals which are found in relatively high concentrations in some waste derived products such as sewage sludge ash egle et al 2015 meanwhile cadmium which is found in higher concentrations in many conventional fertilisers and other p rich products originated from p rock mining has remained unregulated at the eu level in spite of its toxicity ulrich 2019 the revised eu fertilizing products regulation does not include stringent reductions in fertiliser cadmium content over time europees parlement 2018 gilbert 2018 in line with requests put forth by the fertiliser industry de ridder et al 2012 interviews 2 and 8 the third articulation barrier concerns the low market price of conventional fertiliser which has contributed to the low profitability of waste derived products on the market carraresi et al 2018 de boer et al 2018 interviews 2 9 and 11 a combination of rising demand for phosphate shrinking reserves and poorer quality of the remaining reserves with increasing extraction costs as a result makes it likely for the price of phosphate and phosphate fertilisers to increase in the future cooper et al 2011 cordell et al 2009 rittmann et al 2011 this may constitute an opportunity for waste derived fertiliser products to increase their competitiveness nonetheless the literature identifies a need for regulatory forcing melia et al 2017 nättorp et al 2018 withers et al 2015 to enable reuse products to compete with conventional fertilisers withers et al 2015 note that environmental externalities related to the production of conventional fertilisers are largely unaccounted for which can motivate either governmental subsidies of waste derived fertiliser products or taxation on conventional fertiliser products to increase incentives for reuse carraresi et al 2018 highlight the need to explore the possibility of involving governments in sustainable public procurement to base contract terms on value for money which capture environmental externalities rather than on price per unit 3 3 food production and consumption this section reviews barriers and opportunities for p reuse linked to food production processing retailing and consumption the literature highlights barriers associated with values including 1 farmer acceptability and ease in using reuse products and 2 social acceptability of sewage sludge derived products key actors include farmers food processing industry the food retailing industry and food consumers farmers and the fertiliser industry require a constant and predictable product with at least as high quality as the current option in terms of nutrient content and n p ratio de boer et al 2018 ehlert and schoumans 2015 lupton 2017 martinez and pellerin 2016 the nutrient content of animal manure is for instance highly variable since it is influenced by animal age and diet as well as by manure processing storage and spreading conditions martinez and pellerin 2016 similarly the fertiliser industry is vulnerable to the varying quality of sewage sludge ash egle et al 2015 and p rich reuse products only work for certain fertiliser mixes interview 8 recent evidence also suggests that the low use of organic waste fertilisers among danish farmers is partly due to low availability case et al 2017 shortage of organic fertilisers is in turn due to the lack of waste processing facilities to reduce bulk weight and volume while increasing stability nutrient content and availability as well as insufficient distribution systems to transport processed waste derived fertilisers to farmers case et al 2017 increased production volumes and a guaranteed steady supply are critical factors to make waste derived fertilisers more attractive to the fertiliser industry and farmers carraresi et al 2018 de boer et al 2018 standardisation and benchmarking across parameters such as consistency safety fertiliser substitution value and added value benefits e g cadmium and other nutrient elements will in many cases also be needed simha and ganesapillai 2017 withers et al 2015 another factor related to farmer acceptability is the issue of fertiliser solubility and availability of nutrients to plants withers et al 2018 here the literature presents mixed results conventional p fertiliser can be more directly plant available than p in most waste derived fertilisers linderholm et al 2012 de boer et al 2018 highlight that struvite is less soluble in water than conventional fertilisers making it a slow release fertiliser which means that the nutrients are only gradually available for crops however studies on the combined use of struvite and conventional fertilisers have shown increased p efficiency and plant uptake de boer et al 2018 and schröder et al 2011 p 826 note that there is often a misleading perception among farmers that p from a purchased bag of mineral fertiliser is more available to crops than p from organic resources such as manures and other residues withers et al 2018 note that technologies that can increase the cost effectiveness of their use by maximising the plant available p in marketable products are likely to be most acceptable to the farming industry in the danish context farmers state that main barriers towards increased use of waste derived fertiliser are odour nuisance ranked highest uncertainty in nutrient content and increased difficulty in planning for waste derived fertiliser compared with conventional fertilisers case et al 2017 for sludge and sludge derived products social acceptability is a key barrier which can be traced back to a general cognitive barrier of using human excreta for agricultural production cordell et al 2011 further there are known and perceived risks of contamination from e g heavy metals and pathogens making farmers reluctant towards using raw sludge as a fertiliser martinez and pellerin 2016 mcconville et al 2017a in sweden farmers who want to certify their production according to the swedish seal of quality are not allowed to use raw sewage sludge some municipalities have banned application of sewage sludge on fields linderholm et al 2012 and several major food processing companies and flour mills do not accept grains that have been fertilised with sludge interview 8 in switzerland and germany among other countries perceived risks have forced the national authorities to ban the use of raw sludge on croplands this context therefore can drive a need to find effective ways of safely recovering p in treated forms 4 discussion here we discuss the implications of the results for barriers and opportunities through the lens of the multidimensional framework fig 1 following the implications we outline methodological limitations as well as the identified knowledge gaps our results have shown that reuse actors such as wastewater treatment plants innovators and farmers continue to face several barriers we found strong lock in effects linked to the size investment cost and time horizon of wastewater infrastructure these lock in effects represent structural barriers for reuse actors who seek to produce commercialise and apply waste derived fertilisers and which slow down the pace of change further despite some positive developments structures such as policies for nutrient reuse remain few policies such as the eu fertiliser regulations and waste framework directive have so far hindered marketing and trade of waste derived fertiliser and have created an administrative and economic burden for reuse actors as a result many reuse actors struggle to compete with conventional fertilisers here the recent revision of the eu fertilising products regulation which will for the first time regulate organic and waste derived fertilisers constitutes an important opportunity that will probably level the playing field between conventional and waste derived fertilisers coupled with more harmonised national regulations across the eu the expectation is that market interactions will improve which in turn will help position waste derived fertiliser products europees parlement 2018 withers et al 2018 we identify a need to establish better coordination mechanisms to improve the utilization of existing nutrients coupled with the promotion of new and existing manure processing technologies furthermore there are signs of increasing directionality through national legislation in germany and switzerland that attempt to close the p loop and reduce dependence on p imports roskosch and heidecke 2018 however there is a risk that such policies if too narrowly focused on single technologies and specifically on technologies that require large scale infrastructural investments could lead to a new system lock in with low flexibility and little room for developing alternative solutions including more systemic and integrated technologies that recover a wider range of resources including other nutrients carbon and energy harmonising policies across different types of resources is important to ensure that certain types of reuse that may be appropriate in a given context are not hindered or that types of reuse that may be less appropriate in other contexts are indiscriminately supported despite the overall vision i e directionality of a circular economy set by the eu s circular economy action plan and the incorporation of p on the eu s list of critical resources we identify a lack of articulation due to a failure to incorporate commercial p rock limitation and environmental externalities in price setting and certification schemes regulatory forcing in the form of subsidies on waste derived fertiliser or increased taxation of conventional fertilisers is still needed melia et al 2017 nättorp et al 2018 withers et al 2015 such regulatory forcing could be further motivated by the geopolitical importance of p and its key role for agricultural production and food security here sustainable procurement can provide opportunities for circular solutions without necessarily changing regulations drastically new promising technologies are emerging but associated capabilities such as full field trials and reliable data on performance are still lacking furthermore values including farmer acceptability towards new products need to be addressed in product design and business plans to be attractive to farmers waste derived products need to be similar in application be as effective and or provide additional benefits compared to conventional fertilisers while maintaining a competitive price contamination concerns linked to the use of sewage sludge are in switzerland and germany mitigated through incineration and then extraction of phosphoric acid kirchmann et al 2017 this together with stipulated high capture levels will create changes in the design of wastewater treatment systems as well as in the business of reuse of materials from waste products 4 1 limitations and knowledge gaps we searched for literature published between 2008 and 2018 in english and focusing on the bsr the study covered a relatively limited sample of the relevant literature but given the detailed description of methodological steps provided in the methods section the evidence base could be easily updated and extended specifically with more grey and non english literature the included studies were treated equally in terms of their internal validity e g methodological rigour and susceptibility to bias additionally we have focused solely on p reuse knowing at the same time that barriers and opportunities for reuse of other nutrients carbon energy and water are equally important for devising a policy to address the root causes of eutrophication and the high dependency of agriculture on external inputs of fertiliser in the bsr furthermore apart from reuse we acknowledge that there is a need to reduce p demand increase efficiency and reduce waste across all stages of the production chain from p mining to use of p as a fertiliser in agriculture reducing food consumption and waste and similar factors that affect the prospects of innovations to deal with the excess nutrient application food preferences and hence nutrient demand and farm structures as well as contaminants in wastewater products are outside the scope of this paper additionally several questions related to interactions remain to be answered for instance it is unclear what happens and who is responsible for sewage sludge when it exits a wastewater treatment plant and enters the recovery process chain failure to clarify these issues could lead to uncertainty in the final product as farmers and consumers do not know all the characteristics and health and environmental risks related to the land application of these waste derived fertilisers lupton 2017 shared uncertainty related to substances contained in waste derived fertilisers and their potential impacts is a key factor in understanding major controversies in europe on the legitimacy of applying sewage sludge and derived products on lands there are also other questions related to coordination and structures that need further attention for instance it is not yet clear which actors are responsible for nutrient recovery is it the producer of the sludge or the incineration plant who owns the p after the recovery process how can recovery processes be financed should the costs be absorbed by consumers the public budget or industry who should invest in recovery technologies who should take the risk tendering which is required when a new infrastructure in cities is implemented is costly and risky particularly when involving innovations for which benchmarks do not yet exist in addition changing the resource produced by the technology into a product requires market mechanisms in a field where a mature market does not yet exist this raises a further question how to develop or design regulations and support the development of viable business models that foster nutrient recovery and reuse back into agriculture how to design such regulations while avoiding system lock ins addressing the above questions is beyond the immediate scope of this paper however recent developments in germany and switzerland and the ongoing government sludge enquiry in sweden ministry of environment of sweden 2018 will hopefully address some of the identified gaps and lead to innovative solutions among the many stakeholders 5 conclusions this paper has identified barriers and opportunities towards a circular p economy with a focus on the wastewater and agriculture sectors in the bsr we find that recent policy and technology developments have provided new opportunities and there are signs that the system is heading towards increased reuse however it is important to acknowledge that new reuse policies may cause lock in effects by favouring certain types of technologies and risk solving one problem at the expense of another furthermore we find key barriers across the entire system from the generation of phosphorus rich material to market uptake and use for food production and consumption which hamper a transition towards more circular thinking reuse products struggle to compete with the established standards in the wastewater and agriculture sectors in this light we provide some broad recommendations for researchers and decision makers for moving towards a circular economy of p in the bsr 1 shifting mindsets away from take make dispose and more towards reduce reuse recycle recover continuing efforts are necessary to simplify the legal framework for reuse p products particularly at the eu level 2 changing farm structures to more diverse and integrated farming systems that allow for more efficient use of manure and other nutrient sources in agriculture svanbäck and mccrackin 2018 at present large specialised farms are favoured by the eu common agricultural policy guiomar et al 2018 but a better understanding of the role that small or medium farms could play for reuse of p is necessary relatedly a comprehensive assessment of agricultural practices with a focus on how p and other nutrients are currently used in food systems is needed to help reduce the use of nutrients 3 new circular business models with increased collaboration between wastewater treatment plants source of reuse p fertiliser industry potential user of recycled p and farmers potential end user is a necessity for a circular p economy business models need to better capture the process that p will go through after recovery in wastewater treatment plants to prevent uncertainty in sludge composition and potential market failures one starting point towards this end is to clarify roles and responsibilities for the process of recovery including the sharing of costs risks and investments furthermore more knowledge on product development and not only on technical development is crucial for addressing user values and to ensure that reused p applications are user friendly and competitive against standard products on the market 4 government interventions to ensure a fair p price that reflects health and environmental impacts from p mining should be established mayer et al 2016 government intervention in the form of subsidies or taxation is further motivated by the geopolitical and food security significance of phosphorus 5 new technology lock ins can be avoided by considering their systemic impacts by considering multiple benefits and trade offs across additional parameters including other nutrients carbon water and energy we might be better placed to avoid solving one environmental problem at the expense of another flexibility in legislation is necessary to avoid crowding out promising and locally appropriate solutions with one size fits all solutions 6 implementation capacity needs to be increased at national and local government levels to translate the circular economy vision to the local level of implementation municipalities need to create clearer guidelines and requirements for entrepreneurs regarding prioritised technologies and development paths while at the same time making it easier for circular innovations to succeed for instance sustainable procurement of new technologies and services could be used more actively to capture value including environmental externalities and not only price 7 alternative solutions such as source separation should be supported to enable reuse of multiple resources nutrients organic matter water energy this would require investment in different infrastructure and a long term policy commitment for closing the p loop but could be feasible in newly developed housing projects such as h in helsingborg sweden 8 improvement is necessary in the interactions between the wastewater and agriculture sectors as well as between crop and livestock farms bridging actors and umbrella organisations may be needed to increase the adoption of innovative solutions and allow new value chains to emerge

18208,phosphorus p is one of the essential elements needed for global food security however the phosphate life cycle is currently predominantly linear from p rock mining to fertiliser production agriculture and food consumption with the p excess ending up in soil and runoff eutrophication coupled with limited global commercial phosphorus reserves call for increased efforts toward creating a circular economy for p in many populated drainage basins such as the baltic sea region to identify barriers and opportunities for such a transition we employ an analytical framework that merges an innovation systems perspective with elements from the socio technical transitions literature combining a literature review with key informant interviews we find that lack of appropriate policy steering and insufficient knowledge on the performance of technologies for reuse remain key obstacles for closing the p loop there are however structural opportunities presented by the new eu fertilising products regulation that are likely to level the playing field between conventional and waste derived fertilisers and thereby improve the market opportunities for recovered p however the system currently appears to be moving towards a narrow focus on a few new technologies for p recovery and reuse which could lead to new lock ins solutions need to address users acceptability of the technologies and waste derived products while the vision of a circular economy needs to be better articulated through government interventions to capture environmental externalities of phosphate mining the paper further highlights knowledge gaps and proposes recommendations for policy and research related to the circular economy of p keywords agriculture environmental policy innovation nutrient recovery and reuse socio technical transitions wastewater treatment 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential and finite element building the foundation for global food security however the phosphate life cycle is currently predominantly linear from p rock mining to fertiliser production agriculture food consumption and waste with the excess p ending up in soil and runoff haas et al 2015 most of the world s large remaining commercial p rock reserves are in geopolitically sensitive locations and there are significant ca 80 p losses along the entire value chain from mine to fork schröder et al 2011 thus there is a need to transition towards a circular economy closing the p loop a circular economy is characterised by maintaining the value of products materials and resources within the economy for as long as possible and minimizing the generation of waste european commission 2015 it is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design emf 2015 p 2 this approach translated into the management of p implies the recovery of p from waste and further reuse of the recovered products in other sectors including agriculture guest et al 2009 macura et al 2019 peccia and westerhoff 2015 macura et al 2019 circularity however requires a transformation within the nutrient supply and use system putting agriculture reuse at the centre indeed this has been explored for ireland macintosh et al 2019 and north america jacobs et al 2017 in the baltic sea region bsr home to over 90 million people swain 2017 eutrophication is affecting more than 90 of the baltic sea proper due to past and present excessive inputs of nitrogen n and p helcom 2018 n and p are crucial for agriculture but highly problematic when entering water bodies in the bsr the 1900s were characterised by excessive fertiliser use particularly between the 1950s and 1990s svanbäck and mccrackin 2018 despite reductions in chemical fertiliser use over the past 20 25 years agriculture is still the single largest anthropogenic source of nutrients to the baltic sea according to helcom helcom 2015 agriculture is responsible for 70 90 of n and 60 80 of p from diffuse sources making up almost half of the total waterborne nutrient inputs to the baltic sea the current level of eutrophication in the baltic sea has resulted in nerve toxic algal blooms reduced water clarity altered species composition and reduced oxygen concentrations in bottom waters svanbäck and mccrackin 2016 the baltic sea therefore is one of the most sensitive large open sea systems in the world responding negatively to excessive p and is a prime candidate for a transition towards a circular p economy to our knowledge there is no overview of barriers and opportunities for increased reuse of p focusing strictly on this region the resource limitations surrounding commercial p rock reserves schröder et al 2011 on the one hand and the surplus of p in water streams on the other constitute economic and political incentives for p recovery and reuse indeed advanced extraction of p from waste products is predicted to be able to competitively substitute within the eu by 2030 up to 30 of the p currently derived from p rock tonini et al 2019 sewage sludge and animal manure are significant sources of p that can be returned to agriculture powers et al 2019 tonini et al 2019 recovery and reuse of p is not only fundamental for closing the p loop but also for improving the environmental performance of food systems including the solid and liquid waste systems from farms food processing and urban wastewater systems in addition by optimizing the use of fertilisers and animal manure on croplands and re utilising legacy p stored in soils withers et al 2018 the amounts of p introduced into agriculture can be minimised while maintaining desired agricultural output nevertheless turning p rich waste into a resource is a considerable task it requires a social and technical transition from waste management to resource recovery and circular economy thinking and action this includes substantial changes in systems design food production and consumption reuse technologies and practices market incentives as well as the moral economy that defines the right and wrong ways of shaping the circulation gregson et al 2015 this transition would need to redefine the interplay between technology policy and markets geels 2011 at present notions of circular economy within the eu are captured through the eu s circular economy package launched in 2015 which operates as a concept representing a desired state for a future economy geissler et al 2018 but which lacks proper analysis of what its operationalisation would entail lazarevic and valve 2017 the dynamics between innovations policy structures and markets in circular economies are not well understood and as a response some question if transitions to certain forms of a circular economy should happen at all gregson et al 2015 despite apparent challenges several technologies have been developed to recover p as well as other nutrients and energy from different waste streams haddaway et al 2019a 2019b macura et al 2018 macura et al 2019 some of these technologies are now able to produce p rich products for application in agriculture as fertilisers macura et al 2019 however large scale implementation of these technologies remains scattered with only a few successful examples of full commercialization ohtake and tsuneda 2019 the question remains what is needed to accelerate the transition toward a circular p economy in the baltic sea r egion often the analysis of barriers and opportunities for a circular economy of nutrients is reduced to policy and institutional obstacles winans et al 2017 or the technical feasibility of innovations jedelhauser and binder 2018 however issues related to world views market linkages product development values and attitudes concerning the innovations needed to trigger a transition are less well explored metson et al 2015 this paper analyses the barriers and opportunities affecting development and uptake of innovations for nutrient reuse in the agricultural and wastewater sectors in the bsr with a special focus on p unpacking general assumptions on where the problem lies for closing the loop can provide better insights about possible ways forward and can help motivate the transformation towards a global governance of p rosemarin and ekane 2016 combining key informant interviews and a literature review we assess barriers and opportunities across the system from the generation of p rich material to its markets and subsequent use for food production and consumption 2 methods in this paper we have combined and synthesised findings from two main sources published research and key informant interviews we followed rapid review approaches khangura et al 2014 to conduct searches and eligibility screening of literature within limited resources while remaining procedurally objective repeatable and transparent at all stages of the review process haddaway et al 2015 synthesis of data collected from interviews and literature was conducted using principles of framework synthesis below we described in detail all methodological steps 2 1 search strategy we searched for literature using the web of science core collections woscc and google scholar during september and october 2018 searches were restricted to articles published between 2008 and 2018 table 1 shows the search terms used in the woscc this search combined 3 substrings with the boolean operator and using search terms connected to 1 technology and reuse 2 nutrients and 3 barriers and opportunities as 1 and 2 and 3 this search yielded 6843 results but we downloaded the first 500 records sorted by relevance the following english language search terms were used for google scholar searches conducted on full texts policy regulations instruments barriers recycle reuse nutrients phosphorus carbon as woscc and google scholar have different search facilities search string for google scholar had to be simplified out of 3760 search results the first 70 sorted by relevance were downloaded and extracted as citations 2 2 article screening and study eligibility criteria the search results from woscc and google scholar were combined and downloaded to eppi reviewer 4 thomas et al 2010 where they were screened for eligibility after removal of 5 duplicates at three levels title abstract and full text the following eligibility criteria were applied to all levels of screening 1 setting studies published in english from and relevant to the bsr including denmark estonia finland germany latvia lithuania poland russia and sweden relevant studies without a location were included we included studies describing reuse in the agricultural and wastewater sectors since this scope is part of the bonus return project within which this research was conducted forestry textile and food processing industries were excluded since they were outside of this scope 2 reuse studies on p recovery and reuse studies that focused on p reduction or recovery only were not included 3 outcomes studies that described policy markets or technological barriers and opportunities for p reuse studies that described a technology without mentioning any of the above were excluded cost benefit analyses of abatement measures studies without innovation focus and only on the benefits of reducing eutrophication were excluded 2 3 semi structured key informant interviews to supplement the literature review during october 2018 we interviewed ten experts from within the bsr sweden finland denmark germany as well as the netherlands including innovators in the private and public sector n 4 scientists 4 a representative of a wastewater management group 1 and a farmer 1 these interviewees were selected to represent different geographical and sectoral perspectives the interview guide included questions across the areas of innovation policy and markets including e g policy coherence societal perceptions and awareness of new technologies for reuse of p financing of and markets for technological innovations interviews lasted between 60 and 90 min and were recorded and thereafter summarised summaries of the interviews are in supplementary material 1 and overview of interview questions that guided interviews are in supplementary material 2 2 4 data extraction and synthesis apart from the interview data and after the title abstract and full text screening we included findings from 29 scientific articles reviews and reports in the synthesis see supplementary material 3 for a full list of included literature data synthesis was guided by the framework synthesis approach dixon woods 2011 first we identified an analytical framework weber and rohracher 2012 which merges an innovation systems perspective hekkert and negro 2009 with elements of socio technical transitions geels 2010 2004 we adapted the framework based on the understanding of the study system and refer to it as a multidimensional framework for the analysis of barriers and opportunities table 2 the adapted framework consists of seven analytical dimensions designed to capture barriers and opportunities towards a transition the dimensions include 1 physical financial and institutional structures 2 coordination of processes and system components 3 interactions between actors via exchange of information and resources 4 directionality and common vision 5 actor s capabilities to monitor learn and act upon knowledge 6 their values and worldviews and 7 the system s ability to articulate problems or opportunities anticipate and act upon them second we used the multidimensional framework to extract our data from primary research reviews and interviews all data regardless of source were extracted directly to a spreadsheet and mapped on the seven dimensions of the framework data from primary research were extracted from the results and discussion sections and consisted of study findings reported by authors data from interviews included verbatim quotations or rich summaries from interview notes data were classified as either a barrier or an opportunity third within each analytical dimension data explaining the same or related concepts or issues were grouped into sub themes using an inductive approach this was done for barriers and opportunities separately in several iterations by two researchers in parallel where overlapping or redundant sub themes were removed fourth as a part of the interpretation and final synthesis the sub themes were grouped according to different actors and processes into three overarching themes linking the data more closely to the studied system see results section 3 results we identified barriers and opportunities for development and uptake of innovative technologies to close the p loop in the bsr within the three overarching themes 1 innovations for generating nutrient rich material for reuse 2 markets for the uptake of p rich material and 3 food production and consumption 3 1 innovations for generating nutrient rich material for reuse we identified key barriers and opportunities for innovations that generate nutrient rich material for reuse within four areas 1 capabilities knowledge about the performance of technologies for p recovery and reuse 2 structure lock in effects and slow rate of system change 3 coordination the connection between livestock and crop production systems and 4 directionality policy steering towards nutrient reuse key actors related to the generation of nutrient rich material include wastewater treatment plants that produce sewage sludge and effluent animal farms that produce manure and animal slaughter by products such as meat and bone and innovators that develop and apply technologies for p recovery from waste and develop recovered products such as fertilisers for further reuse the barriers and opportunities are further discussed below a first capability barrier is that the performance of technologies for p reuse across economic agricultural and environmental criteria remains understudied there is a lack of full field trials and longer term tests for p recovery and reuse technologies amann et al 2018 egle et al 2016 melia et al 2017 withers et al 2018 interview 8 for example there is a lack of reliable data on the performance of novel manure processing techniques oster et al 2018 struvite melia et al 2017 and source separation in sanitation and wastewater systems mcconville et al 2017a 2017b robust and integrated assessments of the potential combined impact on the whole p cycle in terms of the amount of phosphate rock saved and benefits to the environment and human health are lacking for many reuse technologies withers et al 2018 in addition there is large variability in levels of p recovery and reuse variations in associated emissions energy demand contaminants in the waste derived product such as heavy metals and obtained co benefits during recovery such as other nutrients and carbon amann et al 2018 egle et al 2016 further as the market for recovered nutrients is still emerging egle et al 2016 large uncertainties remain regarding their price amann et al 2018 egle et al 2016 interview 8 at present many waste derived fertilisers are not competitive on the market given the cost of the recovery process and martinez and pellerin 2016 argue that reducing this cost is probably the main challenge to tackle in coming years there are however opportunities in the sense that several technologies are already established or underway in many places melia et al 2017 this includes struvite and mono incineration which are technologically well developed and already in operation in a number of wwtps egle et al 2016 melia et al 2017 a second directionality barrier is related to the slow rate of change in the system that can support p recovery and create waste derived products the literature and interviewees note that the wastewater sector is characterised by large scale infrastructure with long term investment horizons which create lock in effects fam et al 2010 mcconville et al 2017b interview 9 this lock in also stems from a paradigm that portrays centralized systems as superior and more efficient in comparison to small scale and decentralised systems ashley et al 2011 cordell et al 2011 as a result alternative infrastructure that could support decentralised systems such as source separation is rarely established fam et al 2010 mcconville et al 2017b a key opportunity for more widespread adoption of decentralised and source separating systems is that niche markets exist particularly in sparsely populated areas in rapidly growing cities another niche market is newly constructed housing where the economic burden of changing infrastructure is reduced since source separating solutions can be installed from the outset an additional opportunity for source separating and decentralised solutions is the current ageing infrastructure in many parts of the bsr which may push existing water and sanitation systems towards a turning point and open up for alternative solutions cordell et al 2011 a third coordination barrier is within the agricultural sector where manure is an abundant yet under utilised source of nutrient rich material farm specialisation and geographical mismatch between livestock farms and crop production systems limit the use of manure as a fertiliser and are a cause of n and p surplus in animal husbandry regions martinez and pellerin 2016 an interviewee explained that animal husbandry and crop farms do not cooperate enough to transfer the manure from one site to the other there have been several attempts to create some system to facilitate trade taking stock of manure availability and manure demand despite the availability of new technologies we still cannot get the neighbouring farms to cooperate interview 11 thus the large volumes of generated manure in relation to the available land area remain a major barrier to sustainable nutrient re cycling oster et al 2018 at present the cost of transporting manure is high compared to purchasing and applying conventional fertilisers ehlert and schoumans 2015 other logistical challenges for manure include storage handling and spreading martinez and pellerin 2016 processing manure into products with low water content facilitates transport and can often contribute to waste reduction and energy production from renewable wastes ehlert and schoumans 2015 however only about 8 of all manure generated in the eu is processed and there are simple technologies to reduce volumes and transportation expenses available such as liquid and solid separation or dewatering techniques which constitute a potential opportunity that could offer intermediate levers martinez and pellerin 2016 a fourth and major structural barrier is related to the lack of policy steering for reusing nutrient rich material at the global level the importance of p management was long lacking in food and agriculture policy debates cordell et al 2009 withers et al 2015 the debate on peak phosphorus gained traction around a decade ago and the focus has since broadened to the wider meaning of p stewardship including its environmental health and quality dimensions ulrich 2019 phosphate rock is since 2014 officially listed by the eu as a critical raw material because of the eu s high dependency on foreign sources of phosphate and the need to secure sovereign sources for instance through recycling european commission 2017 growing awareness of the p dependency issue and in particular its geopolitical significance is recognised as an opportunity that could drive further policy changes ashley et al 2011 among the general public however awareness remains low regarding the importance of nutrient management and the environmental impacts associated with dietary preferences i e the high proportion of meat and dairy products in european diets de boer et al 2018 withers et al 2015 at the eu level we find some evidence of directionality opportunities related to the eu s circular economy action plan withers et al 2018 and structural opportunities linked to the recently updated eu fertilising products regulationzing products regulation europees parlement 2018 nättorp et al 2018 withers et al 2018 however interviewees point out that the eu s circular economy vision still needs to be translated into national and local level policies and action at the moment there is no awareness of circular economy approaches there are underlying principles and mental models in society such as the waste management hierarchy this should instead be seen as a resource hierarchy which is a more circular model interview 1 another interviewee further noted that in finland there is some level of policy support for circular approaches but a common vision is lacking there is a big goal towards the circular economy but it is unclear how to achieve it interview 9 most policies relating to p and n management have focused on reducing nutrient loads into receiving water bodies to limit eutrophication rather than on returning the nutrients to productive use dawson and hilton 2011 an informant explains that policies for cleaning point sources have achieved good results particularly to reduce phosphate in wastewater treatment but the aluminium and iron phosphate floc produced in sludge is not easily absorbed by plants so the current system of treating wastewater is not designed with reuse in mind interview 2 the wastewater sector as defined by the eu urban wastewater treatment directive eea 2019 aims primarily to reduce nutrient loads not to produce a well fitted product for the fertiliser market dawson and hilton 2011 de boer et al 2018 cordell et al 2009 further point to a divide between the agriculture sector that views nutrients as a fertiliser commodity and the wastewater sector that views nutrients as pollutants this dichotomy hinders circular and integrated solutions since reuse solutions typically require collaboration across sectors and since several technologies are often needed for producing a final nutrient rich reuse product carraresi et al 2018 carraresi et al 2018 identify a lack of access to appropriate networks among actors along the value chain since most nutrient recovery technologies are not yet scaled up and value chains are only emerging further they state that the greatest challenge for firms to overcome is represented by the mutual dependence of different technologies involved carraresi et al 2018 p 93 there is a need for bridging actors that can connect across the wastewater and agriculture sectors interview 7 as well as new business models that involve novel combinations of actors carraresi et al 2018 novel circular business models may however be met with internal resistance within companies interview 1 or require high levels of trust among cooperating partners interview 9 lack of appropriate policy steering for nutrient reuse has hindered technology development and commercialisation mcconville et al 2017a nättorp et al 2018 interviews 1 and 8 however the introduction of new legislation in switzerland and germany is perceived as an opportunity to innovate as they provide long term strategies for p management and include targets for p recovery as well as a ban on agricultural use of raw sludge hukari et al 2016 denmark and sweden have set more general targets for recycling of nutrients in sludge and other wastes nättorp et al 2018 although sweden is also investigating the introduction of similar legislation as germany a swedish informant explains that the clarity provided by the german legislation is an important market driver it was a door opener when germany introduced new legislation in 2017 the new german legislation creates a tech race where the private sector competes to come up with an attractive technology for wastewater treatment plants interview 1 while the legislation that germany has introduced roskosch and heidecke 2018 provides a clear direction and may generate new business opportunities others point out that this legislation poses new risks since it seems to promote a single type of technology i e mono incineration followed by phosphoric acid production that requires large infrastructural investments has high energy demand leases greenhouse gas emissions and does not recover n and carbon interviews 6 and 8 3 2 markets for the uptake of p rich material this section reviews barriers and opportunities related to the market for the uptake of p rich material originating from the wastewater and agricultural sectors and identifies several key barriers and opportunities related to 1 structure the legal recognition of reuse products 2 interactions the uneven playing field between reuse and conventional fertilisers and 3 articulation the price of phosphate ore key actors include the fertiliser industry as well as innovators who seek to act as intermediaries between e g wastewater treatment plants and farms there are several target sectors for recycled p including high tech industries nättorp et al 2018 however for the bulk of recycled p rich material a primary market is the fertiliser industry by fertiliser industry we refer to any actor producing any type of fertiliser whether conventional or derived from recovered nutrients regarding the first structure barrier nutrient rich products originating from wastewater treatment processes have traditionally been treated as waste for which transport and trade are strictly regulated by the eu waste framework directive to lift the status of waste and allow its possible reuse a product needs to fulfil a range of end of waste criteria in the case of recovered nutrients and their reuse as fertilisers the fulfilment of the technical requirements of the fertilisers regulation or national fertiliser acts is necessary the fertilisers regulation of the eu sets requirements on fertilisers regarding environmental and human health impacts if fertilisers meet all requirements they can be labelled as ce fertilisers i e safe and effective fertilisers on the eu market this label significantly improves a fertiliser s marketing position since only labelled fertilisers can be traded freely in the eu de boer et al 2018 ehlert and schoumans 2015 however the fertilisers regulations have traditionally only regulated primary mineral compounds de boer et al 2018 ehlert and schoumans 2015 interview 8 the revised eu fertilising products regulation adopted by the european council in 2019 is expected to bring waste derived fertilisers onboard and grant access to the ce label which constitutes an important opportunity as it will significantly improve the market position of many waste derived fertiliser products europees parlement 2018 withers et al 2018 for products where end of waste criteria are lacking at the eu level member states have national regulations in place which are difficult costly and time consuming for producers of reuse products to comply with de boer et al 2018 hukari et al 2016 the eu sewage sludge directive 86 278 eec dates back to 1986 and countries have since developed diverging national policies most wastewater treatment plants are formally classified as waste management facilities and to gain status as fertiliser producer extra permits and new installations are needed which translate into increased costs registering a new fertiliser type can take up to 7 years and wastewater treatment plants consequently often choose to sell recovered nutrients as waste instead of turning them into fertilisers de boer et al 2018 further actors working in the nutrient recovery and reuse sector e g wastewater treatment plants innovators farmers have to navigate a complex set of policies including the nitrates directive the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulation reach the fertiliser regulation the animal by products regulations and the waste framework directive ehlert and schoumans 2015 as further explained below recovery and reuse actors are a heterogeneous group that is challenging to regulate effectively hukari et al 2016 producers and importers of recovered nutrient products need to register their product with reach which is a costly and lengthy administrative process that they are currently not well organised to handle whereas conventional fertiliser products are jointly registered by the fertiliser industry ehlert and schoumans 2015 currently fertilisers from recovered p cannot either be used in organic agriculture according to the eu s organic farming regulation the second interactions barrier relates to the uneven playing field between waste derived and conventional fertilisers due to existing legislation waste derived products are often more variable in their composition and production processes which would require more flexible regulations ehlert and schoumans 2015 the eu s ec label requires highly concentrated products and quite often fertilisers recovered from waste cannot meet the minimum requirements ehlert and schoumans 2015 further the eu nitrates directive limits the use of animal manure including processed products on agricultural land to a maximum of 170 kg n per ha per year whereas application of conventional fertilisers does not have a strict upper limit ehlert and schoumans 2015 oster et al 2018 further the eu fertilisers regulation contains strict requirements on certain heavy metals which are found in relatively high concentrations in some waste derived products such as sewage sludge ash egle et al 2015 meanwhile cadmium which is found in higher concentrations in many conventional fertilisers and other p rich products originated from p rock mining has remained unregulated at the eu level in spite of its toxicity ulrich 2019 the revised eu fertilizing products regulation does not include stringent reductions in fertiliser cadmium content over time europees parlement 2018 gilbert 2018 in line with requests put forth by the fertiliser industry de ridder et al 2012 interviews 2 and 8 the third articulation barrier concerns the low market price of conventional fertiliser which has contributed to the low profitability of waste derived products on the market carraresi et al 2018 de boer et al 2018 interviews 2 9 and 11 a combination of rising demand for phosphate shrinking reserves and poorer quality of the remaining reserves with increasing extraction costs as a result makes it likely for the price of phosphate and phosphate fertilisers to increase in the future cooper et al 2011 cordell et al 2009 rittmann et al 2011 this may constitute an opportunity for waste derived fertiliser products to increase their competitiveness nonetheless the literature identifies a need for regulatory forcing melia et al 2017 nättorp et al 2018 withers et al 2015 to enable reuse products to compete with conventional fertilisers withers et al 2015 note that environmental externalities related to the production of conventional fertilisers are largely unaccounted for which can motivate either governmental subsidies of waste derived fertiliser products or taxation on conventional fertiliser products to increase incentives for reuse carraresi et al 2018 highlight the need to explore the possibility of involving governments in sustainable public procurement to base contract terms on value for money which capture environmental externalities rather than on price per unit 3 3 food production and consumption this section reviews barriers and opportunities for p reuse linked to food production processing retailing and consumption the literature highlights barriers associated with values including 1 farmer acceptability and ease in using reuse products and 2 social acceptability of sewage sludge derived products key actors include farmers food processing industry the food retailing industry and food consumers farmers and the fertiliser industry require a constant and predictable product with at least as high quality as the current option in terms of nutrient content and n p ratio de boer et al 2018 ehlert and schoumans 2015 lupton 2017 martinez and pellerin 2016 the nutrient content of animal manure is for instance highly variable since it is influenced by animal age and diet as well as by manure processing storage and spreading conditions martinez and pellerin 2016 similarly the fertiliser industry is vulnerable to the varying quality of sewage sludge ash egle et al 2015 and p rich reuse products only work for certain fertiliser mixes interview 8 recent evidence also suggests that the low use of organic waste fertilisers among danish farmers is partly due to low availability case et al 2017 shortage of organic fertilisers is in turn due to the lack of waste processing facilities to reduce bulk weight and volume while increasing stability nutrient content and availability as well as insufficient distribution systems to transport processed waste derived fertilisers to farmers case et al 2017 increased production volumes and a guaranteed steady supply are critical factors to make waste derived fertilisers more attractive to the fertiliser industry and farmers carraresi et al 2018 de boer et al 2018 standardisation and benchmarking across parameters such as consistency safety fertiliser substitution value and added value benefits e g cadmium and other nutrient elements will in many cases also be needed simha and ganesapillai 2017 withers et al 2015 another factor related to farmer acceptability is the issue of fertiliser solubility and availability of nutrients to plants withers et al 2018 here the literature presents mixed results conventional p fertiliser can be more directly plant available than p in most waste derived fertilisers linderholm et al 2012 de boer et al 2018 highlight that struvite is less soluble in water than conventional fertilisers making it a slow release fertiliser which means that the nutrients are only gradually available for crops however studies on the combined use of struvite and conventional fertilisers have shown increased p efficiency and plant uptake de boer et al 2018 and schröder et al 2011 p 826 note that there is often a misleading perception among farmers that p from a purchased bag of mineral fertiliser is more available to crops than p from organic resources such as manures and other residues withers et al 2018 note that technologies that can increase the cost effectiveness of their use by maximising the plant available p in marketable products are likely to be most acceptable to the farming industry in the danish context farmers state that main barriers towards increased use of waste derived fertiliser are odour nuisance ranked highest uncertainty in nutrient content and increased difficulty in planning for waste derived fertiliser compared with conventional fertilisers case et al 2017 for sludge and sludge derived products social acceptability is a key barrier which can be traced back to a general cognitive barrier of using human excreta for agricultural production cordell et al 2011 further there are known and perceived risks of contamination from e g heavy metals and pathogens making farmers reluctant towards using raw sludge as a fertiliser martinez and pellerin 2016 mcconville et al 2017a in sweden farmers who want to certify their production according to the swedish seal of quality are not allowed to use raw sewage sludge some municipalities have banned application of sewage sludge on fields linderholm et al 2012 and several major food processing companies and flour mills do not accept grains that have been fertilised with sludge interview 8 in switzerland and germany among other countries perceived risks have forced the national authorities to ban the use of raw sludge on croplands this context therefore can drive a need to find effective ways of safely recovering p in treated forms 4 discussion here we discuss the implications of the results for barriers and opportunities through the lens of the multidimensional framework fig 1 following the implications we outline methodological limitations as well as the identified knowledge gaps our results have shown that reuse actors such as wastewater treatment plants innovators and farmers continue to face several barriers we found strong lock in effects linked to the size investment cost and time horizon of wastewater infrastructure these lock in effects represent structural barriers for reuse actors who seek to produce commercialise and apply waste derived fertilisers and which slow down the pace of change further despite some positive developments structures such as policies for nutrient reuse remain few policies such as the eu fertiliser regulations and waste framework directive have so far hindered marketing and trade of waste derived fertiliser and have created an administrative and economic burden for reuse actors as a result many reuse actors struggle to compete with conventional fertilisers here the recent revision of the eu fertilising products regulation which will for the first time regulate organic and waste derived fertilisers constitutes an important opportunity that will probably level the playing field between conventional and waste derived fertilisers coupled with more harmonised national regulations across the eu the expectation is that market interactions will improve which in turn will help position waste derived fertiliser products europees parlement 2018 withers et al 2018 we identify a need to establish better coordination mechanisms to improve the utilization of existing nutrients coupled with the promotion of new and existing manure processing technologies furthermore there are signs of increasing directionality through national legislation in germany and switzerland that attempt to close the p loop and reduce dependence on p imports roskosch and heidecke 2018 however there is a risk that such policies if too narrowly focused on single technologies and specifically on technologies that require large scale infrastructural investments could lead to a new system lock in with low flexibility and little room for developing alternative solutions including more systemic and integrated technologies that recover a wider range of resources including other nutrients carbon and energy harmonising policies across different types of resources is important to ensure that certain types of reuse that may be appropriate in a given context are not hindered or that types of reuse that may be less appropriate in other contexts are indiscriminately supported despite the overall vision i e directionality of a circular economy set by the eu s circular economy action plan and the incorporation of p on the eu s list of critical resources we identify a lack of articulation due to a failure to incorporate commercial p rock limitation and environmental externalities in price setting and certification schemes regulatory forcing in the form of subsidies on waste derived fertiliser or increased taxation of conventional fertilisers is still needed melia et al 2017 nättorp et al 2018 withers et al 2015 such regulatory forcing could be further motivated by the geopolitical importance of p and its key role for agricultural production and food security here sustainable procurement can provide opportunities for circular solutions without necessarily changing regulations drastically new promising technologies are emerging but associated capabilities such as full field trials and reliable data on performance are still lacking furthermore values including farmer acceptability towards new products need to be addressed in product design and business plans to be attractive to farmers waste derived products need to be similar in application be as effective and or provide additional benefits compared to conventional fertilisers while maintaining a competitive price contamination concerns linked to the use of sewage sludge are in switzerland and germany mitigated through incineration and then extraction of phosphoric acid kirchmann et al 2017 this together with stipulated high capture levels will create changes in the design of wastewater treatment systems as well as in the business of reuse of materials from waste products 4 1 limitations and knowledge gaps we searched for literature published between 2008 and 2018 in english and focusing on the bsr the study covered a relatively limited sample of the relevant literature but given the detailed description of methodological steps provided in the methods section the evidence base could be easily updated and extended specifically with more grey and non english literature the included studies were treated equally in terms of their internal validity e g methodological rigour and susceptibility to bias additionally we have focused solely on p reuse knowing at the same time that barriers and opportunities for reuse of other nutrients carbon energy and water are equally important for devising a policy to address the root causes of eutrophication and the high dependency of agriculture on external inputs of fertiliser in the bsr furthermore apart from reuse we acknowledge that there is a need to reduce p demand increase efficiency and reduce waste across all stages of the production chain from p mining to use of p as a fertiliser in agriculture reducing food consumption and waste and similar factors that affect the prospects of innovations to deal with the excess nutrient application food preferences and hence nutrient demand and farm structures as well as contaminants in wastewater products are outside the scope of this paper additionally several questions related to interactions remain to be answered for instance it is unclear what happens and who is responsible for sewage sludge when it exits a wastewater treatment plant and enters the recovery process chain failure to clarify these issues could lead to uncertainty in the final product as farmers and consumers do not know all the characteristics and health and environmental risks related to the land application of these waste derived fertilisers lupton 2017 shared uncertainty related to substances contained in waste derived fertilisers and their potential impacts is a key factor in understanding major controversies in europe on the legitimacy of applying sewage sludge and derived products on lands there are also other questions related to coordination and structures that need further attention for instance it is not yet clear which actors are responsible for nutrient recovery is it the producer of the sludge or the incineration plant who owns the p after the recovery process how can recovery processes be financed should the costs be absorbed by consumers the public budget or industry who should invest in recovery technologies who should take the risk tendering which is required when a new infrastructure in cities is implemented is costly and risky particularly when involving innovations for which benchmarks do not yet exist in addition changing the resource produced by the technology into a product requires market mechanisms in a field where a mature market does not yet exist this raises a further question how to develop or design regulations and support the development of viable business models that foster nutrient recovery and reuse back into agriculture how to design such regulations while avoiding system lock ins addressing the above questions is beyond the immediate scope of this paper however recent developments in germany and switzerland and the ongoing government sludge enquiry in sweden ministry of environment of sweden 2018 will hopefully address some of the identified gaps and lead to innovative solutions among the many stakeholders 5 conclusions this paper has identified barriers and opportunities towards a circular p economy with a focus on the wastewater and agriculture sectors in the bsr we find that recent policy and technology developments have provided new opportunities and there are signs that the system is heading towards increased reuse however it is important to acknowledge that new reuse policies may cause lock in effects by favouring certain types of technologies and risk solving one problem at the expense of another furthermore we find key barriers across the entire system from the generation of phosphorus rich material to market uptake and use for food production and consumption which hamper a transition towards more circular thinking reuse products struggle to compete with the established standards in the wastewater and agriculture sectors in this light we provide some broad recommendations for researchers and decision makers for moving towards a circular economy of p in the bsr 1 shifting mindsets away from take make dispose and more towards reduce reuse recycle recover continuing efforts are necessary to simplify the legal framework for reuse p products particularly at the eu level 2 changing farm structures to more diverse and integrated farming systems that allow for more efficient use of manure and other nutrient sources in agriculture svanbäck and mccrackin 2018 at present large specialised farms are favoured by the eu common agricultural policy guiomar et al 2018 but a better understanding of the role that small or medium farms could play for reuse of p is necessary relatedly a comprehensive assessment of agricultural practices with a focus on how p and other nutrients are currently used in food systems is needed to help reduce the use of nutrients 3 new circular business models with increased collaboration between wastewater treatment plants source of reuse p fertiliser industry potential user of recycled p and farmers potential end user is a necessity for a circular p economy business models need to better capture the process that p will go through after recovery in wastewater treatment plants to prevent uncertainty in sludge composition and potential market failures one starting point towards this end is to clarify roles and responsibilities for the process of recovery including the sharing of costs risks and investments furthermore more knowledge on product development and not only on technical development is crucial for addressing user values and to ensure that reused p applications are user friendly and competitive against standard products on the market 4 government interventions to ensure a fair p price that reflects health and environmental impacts from p mining should be established mayer et al 2016 government intervention in the form of subsidies or taxation is further motivated by the geopolitical and food security significance of phosphorus 5 new technology lock ins can be avoided by considering their systemic impacts by considering multiple benefits and trade offs across additional parameters including other nutrients carbon water and energy we might be better placed to avoid solving one environmental problem at the expense of another flexibility in legislation is necessary to avoid crowding out promising and locally appropriate solutions with one size fits all solutions 6 implementation capacity needs to be increased at national and local government levels to translate the circular economy vision to the local level of implementation municipalities need to create clearer guidelines and requirements for entrepreneurs regarding prioritised technologies and development paths while at the same time making it easier for circular innovations to succeed for instance sustainable procurement of new technologies and services could be used more actively to capture value including environmental externalities and not only price 7 alternative solutions such as source separation should be supported to enable reuse of multiple resources nutrients organic matter water energy this would require investment in different infrastructure and a long term policy commitment for closing the p loop but could be feasible in newly developed housing projects such as h in helsingborg sweden 8 improvement is necessary in the interactions between the wastewater and agriculture sectors as well as between crop and livestock farms bridging actors and umbrella organisations may be needed to increase the adoption of innovative solutions and allow new value chains to emerge

18209,stimulating methanothrix dominant communities with ethanol is recently considered as a promising strategy of improving the efficiency and stability of anaerobic digestion ad while the effects on methanogenic pathway and energy metabolism linked to the establishment of direct interspecies electron transfer diet were not investigated yet the results showed that methanothrix species were the dominant and metabolically active methanogens in the methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products and the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide was significantly higher than that fed with the other products such as propionate and butyrate conversely the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in acetate decarboxylation among all the methanogenic sludge were nearly same in the presence of ethanol the abundance of gene for pila significantly increased the gene for plia was primarily derived from sphaerochaeta sedimentibacter and pseudomonas species that were specially abundant and metabolically active further analysis showed that the abundance of genes that encoded v a type atpase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was 1 3 1 5 folds higher than that fed with the other products as a result the concentration of total atp in the cells was increased by 1 8 2 3 folds these results and the fact that diet is the only electron donor to support the reduction of carbon dioxide in methanothrix species for the first time revealed the mechanisms involved in the establishment of diet based methanogenic metabolism with ethanol graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion direct interspecies electron transfer diet metagenomic analysis methanothrix species ethanol 1 introduction over the past decade a major breakthrough in the understanding of the function of methanogenic communities during anaerobic digestion ad is that methanothrix formerly methanosaeta species are capable of accepting electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane rotaru et al 2014b morita et al 2011 it challenges the long held and acknowledged viewpoint that methanothrix species can only utilize acetate as substrates via acetoclastic pathway smith and ingram smith 2007 analysis of the cell growth gene expression and methane production in defined co cultures of geobacter metallireducens with methanothrix harundinacea rotaru et al 2014b as well as in methanothrix dominant rice paddy soils holmes et al 2017 demonstrated that methanothrix species were active to participate in diet especially when methanothrix species receive some of their energy from diet they grow faster than when acetate is their sole energy source rotaru et al 2014b therefore from the perspective of achieving the effective and stable ad establishing the diet based methanogenic metabolism in methanothrix dominant communities is imperative the diet based methanogenic communities were for the first time observed in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digester treating brewery wastes in which ethanol was the primary substrates morita et al 2011 analysis of the gene transcript abundance in the methanogenic aggregates revealed that methanothrix species were the dominant and most active methanogens and geobacter species accounted for ca 25 of the bacterial communities morita et al 2011 the methanogenic aggregates were electrically conductive with a temperature dependence of metal like conductivity similar to the electrically conductive pili e pili of g sulfurreducens malvankar et al 2011 malvankar and lovley 2014 suggesting that geobacter species proceeded diet with methanothrix species via their e pili discovery of more diet based communities was further explored in some other methanogenic digesters treating various substrates such as fatty acids zhao et al 2016a waste activated sludge was yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 and kitchen wastes dang et al 2016 2017 however up to date in the absence of any amendments the uasb digester treating brewery wastes is still the only ad system in which diet is the predominant working mode of interspecies electron exchange an interesting attempt on syntrophic metabolism of propionate and butyrate via diet was conducted in an uasb digester initially fed with ethanol similar to starting up an uasb digester treating brewery wastes zhao et al 2016b the digester also formed the highly conductive aggregates the conductivity of which was even higher than that of the aggregates in the uasb digester treating brewery wastes morita et al 2011 suggesting that the diet based methanogenic metabolism was established analysis of the communities observed two interesting phenomenons in the stimulation of diet with ethanol 1 the precursors of diet equipped with e pili such as g sulfurreducens g bemidjiensis and g lovleyi were specially enriched 2 methanothrix species might receive more energy to support their growth since their abundance significantly increased by 5 13 however the mechanisms involved in the enrichment of dieters to rapidly establish the electrically connected communities were still yet unknown a confirmed fact was that in the absence of ethanol the diet based methanogenic communities established could be thoroughly replaced by the interspecies hydrogen transfer iht based methanogenic communities zhao et al 2016a from the perspective of permanently establishing the diet based methanogenic metabolism and towards engineering applications a strategy of initially fermenting the polysaccharide rich organic wastes to produce ethanol that were used to stimulate the communities to perform diet was proposed the proof of concept studies were consecutively conducted in some anaerobic digesters treating complex organic wastes such as dairy wastes zhao et al 2017 was zhao et al 2018 and corn straw zhu et al 2019 remarkably the aggregates in an engineering scale uasb digester treating bagasse wastes also presented a surprising potential of diet when the bagasse wastes were initially pretreated under the conditions of ethanol type fermentation zhao and zhang 2019 in all of these studies methanothrix species were dominant and their abundance significantly increased when ethanol appeared in the feedstocks a recent research by calicioglu and brennan 2018 evaluated the energy recovery during ad of duckweed via ethanol type fermentation and demonstrated that it resulted in a higher 51 2 methane yield compared to sole ad and increased the overall energy gain by 70 4 the similar results were also observed in the studies with kitchen wastes wu et al 2015 and oat straw dererie et al 2011 while the effects of ethanol on methane and energy metabolism linked to the establishment of diet based methanogenic metabolism were not further explored under the deeper level the diversity of methanogenic pathways and energy metabolism during ad leads to the question of why dieters like drinking metagenomic analysis offers the means under the gene level to query the physiological status of microorganisms holmes et al 2017 therefore in this study we analyzed the metagenome from bacteria and archaea and compared the abundance of genes involved in methane and energy metabolism in the methanogenic digesters fed with the different fermentation products with the aim to gain the new insight into the mechanisms involved in the establishment of diet based methanogenic communities with ethanol 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge and feedstocks seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss of the seed sludge was 77300 210 mg l mean standard deviation n 3 and 28100 433 mg l respectively the seed sludge was stored under the anaerobic conditions at a temperature of 4 c prior to use kitchen wastes were used as the initial feedstocks the fresh kitchen wastes were collected from a canteen of dalian university of technology dlut and primarily included the rice meat vegetables noodles eggs and oil the tss of the kitchen wastes ranged from 17 3 to 18 9 and the vss accounted for more than 95 of the tss after removing the non biodegradable components like the plastics bones and eggshells the kitchen wastes were homogenized using a pulverizer jiuyang jyl y915 china and diluted to the final tss concentration of about 5 the main characteristics of the kitchen wastes are shown in table s1 see supporting information 2 2 pretreating feedstocks kitchen wastes were pretreated in the four parallel semi continuous completely mixed anaerobic digesters each of which had a working volume of 200 ml referred to as pretreatment digester with the aim of obtaining the acidogenic products with the different fermentation types at the top of each of the pretreatment digesters a stirring rod at a speed of 30 40 rpm connected with an electric motor and a ph monitor were placed into the sludge before pretreatment each of the pretreatment digesters received a 200 ml of the seed sludge the solid retention time srt of all the pretreatment digesters was 5 d namely during each day 40 ml of the pretreated kitchen wastes was extracted out of a pretreatment digester and then 40 ml of the fresh kitchen wastes was injected into the pretreatment digester with a 100 ml syringe all the pretreatment digesters was operated at a temperature of 30 0 c the fermentation phs were maintained at 6 0 6 5 5 0 5 5 and 4 0 4 5 with a 4m naoh solution respectively during the 75 day pretreatment fig s1a during the initial 25 day experiments 6 13 average ph the primary fermentation products were propionate and acetate fig s1b accounting for ca 62 87 of the total products suggesting that the dominant fermentation type was the propionate type fermentation lee et al 2008 when the fermentation phs were kept at 5 0 5 5 over the next 25 day experiments 5 2 average ph fig s1a the content of propionate in the fermentation products significantly declined fig s1b instead the primary products were butyrate and acetate accounting for more than 90 of the total products fig s1b suggesting that the dominant fermentation type was the butyrate type fermentation lee et al 2008 the ethanol type fermentation is characterized by the primary production of ethanol and acetate ren et al 1997 and the obvious ethanol yield was only observed when the fermentation phs were kept at 4 0 4 5 4 32 average ph fig s1b which accounted for ca 50 of the total products remarkably the concentration of total short chain fatty acids scfas and ethanol detected in the ethanol type fermentation products was significantly lower than that in the propionate butyrate type fermentation products suggesting that the acidification efficiencies during the ethanol type fermentation declined 2 3 ad of fermentation products the semi continuous flow experiments were conducted in the four parallel completely mixed anaerobic digesters internal diameter of 100 mm and height of 180 mm each of which had a working volume of 1000 ml referred to as methanogenic digester at the top of each of the methanogenic digesters a stirring rod at a speed of 30 40 rpm connected with electric motor and a ph monitor were placed into the sludge each of the methanogenic digesters was equipped with a gas sampling bag and a sludge sampling port and operated at a temperature of 37 0 c before experiments each of the methanogenic digesters received a 1000 ml of seed sludge each of the methanogenic digesters was successively fed with the propionate butyrate and ethanol type fermentation products for 25 day experiments and the srt of all the methanogenic digesters was 25 d 2 4 analytical methods tss and vss were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by hach s method 8000 hach dr 890 usa proteins were measured by lowry s method that used the bovine serum albumin as a standard solution lowry et al 1951 carbohydrates were measured by the phenol sulfuric method that used the glucose as standard solution masuko et al 2005 the short chain fatty acids scfas and alcohols were measured by a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900 fid china jiang et al 2007 the biogas yield in the gas sampling bag was measured by a plastic syringe of 100 ml the content of methane hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the gas sampling bag was measured by another gas chromatograph tianmei gc 7900 tcd china with a thermal conductivity detector tcd zhao et al 2015 the equivalent relationship between cod and substrates are as follows 1 07 g cod g acetate 1 51 g cod g propionate 1 82 g cod g butyrate 2 08 g cod g ethanol 1 5 g cod g protein and 1 06 g cod g carbohydrate ph was measured by a ph analyzer sartorius pb 20 germany 2 5 ets activity measurement activity of electron transfer system ets in the methanogenic sludge was measured by the 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride electron transport system int ets method yin et al 2018 the detailed measurements were as follows 0 3 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 respectively 1 5 ml of the tris hcl buffered solution ph 8 4 and 1 ml of the int solution 0 2 v v were transferred to a 10 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was heated for 30 min by a shaking water bath kettle in the dark at 37 c 1 ml of formaldehyde 37 v v was added to the 10 ml centrifuge tube to terminate the enzyme reaction the mixture was harvested by the centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min after centrifugation the supernatant was removed and 5 ml of methanol was added to the 10 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was harvested by the centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min and then measured their absorbance at 485 nm the calculation was slightly modified by changing the weight of sludge to the volume u d 485 v e k v t where u is the ets activity ug ml min d485 is the absorbance at 485 nm ve is the volume of extractant ml k is the slope of the standard curve v is the volume of mixed samples ml and t is the incubation time min 2 6 sludge conductance measurement conductivity of the methanogenic sludge was measured by the three probe electrical conductance measurement method malvankar et al 2011 5 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 respectively was collected by the centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times by 0 1 m nacl solution li et al 2015 after washing and centrifugation the sludge was placed on the two gold electrodes across the non conductive gap 0 5 mm an electrochemical workstation was used to apply a voltage ramp of 0 3 0 3 v across split electrodes in steps of 0 025 v the time averaged current for each applied voltage was recorded to create the current voltage curve and the conductivity of sludge was calculated by the following formula zhao et al 2016a b σ l r s where σ is the conductivity of sludge s m l is the width of the gap m o is the reciprocal of the slope in the current voltage curve ω and s is the cross sectional area 2 54 10 6 m2 2 7 atp measurement adenosine triphosphate atp in the sludge cells was measured by bactiter glotm microbial cell viability assay promega corporation g8231 dübendorf ch and a glomax 20 20 luminometer sunnyvale usa the detailed measurements were as follows hammes et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 2 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 were transferred into a 2 ml eppendorf tube respectively and 50 μl of the atp reagent was transferred to a 1 5 ml sterile reaction tube both sludge and reagent were heated for at least 1 min in a heating block at 38 0 c afterwards 500 μl of the sludge was transferred to the 50 μl reagent and the mixture was incubated for 20 s in the heating block at 38 c the luminescence was subsequently measured as an integral over 10 s expressed in relative light units rlu the rlu values were converted to the concentration of atp using a calibration curve which was prepared with pure atp standard promega corporation 10 mm france diluted in atp free sterile water milli q to different concentration 10 2 104 nm a conversion factor of 1 75 10 10 nmol atp per cell was applied to calculate the bacterial cell number 2 8 metagenomic analysis to analyze the metagenome 5 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 respectively metagenomic sequencing and analysis was determined according to the protocols by holmes et al 2017 the dna samples were extracted using truseq dna sample prep kit illumina inc usa and analyzed using the illumina miseq platform the sequences assembled by the soapdenovo program were further predicted by the metagene program to further estimate the function and metabolic pathway of genes the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database was utilized via the blastp program with an e value cutoff of 10 5 the relative abundance of a gene was estimated by comparing the number of high quality reads assigned to a specific gene in the gene set 95 identity versus the number of total high quality reads obtained for that sample using the soapaligner program 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of methanogenic digesters despite the gradually declined phs of fermentation products fig 1 a the performances involved in methane production fig 1b and organic removal fig 1c in the methanogenic digesters gradually improved similar to the results in previous study treating dairy wastes zhao et al 2017 the average methane production rates in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products were 1083 2 53 5 ml d fig 1b about 45 and 22 higher than that fed with the propionate and butyrate type fermentation products respectively as expected from the methane data the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products also had the highest cod removal efficiency fig 1c the low efficiency acidogenesis and low ph fermentation products via the ethanol type fermentation did not disturb the balance of methanogenic metabolism but made it more and more stable and effective an obvious phenomena was that the phs in the methanogenic digesters were always kept at more than 7 0 fig 1a and the residual scfas was basically same fig 1e compared with the methanogenic digesters fed with the propionate and butyrate type fermentation products the methane conversion efficiencies calculation was showed in supporting information in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products were 96 1 1 5 higher than that fed with the other products about 10 15 fig 1d respectively suggesting that an more effective mechanism of interspecies electron transfer proceeded the conversion of organic substrates to methane an evidence to support this was that the maximum ets values as an important indication of microbial respiration yin et al 2018 in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products were 31 6 5 6 μg ml min higher than that fed with the other products about 70 80 fig 1f 3 2 microbial community composition methanothrix species were the predominant methanogens and accounted for ca 30 40 of the communities among all the sludge samples fig 2 a analysis of the abundance of genes for the top species revealed that methanothrix concilii were the most metabolically active methanogens fig 2b methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products had the highest abundance of methanothrix species fig 2a while the concentration of acetate in the fermentation products was the lowest fig s1 suggesting that the increase in the abundance of methanothrix species was not derived from acetate stimulation furthermore the abundance of genes involved in methanothrix concilii in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was about 1 5 fold higher than that fed with the other products a possible reason resulting in the increase in the abundance of genes involved in methanothrix species was that methanothrix species participated in diet and gained more energy to support their growth rotaru et al 2014b remarkably though the abundance of methanothrix species in the methanogenic digesters fed with the propionate type fermentation products was significantly higher than that fed with the butyrate type fermentation products fig 2a the abundance of genes involved in methanothrix concilii was nearly same fig 2b methanoculleus species the hydrogen utilizing methanogens were the predominant methanogens in the methanogenic digesters fed with the butyrate type fermentation products fig 2a methanosarcina species the second confirmed methanogens capable of accepting electrons via diet rotaru et al 2014a were hardly detected in the communities among all the sludge samples fig 2a up to date no molecular evidence for definitively determining whether methanosarcina species are engaged in diet has been developed in the methanogenic digesters since some species of methanosarcina species can also use hydrogen as an electron donor de vrieze et al 2012 syntrophomonas species the syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing microorganisms capable of metabolizing propionate and butyrate to acetate with the production of hydrogen were the dominant bacteria accounting for ca 10 20 of the communities fig 2a methanogenic digesters fed with the propionate type fermentation products had the highest abundance of syntrophomonas species fig 2a and the abundance of genes involved in syntrophomonas wolfei was about 2 fold higher than that fed with the other products fig 2b their most likely role was to convert propionate to acetate with the hydrogen utilizing partners such as methanoculleus species methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products needed a fermentative consortium to metabolize the complex organic substrates due to the low efficiency acidogenesis fig s1 in this case some anaerobic fermentative and amino acid degrading bacteria were specially enriched such as sphaerochaeta bacteroides and pseudomonas species fig 2a the abundance of genes involved in sphaerochaeta globosa in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was an order of magnitude higher than that fed with the other products fig 2b suggesting that sphaerochaeta species were only metabolically active when ethanol was dominant in the fermentation products remarkably study ritalahti et al 2012 in pure cultures with glucose as substrates demonstrated that sphaerochaeta species were capable of reducing the soluble fe iii oxides to fe ii it should be pointed out that on the one hand the mechanisms of electron transfer to fe iii oxides are very commonly linked to that of electron transfer to methanogens via diet lovley et al 2011 on the other hand oshurkova et al 2015 observed that sphaerochaeta species could grow in defined co cultures with methanosarcina species and form the methanogenic aggregates therefore it was suggested that sphaerochaeta species held a great potential of participating in diet apart from sphaerochaeta species lin et al 2017 demonstrated that pseudomonas species might be capable of proceeding diet with methanobacterium and methanospirillum species in the methanogenic digesters when graphene were served as the electron conduits though some species with the abundance lower than 0 5 they might be metabolically active in the communities fig 2b anaerolinea thermophila and proteiniphilum acetatigenes were the typical fermentative bacteria and their most likely role was to convert the carbohydrates and proteins to fatty acids sedimentibacter sp b4 and candidatus cloacimonas acidaminovorans were both the fe iii reducing species and remarkably the abundance of genes involved in them in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was significantly higher than that fed with the other products fig 2b 3 3 gene for plia and sludge conductance e pili and c type cytochromes omcs are the two biological electron transfer components involved in diet lovley 2017 the e pili of geobacter species described to date is composed of a plia monomer e pilin that is homologous to type iv pila proteins holmes et al 2017 to clarify that the microorganisms in the methanogenic digesters might participate in diet the gene for plia was analyzed fig 3 a metagenomic analysis showed that the abundance of gene for plia in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was an order of magnitude higher than that fed with the other products fig 3a suggesting that the microorganisms were engaged in the extracellular electron transfer via their e pili an evidence to support this was that the sludge in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products exhibited a higher conductivity fig 3b the possible mechanisms for the conductive sludge had been previously demonstrated in defined co cultures of g metallireducens with g sulfurreducens that geobacter species facilitated diet via their e pili to form the aggregates with a conductive pili network summers et al 2010 the gene for plia was primarily derived from sphaerochaeta sedimentibacter and pseudomonas species suggesting that the special enrichments in the presence of ethanol served as the precursors of diet equipped with e pili to proceed interspecies electron and energy exchange apart from e pilin gene the genes for all the e pilin accessory proteins pila pilb pilc pild pile pilf pill pilm piln pilo pilp pilq pilv pilw pilx and pily were detected in sphaerochaeta sedimentibacter and pseudomonas species however the gene for omcs that mapped to the c type cytochrome omcs was almost not detected in all the sludge samples lovley et al 2011 suggesting that the dieters did not facilitated interspecies electron exchange via their outer surface c type cytochrome omcs omcs is localized along the e pili of g sulfurreducens leang et al 2010 no detection of gene for omcs was likely because that no geobacter species was enriched in the methanogenic communities similar to the results park et al 2018 demonstrated that the gene for pila was derived from geobacter syntrophus pseudomonas and thauera species in the methanogenic digesters supplemented with granular active carbon while the gene for omcs was only derived from geobacter species 3 4 metagenomic analysis of methane metabolism to further demonstrate that the diet based communities was established in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for methanogenic pathway was analyzed the genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in four methanogenic pathways were detected fig 4 a and table 1 including carbon dioxide reduction m00567 acetate decarboxylation m00357 methanol methanogenesis m00356 and methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine methanogenesis m00563 among them the carbon dioxide reduction and acetate decarboxylation were the two primary methanogenic pathways but the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the other two methanogenic pathways was quite low fig 4b acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 are the key enzymes involved in the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa which was further transformed to the precursor of methane 5 methyl thmpt by acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase acds during acetate decarboxylation pathway fig 4a wang et al 2018 the differences in the abundance of genes for acka pta and acs that respectively encoded acetate kinase phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate coa ligase among the four sludge samples were not significant fig 4b suggesting that the metabolic activities for methanogenesis via acetate decarboxylation pathway were the same commonly methanosarcina species primarily expressed the genes that encoded acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase to catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa whereas methanothrix species primarily expressed the genes that encoded acetate coa ligase to catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa wang et al 2018 remarkably the abundance of gene for acs that encoded acetate coa ligase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation was significantly lower than that fed the other products table 1 suggesting that the high abundance fig 2a and metabolically active fig 2b methanothrix species detected were not engaged in the conversion of acetate to methane via acetate decarboxylation pathway despite the low abundance of hydrogen utilizing methanogens and methanosarcina species detected in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol fermentation products fig 2a the higher abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the carbon dioxide reduction pathway were detected in the methanogenic sludge compared to that in the seed sludge table 1 the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the carbon dioxide reduction pathway in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol fermentation products were 1 2 1 8 folds higher than that fed with the other products fig 4b interestingly the abundance of the genes that encoded formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 fwda fwdb fwdc fwdd and fwde and 4fe 4s ferredoxin fwdf and fwdg the first two enzymes from the carbon dioxide reduction pathway 3 42e 04 holmes et al 2017 was significantly higher than the first enzyme from acetate decarboxylation pathway acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase 2 52e 04 table 1 suggesting that methanothrix species might be actively involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane which was the methanogenic pathway that would need to be utilized by methanothrix species accepting electrons via diet 3 5 metagenomic analysis of energy metabolism methanothrix species may benefit from accepting electrons via diet since the conversion of acetate to methane only yields little energy and methanothrix species typically grow slowly with acetate lovley 2017 however up to date it was only supported by the phenomenon that methanothrix species grew faster in defined co cultures with g metallireducens than they grew solely with acetate rotaru et al 2014b to clarify that the ethanol type fermentation products might stimulate the diet based metabolism established that provided more energy to support the growth of methanothrix species the concentration of total atp in the cells among all the sludge was compared fig 5 a the results showed that the concentration of total atp in the cells of methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was 1 8 2 3 folds higher than that fed with the other products fig 5a further studies were to analyze the abundance of genes that encoded atpase table s2 see supporting information commonly bacteria primarily expressed the genes that encoded f type atpase ec 7 1 2 2 7 1 2 1 to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp whereas archaea primarily expressed the genes that encoded v a type atpase ec 7 1 2 2 7 1 2 1 to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp bird et al 2011 the differences in the abundance of genes that encoded the f type atpase were not significant while the abundance of genes that encoded v a type atpase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was 1 3 1 5 folds higher than that fed with the other products fig 5b therefore the high concentration atp detected in the cells of methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was primarily derived from archaea fig 5a together with methanothrix species were the dominant archaea detected in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products fig 2a it was suggested that the energy metabolism in methanothrix species was more active when ethanol was the dominant substrate energy yield is derived from the transmembrane gradient of na h that drives the atpase to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp in mitochondrial inner membrane of cells fig 6 bird et al 2011 the genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in the four pathways nadh dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase map 00190 of na h transport were detected table 2 it is impossible to differentiate the genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in energy metabolism pathways between bacteria and archaea since they have the same complex the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in nadh dehydrogenase cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase was generally based on the following order ph 6 0 6 5 propionate ph 5 0 5 5 butyrate ph 4 0 4 5 ethanol this might be ascribed to the gibbs free energy of thermodynamic oxidation of fatty acids propionate δg0 76 kj mol butyrate δg0 48 kj mol ethanol δg0 10 kj mol stams and plugge 2009 which meant that the cells in the methanogenic sludge fed with the propionate type fermentation products required more energy and increased the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in them to metabolize propionate however the abundance of genes for sdha sdhb sdhc sdhd frda and frdb was significantly higher than that fed the other products table 2 suggesting that ethanol could stimulate the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase to produce atp 3 6 implications the study presented here for the first time analyze the effects of ethanol on methanogenic pathway and energy metabolism linked to the establishment of the diet based methanogenic communities in methanothrix dominant digesters under the molecular level of gene abundance metagenomic analysis revealed two important discoveries 1 in the presence of ethanol methanothrix species were metabolically active via carbon dioxide reduction pathway rather than acetate decarboxylation pathway fig 4b and table 1 and the electrons derived from diet are the only known electron donors for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in methanothrix species 2 ethanol stimulated methanothrix species to increase the abundance of genes that encoded atpase to gain more energy via diet fig 5b and table s2 to our best knowledge though the results in some previous studies suggested that the diet based methanogenic metabolism could be established in the presence of conductive carbon based materials li et al 2015 lin et al 2017 lei et al 2016 luo et al 2015 or minerals yang et al 2016 zhang and lu 2016 the evidence only involved in the performances communities and electrochemical responses was insufficient clarifying the improvement of methane production via diet requires the development of some suitable characterization evidence van steendam et al 2019 and analysis of the gene abundance involved in methane and energy metabolism will be increasingly important to further discover the diet based methanogenic communities holmes et al 2017 park et al 2018 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ethanol stimulated the methanogenic communities to specially enrich some possible microbial species of diet such as sphaerochaeta species fig 2a they might proceed diet with methanothrix species since they were also abundant fig 2a metabolically active fig 2b and most importantly transcribed genes coding for e pilin fig 3a the potential diet based methanogenic pathway between sphaerochaeta and methanothrix species in the methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was revealed by metagenome fig 7 commonly ethanol metabolism ec 1 1 1 1 can proceed the nadh dehydrogenase complex ec 7 1 1 2 to cause the transmembrane gradient of na h that drives the atpase to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp in the mitochondrial inner membrane rotaru et al 2014b however in the current study it seemed more likely that the oxidation of ethanol significantly stimulated the succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase complex ec 1 3 5 1 1 3 5 4 of sphaerochaeta species since the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in them significantly increased table 2 though the transformation between succinate and fumarate could not directly cause the transmembrane gradient of na h that results in the yield of atp as well as transfer electrons they can drive the transformation between ubiquinone uq and uqh2 that transports na h and electrons from nadh dehydrogenase complex to cytochrome bd complex fig 6 namely the stimulation of the succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase complex might accelerate the transportation of na h and electrons in the mitochondrial inner membrane which further accelerated the atp synthesis the yield of more energy might promote sphaerochaeta species to produce the biological electron transfer components of e pili the yield of e pili generally consumes a quantity of cell energy liu et al 2012 which causes that the methanogenic communities fed with the organic substrates other than ethanol are hardly observed to perform diet in addition this also explains why the diet based methanogenic communities can be established in the presence of conductive materials conductive materials may save cell energy because they do not need to produce e pili liu et al 2012 further study should be conducted in pure cultures with a series of gene sdha sdhb sdhc sdhd frda and frdb deletion mutants to clarify this assumption remarkably once the biological interspecies electrical connections via their e pili were established fig 7 the highly conductive aggregates or sludge were formed fig 3b meanwhile the high abundance fig 2a and metabolically active fig 2b methanothrix species were required to increased the abundance of genes for the reduction of carbon dioxide ec 1 2 7 12 ec 2 3 1 101 ec 3 5 4 27 ec 1 5 98 1 ec 1 5 98 2 ec 1 12 98 1 rather than acetate decarboxylation ec 2 7 2 1 ec 2 3 1 8 ec 6 2 1 1 and change their primary methanogenic pathway from acetate decarboxylation to carbon dioxide reduction fig 7 consistently previous study zhao et al 2018 in a ch3 13cooh amended medium observed a significant 13ch4 yield in methanothrix dominant sludge treating was via ethanol type fermentation pretreatment suggesting that methanothrix species changed their primary methanogenic pathway to carbon dioxide reduction when the diet based methanogenic metabolism were established the reduction of carbon dioxide stimulated methanothrix species to increase the abundance of genes that encoded atpase fig 6b and provided more energy to support their growth fig 3a sphaerochaeta species the special enrichments with ethanol are capable of utilizing more complex organic substrates than geobacter species such as d galactose d glucose d fructose d xylose sucrose maltose lactose raffinose melezitose and soluble starch ritalahti et al 2012 which holds a great potential of expanding the available substrates of diet this was likely the reason why the methanogenic digesters fed with the low efficiency acidogenic products had a higher performance of methanogenesis apart from sphaerochaeta species some genera reported in the recent studies such as bacillus zhuang et al 2015 clostridium hu et al 2017 spirochaetes lei et al 2016 syntrophomonas luo et al 2015 thauera yang et al 2016 and petrimonas zhao and zhang 2019 had been inferred to be capable of participating in sole diet or conductive material based diet however their abundance of gene for pila and metabolism pathway were not evaluated methanothrix species are some of the most important microbial contributors to the global methane production smith and ingram smith 2007 study holmes et al 2017 in the methanogenic paddy soils suggested that the growth and metabolism in methanothrix species were faster and more robust than generally considered since diet is an important source of electrons furthermore geobacter species are repeatedly found to be among the most metabolically active microorganisms however the contribution of diet to methane production in methanothrix dominant anaerobic digesters is quite low an important reason is that the precursors of diet equipped with e pili in these methanogenic digesters were rare stimulating the methanogenic communities to enrich the precursors of diet with ethanol may be a promising strategy which has been widely investigated from the laboratory scale zhao et al 2016b 2017 zhu et al 2019 to engineering scale zhao and zhang 2019 from the perspective of the long term energy recovery and stability the initial pretreatment of the polysaccharide rich organic wastes to produce the ethanol abundant fermentation products which then are mixed with the was for further anaerobic co digestion seems more effective zhu et al 2019 on the one hand it will improve the c n ratio that usually limits the sole ad of was on the other hand the excess acidity of the kitchen wastes with the ethanol type fermentation will be remitted by the was that has a high buffer capacity 4 conclusions the study presented here demonstrated that ethanol could specially enrich some precursors of diet such as sphaerochaeta species and increased the abundance of their gene for plia in methanothrix dominant methanogenic digesters they proceeded diet with methanothrix species and formed the highly conductive sludge furthermore in the presence of ethanol methanothrix species were metabolically active via the carbon dioxide reduction pathway rather than acetate decarboxylation pathway which yielded more energy to support their growth since the abundance of genes that encoded atpase in methanothrix species significantly increased author contributions the experiments were

18209,stimulating methanothrix dominant communities with ethanol is recently considered as a promising strategy of improving the efficiency and stability of anaerobic digestion ad while the effects on methanogenic pathway and energy metabolism linked to the establishment of direct interspecies electron transfer diet were not investigated yet the results showed that methanothrix species were the dominant and metabolically active methanogens in the methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products and the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide was significantly higher than that fed with the other products such as propionate and butyrate conversely the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in acetate decarboxylation among all the methanogenic sludge were nearly same in the presence of ethanol the abundance of gene for pila significantly increased the gene for plia was primarily derived from sphaerochaeta sedimentibacter and pseudomonas species that were specially abundant and metabolically active further analysis showed that the abundance of genes that encoded v a type atpase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was 1 3 1 5 folds higher than that fed with the other products as a result the concentration of total atp in the cells was increased by 1 8 2 3 folds these results and the fact that diet is the only electron donor to support the reduction of carbon dioxide in methanothrix species for the first time revealed the mechanisms involved in the establishment of diet based methanogenic metabolism with ethanol graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion direct interspecies electron transfer diet metagenomic analysis methanothrix species ethanol 1 introduction over the past decade a major breakthrough in the understanding of the function of methanogenic communities during anaerobic digestion ad is that methanothrix formerly methanosaeta species are capable of accepting electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane rotaru et al 2014b morita et al 2011 it challenges the long held and acknowledged viewpoint that methanothrix species can only utilize acetate as substrates via acetoclastic pathway smith and ingram smith 2007 analysis of the cell growth gene expression and methane production in defined co cultures of geobacter metallireducens with methanothrix harundinacea rotaru et al 2014b as well as in methanothrix dominant rice paddy soils holmes et al 2017 demonstrated that methanothrix species were active to participate in diet especially when methanothrix species receive some of their energy from diet they grow faster than when acetate is their sole energy source rotaru et al 2014b therefore from the perspective of achieving the effective and stable ad establishing the diet based methanogenic metabolism in methanothrix dominant communities is imperative the diet based methanogenic communities were for the first time observed in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digester treating brewery wastes in which ethanol was the primary substrates morita et al 2011 analysis of the gene transcript abundance in the methanogenic aggregates revealed that methanothrix species were the dominant and most active methanogens and geobacter species accounted for ca 25 of the bacterial communities morita et al 2011 the methanogenic aggregates were electrically conductive with a temperature dependence of metal like conductivity similar to the electrically conductive pili e pili of g sulfurreducens malvankar et al 2011 malvankar and lovley 2014 suggesting that geobacter species proceeded diet with methanothrix species via their e pili discovery of more diet based communities was further explored in some other methanogenic digesters treating various substrates such as fatty acids zhao et al 2016a waste activated sludge was yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 and kitchen wastes dang et al 2016 2017 however up to date in the absence of any amendments the uasb digester treating brewery wastes is still the only ad system in which diet is the predominant working mode of interspecies electron exchange an interesting attempt on syntrophic metabolism of propionate and butyrate via diet was conducted in an uasb digester initially fed with ethanol similar to starting up an uasb digester treating brewery wastes zhao et al 2016b the digester also formed the highly conductive aggregates the conductivity of which was even higher than that of the aggregates in the uasb digester treating brewery wastes morita et al 2011 suggesting that the diet based methanogenic metabolism was established analysis of the communities observed two interesting phenomenons in the stimulation of diet with ethanol 1 the precursors of diet equipped with e pili such as g sulfurreducens g bemidjiensis and g lovleyi were specially enriched 2 methanothrix species might receive more energy to support their growth since their abundance significantly increased by 5 13 however the mechanisms involved in the enrichment of dieters to rapidly establish the electrically connected communities were still yet unknown a confirmed fact was that in the absence of ethanol the diet based methanogenic communities established could be thoroughly replaced by the interspecies hydrogen transfer iht based methanogenic communities zhao et al 2016a from the perspective of permanently establishing the diet based methanogenic metabolism and towards engineering applications a strategy of initially fermenting the polysaccharide rich organic wastes to produce ethanol that were used to stimulate the communities to perform diet was proposed the proof of concept studies were consecutively conducted in some anaerobic digesters treating complex organic wastes such as dairy wastes zhao et al 2017 was zhao et al 2018 and corn straw zhu et al 2019 remarkably the aggregates in an engineering scale uasb digester treating bagasse wastes also presented a surprising potential of diet when the bagasse wastes were initially pretreated under the conditions of ethanol type fermentation zhao and zhang 2019 in all of these studies methanothrix species were dominant and their abundance significantly increased when ethanol appeared in the feedstocks a recent research by calicioglu and brennan 2018 evaluated the energy recovery during ad of duckweed via ethanol type fermentation and demonstrated that it resulted in a higher 51 2 methane yield compared to sole ad and increased the overall energy gain by 70 4 the similar results were also observed in the studies with kitchen wastes wu et al 2015 and oat straw dererie et al 2011 while the effects of ethanol on methane and energy metabolism linked to the establishment of diet based methanogenic metabolism were not further explored under the deeper level the diversity of methanogenic pathways and energy metabolism during ad leads to the question of why dieters like drinking metagenomic analysis offers the means under the gene level to query the physiological status of microorganisms holmes et al 2017 therefore in this study we analyzed the metagenome from bacteria and archaea and compared the abundance of genes involved in methane and energy metabolism in the methanogenic digesters fed with the different fermentation products with the aim to gain the new insight into the mechanisms involved in the establishment of diet based methanogenic communities with ethanol 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge and feedstocks seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss of the seed sludge was 77300 210 mg l mean standard deviation n 3 and 28100 433 mg l respectively the seed sludge was stored under the anaerobic conditions at a temperature of 4 c prior to use kitchen wastes were used as the initial feedstocks the fresh kitchen wastes were collected from a canteen of dalian university of technology dlut and primarily included the rice meat vegetables noodles eggs and oil the tss of the kitchen wastes ranged from 17 3 to 18 9 and the vss accounted for more than 95 of the tss after removing the non biodegradable components like the plastics bones and eggshells the kitchen wastes were homogenized using a pulverizer jiuyang jyl y915 china and diluted to the final tss concentration of about 5 the main characteristics of the kitchen wastes are shown in table s1 see supporting information 2 2 pretreating feedstocks kitchen wastes were pretreated in the four parallel semi continuous completely mixed anaerobic digesters each of which had a working volume of 200 ml referred to as pretreatment digester with the aim of obtaining the acidogenic products with the different fermentation types at the top of each of the pretreatment digesters a stirring rod at a speed of 30 40 rpm connected with an electric motor and a ph monitor were placed into the sludge before pretreatment each of the pretreatment digesters received a 200 ml of the seed sludge the solid retention time srt of all the pretreatment digesters was 5 d namely during each day 40 ml of the pretreated kitchen wastes was extracted out of a pretreatment digester and then 40 ml of the fresh kitchen wastes was injected into the pretreatment digester with a 100 ml syringe all the pretreatment digesters was operated at a temperature of 30 0 c the fermentation phs were maintained at 6 0 6 5 5 0 5 5 and 4 0 4 5 with a 4m naoh solution respectively during the 75 day pretreatment fig s1a during the initial 25 day experiments 6 13 average ph the primary fermentation products were propionate and acetate fig s1b accounting for ca 62 87 of the total products suggesting that the dominant fermentation type was the propionate type fermentation lee et al 2008 when the fermentation phs were kept at 5 0 5 5 over the next 25 day experiments 5 2 average ph fig s1a the content of propionate in the fermentation products significantly declined fig s1b instead the primary products were butyrate and acetate accounting for more than 90 of the total products fig s1b suggesting that the dominant fermentation type was the butyrate type fermentation lee et al 2008 the ethanol type fermentation is characterized by the primary production of ethanol and acetate ren et al 1997 and the obvious ethanol yield was only observed when the fermentation phs were kept at 4 0 4 5 4 32 average ph fig s1b which accounted for ca 50 of the total products remarkably the concentration of total short chain fatty acids scfas and ethanol detected in the ethanol type fermentation products was significantly lower than that in the propionate butyrate type fermentation products suggesting that the acidification efficiencies during the ethanol type fermentation declined 2 3 ad of fermentation products the semi continuous flow experiments were conducted in the four parallel completely mixed anaerobic digesters internal diameter of 100 mm and height of 180 mm each of which had a working volume of 1000 ml referred to as methanogenic digester at the top of each of the methanogenic digesters a stirring rod at a speed of 30 40 rpm connected with electric motor and a ph monitor were placed into the sludge each of the methanogenic digesters was equipped with a gas sampling bag and a sludge sampling port and operated at a temperature of 37 0 c before experiments each of the methanogenic digesters received a 1000 ml of seed sludge each of the methanogenic digesters was successively fed with the propionate butyrate and ethanol type fermentation products for 25 day experiments and the srt of all the methanogenic digesters was 25 d 2 4 analytical methods tss and vss were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by hach s method 8000 hach dr 890 usa proteins were measured by lowry s method that used the bovine serum albumin as a standard solution lowry et al 1951 carbohydrates were measured by the phenol sulfuric method that used the glucose as standard solution masuko et al 2005 the short chain fatty acids scfas and alcohols were measured by a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900 fid china jiang et al 2007 the biogas yield in the gas sampling bag was measured by a plastic syringe of 100 ml the content of methane hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the gas sampling bag was measured by another gas chromatograph tianmei gc 7900 tcd china with a thermal conductivity detector tcd zhao et al 2015 the equivalent relationship between cod and substrates are as follows 1 07 g cod g acetate 1 51 g cod g propionate 1 82 g cod g butyrate 2 08 g cod g ethanol 1 5 g cod g protein and 1 06 g cod g carbohydrate ph was measured by a ph analyzer sartorius pb 20 germany 2 5 ets activity measurement activity of electron transfer system ets in the methanogenic sludge was measured by the 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride electron transport system int ets method yin et al 2018 the detailed measurements were as follows 0 3 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 respectively 1 5 ml of the tris hcl buffered solution ph 8 4 and 1 ml of the int solution 0 2 v v were transferred to a 10 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was heated for 30 min by a shaking water bath kettle in the dark at 37 c 1 ml of formaldehyde 37 v v was added to the 10 ml centrifuge tube to terminate the enzyme reaction the mixture was harvested by the centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min after centrifugation the supernatant was removed and 5 ml of methanol was added to the 10 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was harvested by the centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min and then measured their absorbance at 485 nm the calculation was slightly modified by changing the weight of sludge to the volume u d 485 v e k v t where u is the ets activity ug ml min d485 is the absorbance at 485 nm ve is the volume of extractant ml k is the slope of the standard curve v is the volume of mixed samples ml and t is the incubation time min 2 6 sludge conductance measurement conductivity of the methanogenic sludge was measured by the three probe electrical conductance measurement method malvankar et al 2011 5 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 respectively was collected by the centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times by 0 1 m nacl solution li et al 2015 after washing and centrifugation the sludge was placed on the two gold electrodes across the non conductive gap 0 5 mm an electrochemical workstation was used to apply a voltage ramp of 0 3 0 3 v across split electrodes in steps of 0 025 v the time averaged current for each applied voltage was recorded to create the current voltage curve and the conductivity of sludge was calculated by the following formula zhao et al 2016a b σ l r s where σ is the conductivity of sludge s m l is the width of the gap m o is the reciprocal of the slope in the current voltage curve ω and s is the cross sectional area 2 54 10 6 m2 2 7 atp measurement adenosine triphosphate atp in the sludge cells was measured by bactiter glotm microbial cell viability assay promega corporation g8231 dübendorf ch and a glomax 20 20 luminometer sunnyvale usa the detailed measurements were as follows hammes et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 2 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 were transferred into a 2 ml eppendorf tube respectively and 50 μl of the atp reagent was transferred to a 1 5 ml sterile reaction tube both sludge and reagent were heated for at least 1 min in a heating block at 38 0 c afterwards 500 μl of the sludge was transferred to the 50 μl reagent and the mixture was incubated for 20 s in the heating block at 38 c the luminescence was subsequently measured as an integral over 10 s expressed in relative light units rlu the rlu values were converted to the concentration of atp using a calibration curve which was prepared with pure atp standard promega corporation 10 mm france diluted in atp free sterile water milli q to different concentration 10 2 104 nm a conversion factor of 1 75 10 10 nmol atp per cell was applied to calculate the bacterial cell number 2 8 metagenomic analysis to analyze the metagenome 5 ml of the seed sludge and sludge taken from one of four methanogenic digesters at day 25 50 and 75 respectively metagenomic sequencing and analysis was determined according to the protocols by holmes et al 2017 the dna samples were extracted using truseq dna sample prep kit illumina inc usa and analyzed using the illumina miseq platform the sequences assembled by the soapdenovo program were further predicted by the metagene program to further estimate the function and metabolic pathway of genes the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database was utilized via the blastp program with an e value cutoff of 10 5 the relative abundance of a gene was estimated by comparing the number of high quality reads assigned to a specific gene in the gene set 95 identity versus the number of total high quality reads obtained for that sample using the soapaligner program 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of methanogenic digesters despite the gradually declined phs of fermentation products fig 1 a the performances involved in methane production fig 1b and organic removal fig 1c in the methanogenic digesters gradually improved similar to the results in previous study treating dairy wastes zhao et al 2017 the average methane production rates in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products were 1083 2 53 5 ml d fig 1b about 45 and 22 higher than that fed with the propionate and butyrate type fermentation products respectively as expected from the methane data the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products also had the highest cod removal efficiency fig 1c the low efficiency acidogenesis and low ph fermentation products via the ethanol type fermentation did not disturb the balance of methanogenic metabolism but made it more and more stable and effective an obvious phenomena was that the phs in the methanogenic digesters were always kept at more than 7 0 fig 1a and the residual scfas was basically same fig 1e compared with the methanogenic digesters fed with the propionate and butyrate type fermentation products the methane conversion efficiencies calculation was showed in supporting information in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products were 96 1 1 5 higher than that fed with the other products about 10 15 fig 1d respectively suggesting that an more effective mechanism of interspecies electron transfer proceeded the conversion of organic substrates to methane an evidence to support this was that the maximum ets values as an important indication of microbial respiration yin et al 2018 in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products were 31 6 5 6 μg ml min higher than that fed with the other products about 70 80 fig 1f 3 2 microbial community composition methanothrix species were the predominant methanogens and accounted for ca 30 40 of the communities among all the sludge samples fig 2 a analysis of the abundance of genes for the top species revealed that methanothrix concilii were the most metabolically active methanogens fig 2b methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products had the highest abundance of methanothrix species fig 2a while the concentration of acetate in the fermentation products was the lowest fig s1 suggesting that the increase in the abundance of methanothrix species was not derived from acetate stimulation furthermore the abundance of genes involved in methanothrix concilii in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was about 1 5 fold higher than that fed with the other products a possible reason resulting in the increase in the abundance of genes involved in methanothrix species was that methanothrix species participated in diet and gained more energy to support their growth rotaru et al 2014b remarkably though the abundance of methanothrix species in the methanogenic digesters fed with the propionate type fermentation products was significantly higher than that fed with the butyrate type fermentation products fig 2a the abundance of genes involved in methanothrix concilii was nearly same fig 2b methanoculleus species the hydrogen utilizing methanogens were the predominant methanogens in the methanogenic digesters fed with the butyrate type fermentation products fig 2a methanosarcina species the second confirmed methanogens capable of accepting electrons via diet rotaru et al 2014a were hardly detected in the communities among all the sludge samples fig 2a up to date no molecular evidence for definitively determining whether methanosarcina species are engaged in diet has been developed in the methanogenic digesters since some species of methanosarcina species can also use hydrogen as an electron donor de vrieze et al 2012 syntrophomonas species the syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing microorganisms capable of metabolizing propionate and butyrate to acetate with the production of hydrogen were the dominant bacteria accounting for ca 10 20 of the communities fig 2a methanogenic digesters fed with the propionate type fermentation products had the highest abundance of syntrophomonas species fig 2a and the abundance of genes involved in syntrophomonas wolfei was about 2 fold higher than that fed with the other products fig 2b their most likely role was to convert propionate to acetate with the hydrogen utilizing partners such as methanoculleus species methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products needed a fermentative consortium to metabolize the complex organic substrates due to the low efficiency acidogenesis fig s1 in this case some anaerobic fermentative and amino acid degrading bacteria were specially enriched such as sphaerochaeta bacteroides and pseudomonas species fig 2a the abundance of genes involved in sphaerochaeta globosa in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was an order of magnitude higher than that fed with the other products fig 2b suggesting that sphaerochaeta species were only metabolically active when ethanol was dominant in the fermentation products remarkably study ritalahti et al 2012 in pure cultures with glucose as substrates demonstrated that sphaerochaeta species were capable of reducing the soluble fe iii oxides to fe ii it should be pointed out that on the one hand the mechanisms of electron transfer to fe iii oxides are very commonly linked to that of electron transfer to methanogens via diet lovley et al 2011 on the other hand oshurkova et al 2015 observed that sphaerochaeta species could grow in defined co cultures with methanosarcina species and form the methanogenic aggregates therefore it was suggested that sphaerochaeta species held a great potential of participating in diet apart from sphaerochaeta species lin et al 2017 demonstrated that pseudomonas species might be capable of proceeding diet with methanobacterium and methanospirillum species in the methanogenic digesters when graphene were served as the electron conduits though some species with the abundance lower than 0 5 they might be metabolically active in the communities fig 2b anaerolinea thermophila and proteiniphilum acetatigenes were the typical fermentative bacteria and their most likely role was to convert the carbohydrates and proteins to fatty acids sedimentibacter sp b4 and candidatus cloacimonas acidaminovorans were both the fe iii reducing species and remarkably the abundance of genes involved in them in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was significantly higher than that fed with the other products fig 2b 3 3 gene for plia and sludge conductance e pili and c type cytochromes omcs are the two biological electron transfer components involved in diet lovley 2017 the e pili of geobacter species described to date is composed of a plia monomer e pilin that is homologous to type iv pila proteins holmes et al 2017 to clarify that the microorganisms in the methanogenic digesters might participate in diet the gene for plia was analyzed fig 3 a metagenomic analysis showed that the abundance of gene for plia in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was an order of magnitude higher than that fed with the other products fig 3a suggesting that the microorganisms were engaged in the extracellular electron transfer via their e pili an evidence to support this was that the sludge in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products exhibited a higher conductivity fig 3b the possible mechanisms for the conductive sludge had been previously demonstrated in defined co cultures of g metallireducens with g sulfurreducens that geobacter species facilitated diet via their e pili to form the aggregates with a conductive pili network summers et al 2010 the gene for plia was primarily derived from sphaerochaeta sedimentibacter and pseudomonas species suggesting that the special enrichments in the presence of ethanol served as the precursors of diet equipped with e pili to proceed interspecies electron and energy exchange apart from e pilin gene the genes for all the e pilin accessory proteins pila pilb pilc pild pile pilf pill pilm piln pilo pilp pilq pilv pilw pilx and pily were detected in sphaerochaeta sedimentibacter and pseudomonas species however the gene for omcs that mapped to the c type cytochrome omcs was almost not detected in all the sludge samples lovley et al 2011 suggesting that the dieters did not facilitated interspecies electron exchange via their outer surface c type cytochrome omcs omcs is localized along the e pili of g sulfurreducens leang et al 2010 no detection of gene for omcs was likely because that no geobacter species was enriched in the methanogenic communities similar to the results park et al 2018 demonstrated that the gene for pila was derived from geobacter syntrophus pseudomonas and thauera species in the methanogenic digesters supplemented with granular active carbon while the gene for omcs was only derived from geobacter species 3 4 metagenomic analysis of methane metabolism to further demonstrate that the diet based communities was established in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for methanogenic pathway was analyzed the genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in four methanogenic pathways were detected fig 4 a and table 1 including carbon dioxide reduction m00567 acetate decarboxylation m00357 methanol methanogenesis m00356 and methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine methanogenesis m00563 among them the carbon dioxide reduction and acetate decarboxylation were the two primary methanogenic pathways but the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the other two methanogenic pathways was quite low fig 4b acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 are the key enzymes involved in the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa which was further transformed to the precursor of methane 5 methyl thmpt by acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase acds during acetate decarboxylation pathway fig 4a wang et al 2018 the differences in the abundance of genes for acka pta and acs that respectively encoded acetate kinase phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate coa ligase among the four sludge samples were not significant fig 4b suggesting that the metabolic activities for methanogenesis via acetate decarboxylation pathway were the same commonly methanosarcina species primarily expressed the genes that encoded acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase to catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa whereas methanothrix species primarily expressed the genes that encoded acetate coa ligase to catalyze the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa wang et al 2018 remarkably the abundance of gene for acs that encoded acetate coa ligase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation was significantly lower than that fed the other products table 1 suggesting that the high abundance fig 2a and metabolically active fig 2b methanothrix species detected were not engaged in the conversion of acetate to methane via acetate decarboxylation pathway despite the low abundance of hydrogen utilizing methanogens and methanosarcina species detected in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol fermentation products fig 2a the higher abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the carbon dioxide reduction pathway were detected in the methanogenic sludge compared to that in the seed sludge table 1 the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes for the carbon dioxide reduction pathway in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol fermentation products were 1 2 1 8 folds higher than that fed with the other products fig 4b interestingly the abundance of the genes that encoded formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 fwda fwdb fwdc fwdd and fwde and 4fe 4s ferredoxin fwdf and fwdg the first two enzymes from the carbon dioxide reduction pathway 3 42e 04 holmes et al 2017 was significantly higher than the first enzyme from acetate decarboxylation pathway acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase 2 52e 04 table 1 suggesting that methanothrix species might be actively involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane which was the methanogenic pathway that would need to be utilized by methanothrix species accepting electrons via diet 3 5 metagenomic analysis of energy metabolism methanothrix species may benefit from accepting electrons via diet since the conversion of acetate to methane only yields little energy and methanothrix species typically grow slowly with acetate lovley 2017 however up to date it was only supported by the phenomenon that methanothrix species grew faster in defined co cultures with g metallireducens than they grew solely with acetate rotaru et al 2014b to clarify that the ethanol type fermentation products might stimulate the diet based metabolism established that provided more energy to support the growth of methanothrix species the concentration of total atp in the cells among all the sludge was compared fig 5 a the results showed that the concentration of total atp in the cells of methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was 1 8 2 3 folds higher than that fed with the other products fig 5a further studies were to analyze the abundance of genes that encoded atpase table s2 see supporting information commonly bacteria primarily expressed the genes that encoded f type atpase ec 7 1 2 2 7 1 2 1 to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp whereas archaea primarily expressed the genes that encoded v a type atpase ec 7 1 2 2 7 1 2 1 to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp bird et al 2011 the differences in the abundance of genes that encoded the f type atpase were not significant while the abundance of genes that encoded v a type atpase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was 1 3 1 5 folds higher than that fed with the other products fig 5b therefore the high concentration atp detected in the cells of methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was primarily derived from archaea fig 5a together with methanothrix species were the dominant archaea detected in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol type fermentation products fig 2a it was suggested that the energy metabolism in methanothrix species was more active when ethanol was the dominant substrate energy yield is derived from the transmembrane gradient of na h that drives the atpase to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp in mitochondrial inner membrane of cells fig 6 bird et al 2011 the genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in the four pathways nadh dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase map 00190 of na h transport were detected table 2 it is impossible to differentiate the genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in energy metabolism pathways between bacteria and archaea since they have the same complex the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in nadh dehydrogenase cytochrome bd complex and cytochrome c oxidase was generally based on the following order ph 6 0 6 5 propionate ph 5 0 5 5 butyrate ph 4 0 4 5 ethanol this might be ascribed to the gibbs free energy of thermodynamic oxidation of fatty acids propionate δg0 76 kj mol butyrate δg0 48 kj mol ethanol δg0 10 kj mol stams and plugge 2009 which meant that the cells in the methanogenic sludge fed with the propionate type fermentation products required more energy and increased the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in them to metabolize propionate however the abundance of genes for sdha sdhb sdhc sdhd frda and frdb was significantly higher than that fed the other products table 2 suggesting that ethanol could stimulate the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase to produce atp 3 6 implications the study presented here for the first time analyze the effects of ethanol on methanogenic pathway and energy metabolism linked to the establishment of the diet based methanogenic communities in methanothrix dominant digesters under the molecular level of gene abundance metagenomic analysis revealed two important discoveries 1 in the presence of ethanol methanothrix species were metabolically active via carbon dioxide reduction pathway rather than acetate decarboxylation pathway fig 4b and table 1 and the electrons derived from diet are the only known electron donors for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in methanothrix species 2 ethanol stimulated methanothrix species to increase the abundance of genes that encoded atpase to gain more energy via diet fig 5b and table s2 to our best knowledge though the results in some previous studies suggested that the diet based methanogenic metabolism could be established in the presence of conductive carbon based materials li et al 2015 lin et al 2017 lei et al 2016 luo et al 2015 or minerals yang et al 2016 zhang and lu 2016 the evidence only involved in the performances communities and electrochemical responses was insufficient clarifying the improvement of methane production via diet requires the development of some suitable characterization evidence van steendam et al 2019 and analysis of the gene abundance involved in methane and energy metabolism will be increasingly important to further discover the diet based methanogenic communities holmes et al 2017 park et al 2018 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ethanol stimulated the methanogenic communities to specially enrich some possible microbial species of diet such as sphaerochaeta species fig 2a they might proceed diet with methanothrix species since they were also abundant fig 2a metabolically active fig 2b and most importantly transcribed genes coding for e pilin fig 3a the potential diet based methanogenic pathway between sphaerochaeta and methanothrix species in the methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol type fermentation products was revealed by metagenome fig 7 commonly ethanol metabolism ec 1 1 1 1 can proceed the nadh dehydrogenase complex ec 7 1 1 2 to cause the transmembrane gradient of na h that drives the atpase to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp in the mitochondrial inner membrane rotaru et al 2014b however in the current study it seemed more likely that the oxidation of ethanol significantly stimulated the succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase complex ec 1 3 5 1 1 3 5 4 of sphaerochaeta species since the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in them significantly increased table 2 though the transformation between succinate and fumarate could not directly cause the transmembrane gradient of na h that results in the yield of atp as well as transfer electrons they can drive the transformation between ubiquinone uq and uqh2 that transports na h and electrons from nadh dehydrogenase complex to cytochrome bd complex fig 6 namely the stimulation of the succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase complex might accelerate the transportation of na h and electrons in the mitochondrial inner membrane which further accelerated the atp synthesis the yield of more energy might promote sphaerochaeta species to produce the biological electron transfer components of e pili the yield of e pili generally consumes a quantity of cell energy liu et al 2012 which causes that the methanogenic communities fed with the organic substrates other than ethanol are hardly observed to perform diet in addition this also explains why the diet based methanogenic communities can be established in the presence of conductive materials conductive materials may save cell energy because they do not need to produce e pili liu et al 2012 further study should be conducted in pure cultures with a series of gene sdha sdhb sdhc sdhd frda and frdb deletion mutants to clarify this assumption remarkably once the biological interspecies electrical connections via their e pili were established fig 7 the highly conductive aggregates or sludge were formed fig 3b meanwhile the high abundance fig 2a and metabolically active fig 2b methanothrix species were required to increased the abundance of genes for the reduction of carbon dioxide ec 1 2 7 12 ec 2 3 1 101 ec 3 5 4 27 ec 1 5 98 1 ec 1 5 98 2 ec 1 12 98 1 rather than acetate decarboxylation ec 2 7 2 1 ec 2 3 1 8 ec 6 2 1 1 and change their primary methanogenic pathway from acetate decarboxylation to carbon dioxide reduction fig 7 consistently previous study zhao et al 2018 in a ch3 13cooh amended medium observed a significant 13ch4 yield in methanothrix dominant sludge treating was via ethanol type fermentation pretreatment suggesting that methanothrix species changed their primary methanogenic pathway to carbon dioxide reduction when the diet based methanogenic metabolism were established the reduction of carbon dioxide stimulated methanothrix species to increase the abundance of genes that encoded atpase fig 6b and provided more energy to support their growth fig 3a sphaerochaeta species the special enrichments with ethanol are capable of utilizing more complex organic substrates than geobacter species such as d galactose d glucose d fructose d xylose sucrose maltose lactose raffinose melezitose and soluble starch ritalahti et al 2012 which holds a great potential of expanding the available substrates of diet this was likely the reason why the methanogenic digesters fed with the low efficiency acidogenic products had a higher performance of methanogenesis apart from sphaerochaeta species some genera reported in the recent studies such as bacillus zhuang et al 2015 clostridium hu et al 2017 spirochaetes lei et al 2016 syntrophomonas luo et al 2015 thauera yang et al 2016 and petrimonas zhao and zhang 2019 had been inferred to be capable of participating in sole diet or conductive material based diet however their abundance of gene for pila and metabolism pathway were not evaluated methanothrix species are some of the most important microbial contributors to the global methane production smith and ingram smith 2007 study holmes et al 2017 in the methanogenic paddy soils suggested that the growth and metabolism in methanothrix species were faster and more robust than generally considered since diet is an important source of electrons furthermore geobacter species are repeatedly found to be among the most metabolically active microorganisms however the contribution of diet to methane production in methanothrix dominant anaerobic digesters is quite low an important reason is that the precursors of diet equipped with e pili in these methanogenic digesters were rare stimulating the methanogenic communities to enrich the precursors of diet with ethanol may be a promising strategy which has been widely investigated from the laboratory scale zhao et al 2016b 2017 zhu et al 2019 to engineering scale zhao and zhang 2019 from the perspective of the long term energy recovery and stability the initial pretreatment of the polysaccharide rich organic wastes to produce the ethanol abundant fermentation products which then are mixed with the was for further anaerobic co digestion seems more effective zhu et al 2019 on the one hand it will improve the c n ratio that usually limits the sole ad of was on the other hand the excess acidity of the kitchen wastes with the ethanol type fermentation will be remitted by the was that has a high buffer capacity 4 conclusions the study presented here demonstrated that ethanol could specially enrich some precursors of diet such as sphaerochaeta species and increased the abundance of their gene for plia in methanothrix dominant methanogenic digesters they proceeded diet with methanothrix species and formed the highly conductive sludge furthermore in the presence of ethanol methanothrix species were metabolically active via the carbon dioxide reduction pathway rather than acetate decarboxylation pathway which yielded more energy to support their growth since the abundance of genes that encoded atpase in methanothrix species significantly increased author contributions the experiments were
