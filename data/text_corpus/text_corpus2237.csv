saffron production yield area and nitrogen fertilizer application in each province are presented in table 1 saffron is produced under irrigated conditions in the whole country on average annual saffron production in the country is around 228 5 ton with an average yield of 4 14 kg ha 1 and the total utilization of nitrogen fertilizers is 105 8 kg ha 1 the highest saffron yield is obtained in isfahan and lorestan provinces i e 6 19 and 5 45 kg ha 1 respectively although the largest saffron cultivated lands are located in razavi khorasan and south khorasan provinces both of the provinces have the smallest saffron yield due to severe water stress according to the reports of ministry of agriculture jihad ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 although the saffron sowing area increased whose yield decreased in iran comparing the saffron yield 4 14 kg ha 1 during 2008 2014 with the former period 2000 2007 shows a 24 yield decrease saffron yield is considerably higher in other countries like italy 8 3 kg ha 1 and spain 7 94 kg ha 1 fao 2014 based on the results of koocheki 2013 low knowledge and technology of planting and harvesting low fertility of saffron farms low thickness of the soil layer and the lack of using chemical and organic fertilizers are the crucial reasons of low yield fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of average precipitation net irrigation requirement temperature and precipitation in the major saffron producing provinces in iran net irrigation requirement is high in the central yazd and kerman eastern and southeastern razavi khorasan and south khorasan parts of the country while effective precipitation and total precipitation are higher in the west lorestan and kermanshah north golestan and north west east azerbaijan effective precipitation provides greater share of water requirement in the west and north provinces of iran while this share is lower in southern and central regions the components of saffron wf are summarized in table 2 the green blue grey and white wf ranged 127 1510 m3 kg 1 999 3499 m3 kg 1 162 510 m3 kg 1 and 8898 2875 m3 kg 1 respectively the total average wf in saffron production in the selected provinces is 4659 m3 kg 1 with 12 wfgreen 42 wfblue 40 wfwhite and 6 wfgrey three provinces with high shares of wfgreen are golestan 29 lorestan 27 and kermanshah 21 and the smallest are yazd 3 southern khorasan 4 and semnan 5 respectively the wfblue with a share of 42 constitutes the largest part of wf in saffron production yazd 46 semnan 45 and south khorasan 45 have the largest shares of the wfblue in contrast golestan 33 lorestan 35 and kermanshah 37 have the smallest shares of the wfblue the green blue wf indicates that chaharmahal and bakhtiari golestan fars and razavi khorasan provinces have the largest shares considering the considerable amounts of precipitation in these provinces strategies such as cultivation of new genotypes more adapted to the wet periods shortening the flowering period of saffron with the aim of avoiding the dry period at the end of the growing season can be considered to reduce the share of the wfblue and reduce the share of the green blue wf around 6 of total wf in saffron production is contributed by the wfgrey chaharmahal and bakhtiari 6 1 has the highest share of wfgrey and the smallest share is related to yazd 4 9 the average of wfgrey in saffron production in the study period of 2008 2014 is estimated to 260 m3 kg and the highest share is for chaharmahal and bakhtiari province 510 m3 kg the main reasons for the considerable value of wfgrey in this province are low yield of saffron high consumption of chemical fertilizer and high leaching of fertilizer in this region ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 the wfwhite constitutes 40 of the total wf of saffron production in the country three provinces with high shares of wfwhite are golestan 29 lorestan 27 and kermanshah 21 provinces and yazd 46 semnan and southern khorasan 45 have the largest shares however the declinnig groundwater is so serious in more than 400 plains in iran including yazd ardakan mashhad neyshabur and birjand madani 2014 these provinces have low precipitation and a high crop water requirement on the other hand inappropriate irrigation management number of events and the volume of irrigation has led to decreased saffron yield in these regions and larger wf shirzadi et al 2017 three provinces with high shares of wfwhite are lorestan 32 golestan 32 and kermanshah 38 due to the high yield of saffron in addition the distribution of the wfgreen in these three provinces indicates that a larger amount of precipitation in these regions has led to higher soil moisture and supplying a considerable part of water demand table 3 presents the average annual volume of each wf component averaged over the period of 2008 2014 the total volume of the wf of saffron production in the country is 1541 mcm per year razavi khorasan 1204 mcm year 1 and south khorasan 278 mcm year 1 have the largest wf of saffron production while zanjan 0 36 mcm year 1 and alborz 0 44 mcm year 1 have the smallest wf the largest volumes of wf were observed in razavi khorasan 78 and southern khorasan 18 the sum of the volume wf in these two provinces is 1483 mcm which is more than 96 of the total wf 1541 mcm in the whole country in chaharmahal and bakhtiari golestan lorestan and kermanshah a large share of wf is related to the wfblue despite having considerable amount of seasonal precipitation the largest share of the total wf in saffron related to the blue white wfs would be 82 while the average share of blue white wfs was estimated by ababaei and ramezani 2017 to be 37 for cereals in iran although wfwhite eventually returns to the water cycle there are opportunities for effective irrigation management to reduce the wf more than 96 of saffron cultivated lands are located in central parts of iran with arid and semi arid climates the share of wfblue was considerably large greater than 42 most of the required water supplied from groundwater resources which led to the groundwater depletion sepaskhah and yarami 2010 changing cultivation calendar and using genotypes more adapted to the wet season can result in a considerable decrease in wfblue and an increase in the contribution of the wfgreen koocheki 2013 the relation between the provinces obtained through hierarchical cluster analyses linkage between groups euclidian distance has been used for similarity measures of dendrograms this method classified the provinces in three groups in terms of wfgreen fig 2 a each group has similar characteristics in the yield and effective precipitation the ranges of wfgreen are as follows 127 378 m3 kg 1 in the first group 379 767 m3 kg 1 in the second and 768 1510 m3 kg 1 in the third group the group 1 contains the provinces with low effective precipitation while the group 3 includes those with high effective precipitation and low yield there are four major groups obtained from wfblue the amounts of wfblue in the four groups are as follows group 1 999 1458 m3 kg 1 group 2 1604 to 1872 m3 kg 1 group 3 2122 2625 m3 kg 1 and group 4 3040 3499 m3 kg 1 the provinces of each group are given in details in the dendrogram of fig 2b the wfgrey classified to three groups fig 2c the ranges of wfgrey are as follows 161 253 m3 kg 1 in the first group 290 356 m3 kg 1 in the second and 510 m3 kg 1 in the third group in case of wfgrey the group 1 is regarded as provinces with lower nutrient consumption whereas group 3 is as higher consumption there are six groups obtained from wfblue the provinces of each group are shown in fig 2d in this case the first group is regarded as provinces with lower irrigation water requirement whereas the sixth group is cherechterized as higher requirement the amounts of wfwhite in six groups are as follows group 1 926 1184 m3 kg 1 group 2 1332 1556 1872 m3 kg 1 group 3 1714 1951 m3 kg 1 group 4 2130 2251 m3kg 1 group 5 2321 2330 and group 6 3021 3378 finally provinces are classified in four groups based on total wf fig 2e the group 1 consist of kerman hamedan tehran north khorasan kermanshah lorestan zanjan east azerbaijan and isfahan provinces whose total wf range is 2875 3935 m3 kg 1 the associated range for group 2 is 3906 5801 m3 kg 1 this cluster includes golestan markazi alborza qazvin south khorasan yazd and razavi khorasan provinces semnan and fars provinces are in cluster 3 with 61 71 6738 m3 kg 1 of total wf chaharmahal and bakhtiari is the only member of cluster 4 with total wf of 8898 m3 kg 1 as mentioned above cluster 1 can be classified as low total wf cluster 2 as middle total wf cluster 3 as high total wf and cluster 4 as very high total wf the saffron consumption is 0 5 g per capita in each year with the estimated volumes of consumed vw 186 4 mcm yr 1 based on the population of about 80 million in iran ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 statistical centre of iran statistical centre of iran sci 2017 the total volume of the wf of saffron production is 1541 mcm per year that 186 4 mcm will be used yearly in the country and 1354 6 mcm exported per year to other countries the 162 5 mcm yr 1of exported vw is the share of wfgreen and 1192 1 mcm yr 1 of total wf includes of blue grey and white hence considerable volume of the region s groundwater resources was exported annually from iran through exporting saffron production based on the wfe listed in table 3 lorestan and chaharmahal and bakhtiari provinces has the lowest 1 92 m3 us 1 and the highest 5 93 m3 us 1 wfe of saffron production in iran respectively it means lorestan province can earn 1 by consuming 1 92 m3 1 93 m3 per us water while chaharmahal and bakhtiari province consumes 5 93 m3 water to earn 1 i e 3 1 times more consumption than lorestan the other provinces in wfe ascending are semnan 4 49 m3 us 1 fars 4 11 m3 us 1 south khorasan 3 87 m3 us 1 and razavi khorasan 3 68 m3 us 1 respectively these provinces have low yield per ha more than 94 of saffron is produced in the razavi khorasan and south khorasan with a low yield 3 3 kg ha 1 the average of exported wfe for saffron production is 3 1 m3 us 1 in iran that the shares of green blue white and grey wf are estimated as 0 36 1 29 1 26 and 0 17 m3 us 1 respectively arabi yazi et al 2009 classified the wfe in the exported agricultural products to six groups including very low low middle high very high and extreme in this category the saffron is placed in the middle group in regards of wfe also the majority of exported products include pistachios almond apple plumes and watermelons are in the middle group ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 4 conclusions the magnitudes shares and spatial distribution of wf components of saffron production in iran were studied using the assessment frameworks proposed by hoekstra and chapagain 2008 ababaei and ramezani 2017 and hoekstra et al 2009 in the period of 2008 2014 saffron is a big part of non oil exports in iran more than 95 of the saffron cultivated lands are located in the arid and semi arid regions these lands are facing with water shortage and groundwater depletion thus using efficient irrigation systems and planting the higher yield varieties are very essential practices in saffron cultivated lands resuls of this study showed the share of wfgreen is very low about 12 of the total average wf in saffron production in contrast the share of blue white wfs is very high 82 of the total average wf introducing the varieties with low water requirement and adapt to the wet periods can be very helpful in order to extend the rain fed cropping in regions with sufficient precipitation especially in grow seasons which can lead to a sustainable strategy in a water scarce country like iran also selecting the regions with high precipitation such as lorestan eastern azarbaijan esfahan and kermanshah for saffron cultivation are very useful on the other hand the overall share of white grey wfs is about 46 which this is the results of low efficiency of water use and high rates of fertilizer consumption especially in the regions with high contributions of national saffron cultivation e g razavi khorasan and south khorasan although a partial of these wfs return to the water cycle contamination and inaccessibility at least for one year can be considerable issues by the authorities increasing water productivity and irrigation system efficiency are the main strategy for reducing these wfs based on the literature virtual water concept is a source of great concern but one of the important drawbacks of this concept is that we actually cannot rely on crop imports with high confidence as we know many countries will deal with water and food safety problems in future therefore they may have problems with growing crops and enough freshwater for irrigation they can not actually rely on crop imports from other countries as a sustainable solution since they may have their own water and food problems and hence couldn t provide our need thus saving the freshwater resources and having a sustainable development will occur based on the water policy in the country in the near future virtual water will play an important role in the international trade of strategic products therefore it is necessary to study and explore the temporal and spatial distribution of wf with the aim of improving productivity and reducing water consumption results of this research provide the managers and policy makers with valuable information on the distribution of the saffron wf across iran and helps optimizing the water consumption and cultivation of saffron at a regional and national scale acknowledgments the authors truly appreciate the saffron institute university of torbat heydarieh for their collaboration ministry of jihad agriculture maj and i r iran meteorological organization irimo for related data

around 6 of total wf in saffron production is contributed by the wfgrey chaharmahal and bakhtiari 6 1 has the highest share of wfgrey and the smallest share is related to yazd 4 9 the average of wfgrey in saffron production in the study period of 2008 2014 is estimated to 260 m3 kg and the highest share is for chaharmahal and bakhtiari province 510 m3 kg the main reasons for the considerable value of wfgrey in this province are low yield of saffron high consumption of chemical fertilizer and high leaching of fertilizer in this region ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 the wfwhite constitutes 40 of the total wf of saffron production in the country three provinces with high shares of wfwhite are golestan 29 lorestan 27 and kermanshah 21 provinces and yazd 46 semnan and southern khorasan 45 have the largest shares however the declinnig groundwater is so serious in more than 400 plains in iran including yazd ardakan mashhad neyshabur and birjand madani 2014 these provinces have low precipitation and a high crop water requirement on the other hand inappropriate irrigation management number of events and the volume of irrigation has led to decreased saffron yield in these regions and larger wf shirzadi et al 2017 three provinces with high shares of wfwhite are lorestan 32 golestan 32 and kermanshah 38 due to the high yield of saffron in addition the distribution of the wfgreen in these three provinces indicates that a larger amount of precipitation in these regions has led to higher soil moisture and supplying a considerable part of water demand table 3 presents the average annual volume of each wf component averaged over the period of 2008 2014 the total volume of the wf of saffron production in the country is 1541 mcm per year razavi khorasan 1204 mcm year 1 and south khorasan 278 mcm year 1 have the largest wf of saffron production while zanjan 0 36 mcm year 1 and alborz 0 44 mcm year 1 have the smallest wf the largest volumes of wf were observed in razavi khorasan 78 and southern khorasan 18 the sum of the volume wf in these two provinces is 1483 mcm which is more than 96 of the total wf 1541 mcm in the whole country in chaharmahal and bakhtiari golestan lorestan and kermanshah a large share of wf is related to the wfblue despite having considerable amount of seasonal precipitation the largest share of the total wf in saffron related to the blue white wfs would be 82 while the average share of blue white wfs was estimated by ababaei and ramezani 2017 to be 37 for cereals in iran although wfwhite eventually returns to the water cycle there are opportunities for effective irrigation management to reduce the wf more than 96 of saffron cultivated lands are located in central parts of iran with arid and semi arid climates the share of wfblue was considerably large greater than 42 most of the required water supplied from groundwater resources which led to the groundwater depletion sepaskhah and yarami 2010 changing cultivation calendar and using genotypes more adapted to the wet season can result in a considerable decrease in wfblue and an increase in the contribution of the wfgreen koocheki 2013 the relation between the provinces obtained through hierarchical cluster analyses linkage between groups euclidian distance has been used for similarity measures of dendrograms this method classified the provinces in three groups in terms of wfgreen fig 2 a each group has similar characteristics in the yield and effective precipitation the ranges of wfgreen are as follows 127 378 m3 kg 1 in the first group 379 767 m3 kg 1 in the second and 768 1510 m3 kg 1 in the third group the group 1 contains the provinces with low effective precipitation while the group 3 includes those with high effective precipitation and low yield there are four major groups obtained from wfblue the amounts of wfblue in the four groups are as follows group 1 999 1458 m3 kg 1 group 2 1604 to 1872 m3 kg 1 group 3 2122 2625 m3 kg 1 and group 4 3040 3499 m3 kg 1 the provinces of each group are given in details in the dendrogram of fig 2b the wfgrey classified to three groups fig 2c the ranges of wfgrey are as follows 161 253 m3 kg 1 in the first group 290 356 m3 kg 1 in the second and 510 m3 kg 1 in the third group in case of wfgrey the group 1 is regarded as provinces with lower nutrient consumption whereas group 3 is as higher consumption there are six groups obtained from wfblue the provinces of each group are shown in fig 2d in this case the first group is regarded as provinces with lower irrigation water requirement whereas the sixth group is cherechterized as higher requirement the amounts of wfwhite in six groups are as follows group 1 926 1184 m3 kg 1 group 2 1332 1556 1872 m3 kg 1 group 3 1714 1951 m3 kg 1 group 4 2130 2251 m3kg 1 group 5 2321 2330 and group 6 3021 3378 finally provinces are classified in four groups based on total wf fig 2e the group 1 consist of kerman hamedan tehran north khorasan kermanshah lorestan zanjan east azerbaijan and isfahan provinces whose total wf range is 2875 3935 m3 kg 1 the associated range for group 2 is 3906 5801 m3 kg 1 this cluster includes golestan markazi alborza qazvin south khorasan yazd and razavi khorasan provinces semnan and fars provinces are in cluster 3 with 61 71 6738 m3 kg 1 of total wf chaharmahal and bakhtiari is the only member of cluster 4 with total wf of 8898 m3 kg 1 as mentioned above cluster 1 can be classified as low total wf cluster 2 as middle total wf cluster 3 as high total wf and cluster 4 as very high total wf the saffron consumption is 0 5 g per capita in each year with the estimated volumes of consumed vw 186 4 mcm yr 1 based on the population of about 80 million in iran ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 statistical centre of iran statistical centre of iran sci 2017 the total volume of the wf of saffron production is 1541 mcm per year that 186 4 mcm will be used yearly in the country and 1354 6 mcm exported per year to other countries the 162 5 mcm yr 1of exported vw is the share of wfgreen and 1192 1 mcm yr 1 of total wf includes of blue grey and white hence considerable volume of the region s groundwater resources was exported annually from iran through exporting saffron production based on the wfe listed in table 3 lorestan and chaharmahal and bakhtiari provinces has the lowest 1 92 m3 us 1 and the highest 5 93 m3 us 1 wfe of saffron production in iran respectively it means lorestan province can earn 1 by consuming 1 92 m3 1 93 m3 per us water while chaharmahal and bakhtiari province consumes 5 93 m3 water to earn 1 i e 3 1 times more consumption than lorestan the other provinces in wfe ascending are semnan 4 49 m3 us 1 fars 4 11 m3 us 1 south khorasan 3 87 m3 us 1 and razavi khorasan 3 68 m3 us 1 respectively these provinces have low yield per ha more than 94 of saffron is produced in the razavi khorasan and south khorasan with a low yield 3 3 kg ha 1 the average of exported wfe for saffron production is 3 1 m3 us 1 in iran that the shares of green blue white and grey wf are estimated as 0 36 1 29 1 26 and 0 17 m3 us 1 respectively arabi yazi et al 2009 classified the wfe in the exported agricultural products to six groups including very low low middle high very high and extreme in this category the saffron is placed in the middle group in regards of wfe also the majority of exported products include pistachios almond apple plumes and watermelons are in the middle group ministry of agriculture jihad maj 2017 4 conclusions the magnitudes shares and spatial distribution of wf components of saffron production in iran were studied using the assessment frameworks proposed by hoekstra and chapagain 2008 ababaei and ramezani 2017 and hoekstra et al 2009 in the period of 2008 2014 saffron is a big part of non oil exports in iran more than 95 of the saffron cultivated lands are located in the arid and semi arid regions these lands are facing with water shortage and groundwater depletion thus using efficient irrigation systems and planting the higher yield varieties are very essential practices in saffron cultivated lands resuls of this study showed the share of wfgreen is very low about 12 of the total average wf in saffron production in contrast the share of blue white wfs is very high 82 of the total average wf introducing the varieties with low water requirement and adapt to the wet periods can be very helpful in order to extend the rain fed cropping in regions with sufficient precipitation especially in grow seasons which can lead to a sustainable strategy in a water scarce country like iran also selecting the regions with high precipitation such as lorestan eastern azarbaijan esfahan and kermanshah for saffron cultivation are very useful on the other hand the overall share of white grey wfs is about 46 which this is the results of low efficiency of water use and high rates of fertilizer consumption especially in the regions with high contributions of national saffron cultivation e g razavi khorasan and south khorasan although a partial of these wfs return to the water cycle contamination and inaccessibility at least for one year can be considerable issues by the authorities increasing water productivity and irrigation system efficiency are the main strategy for reducing these wfs based on the literature virtual water concept is a source of great concern but one of the important drawbacks of this concept is that we actually cannot rely on crop imports with high confidence as we know many countries will deal with water and food safety problems in future therefore they may have problems with growing crops and enough freshwater for irrigation they can not actually rely on crop imports from other countries as a sustainable solution since they may have their own water and food problems and hence couldn t provide our need thus saving the freshwater resources and having a sustainable development will occur based on the water policy in the country in the near future virtual water will play an important role in the international trade of strategic products therefore it is necessary to study and explore the temporal and spatial distribution of wf with the aim of improving productivity and reducing water consumption results of this research provide the managers and policy makers with valuable information on the distribution of the saffron wf across iran and helps optimizing the water consumption and cultivation of saffron at a regional and national scale acknowledgments the authors truly

11186,the salt tolerance of crops is commonly expressed in descriptive parameters such as threshold or 50 yield soil salinity and shape parameters describing the yield curve estimation by visual or simplified ordinary least squares ols regression methods has multiple issues parameter bias due to uncertainty in soil salinity lack of independent estimates of the reference yield questionable robustness of the threshold parameter and missing information about uncertainty and correlation of the parameter estimates here we present a comprehensive ols method together with an analysis of its statistical properties to alleviate and overcome such issues on the basis of a numerical experiment that mimics observed yield responses to saline groundwater across a range of salinities in the experimental test facility salt farm texel the results indicate under which experimental conditions bias is not a major problem the method allows estimation of the zero observed effect yield from the data which is relevant to agricultural practice estimates for zero observed effect yield and threshold ece are negatively correlated underlining the difficulty of obtaining reliable threshold values the estimated confidence regions are reliable and robust against soil salinity uncertainty but large observation error jeopardizes the confidence intervals especially for the slope parameter data uncertainty alone can be responsible for substantial differences from experiment to experiment providing a partial explanation for the wide variety in reported parameters in the literature and stressing the need for long term repetitions given the lack of robustness of the threshold parameter we propose to adopt the 90 yield ec ece90 as tolerance parameter its confidence bounds can be obtained from a simple reformulation of the original models we also present uncertainty ellipses as a suitable tool to unite multiple year estimates the method is offered as a solid and generic basis for reliable assessment of the cultivation potential of varieties and crops on salt affected soils keywords crop salinity tolerance parameter estimation salinization 1 introduction one of the most common representations of salt tolerance originates back to the celebrated maas hoffman model maas and hoffman 1977 describing crop salt tolerance by a threshold salinity parameter below which yield is not affected and a slope parameter describing the decline in relative yield when salinity is beyond the threshold previous work ulery et al 1998 as well as a recent study stuyt et al 2016 reveals an extremely wide uncertainty range in crop salinity tolerance parameters many studies report the estimates without due account to the uncertainties associated with the estimation also the existence of a real threshold has been debated leading to alternate s shape models such as the models by van genuchten and hoffman 1984 and van genuchten and gupta 1993 though probably agronomical more correct these models have found less wide application as the parameters do not have the same intuitive appeal as the parameters of the threshold model while van genuchten and hoffman 1984 did an extensive study on various least squares methods to estimate the parameters of either model from soil salinity versus yield data a number of issues need further attention we focus on i possible bias due to uncertainty in the independent variable soil salinity ii the assessment of parameter uncertainty and correlation iii the consequences of measurement noise and parameter correlation to the variability of tolerance estimates between experiments iv whether a different parameterization can be found that is more independent of the chosen model the motivation for the current study is that the worldwide expansion of salinization stimulates the quest for relatively salt tolerant varieties to provide a partial solution ghassemi et al 1995 qadir et al 2014 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to have a solid estimation method that ultimately allows for a reliable assessment of the suitability of varieties and crops for cultivation on salt affected soils 2 models and data for investigating salt tolerance of crops 2 1 typical uncertainties in crop yields in response to soil salinity before proceeding we first present some typical crop data to provide an impression of the uncertainties involved fig 1 shows three consecutive years of a series of data over the years 2012 2017 of field experiments conducted at salt farm texel sft sft has a facility of 1 ha split up in 56 fields grouped in 8 randomly selected fields that receive irrigation with one of seven irrigation electric conductivities ecs in a rotational system with one or two irrigation events per day the irrigation water is obtained by controlled mixing of fresh dune water with sea water the target irrigation ecs are 0 4 8 12 16 20 and 32 ds m in this paper data from ec 32 are not considered as it did not lead to consistent yields the actual ec of the lowest level was 1 7 ds m up till 2015 which did not allow estimating a zero observed effect or reference yield an ec of 0 5 ds m was achieved from 2016 onwards but even such small salinity deviations may cause deviation from a zero observed effect yield below we will show how this problem can be circumvented by considering the reference yield as a parameter estimated from the data soil samples and soil water samples were taken at various times during the growing season at three depths around the root zone from which the seasonal mean soil salinity measured as the electric conductivity of a soil saturated paste ece is derived per field as used in the fig 1 left in fig 1 right the data have been plotted again against the seasonal mean ece per treatment group based on the water and salt balance the expected pore water conductivity was 1 2 percent higher than the irrigation ec depending on the year together with the experimentally established relationship between ece and pore water ec ece 0 69 pore water ec it is deduced that the expected values for the remaining 6 group treatment means are about 1 2 2 8 5 6 8 4 11 2 and 14 ds m 1 details of the irrigation and sampling procedure can be found in de vos et al 2016 and van straten et al 2016 fig 1 shows how at sft the reproducibility and consistency of the irrigation and sampling improved over the years as seen from the more clustered data in later years and the more even distribution of the group means over the soil salinity range in particular by the installation of a tap water basin in 2016 sft provided lower ec values of irrigation water moreover the group mean ece gets closer to the target ece s this does not disqualify the soil salinity yield pairs left panels of fig 1 as useful points for the determination of the tolerance curve it only means that the true soil salinity was not the one that was originally intended even in 2016 though there is considerable scatter in yields for fields supposed to have the same treatment also average yields vary from year to year in general salinity effects on crop yield can be described by a multiplicative limitation function i e 1 y y o f e c e β where y actual salt affected yield yo yield without salinity limitation but possibly affected by other factors reference or zero observed effect yield f limit function between 1 no effect and 0 complete mortality ece soil salinity expressed as saturated paste β a vector of parameters in the function f any set of consistent units can be chosen the common practice to estimate parameters β from relative yield data y y 0 implies that valid results are only obtained in the rare case that the zero observed effect yield has been measured with high precision there might be interaction between salt tolerance and evapotranspiration of some crops e g groenveld et al 2013 shani and dudley 2001 sadeh and ravina 2000 the literature is not decisive on this point and further study is needed to see whether this is consistent with the simple formulation in eq 1 here we adhere to the dominant approach in the salt tolerance literature and base our investigations on two common salt tolerance models 2 2 common salt tolerance models 2 2 1 the threshold model the threshold or breakpoint model by maas and hoffman 1977 denoted in the sequel as mh is given by 2 y y 0 e c e e c e t h r y 0 s e c e e c e t h r e c e t h r e c e e c e t h r y 0 s 0 e c e e c e t h r y 0 s where y yield at a particular ece dependent variable y 0 yield without saline stress a parameter e c e t h r threshold breakpoint ece beyond which yield effects are expected a parameter s slope i e the loss in yield per unit ece beyond the threshold a parameter the yield is expressed in appropriate yield units possibly different by crop and the ece is expressed in ds m 1 the slope in the equation above is negative and is expressed in appropriate yield units per ds m 1 note that in the mh model there is a discontinuity in the derivative of the yield to ece at e c e e c e t h r in the mh model the number of parameters to be estimated is 3 once an estimate of the unaffected yield y 0 ˆ is available in addition to the estimates e c ˆ e t h r and s ˆ a plot in terms of percentage of unaffected yield can be presented as 3 y y 0 ˆ 100 e c e e c ˆ e t h r 100 s ˆ e c e e c ˆ e t h r e c ˆ e t h r e c e e c ˆ e t h r 100 s ˆ 0 e c e e c ˆ e t h r 100 s ˆ where s ˆ 100 s ˆ y ˆ 0 the percentage yield loss per unit of ds m beyond the threshold relative slope obviously the relative slope curve relies on the estimates of both slope and zero observed effect yield the latter is unknown in real field situations but is often derived from the yields observed at the lowest salinity level from the above it is clear that this procedure is prone to errors 2 2 2 the s shape model one particular useful form of an s shape model is presented in van genuchten and hoffman 1984 as 4 y y 0 1 1 e c e e c e 50 p where the additional symbols are e c e 50 the ece at which the yield has dropped to 50 of the maximum yield y 0 parameter pa dimensionless steepness parameter this too is a three parameter model in a later study van genuchten and gupta 1993 found that fixing the value of p to 3 resulted in only slightly worse fits for most crops by doing that the number of parameters to be estimated reduces to 2 once an estimate of the unaffected yield y 0 ˆ is available in addition to the estimates e c ˆ e 50 and p ˆ a plot in terms of percentage of unaffected yield is given by 5 y y 0 ˆ 100 1 1 e c e e c ˆ e 50 p ˆ in contrast to the mh model the parameters in the relative plot remain the same irrespective of the estimate of unaffected yield y 0 ˆ also there are no discontinuities in the derivative of the yield to ece hence from a mathematical point of view the s shape model is preferable however in agricultural practice the mh model has the charm of an easy interpretation 2 3 parameter estimation there are various methods to estimate abovementioned parameters from data a linear equation can be fit for salinities beyond the threshold by the least squares method maas and hoffman 1977 this method requires a visual determination of the threshold and the reference yield in the example of fig 1 visual inspection would suggest that if a threshold ece exists at all cf the 2015 data it must be between 4 and 6 ds m 1 this uncertainty will affect the result in maas 1993 it was stated that the threshold can be found by the intersection of a horizontal and sloping regression line but this does not eliminate the arbitrariness as the location of the horizontal line will depend on the number of points included as more objective procedure van genuchten and hoffman 1984 proposed to apply ordinary least squares ols solved by a non linear optimization method this is also the basis for our study but expanded with an in depth analysis and the assessment of parameter confidence regions and correlations the ols method assumes that the independent variable soil ece is known with large precision this is obviously not the case as clearly testified in fig 1 hence the problem is a so called errors in variables case also known as type 2 errors in statistical literature leading to biased estimates meaning that the mean of the estimates over repeated experiments will not converge to the true value rather than taking resort to instrumental variables or total least squares requiring additional assumptions we keep the attractive ols method and just test by a numerical monte carlo experiment the bias under realistic noise conditions such evaluation of the ols estimation is not complete without the assessment of parameter uncertainties and the correlation between the estimates from eq 2 it is apparent that a higher estimate for the reference yield must be compensated by a lower estimate of the threshold ece this alone can be a source of variation in reported threshold values the parameter estimation method and the assessment of the covariance of the parameters is outlined in appendix a the method was implemented in matlab allowing to analyse the structure of the parameter solutions in more detail but it can also be done in standard statistical packages such as spss 2 4 the numerical experiment the ols method applied to an individual year provides estimates of the parameters and of the co variance of the estimated parameters but the asymptotic properties of the estimator can only be judged over a large number of experiments hence a numerical experiment was set up pretending the availability of a large number of datasets with known fixed parameters the experiment was set up in so that it mimics the observed situation as closely as possible the unparalleled rigour and gain in experience of the experiments at sft allowed to suspect that part of the variation in soil salinity is real due to variations in irrigation especially in earlier years generally especially regarding literature data it is impossible to tell whether the variation of observed ece in the soil is real or the result of observation and sampling error or both therefore in the numerical experiments sets of artificial data were generated with a varying distribution of the two uncertainties over the total the standard deviation of the soil ec due to uncertainties in the transfer from irrigation to soil is called sdxtarget and the observation and sampling error is called sdx there is also uncertainty in the yield sdy starting with the irrigation ec of the six treatments the target soil ece was computed following information in section 2 1 next 100 artificial data sets each with 48 8 6 ece yield pairs were generated in two steps first random normally distributed noise with standard deviation s d sdxtarget was added to the target soil ece s thus representing the true variation in the soil next with the model and a set of realistic parameters mh y0 60 tons ha 1 ecethr 4 ds m 1 s 3 tons ha 1 ds m 1 vgh y0 60 tons ha 1 ece50 10 ds m 1 p 3 the yield was computed for each true soil ece finally normally distributed observation noise was added to both the soil ece with s d sdx as well as the yield with s d sdy we set sdy to 4 tons ha this gives an individual 95 realization range of 16 tons ha cf figs 1 and 4 the s d of the target ece and the ece observation noise was varied between 0 and 3 ds m in this way several sets of 100 virtual experiments were obtained for various distributions of the total noise in soil ece over a true variation and a variation due to observation error the data were specific for sft but it is important to stress that the procedure is generic for most salt tolerance of crops literature for which data consist of noisy ece versus noisy yield data e g de pascale and barbieri 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation and uncertainties in soil tolerance on real data illustrative example fig 2 shows the actually observed standard deviation of the seasonal mean soil ece per treatment group in the various years and the improvement of the reproducibility over the years as a consequence of improved skills and experience at sft thus the high end of the chosen ece noise is representative for the early years and the low end for later years there is also some variation of the noise between irrigation groups but for simplicity in the numerical experiment the uncertainty has been set equal over all irrigation groups to corroborate the realism of the artificial data one sample out of the 100 artificial data sets is shown fig 3 for different values of the target and observation noise in ece when the total noise is low case a sum 0 4 ds m the data become more clustered resembling the 2015 situation whereas if the noise is large case b sum 3 ds m the data look more distributed resembling the 2014 situation in order to better understand the numerical experiment it is appropriate to illustrate the estimation method achilles 2014 is taken as an example the ols fits and uncertainty bounds are shown in fig 4 and table 1 the individual prediction error bounds specify the range of outcomes for a single field subject to a specific soil salinity e g at an ece of 8 ds m the yield will be between about 10 and 30 tons ha the simultaneous prediction error represents with 95 probability the mean outcome for a group of farmers or fields in the example between 20 the representation in table 1 can be somewhat misleading since the correlation between parameter estimates was not accounted for at each individual point the ols provides an estimate of the co variance i e of the confidence contour around that point and can also be obtained from the correlation matrix not shown fig 5 shows that the center of the ellipse is located at the best estimate the estimate for the threshold ece is between 2 8 and 7 5 ds m 1 and that of the unaffected yield between 24 and 30 tons ha 1 in accordance with the standard representation in table 1 but the combinations 2 8 24 or 7 5 30 for instance are outside the confidence contour also a high estimate of the unaffected yield implies a low estimate of the threshold and vice versa illustrating one of the difficulties of obtaining reliable salt tolerance parameters from field data in addition to the default parameters one can also obtain the ece90 i e the ece where the yield is 90 of the maximum yield and the ece50 representing the 50 yield ece the ece90 is 6 6 and 6 0 ds m 1 for mh and vgh respectively whereas the ece50 is 12 7 and 12 4 ds m 1 respectively in this regard the models yield similar values for properties that are of agricultural interest table 2 presents the goodness of fit criteria of the two models as defined in appendix a compared with simple linear regression lr the differences in root mean square error of the three models is hardly discernible the mh model has the lowest sum of squares and the highest r2 values although the differences are small the addition of the extra parameter in the mh and vgh models compared to linear regression leads to a lower aic meaning that these more complex models are justified this is in line with what is seen from the data of other years and data from the literature the ability to distinguish between mh and vgh will largely depend upon the availability of data at the high end tail of the curve but the agricultural significance of this part of the curve is low the r2 values are rather low in line with the high variation in yields an analysis of the residuals not shown does not reveal correlation or skewness meaning that the models are reasonable 3 2 bias and reliability of confidence contours the ols method provides descriptive statistics for the estimate of an individual year but for the generic behaviour of the estimator the numerical experiment is instrumental fig 6 shows the position of the individual estimates for the 100 realizations with the same relatively large noise as in fig 3b one of these points belongs to the artificial data of fig 3b it is striking that across all realizations the range of estimates in the ensemble fig 6 closely resembles the shape of the estimated confidence contours of an individual estimate including the correlation between estimates fig 5 however the true value barely falls within the range indicating a clear bias in this case this means that over a number of experiments the mean will be off from the true value the noise for fig 6 was chosen to be rather high to clearly visualize the occurrence of bias similar plots can be presented for cases when the noise is smaller in those cases bias may be almost absent the relation between noise and bias is further discussed in section 3 4 in a situation without errors in variables the 2σ bound represents the exact 95 confidence interval for linear parameters such as y 0 and approximately 95 for non linear parameters when these conditions are not met as is the case here no firm statements can be made to test whether the assumption was approximately valid the distribution of the distance of the estimated point to the true point was tested normalized by the estimated standard deviation i e β ˆ β t r u e σ ˆ β is evaluated the result is shown in fig 7 for both the high noise example as well as a low noise one the statistics of the confidence intervals of both the estimates of ecethr as well as y0 are close to the expectation that there are no more than 5 out of 100 cases where the true value is outside the 2 σ bound x 2 even if the noise is relatively large obviously for an individual year there is no guarantee that the true parameter is within the estimated uncertainty bound underlining again the importance of repeated experiments if the noise is large fig 7 top reveals that the estimated confidence range of the slope is unreliable as more than 30 of the cases lies outside the 2 σ bound or formulated differently the 2 σ bound is associated with a confidence level of about 70 rather than 95 the difference disappears if the noise becomes smaller fig 7 bottom 3 3 effects of taking group means on salt tolerance estimates it is expected that the bias due to high noise in the soil salinity can be reduced by taking the mean of the treatment group prior to the estimation comparing fig 8 with fig 6 reveals that this is indeed the case this can be explained by the fact that in the presence of large observation noise the mean soil salinity is a better estimate of the actual soil salinity than the individual salinities per replicate however averaging may be counter productive if the variation in the soil is largely determined by true variations in irrigation conditions see section 3 4 averaging might also help to improve the confidence estimation statistics fig 1 regarding the high noise case the number of cases where the 2 σ bound is not met reduces from 33 to 20 out of 100 for the slope which is an improvement but still far from the ideal 5 averaging somewhat worsens the reliability of the confidence contour for ecethr from 4 cases out of 100 to 8 whereas the confidence contour of the zero observed effect yield yo remains reliable the latter probably relates to the fact that the models are linear in this parameter 3 4 effect of the distribution over target ece and observation ece in order to further study the effect of the two sources of noise in the soil ece the bias was studied as function of the distribution of the total noise over the irrigation target noise and the observation sampling noise we expect the bias to be larger if the proportion of the observation noise becomes larger in that case averaging over all replicates prior to estimation may be better on the other hand if the soil salinity is determined by variation in irrigation or in other soil properties target noise then the variation is real and it is expected that averaging will not improve the estimates in general this picture is confirmed in fig 9 where the bias is expressed as percentage of the true parameter value a large proportion of observation noise causes a large bias in both ecethr as well as in s while the bias in zero observed effect yield y0 remains small beyond a contribution of observation noise of around 30 averaging reduces the bias without observation noise the bias is zero and averaging has a negative effect since it averages out real differences the effect on the parameter confidence interval was studied by plotting the average of the 100 coefficients of variation cv i e σ ˆ β ˆ expressed as percentage it can be seen right hand panels that with more observation noise the uncertainty in the parameter estimates increases with increasing observation noise if the fields are treated as independent and vice versa if the replicates are averaged the practical meaning of the results is that in experimental situations with replicates with good control over the root zone salinity such as in greenhouses averaging prior to estimation leads to less biased results the practical meaning for field experiments as carried out at e g sft can better be judged from a plot of the observation noise at a fixed target noise in fig 10 a target noise of 1 ds m 1 is assumed with an observation noise ranging from 0 to 3 the bias is practically absent without error in variables i e at observation noise 0 the small deviation is due to the randomness of the yield and expands rapidly when the noise increases the threshold is underestimated negative bias but overestimated by averaging beyond about 1 ds m 1 averaging the soil salinity per treatment group leads to lower absolute bias as at sft according to fig 2 the total uncertainty is generally less than 2 ds m 1 there is little practical difference between averaging or not this also holds for the slope s whereas for the zero observed effect yield the bias is always less than 0 5 so that the choice about averaging has no impact when the same exercise is done for the vgh model the overall picture is the same but the bias in ece50 is going up to 10 compared to the 30 of the ecethr toward sdx 3 also the bias in slope parameter is more favourable 25 in s vs 15 in p at the expense of a little bit more bias for y0 2 vs 4 3 5 an alternative agronomically sensible parameterization ece90 although the threshold ece as parameter has been widely used and has appeal in agricultural practice it is doubtful whether such a sharp threshold really exists in view of the correlations the bias and the uncertainties its determination from a few single experiments can only be done with large uncertainty moreover there is no direct way to deduce this parameter in a decent way when the probably more realistic s shape functions are used therefore we advocate an alternative parameter that is agronomical meaningful and can be evaluated more or less independent of the model choice such a parameter is the ece90 i e the soil ece level at which the yield has dropped by 10 while the calculation of the ece90 from the original parameters is straight forward in both models the assessment of its uncertainty is not because there are no analytical tools for the error propagation in non linear expressions however by reformulating the models such that ece90 is the native parameter the ols can be applied to this new parameter including the assessment of the parameter uncertainty and other statistics completely equivalent to the procedures in appendix a the alternative models with e c e 90 as parameter are presented in appendix b next the same analysis of the effect of uncertainty on bias and estimation error is done with the new parameterization fig 11 here we chose to present the bias in absolute units ds m 1 so that it can be compared to the estimation error the bias of ece90 is quite a bit lower as compared to ecethr especially at higher noise levels and also the average estimation error is lower this is true both for treating the fields as independent or by taking the group means in the vgh model not shown the bias in ece90 is also lower than in the original parameterization with ece50 although in each case the bias almost disappears when soil salinities are averaged the estimation error of ece90 is higher though in general the ece50 can be determined with largest precision which intuitively makes sense nevertheless since ece50 is less interesting from an agricultural point of view it remains useful to know the confidence range for the more relevant ece90 the robustness of determining ece90 under different model assumptions was also evaluated to this end data were generated with the vgh model with ece50 12 p 3 so that the equivalent true ece90 5 77 ds m and ec90 was estimated with the alternative forms of both models application of the mh model mimics the situation where the data are evaluated with the popular threshold model while they originate in fact from an s shape curve again 100 sets were generated for three combinations of target noise and observation noise with a total sum of 2 ds m illustrative of the situation at sft in the absence of observation noise sdx 0 there are differences between the two models table 3 and it requires the correct model vgh to obtain the correct value while the bias increases when the observation noise sdx gets larger as expected the estimates of both models become remarkably similar table 3 it should be noted that the transformation to ece90 does not modify the yield prediction uncertainty bounds as shown in fig 4 3 6 representation of salt tolerance by uncertainty ellipses over multiple years the method can now be applied to data from several years of experimentation it is already clear from the data that the estimated parameters will differ from year to year to get an impression of the salt tolerance over the years the uncertainty ellipses for the mh model obtained with the individual data have been plotted for the alternative form with ece90 fig 12 for easier interpretation the slope is represented here as the percentage decline per unit soil ece change in some years with the maas hoffman model it appeared not possible to obtain a reliable estimate for the threshold ece the inverse in the matrix j t j in eq a 3 cannot be evaluated because the matrix is singular it can be shown that this occurs when there are no data below the threshold ece so that the model cannot be distinguished from a linear regression model this would be different if an independent measurement of the zero observed effect yield y 0 would be available but this is not the case in the vgh model the above problem does not occur since all data contribute to the curve hence to obtain approximate uncertainty bounds in the ill conditioned case the mh curve was directed to the y o found from the vgh model this was done by adding some additional pseudo data pairs at ece 0 three extra points with the vgh y o and two points plus or minus one standard deviation this procedure was tested extensively and was found to provide approximate uncertainty bounds that coincide well with the simultaneous prediction error like the one shown in fig 4 the area with most overlap of the ellipsoidal regions can be considered as the most likely multi annual estimate thus leading to an ece90 of about 5 5 ds m with a decline rate of roughly 5 5 per ds m in this case there is little difference between averaging or not over the treatment mean seasonal soil ece not shown similar plots can be made for the vangenuchten hoffman model not shown 4 concluding remarks our improved methodology to assess salt tolerance of crops resolves a number of issues in the current estimation of salt tolerance parameters from field trials the success of our proposed method depends upon the success of the field trial and does not provide a solution for additional issues that are inherent in final yield field trials a common prerequisites is the prevention of other limiting factors such as water stress in addition variation in soil salinity during the season cannot always be avoided but the effects are hard to investigate from final yield observations alone the method can cope with yield variations between years but method nor final yield field trials can unravel the causes such as variation in breed material differences in plant soil interaction differences in soil biotics and the effect of growth stage on salinity tolerance with these limitations in mind we showed that the ordinary least squares method provides an objective manner to assess the salt tolerance of crops the associated analysis of the parameter uncertainties and correlations reveals that unavoidable noise alone is already responsible for part of the variety in salt tolerance values reported in the literature underlining the necessity to perform experiments over a number of years in general the zero observed effect yield must be considered as a parameter that needs to be estimated as well the customary estimation from relative rather than absolute yields is prone to error unless the reference yield y 0 is known with large precision efforts in the field to assess the zero observed effect yield will be rewarding as pin pointing this parameter reduces the uncertainties the uncertainty in the soil salinity as the independent variable leads to estimation bias the bias reduces when the proportion of the noise that cannot be explained by known variation in treatment salinity is lower in high noise situations the effect of bias can be mitigated by averaging the soil salinities of replicate fields with the same target salinity prior to estimation averaging also results in lower variance of the parameters in that case at salt farm texel the bias is relatively low the situation in other field test sites can be readily judged by performing a similar numerical experiment our expectation is that in carefully designed experiments bias is not a major problem the parameter estimation variance obtained from a single experiment is generally a good measure of the 95 confidence bound of an ensemble of measurements but with high soil salinity variance the reliability of the 2 σ boundary of the slope is substantially lower the correlation between the estimates for instance between zero observed effect yield and threshold must be considered when judging separately reported uncertainty bounds in calculating the prediction uncertainty of the expected yield at a specific soil salinity our method automatically accounts for the covariance the prediction uncertainty is smaller than when the bounds are considered independently the plot of the ellipsoidal uncertainty ranges is offered as a convenient way to aggregate the data over multiple years the s shape model has better mathematical properties than the threshold model but the ece50 is a less attractive parameter in practice on the other hand the threshold ece is often hard to determine and its true existence may be questioned as an alternative to both the ece50 as well as the threshold ece the ece90 might be a better choice while its value can easily be obtained from original model parameters its uncertainty cannot it has been shown that by a simple model transformation its estimation uncertainty can be estimated it turns out that bias and estimation variance are lower than for the threshold ec and its estimate is more robust against the choice of the descriptive model hence we advocate our method to reduce statistical issues prevailing in current estimation approaches and recommend ec90 as an agronomical sensible measure of salt

11186,the salt tolerance of crops is commonly expressed in descriptive parameters such as threshold or 50 yield soil salinity and shape parameters describing the yield curve estimation by visual or simplified ordinary least squares ols regression methods has multiple issues parameter bias due to uncertainty in soil salinity lack of independent estimates of the reference yield questionable robustness of the threshold parameter and missing information about uncertainty and correlation of the parameter estimates here we present a comprehensive ols method together with an analysis of its statistical properties to alleviate and overcome such issues on the basis of a numerical experiment that mimics observed yield responses to saline groundwater across a range of salinities in the experimental test facility salt farm texel the results indicate under which experimental conditions bias is not a major problem the method allows estimation of the zero observed effect yield from the data which is relevant to agricultural practice estimates for zero observed effect yield and threshold ece are negatively correlated underlining the difficulty of obtaining reliable threshold values the estimated confidence regions are reliable and robust against soil salinity uncertainty but large observation error jeopardizes the confidence intervals especially for the slope parameter data uncertainty alone can be responsible for substantial differences from experiment to experiment providing a partial explanation for the wide variety in reported parameters in the literature and stressing the need for long term repetitions given the lack of robustness of the threshold parameter we propose to adopt the 90 yield ec ece90 as tolerance parameter its confidence bounds can be obtained from a simple reformulation of the original models we also present uncertainty ellipses as a suitable tool to unite multiple year estimates the method is offered as a solid and generic basis for reliable assessment of the cultivation potential of varieties and crops on salt affected soils keywords crop salinity tolerance parameter estimation salinization 1 introduction one of the most common representations of salt tolerance originates back to the celebrated maas hoffman model maas and hoffman 1977 describing crop salt tolerance by a threshold salinity parameter below which yield is not affected and a slope parameter describing the decline in relative yield when salinity is beyond the threshold previous work ulery et al 1998 as well as a recent study stuyt et al 2016 reveals an extremely wide uncertainty range in crop salinity tolerance parameters many studies report the estimates without due account to the uncertainties associated with the estimation also the existence of a real threshold has been debated leading to alternate s shape models such as the models by van genuchten and hoffman 1984 and van genuchten and gupta 1993 though probably agronomical more correct these models have found less wide application as the parameters do not have the same intuitive appeal as the parameters of the threshold model while van genuchten and hoffman 1984 did an extensive study on various least squares methods to estimate the parameters of either model from soil salinity versus yield data a number of issues need further attention we focus on i possible bias due to uncertainty in the independent variable soil salinity ii the assessment of parameter uncertainty and correlation iii the consequences of measurement noise and parameter correlation to the variability of tolerance estimates between experiments iv whether a different parameterization can be found that is more independent of the chosen model the motivation for the current study is that the worldwide expansion of salinization stimulates the quest for relatively salt tolerant varieties to provide a partial solution ghassemi et al 1995 qadir et al 2014 rozema and flowers 2008 rozema et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to have a solid estimation method that ultimately allows for a reliable assessment of the suitability of varieties and crops for cultivation on salt affected soils 2 models and data for investigating salt tolerance of crops 2 1 typical uncertainties in crop yields in response to soil salinity before proceeding we first present some typical crop data to provide an impression of the uncertainties involved fig 1 shows three consecutive years of a series of data over the years 2012 2017 of field experiments conducted at salt farm texel sft sft has a facility of 1 ha split up in 56 fields grouped in 8 randomly selected fields that receive irrigation with one of seven irrigation electric conductivities ecs in a rotational system with one or two irrigation events per day the irrigation water is obtained by controlled mixing of fresh dune water with sea water the target irrigation ecs are 0 4 8 12 16 20 and 32 ds m in this paper data from ec 32 are not considered as it did not lead to consistent yields the actual ec of the lowest level was 1 7 ds m up till 2015 which did not allow estimating a zero observed effect or reference yield an ec of 0 5 ds m was achieved from 2016 onwards but even such small salinity deviations may cause deviation from a zero observed effect yield below we will show how this problem can be circumvented by considering the reference yield as a parameter estimated from the data soil samples and soil water samples were taken at various times during the growing season at three depths around the root zone from which the seasonal mean soil salinity measured as the electric conductivity of a soil saturated paste ece is derived per field as used in the fig 1 left in fig 1 right the data have been plotted again against the seasonal mean ece per treatment group based on the water and salt balance the expected pore water conductivity was 1 2 percent higher than the irrigation ec depending on the year together with the experimentally established relationship between ece and pore water ec ece 0 69 pore water ec it is deduced that the expected values for the remaining 6 group treatment means are about 1 2 2 8 5 6 8 4 11 2 and 14 ds m 1 details of the irrigation and sampling procedure can be found in de vos et al 2016 and van straten et al 2016 fig 1 shows how at sft the reproducibility and consistency of the irrigation and sampling improved over the years as seen from the more clustered data in later years and the more even distribution of the group means over the soil salinity range in particular by the installation of a tap water basin in 2016 sft provided lower ec values of irrigation water moreover the group mean ece gets closer to the target ece s this does not disqualify the soil salinity yield pairs left panels of fig 1 as useful points for the determination of the tolerance curve it only means that the true soil salinity was not the one that was originally intended even in 2016 though there is considerable scatter in yields for fields supposed to have the same treatment also average yields vary from year to year in general salinity effects on crop yield can be described by a multiplicative limitation function i e 1 y y o f e c e β where y actual salt affected yield yo yield without salinity limitation but possibly affected by other factors reference or zero observed effect yield f limit function between 1 no effect and 0 complete mortality ece soil salinity expressed as saturated paste β a vector of parameters in the function f any set of consistent units can be chosen the common practice to estimate parameters β from relative yield data y y 0 implies that valid results are only obtained in the rare case that the zero observed effect yield has been measured with high precision there might be interaction between salt tolerance and evapotranspiration of some crops e g groenveld et al 2013 shani and dudley 2001 sadeh and ravina 2000 the literature is not decisive on this point and further study is needed to see whether this is consistent with the simple formulation in eq 1 here we adhere to the dominant approach in the salt tolerance literature and base our investigations on two common salt tolerance models 2 2 common salt tolerance models 2 2 1 the threshold model the threshold or breakpoint model by maas and hoffman 1977 denoted in the sequel as mh is given by 2 y y 0 e c e e c e t h r y 0 s e c e e c e t h r e c e t h r e c e e c e t h r y 0 s 0 e c e e c e t h r y 0 s where y yield at a particular ece dependent variable y 0 yield without saline stress a parameter e c e t h r threshold breakpoint ece beyond which yield effects are expected a parameter s slope i e the loss in yield per unit ece beyond the threshold a parameter the yield is expressed in appropriate yield units possibly different by crop and the ece is expressed in ds m 1 the slope in the equation above is negative and is expressed in appropriate yield units per ds m 1 note that in the mh model there is a discontinuity in the derivative of the yield to ece at e c e e c e t h r in the mh model the number of parameters to be estimated is 3 once an estimate of the unaffected yield y 0 ˆ is available in addition to the estimates e c ˆ e t h r and s ˆ a plot in terms of percentage of unaffected yield can be presented as 3 y y 0 ˆ 100 e c e e c ˆ e t h r 100 s ˆ e c e e c ˆ e t h r e c ˆ e t h r e c e e c ˆ e t h r 100 s ˆ 0 e c e e c ˆ e t h r 100 s ˆ where s ˆ 100 s ˆ y ˆ 0 the percentage yield loss per unit of ds m beyond the threshold relative slope obviously the relative slope curve relies on the estimates of both slope and zero observed effect yield the latter is unknown in real field situations but is often derived from the yields observed at the lowest salinity level from the above it is clear that this procedure is prone to errors 2 2 2 the s shape model one particular useful form of an s shape model is presented in van genuchten and hoffman 1984 as 4 y y 0 1 1 e c e e c e 50 p where the additional symbols are e c e 50 the ece at which the yield has dropped to 50 of the maximum yield y 0 parameter pa dimensionless steepness parameter this too is a three parameter model in a later study van genuchten and gupta 1993 found that fixing the value of p to 3 resulted in only slightly worse fits for most crops by doing that the number of parameters to be estimated reduces to 2 once an estimate of the unaffected yield y 0 ˆ is available in addition to the estimates e c ˆ e 50 and p ˆ a plot in terms of percentage of unaffected yield is given by 5 y y 0 ˆ 100 1 1 e c e e c ˆ e 50 p ˆ in contrast to the mh model the parameters in the relative plot remain the same irrespective of the estimate of unaffected yield y 0 ˆ also there are no discontinuities in the derivative of the yield to ece hence from a mathematical point of view the s shape model is preferable however in agricultural practice the mh model has the charm of an easy interpretation 2 3 parameter estimation there are various methods to estimate abovementioned parameters from data a linear equation can be fit for salinities beyond the threshold by the least squares method maas and hoffman 1977 this method requires a visual determination of the threshold and the reference yield in the example of fig 1 visual inspection would suggest that if a threshold ece exists at all cf the 2015 data it must be between 4 and 6 ds m 1 this uncertainty will affect the result in maas 1993 it was stated that the threshold can be found by the intersection of a horizontal and sloping regression line but this does not eliminate the arbitrariness as the location of the horizontal line will depend on the number of points included as more objective procedure van genuchten and hoffman 1984 proposed to apply ordinary least squares ols solved by a non linear optimization method this is also the basis for our study but expanded with an in depth analysis and the assessment of parameter confidence regions and correlations the ols method assumes that the independent variable soil ece is known with large precision this is obviously not the case as clearly testified in fig 1 hence the problem is a so called errors in variables case also known as type 2 errors in statistical literature leading to biased estimates meaning that the mean of the estimates over repeated experiments will not converge to the true value rather than taking resort to instrumental variables or total least squares requiring additional assumptions we keep the attractive ols method and just test by a numerical monte carlo experiment the bias under realistic noise conditions such evaluation of the ols estimation is not complete without the assessment of parameter uncertainties and the correlation between the estimates from eq 2 it is apparent that a higher estimate for the reference yield must be compensated by a lower estimate of the threshold ece this alone can be a source of variation in reported threshold values the parameter estimation method and the assessment of the covariance of the parameters is outlined in appendix a the method was implemented in matlab allowing to analyse the structure of the parameter solutions in more detail but it can also be done in standard statistical packages such as spss 2 4 the numerical experiment the ols method applied to an individual year provides estimates of the parameters and of the co variance of the estimated parameters but the asymptotic properties of the estimator can only be judged over a large number of experiments hence a numerical experiment was set up pretending the availability of a large number of datasets with known fixed parameters the experiment was set up in so that it mimics the observed situation as closely as possible the unparalleled rigour and gain in experience of the experiments at sft allowed to suspect that part of the variation in soil salinity is real due to variations in irrigation especially in earlier years generally especially regarding literature data it is impossible to tell whether the variation of observed ece in the soil is real or the result of observation and sampling error or both therefore in the numerical experiments sets of artificial data were generated with a varying distribution of the two uncertainties over the total the standard deviation of the soil ec due to uncertainties in the transfer from irrigation to soil is called sdxtarget and the observation and sampling error is called sdx there is also uncertainty in the yield sdy starting with the irrigation ec of the six treatments the target soil ece was computed following information in section 2 1 next 100 artificial data sets each with 48 8 6 ece yield pairs were generated in two steps first random normally distributed noise with standard deviation s d sdxtarget was added to the target soil ece s thus representing the true variation in the soil next with the model and a set of realistic parameters mh y0 60 tons ha 1 ecethr 4 ds m 1 s 3 tons ha 1 ds m 1 vgh y0 60 tons ha 1 ece50 10 ds m 1 p 3 the yield was computed for each true soil ece finally normally distributed observation noise was added to both the soil ece with s d sdx as well as the yield with s d sdy we set sdy to 4 tons ha this gives an individual 95 realization range of 16 tons ha cf figs 1 and 4 the s d of the target ece and the ece observation noise was varied between 0 and 3 ds m in this way several sets of 100 virtual experiments were obtained for various distributions of the total noise in soil ece over a true variation and a variation due to observation error the data were specific for sft but it is important to stress that the procedure is generic for most salt tolerance of crops literature for which data consist of noisy ece versus noisy yield data e g de pascale and barbieri 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation and uncertainties in soil tolerance on real data illustrative example fig 2 shows the actually observed standard deviation of the seasonal mean soil ece per treatment group in the various years and the improvement of the reproducibility over the years as a consequence of improved skills and experience at sft thus the high end of the chosen ece noise is representative for the early years and the low end for later years there is also some variation of the noise between irrigation groups but for simplicity in the numerical experiment the uncertainty has been set equal over all irrigation groups to corroborate the realism of the artificial data one sample out of the 100 artificial data sets is shown fig 3 for different values of the target and observation noise in ece when the total noise is low case a sum 0 4 ds m the data become more clustered resembling the 2015 situation whereas if the noise is large case b sum 3 ds m the data look more distributed resembling the 2014 situation in order to better understand the numerical experiment it is appropriate to illustrate the estimation method achilles 2014 is taken as an example the ols fits and uncertainty bounds are shown in fig 4 and table 1 the individual prediction error bounds specify the range of outcomes for a single field subject to a specific soil salinity e g at an ece of 8 ds m the yield will be between about 10 and 30 tons ha the simultaneous prediction error represents with 95 probability the mean outcome for a group of farmers or fields in the example between 20 the representation in table 1 can be somewhat misleading since the correlation between parameter estimates was not accounted for at each individual point the ols provides an estimate of the co variance i e of the confidence contour around that point and can also be obtained from the correlation matrix not shown fig 5 shows that the center of the ellipse is located at the best estimate the estimate for the threshold ece is between 2 8 and 7 5 ds m 1 and that of the unaffected yield between 24 and 30 tons ha 1 in accordance with the standard representation in table 1 but the combinations 2 8 24 or 7 5 30 for instance are outside the confidence contour also a high estimate of the unaffected yield implies a low estimate of the threshold and vice versa illustrating one of the difficulties of obtaining reliable salt tolerance parameters from field data in addition to the default parameters one can also obtain the ece90 i e the ece where the yield is 90 of the maximum yield and the ece50 representing the 50 yield ece the ece90 is 6 6 and 6 0 ds m 1 for mh and vgh respectively whereas the ece50 is 12 7 and 12 4 ds m 1 respectively in this regard the models yield similar values for properties that are of agricultural interest table 2 presents the goodness of fit criteria of the two models as defined in appendix a compared with simple linear regression lr the differences in root mean square error of the three models is hardly discernible the mh model has the lowest sum of squares and the highest r2 values although the differences are small the addition of the extra parameter in the mh and vgh models compared to linear regression leads to a lower aic meaning that these more complex models are justified this is in line with what is seen from the data of other years and data from the literature the ability to distinguish between mh and vgh will largely depend upon the availability of data at the high end tail of the curve but the agricultural significance of this part of the curve is low the r2 values are rather low in line with the high variation in yields an analysis of the residuals not shown does not reveal correlation or skewness meaning that the models are reasonable 3 2 bias and reliability of confidence contours the ols method provides descriptive statistics for the estimate of an individual year but for the generic behaviour of the estimator the numerical experiment is instrumental fig 6 shows the position of the individual estimates for the 100 realizations with the same relatively large noise as in fig 3b one of these points belongs to the artificial data of fig 3b it is striking that across all realizations the range of estimates in the ensemble fig 6 closely resembles the shape of the estimated confidence contours of an individual estimate including the correlation between estimates fig 5 however the true value barely falls within the range indicating a clear bias in this case this means that over a number of experiments the mean will be off from the true value the noise for fig 6 was chosen to be rather high to clearly visualize the occurrence of bias similar plots can be presented for cases when the noise is smaller in those cases bias may be almost absent the relation between noise and bias is further discussed in section 3 4 in a situation without errors in variables the 2σ bound represents the exact 95 confidence interval for linear parameters such as y 0 and approximately 95 for non linear parameters when these conditions are not met as is the case here no firm statements can be made to test whether the assumption was approximately valid the distribution of the distance of the estimated point to the true point was tested normalized by the estimated standard deviation i e β ˆ β t r u e σ ˆ β is evaluated the result is shown in fig 7 for both the high noise example as well as a low noise one the statistics of the confidence intervals of both the estimates of ecethr as well as y0 are close to the expectation that there are no more than 5 out of 100 cases where the true value is outside the 2 σ bound x 2 even if the noise is relatively large obviously for an individual year there is no guarantee that the true parameter is within the estimated uncertainty bound underlining again the importance of repeated experiments if the noise is large fig 7 top reveals that the estimated confidence range of the slope is unreliable as more than 30 of the cases lies outside the 2 σ bound or formulated differently the 2 σ bound is associated with a confidence level of about 70 rather than 95 the difference disappears if the noise becomes smaller fig 7 bottom 3 3 effects of taking group means on salt tolerance estimates it is expected that the bias due to high noise in the soil salinity can be reduced by taking the mean of the treatment group prior to the estimation comparing fig 8 with fig 6 reveals that this is indeed the case this can be explained by the fact that in the presence of large observation noise the mean soil salinity is a better estimate of the actual soil salinity than the individual salinities per replicate however averaging may be counter productive if the variation in the soil is largely determined by true variations in irrigation conditions see section 3 4 averaging might also help to improve the confidence estimation statistics fig 1 regarding the high noise case the number of cases where the 2 σ bound is not met reduces from 33 to 20 out of 100 for the slope which is an improvement but still far from the ideal 5 averaging somewhat worsens the reliability of the confidence contour for ecethr from 4 cases out of 100 to 8 whereas the confidence contour of the zero observed effect yield yo remains reliable the latter probably relates to the fact that the models are linear in this parameter 3 4 effect of the distribution over target ece and observation ece in order to further study the effect of the two sources of noise in the soil ece the bias was studied as function of the distribution of the total noise over the irrigation target noise and the observation sampling noise we expect the bias to be larger if the proportion of the observation noise becomes larger in that case averaging over all replicates prior to estimation may be better on the other hand if the soil salinity is determined by variation in irrigation or in other soil properties target noise then the variation is real and it is expected that averaging will not improve the estimates in general this picture is confirmed in fig 9 where the bias is expressed as percentage of the true parameter value a large proportion of observation noise causes a large bias in both ecethr as well as in s while the bias in zero observed effect yield y0 remains small beyond a contribution of observation noise of around 30 averaging reduces the bias without observation noise the bias is zero and averaging has a negative effect since it averages out real differences the effect on the parameter confidence interval was studied by plotting the average of the 100 coefficients of variation cv i e σ ˆ β ˆ expressed as percentage it can be seen right hand panels that with more observation noise the uncertainty in the parameter estimates increases with increasing observation noise if the fields are treated as independent and vice versa if the replicates are averaged the practical meaning of the results is that in experimental situations with replicates with good control over the root zone salinity such as in greenhouses averaging prior to estimation leads to less biased results the practical meaning for field experiments as carried out at e g sft can better be judged from a plot of the observation noise at a fixed target noise in fig 10 a target noise of 1 ds m 1 is assumed with an observation noise ranging from 0 to 3 the bias is practically absent without error in variables i e at observation noise 0 the small deviation is due to the randomness of the yield and expands rapidly when the noise increases the threshold is underestimated negative bias but overestimated by averaging beyond about 1 ds m 1 averaging the soil salinity per treatment group leads to lower absolute bias as at sft according to fig 2 the total uncertainty is generally less than 2 ds m 1 there is little practical difference between averaging or not this also holds for the slope s whereas for the zero observed effect yield the bias is always less than 0 5 so that the choice about averaging has no impact when the same exercise is done for the vgh model the overall picture is the same but the bias in ece50 is going up to 10 compared to the 30 of the ecethr toward sdx 3 also the bias in slope parameter is more favourable 25 in s vs 15 in p at the expense of a little bit more bias for y0 2 vs 4 3 5 an alternative agronomically sensible parameterization ece90 although the threshold ece as parameter has been widely used and has appeal in agricultural practice it is doubtful whether such a sharp threshold really exists in view of the correlations the bias and the uncertainties its determination from a few single experiments can only be done with large uncertainty moreover there is no direct way to deduce this parameter in a decent way when the probably more realistic s shape functions are used therefore we advocate an alternative parameter that is agronomical meaningful and can be evaluated more or less independent of the model choice such a parameter is the ece90 i e the soil ece level at which the yield has dropped by 10 while the calculation of the ece90 from the original parameters is straight forward in both models the assessment of its uncertainty is not because there are no analytical tools for the error propagation in non linear expressions however by reformulating the models such that ece90 is the native parameter the ols can be applied to this new parameter including the assessment of the parameter uncertainty and other statistics completely equivalent to the procedures in appendix a the alternative models with e c e 90 as parameter are presented in appendix b next the same analysis of the effect of uncertainty on bias and estimation error is done with the new parameterization fig 11 here we chose to present the bias in absolute units ds m 1 so that it can be compared to the estimation error the bias of ece90 is quite a bit lower as compared to ecethr especially at higher noise levels and also the average estimation error is lower this is true both for treating the fields as independent or by taking the group means in the vgh model not shown the bias in ece90 is also lower than in the original parameterization with ece50 although in each case the bias almost disappears when soil salinities are averaged the estimation error of ece90 is higher though in general the ece50 can be determined with largest precision which intuitively makes sense nevertheless since ece50 is less interesting from an agricultural point of view it remains useful to know the confidence range for the more relevant ece90 the robustness of determining ece90 under different model assumptions was also evaluated to this end data were generated with the vgh model with ece50 12 p 3 so that the equivalent true ece90 5 77 ds m and ec90 was estimated with the alternative forms of both models application of the mh model mimics the situation where the data are evaluated with the popular threshold model while they originate in fact from an s shape curve again 100 sets were generated for three combinations of target noise and observation noise with a total sum of 2 ds m illustrative of the situation at sft in the absence of observation noise sdx 0 there are differences between the two models table 3 and it requires the correct model vgh to obtain the correct value while the bias increases when the observation noise sdx gets larger as expected the estimates of both models become remarkably similar table 3 it should be noted that the transformation to ece90 does not modify the yield prediction uncertainty bounds as shown in fig 4 3 6 representation of salt tolerance by uncertainty ellipses over multiple years the method can now be applied to data from several years of experimentation it is already clear from the data that the estimated parameters will differ from year to year to get an impression of the salt tolerance over the years the uncertainty ellipses for the mh model obtained with the individual data have been plotted for the alternative form with ece90 fig 12 for easier interpretation the slope is represented here as the percentage decline per unit soil ece change in some years with the maas hoffman model it appeared not possible to obtain a reliable estimate for the threshold ece the inverse in the matrix j t j in eq a 3 cannot be evaluated because the matrix is singular it can be shown that this occurs when there are no data below the threshold ece so that the model cannot be distinguished from a linear regression model this would be different if an independent measurement of the zero observed effect yield y 0 would be available but this is not the case in the vgh model the above problem does not occur since all data contribute to the curve hence to obtain approximate uncertainty bounds in the ill conditioned case the mh curve was directed to the y o found from the vgh model this was done by adding some additional pseudo data pairs at ece 0 three extra points with the vgh y o and two points plus or minus one standard deviation this procedure was tested extensively and was found to provide approximate uncertainty bounds that coincide well with the simultaneous prediction error like the one shown in fig 4 the area with most overlap of the ellipsoidal regions can be considered as the most likely multi annual estimate thus leading to an ece90 of about 5 5 ds m with a decline rate of roughly 5 5 per ds m in this case there is little difference between averaging or not over the treatment mean seasonal soil ece not shown similar plots can be made for the vangenuchten hoffman model not shown 4 concluding remarks our improved methodology to assess salt tolerance of crops resolves a number of issues in the current estimation of salt tolerance parameters from field trials the success of our proposed method depends upon the success of the field trial and does not provide a solution for additional issues that are inherent in final yield field trials a common prerequisites is the prevention of other limiting factors such as water stress in addition variation in soil salinity during the season cannot always be avoided but the effects are hard to investigate from final yield observations alone the method can cope with yield variations between years but method nor final yield field trials can unravel the causes such as variation in breed material differences in plant soil interaction differences in soil biotics and the effect of growth stage on salinity tolerance with these limitations in mind we showed that the ordinary least squares method provides an objective manner to assess the salt tolerance of crops the associated analysis of the parameter uncertainties and correlations reveals that unavoidable noise alone is already responsible for part of the variety in salt tolerance values reported in the literature underlining the necessity to perform experiments over a number of years in general the zero observed effect yield must be considered as a parameter that needs to be estimated as well the customary estimation from relative rather than absolute yields is prone to error unless the reference yield y 0 is known with large precision efforts in the field to assess the zero observed effect yield will be rewarding as pin pointing this parameter reduces the uncertainties the uncertainty in the soil salinity as the independent variable leads to estimation bias the bias reduces when the proportion of the noise that cannot be explained by known variation in treatment salinity is lower in high noise situations the effect of bias can be mitigated by averaging the soil salinities of replicate fields with the same target salinity prior to estimation averaging also results in lower variance of the parameters in that case at salt farm texel the bias is relatively low the situation in other field test sites can be readily judged by performing a similar numerical experiment our expectation is that in carefully designed experiments bias is not a major problem the parameter estimation variance obtained from a single experiment is generally a good measure of the 95 confidence bound of an ensemble of measurements but with high soil salinity variance the reliability of the 2 σ boundary of the slope is substantially lower the correlation between the estimates for instance between zero observed effect yield and threshold must be considered when judging separately reported uncertainty bounds in calculating the prediction uncertainty of the expected yield at a specific soil salinity our method automatically accounts for the covariance the prediction uncertainty is smaller than when the bounds are considered independently the plot of the ellipsoidal uncertainty ranges is offered as a convenient way to aggregate the data over multiple years the s shape model has better mathematical properties than the threshold model but the ece50 is a less attractive parameter in practice on the other hand the threshold ece is often hard to determine and its true existence may be questioned as an alternative to both the ece50 as well as the threshold ece the ece90 might be a better choice while its value can easily be obtained from original model parameters its uncertainty cannot it has been shown that by a simple model transformation its estimation uncertainty can be estimated it turns out that bias and estimation variance are lower than for the threshold ec and its estimate is more robust against the choice of the descriptive model hence we advocate our method to reduce statistical issues prevailing in current estimation approaches and recommend ec90 as an agronomical sensible measure of salt

11187,in the context of global warming as drought episodes become increasingly frequent it is crucial to accurately measure the impacts of droughts on the overall performance of agrosystems this study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale the analysis is conducted in spain using a spatially detailed 12 year 2003 2015 dataset on crop yields including different types of cereals yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level the standardised precipitation index spi computed at different temporal aggregation levels and two satellite based drought indices the vegetation condition index vci and the temperature condition index tci were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area models resting on satellite based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated in particular vci tci models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70 and 40 of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability respectively we also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones instead of models at the national scale were considered all the results were cross validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real time forecasting exercise results from

european countries such as france or germany lópez querol et al 2016 constrained by more adverse heat and drought conditions and shorter growing cycles with the exception of maize typically grown in

these blocks is then subdivided in 100 equivalent cells of 1 km 1 km or 100 ha squared segments of 700 m side anchored in the southwest extreme of each cell are the basic units that are sampled every year see centre and right panel of fig 1 blocks are sampled according to their production intensity three segments are visited in extensive blocks and from nine to fifteen in intensive or very intensive production areas around 6 million hectares of cereals are planted on average in spain every year production is widespread around the whole territory but intensively located at the central plateaus and the banks of the main rivers ebro duero and guadalquivir as evidenced in fig 2 top for wheat and barley see fig s1 for oat rye and grain maize there are about a dozen species of cereals grown in spain every year in this study we focus on the five most representatives namely winter wheat including common wheat and durum wheat barley oat rye and grain maize the four first species are eminently rainfed whilst grain maize is mostly irrigated these five classes cover 96 of the total area and 93 of the total production of cereals in spain as shown in fig 2 bottom winter wheat and barley yields have remained relatively stable since the beginning of the sample period see fig s2 for oat rye and grain maize corroborating the generalised evidence of the stagnation of crop yields

total rainfall observed at a particular location during a window period of n months with the long term rainfall distribution for the same period at that location spi is computed on a monthly basis for a moving window of fixed length in which rainfall is accumulated the length of the accumulated period typically takes values from 1 to 24 months depending on which type of drought needs to be evaluated for example short accumulation periods e g spi 1 to spi 3 are better related with drought impacts on seasonal herbaceous systems while larger spis spi 9 or spi 12 are better connected with impacts on perennial crops contreras and hunink 2015 we concentrated on shorter accumulation periods 1 3 and 6 more linked to agricultural impacts and calculated spi based on a monthly precipitation

spatial resolution of 0 5 for each accumulation period precipitation frequencies were fitted a gamma probability distribution the resulting cumulative distribution function was then transformed into that of a standardised normal variable with zero mean and variance equal to one spi values were measured in units of standard deviation from the long term mean of the standardised distribution and range from 3 extreme dry to 3 extreme wet spi values were obtained from the original precipitation time series using the r package spei https cran r project org web packages spei index html 2 3 satellite based drought indices three satellite based drought indices the vegetation condition index vci the temperature condition index tci and the average of the two the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995 1997 were used to quantify local drought severity these indices were retrieved from the infosequia drought monitoring system www infosequia eu a satellite based web mapping climate service for the operational monitoring of droughts at the spanish national level the vci is retrieved from the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and provides a normalised relative index in which the current observed value of ndvi is compared against the extreme limits minimum and maximum values observed during a reference period tci is similarly computed but using instead land surface temperature lst as input while vci provides a good surrogate of the vegetation stress due to wetness conditions the tci is more closely related to the thermal stress of vegetation the vhi computed as the average of both indices provides a combined effect of both stressors and thus represents a good overall indicator of the health status of vegetation vci tci and vhi values range between 0 highest level of drought severity and 100 lowest level of severity these indices are widely employed in drought impact assessments on agriculture wmo and gwp 2016 bokusheva et al 2016 for any desired time step t vci

ndvimax lstmax refer to the historical minimum and maximum values at each desired time step over the study period composite values to calculate both indices were extracted from the collection 6 0 of modis products in particular we used mod13a2 and myd13a2 didan 2015a 2015b for ndvi and myd11a2 wan et al 2015 for lst 2 4 spatial aggregation the basic spatial unit used in this analysis was the agricultural district this classification stems from an initiative of the spanish ministry of agriculture in the 1970s to respond to the need of implementing and designing more efficient agricultural policies the country was divided in non legislative medium sized spatial units larger than a municipality and smaller than a province with homogenous agricultural characteristics such as similar potential output agro management practices and agro climatic patterns the total number of agricultural districts in spain is 346 excluding canary islands with an average area of 14 10 4 ha and a standard deviation of 9 4 10 4 ha fig s3 shows a geographical description of the agricultural districts classification the motivation for this spatial aggregation is twofold first the existence of limitations inherent to survey data usually answered vaguely and incompletely potential farm level uncertainties as well as data inaccuracies and gaps can be largely smoothed out by aggregating individual farm level data to a wider spatial unit second the mismatch in spatial resolution between the spi 0 5 and the remotely sensed variables from infosequia 1 km can a priori bias the regression results in favour of the latter by upscaling the spatial level of analysis a fairer comparison between all candidate predictors can be done in this study geo referenced area weighted crop yields and drought indicators were thus spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level 2 5 statistical crop models statistical models of crop yield typically express either yield levels or yield anomalies as the dependent variable models based on yield levels usually account for a time trend to control for the combined effects of changes in agro management practices environmental and socio economic factors and climatic changes and a weather related component driving crop yield variability we used the following pooled yield level model for each crop 4 y i t α i β t i γ i x i t ε i t where yit is the crop yield level in agricultural district i at growing season t αi represents an agricultural district fixed effect β is a vector of loadings of t xit represents the vector of candidate predictor at different frequencies over the growing season and εit are the residuals considering the spanish annual calendar for crops oteros et al 2015 a growing season between october and june was used for winter wheat barley oat and rye for these crops candidate predictors were quarterly aggregated to capture three different growing stages of the plant early or tilling stage october december mid or anthesis stage january march and late or grain filling stage april june for grain maize a growing period between march and september was considered with candidate predictors aggregated in equally spaced two month periods additionally yield anomalies relating inter annual changes of crop yields to inter annual changes of weather variables were calculated to calculate yield anomalies yield levels for every agricultural district i were standardised using the z score formula as follows 5 z i t y i t y i σ y i being yit the crop yield level in agricultural district i at growing season t y i the sample average yield of agricultural district i and σ y i its standard deviation zit has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 the resulting rescaled variables represent the dependent variable in the following model 6 z i t i δ i x i t u i t where yield anomalies zit of agricultural district i at growing season t are linearly related to the candidate predictors xit with coefficients δ i and residuals uit as the dependent variable is standardised no constant term is required model residuals should be normally distributed independent and homoskedastic we tested these assumptions using the shapiro durbin watson and breusch pagan tests also an alternative method to calculate yield anomalies was considered more specifically yield anomalies were obtained by estimating a temporal trend with linear and quadratic terms alternative detrended yields were obtained as follows 7 z i t y i t θ ˆ 1 t θ ˆ 2 t 2 where parameters θ ˆ 1 and θ ˆ 2 were estimated via ols by regressing yit on t and t2 the robustness of our results was evaluated for all crops and modelling methods several measures of quality fit and prediction accuracy were calculated such as variable adjusted r2 root mean squared error rmse akaike information criterion aic or model efficiency index ns in addition a cross validation estimation experiment was designed in particular a repeated n 1000 sequence of regressions from a random subset of the whole sample 70 was estimated and tested in the remaining 30 observations robust rmse values were calculated for all crops and models 2 6 predictive ability a real time forecasting exercise was designed to assess the effectiveness of the prediction models to describe actual yield variability the region of castilla y león which includes a total number of 59 agricultural districts was selected for this statistical experiment castilla y león has the largest proportion of cereal production in spain see fig 2 modelling was performed on a rolling window over a 5 year period 2011 2015 models of crop yield anomalies eq 6 were re calibrated after a complete vintage of data yield and drought indices was released in season yield anomaly forecasts were updated as new weather data became available in quarters months where weather data was not yet released average historic values were used the three different spi based models were compared with the benchmark vci tci model and an optimised version of the latter fitted to continental climate regions including only agricultural districts with less than 5 of urban land according to the most updated version of the corine land cover project https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover a false alarm yield anomaly detection rate ratio of false positives and false negatives to total number of forecasts was computed to compare the performance ability of each model 3 results 3 1 explaining crop yield levels and anomalies pooled ols estimation for representative agricultural districts more than 10 years of observed yields was performed for every crop and candidate predictor in table 1 variable adjusted coefficients of determination r2 adj for all the competing models are presented satellite based vci tci and vci tci models performed systematically better than precipitation based spi n models in explaining both crop yield levels and crop yield anomalies seventy percent of winter wheat yield level variability was explained when quarterly values of satellite indices were combined the overall fit was slightly better than that obtained with only the vci 69 3 or the tci 66 1 in all cases models built with satellite based indicators showed superior fit than those based upon precipitation based the use of satellite data improved r2 adj figures by 7 to 10 as shown in the second part of table 1 the performance of the competing models to describe wheat yield anomalies decreased overall but relatively less in the case of satellite based models r2 adj percentage gains from using satellite based indices and their combination were substantial above 40 results for barley oat and rye were quantitatively comparable to those shown above for winter wheat yield level explanatory power of satellite based models ranged between 50 70 and was always greater than spi based models r2 adj gains were more marked in yield anomaly models with satellite based models almost doubling the explanatory power of precipitation based models in some cases among the spi models spi 3 models performed better than the others the three month spi provides a comparison of the precipitation over a specific 3 month period with the precipitation totals from the same 3 month period for all the years included in the historical record thus making this indicator particularly suitable for the chosen temporal three month aggregation scheme several other goodness of fit and model evaluation statistics were calculated such as root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns and akaike information criterion aic all of them support the messages delivered in this subsection with regards to the r2 adj analysis detailed results for all competing models can be seen in tables s2 s4 of the winter crops considered in this study winter wheat barley oat and rye 83 are rainfed mapama 2015 the few irrigated fields were excluded from the analysis fitting eqs 4 and 6 to grain maize data yielded notably different results the explanatory power of both types of models decreased substantially compared to the crops considered before the combination of vci and tci explained a maximum yield level variability of 25 3 2 robustness of the results to assess the consistency of the main results several experiments were conducted firstly a cross validation procedure was designed as described in the last part of section 2 5 the prediction error of each model was tested by calculating the rmse both within the training dataset and the test dataset table s5 summarises these average robust statistics for each crop species and candidate model these results confirm those presented in section 3 1 secondly individual models were fitted to each agricultural district due to the short studied period 2003 2015 local estimations could suffer from small sample size problems to reduce the impact of this limitation a loocv exercise was applied to individual districts with more than 10 observed yields also to avoid potentially overfitted models the vhi was used a summary of the findings is presented in fig 3 and fig 4 the panels in fig 3 show for each district two interesting features firstly the already mentioned better performance of crop yield level models against crop yield anomaly models and secondly the confirmation of the better fit of satellite based models versus spi1 left spi3 centre and spi6 right at the local level fig 4 describes geographically where individual r2 adj gains are located which are concentrated to the west and south hemisphere of the country better fit of satellite based models against spi models is also observed for the cases of barley oat and rye fig s4 s6 meanwhile localised r2 adj gains show uneven and sparse as seen in fig s7 s9 lastly an alternative method to detrend yields was considered following eq 7 a quadratic time trend was estimated and new yield anomalies were obtained eq 6 was re calculated with this new dependent variable the findings in section 3 1 regarding the explanatory power of the candidate models and the better performance of satellite based models are confirmed by this scenario no measurable differences stem from the detrending method chosen see table s6 for detailed results 3 3 efficient temporal aggregation of predictors quarterly versus monthly aggregation an operational statistical model for forecasting crop yields should be based on drought indicators at a high frequency infosequia variables are provided at a maximum of 8 day frequency whereas accumulated precipitation data is only available on a monthly basis eqs 4 and 6 were adapted at this stage to accommodate monthly indicators the fit of the new models is described in table s7 the addition of more regressors created a generalised and proportional increase in the overall fit of the available models satellite based models continued to outperform spi based models both for crop yield levels and yield anomalies interestingly the spi 1 family of models behaved better than models based on spi 3 because spi 1 figures describe monthly precipitation anomalies better by construction 3 4 accounting for different climate zones the use of climate zones to upscale process based or statistical crop models is widespread at the global and national scale geographic areas are configured based on homogeneity in weather variables that have the greatest influence on crop yield in spain due to its large size there are marked differences between provinces close to the coast and those belonging to the vast central plateau or meseta a continental influenced climate with hot dry summers and cold winters beneficial to cereals seeds requiring vernalisation processes in the north the cantabrian mountains the basque country cantabria asturias and galicia have a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters on the mediterranean coast the climate is moderate with rain in spring and autumn following fernández díaz et al 1987 three different climate zones were distinguished namely mediterranean continental and atlantic the geographical distribution of each zone can be seen in fig s10 crop yield level and yield anomaly models were fitted separately for each climatic area results were partially conditioned by the presence of each crop in a specific area r2 adj values using vci tci as predictors for each crop for the three different climatic areas are shown in table 2 continental specific crop models showed better results than the pooled models presented in section 3 1 winter wheat yield level variability is highly explained 75 in continental areas the same was observed for yield anomaly models where 20 gains in yield variability explanatory power were observed compared to the benchmark model similar results were obtained for barley the other predominant crop in continental areas experiencing r2 adj gains of 7 5 and 20 5 for yield level and yield anomaly models respectively increases in explanatory power of oat and rye modelling were weaker than those observed for winter wheat and barley goodness of fit in mediterranean and atlantic areas was negatively affected reflecting the existence of additional orographic or climate variables influencing crop yield 3 5 out of sample performance real time forecasting exercise as seen in the left panel of fig 5 satellite based models predict winter wheat yield anomalies better than spi based models in real time in general as more information about the current season comes available nearly all models become more accurate the optimised vci tci model continental climate zone and 5 of urban land delivers a better performance skill than the benchmark vci tci model benefiting from cleaner pixels and climate specific parameterisation similar conclusions are drawn from the forecast derived from monthly models right almost for all lead times the optimised vci tci model provides better forecasts on average with increasing performance as the cropping season unfolds and more data comes available results for barley are qualitatively similar to those of winter wheat see fig s11 so are those for oat and rye but the relatively reduced number of observations of these two last crops limits the value of the forecast exercise as seen in fig s11 s13 4 discussion and conclusions satellite based models showed better performance than spi based models for both crop yield levels and crop yield anomalies and for all considered crops yield level models were able to explain about 70 of winter wheat and barley yield level variability a remarkable figure given the simplicity of the modelling approach and the high degree of spatial resolution crop yield anomaly models of wheat and barley explained 35 40 of total yield variability a similar figure to that obtained by other authors in different study regions quiring and papakryiaokou 2003 lobell et al 2014 ceglar et al 2017 for oat and rye similar results were obtained in qualitative terms but estimations suffered from sparse data and reduced sample size our results for grain maize predominantly irrigated in spain were very poor for both precipitation based and satellite based models probably conditioned by the smaller range of variability of maize yields and because of assuming a fixed agronomic calendar for all cropping systems it is reasonable to think that growing cycles are adjusted to latitude heat and other climatic factors incorporating this feature into our models may well result in an improvement of the overall fit considering alternative drought indicators such as total evapotranspiration may increase the fit of maize models zdeněk et al 2017 for the case of wheat distinguishing between common and durum wheat the latter regarded as being more resistant to drought and heat stress could also enhance our model performance we also applied crop models to different climate geographical zones on the premise that different agroclimatic regions at the national scale may have different model statistics due to large climate heterogeneity between zones van wart et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2018 we found that there was an r2 adj gain in concentrating our modelling on continental climate areas where national cereal is dominant further investigation is required though to assess the effect of agronomic calendar and phenology in our estimations for the sake of simplicity we imposed in our models a fixed agronomic calendar for all climate zones running each climate zone model adjusted to the timing calendar and length phenology of the growing cycle would shed some more light into our final results this statement will be tested in future research also the overall performance of our approach to assess drought impacts in more humid climates may improve if the water balance of these areas is taken into account vicente serrano et al 2010 or if non local hydrology e g river discharge is included zampieri et al 2018 finally we demonstrated through a simple real time forecasting exercise the higher performance of satellite based models as operational drought assessment tools both at the quarterly and monthly temporal scale with satellite based models better avoiding false positives and false negatives yield anomalies more work and alternative measures however are required to validate the forecast accuracy of these models the use of a probabilistic approach that incorporates short term drought forecasts can be also considered for future exercises madadgar et al 2017 results derived from this analysis demonstrate that 1 finer spatial resolution provided by satellite products capture local drought conditions better than drought measures based on climate gridded datasets which usually rest on data provided by a coarse network of weather stations aufhammer et al 2013 2 remote sensing data related to vegetation health give a better picture of local drought conditions than drought indices that only rely on rainfall mainly because vegetation related indices inherently consider the local biophysical soil slope and climate conditions the current study used two common indices describing the vegetation status of the plant future local scale assessments could expand on the number of climate land surface variables included in our models and use it to more comprehensively understand crop specific sensitivities to drought other available satellite based indicators not currently used for operational drought monitoring such as near surface air relative humidity data may improve the performance of our models and tell us more of the spatial patterns and temporal trends of crop yields aghakouchak et al 2015 also remotely sensed soil moisture from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos or the soil moisture active and passive smap missions may be incorporated as additional indicators of agricultural drought sánchez et al 2016 a geographically weighted combination of the available indicators could also result in an increase of the explanatory power of our models páscoa et al 2017 even though we advocate in this study for the use of satellite based measures to detect agronomical drought stress because of the limitations of climate gridded data the recent proliferation of local good quality high resolution precipitation gridded datasets quintana seguí et al 2017 has yet to be tested in local scale drought assessments in the case of spain the version 4 of the spain02 dataset herrera et al 2016 shows a horizontal resolution of up to 0 11 five times larger than the cru dataset and very similar to that of the remote sensing products used in the current study there also exists a novel trend in the literature claiming for coupling statistical models with seasonal forecasts stemming from climate models or an ensemble of climate models hao et al 2018 this hybrid modelling strategy opens an entire avenue for research and has yet to be further explored in regional and local assessments ceglar et al 2018 as for example in our case study area there is an increasing need for weather and climate services that provide user focused information on anticipated drought impacts to improve agricultural water management van den hurk et al 2016 however there is still a gap between what stakeholders in the agricultural sector need in terms of spatial resolution i e at least district level and the meteorological drought information available from observations or climate models i e coarser information potentially useful at the provincial level the current study confirmed that high resolution satellite based drought information portrays drought impacts at the district scale better than meteorological drought information still for drought impact forecasting seasonal forecasts from dynamic climate models based on coarse meteorological information iizumi et al 2013 may still have an added value the predictive quality of seasonal climate models is still increasing and has shown to be useful for certain areas in europe turco et al 2017 potentially satellite based information on current drought conditions can be used to downscale coarser forecasts of crop yield impacts new guidelines for updating agricultural water and drought management plans in all the spanish river basins recognise the need to include spi as an index to be monitored for agricultural drought emergency plans this study suggests that satellite based drought indices may complement spi as they have been demonstrated here to be more directly related to crop yield impacts

11187,in the context of global warming as drought episodes become increasingly frequent it is crucial to accurately measure the impacts of droughts on the overall performance of agrosystems this study aims to compare the effectiveness of meteorological drought indices against satellite based agronomical drought indices as crop yield explanatory factors in statistical models calibrated at a local scale the analysis is conducted in spain using a spatially detailed 12 year 2003 2015 dataset on crop yields including different types of cereals yields and drought indices were spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level the standardised precipitation index spi computed at different temporal aggregation levels and two satellite based drought indices the vegetation condition index vci and the temperature condition index tci were used to characterise the dynamics of drought severity conditions in the study area models resting on satellite based indices showed higher performance in explaining yield levels as well as yield anomalies for all the crops evaluated in particular vci tci models of winter wheat and barley were able to explain 70 and 40 of annual crop yield level and crop yield anomaly variability respectively we also observed gains in explanatory power when models for climate zones instead of models at the national scale were considered all the results were cross validated on subsamples of the whole dataset and on models fitted to individual agricultural districts and their predictive accuracy was assessed with a real time forecasting exercise results from this study highlight the potential for including satellite based drought indices in agricultural decision support systems e g agricultural drought early warning systems crop yield forecasting models

climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts in continental europe and the mediterranean countries in the next few years lehner et al 2017 these extreme events threaten global food security and local agri food markets lesk et al 2016 hadebe et al 2017 it is therefore necessary to detect droughts at an early phase and more importantly assess their impacts on the productivity of cropping systems only then risk control and mitigation measures can be taken ipcc 2012 unisdr 2013 however for an accurate estimation of drought impacts on crop productivity there are still various data related and methodological challenges that should be addressed siebert et al 2017 in particular drought impact assessments require a time series of local drought conditions with

resolution which facilitates its incorporation into local drought yield analyses to assess the relationship between drought conditions and crop yields either process based methods or statistical data

as they are flexible and easily applicable michel and makowski 2013 showed that linear models outperform in many cases more complex statistical crop models in explaining yield variability this work focuses on the main cereal crops cultivated in spain i e wheat barley grain maize oat and rye as they correspond to the largest cultivated area and are used for human and animal consumption in 2014 these five classes covered 96 of the total harvested area and 93 of the total national production of cereals mapama 2015 cereal yields in spain are generally lower than those observed in other european countries such as france or germany lópez querol et al 2016 constrained by more adverse heat and drought conditions and shorter growing cycles with the exception of maize typically grown in summer under irrigation regimes cereals in spain are predominantly rainfed mapama 2015 and thus highly vulnerable to drought events even though they appear to be more resistant to water deficit than other crop species daryanto et al 2017 the aim of this study is to locally quantify the ability of meteorological and satellite based drought indices to explain factors of cereal yield variability in water limited environments using high resolution agricultural and drought data results were validated by considering different climate zones pre processing methods and temporal aggregation levels and by assessing the models forecast performance with a real time exercise 2 materials and methods 2 1 crop yield data farm level yields and harvested areas spanning the years 2003 to 2015 were retrieved from the esyrce encuesta sobre superficies y rendimientos de cultivos dataset see table s1 for descriptive statistics of this dataset esyrce is an annual comprehensive field level survey providing data on agricultural surface and crop yields in spain esyrce serves as the spanish input for the european union s farm accountancy data network fadn http ec europa eu agriculture rica which describes in detail the income and productivity of agricultural holdings throughout the european union and represents a tool for evaluating eu s common agricultural policy esyrce is based on a conglomerate stratified sampling method the universal transversal mercator utm10 coordinate system is used to build 10km sided blocks covering the entire country as is shown in the left panel of fig 1 each of these blocks is then subdivided in 100 equivalent cells of 1 km 1 km or 100 ha squared segments of 700 m side anchored in the southwest extreme of each cell are the basic units that are sampled every year see centre and right panel of fig 1 blocks are sampled according to their production intensity three segments are visited in extensive blocks and from nine to fifteen in intensive or very intensive production areas around 6 million hectares of cereals are planted on average in spain every year production is widespread around the whole territory but intensively located at the central plateaus and the banks of the main rivers ebro duero and guadalquivir as evidenced in fig 2 top for wheat and barley see fig s1 for oat rye and grain maize there are about a dozen species of cereals grown in spain every year in this study we focus on the five most representatives namely winter wheat including common wheat and durum wheat barley oat rye and grain maize the four first species are eminently rainfed whilst grain maize is mostly irrigated these five classes cover 96 of the total area and 93 of the total production of cereals in spain as shown in fig 2 bottom winter wheat and barley yields have remained relatively stable since the beginning of the sample period see fig s2 for oat rye and grain maize corroborating the generalised evidence of the stagnation of crop yields across europe during the last two decades lobell and moore 2015 ceglar et al 2016 2 2 a meteorological drought index the spi the standardized precipitation index spi n mckee et al 1993 compares the total rainfall observed at a particular location during a window period of n months with the long term rainfall distribution for the same period at that location spi is computed on a monthly basis for a moving window of fixed length in which rainfall is accumulated the length of the accumulated period typically takes values from 1 to 24 months depending on which type of drought needs to be evaluated for example short accumulation periods e g spi 1 to spi 3 are better related with drought impacts on seasonal herbaceous systems while larger spis spi 9 or spi 12 are better connected with impacts on perennial crops contreras and hunink 2015 we concentrated on shorter accumulation periods 1 3 and 6 more linked to agricultural impacts and calculated spi based on a monthly precipitation gridded dataset from the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia cru ts version 3 25 harris et al 2014 this updated version covers the period 1901 2016 at the global scale and has a spatial resolution of 0 5 for each accumulation period precipitation frequencies were fitted a gamma probability distribution the resulting cumulative distribution function was then transformed into that of a standardised normal variable with zero mean and variance equal to one spi values were measured in units of standard deviation from the long term mean of the standardised distribution and range from 3 extreme dry to 3 extreme wet spi values were obtained from the original precipitation time series using the r package spei https cran r project org web packages spei index html 2 3 satellite based drought indices three satellite based drought indices the vegetation condition index vci the temperature condition index tci and the average of the two the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995 1997 were used to quantify local drought severity these indices were retrieved from the infosequia drought monitoring system www infosequia eu a satellite based web mapping climate service for the operational monitoring of droughts at the spanish national level the vci is retrieved from the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and provides a normalised relative index in which the current observed value of ndvi is compared against the extreme limits minimum and maximum values observed during a reference period tci is similarly computed but using instead land surface temperature lst as input while vci provides a good surrogate of the vegetation stress due to wetness conditions the tci is more closely related to the thermal stress of vegetation the vhi computed as the average of both indices provides a combined effect of both stressors and thus represents a good overall indicator of the health status of vegetation vci tci and vhi values range between 0 highest level of drought severity and 100 lowest level of severity these indices are widely employed in drought impact assessments on agriculture wmo and gwp 2016 bokusheva et al 2016 for any desired time step t vci and tci are computed as 1 v c i t 100 n d v i t n d v i m i n n d v i m a x n d v i m i n 2 t c i t 100 l s t m a x l s t t l s t m a x l s t m i n 3 v h i t v c i t t c i t 2 where ndvimin lstmin and ndvimax lstmax refer to the historical minimum and maximum values at each desired time step over the study period composite values to calculate both indices were extracted from the collection 6 0 of modis products in particular we used mod13a2 and myd13a2 didan 2015a 2015b for ndvi and myd11a2 wan et al 2015 for lst 2 4 spatial aggregation the basic spatial unit used in this analysis was the agricultural district this classification stems from an initiative of the spanish ministry of agriculture in the 1970s to respond to the need of implementing and designing more efficient agricultural policies the country was divided in non legislative medium sized spatial units larger than a municipality and smaller than a province with homogenous agricultural characteristics such as similar potential output agro management practices and agro climatic patterns the total number of agricultural districts in spain is 346 excluding canary islands with an average area of 14 10 4 ha and a standard deviation of 9 4 10 4 ha fig s3 shows a geographical description of the agricultural districts classification the motivation for this spatial aggregation is twofold first the existence of limitations inherent to survey data usually answered vaguely and incompletely potential farm level uncertainties as well as data inaccuracies and gaps can be largely smoothed out by aggregating individual farm level data to a wider spatial unit second the mismatch in spatial resolution between the spi 0 5 and the remotely sensed variables from infosequia 1 km can a priori bias the regression results in favour of the latter by upscaling the spatial level of analysis a fairer comparison between all candidate predictors can be done in this study geo referenced area weighted crop yields and drought indicators were thus spatially aggregated at the agricultural district level 2 5 statistical crop models statistical models of crop yield typically express either yield levels or yield anomalies as the dependent variable models based on yield levels usually account for a time trend to control for the combined effects of changes in agro management practices environmental and socio economic factors and climatic changes and a weather related component driving crop yield variability we used the following pooled yield level model for each crop 4 y i t α i β t i γ i x i t ε i t where yit is the crop yield level in agricultural district i at growing season t αi represents an agricultural district fixed effect β is a vector of loadings of t xit represents the vector of candidate predictor at different frequencies over the growing season and εit are the residuals considering the spanish annual calendar for crops oteros et al 2015 a growing season between october and june was used for winter wheat barley oat and rye for these crops candidate predictors were quarterly aggregated to capture three different growing stages of the plant early or tilling stage october december mid or anthesis stage january march and late or grain filling stage april june for grain maize a growing period between march and september was considered with candidate predictors aggregated in equally spaced two month periods additionally yield anomalies relating inter annual changes of crop yields to inter annual changes of weather variables were calculated to calculate yield anomalies yield levels for every agricultural district i were standardised using the z score formula as follows 5 z i t y i t y i σ y i being yit the crop yield level in agricultural district i at growing season t y i the sample average yield of agricultural district i and σ y i its standard deviation zit has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 the resulting rescaled variables represent the dependent variable in the following model 6 z i t i δ i x i t u i t where yield anomalies zit of agricultural district i at growing season t are linearly related to the candidate predictors xit with coefficients δ i and residuals uit as the dependent variable is standardised no constant term is required model residuals should be normally distributed independent and homoskedastic we tested these assumptions using the shapiro durbin watson and breusch pagan tests also an alternative method to calculate yield anomalies was considered more specifically yield anomalies were obtained by estimating a temporal trend with linear and quadratic terms alternative detrended yields were obtained as follows 7 z i t y i t θ ˆ 1 t θ ˆ 2 t 2 where parameters θ ˆ 1 and θ ˆ 2 were estimated via ols by regressing yit on t and t2 the robustness of our results was evaluated for all crops and modelling methods several measures of quality fit and prediction accuracy were calculated such as variable adjusted r2 root mean squared error rmse akaike information criterion aic or model efficiency index ns in addition a cross validation estimation experiment was designed in particular a repeated n 1000 sequence of regressions from a random subset of the whole sample 70 was estimated and tested in the remaining 30 observations robust rmse values were calculated for all crops and models 2 6 predictive ability a real time forecasting exercise was designed to assess the effectiveness of the prediction models to describe actual yield variability the region of castilla y león which includes a total number of 59 agricultural districts was selected for this statistical experiment castilla y león has the largest proportion of cereal production in spain see fig 2 modelling was performed on a rolling window over a 5 year period 2011 2015 models of crop yield anomalies eq 6 were re calibrated after a complete vintage of data yield and drought indices was released in season yield anomaly forecasts were updated as new weather data became available in quarters months where weather data was not yet released average historic values were used the three different spi based models were compared with the benchmark vci tci model and an optimised version of the latter fitted to continental climate regions including only agricultural districts with less than 5 of urban land according to the most updated version of the corine land cover project https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover a false alarm yield anomaly detection rate ratio of false positives and false negatives to total number of forecasts was computed to compare the performance ability of each model 3 results 3 1 explaining crop yield levels and anomalies pooled ols estimation for representative agricultural districts more than 10 years of observed yields was performed for every crop and candidate predictor in table 1 variable adjusted coefficients of determination r2 adj for all the competing models are presented satellite based vci tci and vci tci models performed systematically better than precipitation based spi n models in explaining both crop yield levels and crop yield anomalies seventy percent of winter wheat yield level variability was explained when quarterly values of satellite indices were combined the overall fit was slightly better than that obtained with only the vci 69 3 or the tci 66 1 in all cases models built with satellite based indicators showed superior fit than those based upon precipitation based the use of satellite data improved r2 adj figures by 7 to 10 as shown in the second part of table 1 the performance of the competing models to describe wheat yield anomalies decreased overall but relatively less in the case of satellite based models r2 adj percentage gains from using satellite based indices and their combination were substantial above 40 results for barley oat and rye were quantitatively comparable to those shown above for winter wheat yield level explanatory power of satellite based models ranged between 50 70 and was always greater than spi based models r2 adj gains were more marked in yield anomaly models with satellite based models almost doubling the explanatory power of precipitation based models in some cases among the spi models spi 3 models performed better than the others the three month spi provides a comparison of the precipitation over a specific 3 month period with the precipitation totals from the same 3 month period for all the years included in the historical record thus making this indicator particularly suitable for the chosen temporal three month aggregation scheme several other goodness of fit and model evaluation statistics were calculated such as root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns and akaike information criterion aic all of them support the messages delivered in this subsection with regards to the r2 adj analysis detailed results for all competing models can be seen in tables s2 s4 of the winter crops considered in this study winter wheat barley oat and rye 83 are rainfed mapama 2015 the few irrigated fields were excluded from the analysis fitting eqs 4 and 6 to grain maize data yielded notably different results the explanatory power of both types of models decreased substantially compared to the crops considered before the combination of vci and tci explained a maximum yield level variability of 25 3 2 robustness of the results to assess the consistency of the main results several experiments were conducted firstly a cross validation procedure was designed as described in the last part of section 2 5 the prediction error of each model was tested by calculating the rmse both within the training dataset and the test dataset table s5 summarises these average robust statistics for each crop species and candidate model these results confirm those presented in section 3 1 secondly individual models were fitted to each agricultural district due to the short studied period 2003 2015 local estimations could suffer from small sample size problems to reduce the impact of this limitation a loocv exercise was applied to individual districts with more than 10 observed yields also to avoid potentially overfitted models the vhi was used a summary of the findings is presented in fig 3 and fig 4 the panels in fig 3 show for each district two interesting features firstly the already mentioned better performance of crop yield level models against crop yield anomaly models and secondly the confirmation of the better fit of satellite based models versus spi1 left spi3 centre and spi6 right at the local level fig 4 describes geographically where individual r2 adj gains are located which are concentrated to the west and south hemisphere of the country better fit of satellite based models against spi models is also observed for the cases of barley oat and rye fig s4 s6 meanwhile localised r2 adj gains show uneven and sparse as seen in fig s7 s9 lastly an alternative method to detrend yields was considered following eq 7 a quadratic time trend was estimated and new yield anomalies were obtained eq 6 was re calculated with this new dependent variable the findings in section 3 1 regarding the explanatory power of the candidate models and the better performance of satellite based models are confirmed by this scenario no measurable differences stem from the detrending method chosen see table s6 for detailed results 3 3 efficient temporal aggregation of predictors quarterly versus monthly aggregation an operational statistical model for forecasting crop yields should be based on drought indicators at a high frequency infosequia variables are provided at a maximum of 8 day frequency whereas accumulated precipitation data is only available on a monthly basis eqs 4 and 6 were adapted at this stage to accommodate monthly indicators the fit of the new models is described in table s7 the addition of more regressors created a generalised and proportional increase in the overall fit of the available models satellite based models continued to outperform spi based models both for crop yield levels and yield anomalies interestingly the spi 1 family of models behaved better than models based on spi 3 because spi 1 figures describe monthly precipitation anomalies better by construction 3 4 accounting for different climate zones the use of climate zones to upscale process based or statistical crop models is widespread at the global and national scale geographic areas are configured based on homogeneity in weather variables that have the greatest influence on crop yield in spain due to its large size there are marked differences between provinces close to the coast and those belonging to the vast central plateau or meseta a continental influenced climate with hot dry summers and cold winters beneficial to cereals seeds requiring vernalisation processes in the north the cantabrian mountains the basque country cantabria asturias and galicia have a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters on the mediterranean coast the climate is moderate with rain in spring and autumn following fernández díaz et al 1987 three different climate zones were distinguished namely mediterranean continental and atlantic the geographical distribution of each zone can be seen in fig s10 crop yield level and yield anomaly models were fitted separately for each climatic area results were partially conditioned by the presence of each crop in a specific area r2 adj values using vci tci as predictors for each crop for the three different climatic areas are shown in table 2 continental specific crop models showed better results than the pooled models presented in section 3 1 winter wheat yield level variability is highly explained 75 in continental areas the same was observed for yield anomaly models where 20 gains in yield variability explanatory power were observed compared to the benchmark model similar results were obtained for barley the other predominant crop in continental areas experiencing r2 adj gains of 7 5 and 20 5 for yield level and yield anomaly models respectively increases in explanatory power of oat and rye modelling were weaker than those observed for winter wheat and barley goodness of fit in mediterranean and atlantic areas was negatively affected reflecting the existence of additional orographic or climate variables influencing crop yield 3 5 out of sample performance real time forecasting exercise as seen in the left panel of fig 5 satellite based models predict winter wheat yield anomalies better than spi based models in real time in general as more information about the current season comes available nearly all models become more accurate the optimised vci tci model continental climate zone and 5 of urban land delivers a better performance skill than the benchmark vci tci model benefiting from cleaner pixels and climate specific parameterisation similar conclusions are drawn from the forecast derived from monthly models right almost for all lead times the optimised vci tci model provides better forecasts on average with increasing performance as the cropping season unfolds and more data comes available results for barley are qualitatively similar to those of winter wheat see fig s11 so are those for oat and rye but the relatively reduced number of observations of these two last crops limits the value of the forecast exercise as seen in fig s11 s13 4 discussion and conclusions satellite based models showed better performance than spi based models for both crop yield levels and crop yield anomalies and for all considered crops yield level models were able to explain about 70 of winter wheat and barley yield level variability a remarkable figure given the simplicity of the modelling approach and the high degree of spatial resolution crop yield anomaly models of wheat and barley explained 35 40 of total yield variability a similar figure to that obtained by other authors in different study regions quiring and papakryiaokou 2003 lobell et al 2014 ceglar et al 2017 for oat and rye similar results were obtained in qualitative terms but estimations suffered from sparse data and reduced sample size our results for grain maize predominantly irrigated in spain were very poor for both precipitation based and satellite based models probably conditioned by the smaller range of variability of maize yields and because of assuming a fixed agronomic calendar for all cropping systems it is reasonable to think that growing cycles are adjusted to latitude heat and other climatic factors incorporating this feature into our models may well result in an improvement of the overall fit considering alternative drought indicators such as total evapotranspiration may increase the fit of maize models zdeněk et al 2017 for the case of wheat distinguishing between common and durum wheat the latter regarded as being more resistant to drought and heat stress could also enhance our model performance we also applied crop models to different climate geographical zones on the premise that different agroclimatic regions at the national scale may have different model statistics due to large climate heterogeneity between zones van wart et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2018 we found that there was an r2 adj gain in concentrating our modelling on continental climate areas where national cereal is dominant further investigation is required though to assess the effect of agronomic calendar and phenology in our estimations for the sake of simplicity we imposed in our models a fixed agronomic calendar for all climate zones running each climate zone model adjusted to the timing calendar and length phenology of the growing cycle would shed some more light into our final results this statement will be tested in future research also the overall performance of our approach to assess drought impacts in more humid climates may improve if the water balance of these areas is taken into account vicente serrano et al 2010 or if non local hydrology e g river discharge is included zampieri et al 2018 finally we demonstrated through a simple real time forecasting exercise the higher performance of satellite based models as operational drought assessment tools both at the quarterly and monthly temporal scale with satellite based models better avoiding false positives and false negatives yield anomalies more work and alternative measures however are required to validate the forecast accuracy of these models the use of a probabilistic approach that incorporates short term drought forecasts can be also considered for future exercises madadgar et al 2017 results derived from this analysis demonstrate that 1 finer spatial resolution provided by satellite products capture local drought conditions better than drought measures based on climate gridded datasets which usually rest on data provided by a coarse network of weather stations aufhammer et al 2013 2 remote sensing data related to vegetation health give a better picture of local drought conditions than drought indices that only rely on rainfall mainly because vegetation related indices inherently consider the local biophysical soil slope and climate conditions the current study used two common indices describing the vegetation status of the plant future local scale assessments could expand on the number of climate land surface variables included in our models and use it to more comprehensively understand crop specific sensitivities to drought other available satellite based indicators not currently used for operational drought monitoring such as near surface air relative humidity data may improve the performance of our models and tell us more of the spatial patterns and temporal trends of crop yields aghakouchak et al 2015 also remotely sensed soil moisture from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos or the soil moisture active and passive smap missions may be incorporated as additional indicators of agricultural drought sánchez et al 2016 a geographically weighted combination of the available indicators could also result in an increase of the explanatory power of our models páscoa et al 2017 even though we advocate in this study for the use of satellite based measures to detect agronomical drought stress because of the limitations of climate gridded data the recent proliferation of local good quality high resolution precipitation gridded datasets quintana seguí et al 2017 has yet to be tested in local scale drought assessments in the case of spain the version 4 of the spain02 dataset herrera et al 2016 shows a horizontal resolution of up to 0 11 five times larger than the cru dataset and very similar to that of the remote sensing products used in the current study there also exists a novel trend in the literature claiming for coupling statistical models with seasonal forecasts stemming from climate models or an ensemble of climate models hao et al 2018 this hybrid modelling strategy opens an entire avenue for research and has yet to be further explored in regional and local assessments ceglar et al 2018 as for example in our case study area there is an increasing need for weather and climate services that provide user focused information on anticipated drought impacts to improve agricultural water management van den hurk et al 2016 however there is still a gap between what stakeholders in the agricultural sector need in terms of spatial resolution i e at least district level and the meteorological drought information available from observations or climate models i e coarser information potentially useful at the provincial level the current study confirmed that high resolution satellite based drought information portrays drought impacts at the district scale better than meteorological drought information still for drought impact forecasting seasonal forecasts from dynamic climate models based on coarse meteorological information iizumi et al 2013 may still have an added value the predictive quality of seasonal climate models is still increasing and has shown to be useful for certain areas in europe turco et al 2017 potentially satellite based information on current drought conditions can be used to downscale coarser forecasts of crop yield impacts new guidelines for updating agricultural water and drought management plans in all the spanish river basins recognise the need to include spi as an index to be monitored for agricultural drought emergency plans this study suggests that satellite based drought indices may complement spi as they have been demonstrated here to be more directly related to crop yield impacts

11188,drip irrigation under mulch dm has been widely promoted and applied in arid regions the process of crop growth and surface water and energy transfer will change significantly under the dual control of mulch and drip irrigation compared with those under the traditional border irrigation under mulch bm method which will further affect the regional eco hydrology process the hexi corridor has become the largest seed maize production base in china due to its abundant solar radiation and heat resources and large diurnal temperature difference unlike grain maize seed maize can be divided into female and male parent plants the growth conditions of the parent plants differ male plants are planted 7 14 d later than female plants to produce preferable fertilization conditions which distinctly influences the energy transfer process between the different parent plants and the soil and ultimately leads to significantly different plant water consumption in the maize field to determine the difference in the transpiration rate between a bm field and a dm field and to reveal the difference in water consumption characteristics between female and male plants eddy covariance system ec measurements a thermal balance sap flow system and micro lysimeters were applied to conduct continuous fixed location comparison measurements of the total evapotranspiration from 2014 to 2016 the total evapotranspiration et transpiration rates of the female tf and male plants tm and the soil evaporation e s in seed maize fields were separately analysed in both the bm field and dm fields results indicated that tf et tm et and e s et dynamically varied with the crop growth during the whole growth period transpiration rates under the dm treatment were 2 8 higher than those under the bm treatment under the local agricultural management conditions besides the female plant transpiration rate exceeded the male plant transpiration rate by 9 20 in the bm treatment and by 14 32 in the dm treatment field during the whole growth stages however male plant transpiration produced after the pollination of female plants is useless to final seed production it is more practical to decrease the planting ratio of male to female plants to the appropriate level and remove the male plants earlier to increase the water use efficiency in seed maize fields moreover the seed maize field in this study had a smaller proportion of soil evaporation than those in other grain maize field studies conducted around the world which was probably due to the mulching effect and higher plant density keywords drip irrigation evapotranspiration eddy covariance micro lysimeter sap flow seed maize 1 introduction drip irrigation under film mulch is a new agricultural water saving irrigation technology which has been extensively used in arid regions in recent years for its effect in increasing the water use efficiency eid et al 2013 liu et al 2017 yaghi et al 2013 and promoting the crop growth hou et al 2010 qin et al 2016 tiwari et al 2003 1998 under the dual controls of mulching and drip irrigation technologies water and energy transfer process would significantly change li et al 2017 wang et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 zotarelli et al 2009 which will further affect the regional eco hydrology process maize is a densely planted crop in which crop transpiration represents most of the total evapotranspiration al kaisi et al 1989 ding et al 2013 kang et al 2003 zhou et al 2017 and has been widely planted in arid areas many studies have been conducted on the water consumption of maize to reduce soil evaporation abu awwad 1998 li et al 2013a b martins et al 2013 promote crop transpiration wu et al 2011 yang et al 2012 and improve water use efficiency howell et al 1998 kang et al 2003 li et al 2008 payero et al 2008 in addition studies have shown that the agricultural microclimate that results from farming control measures and the physiological and growth characteristics of maize have important influences on water consumption by maize djaman et al 2013 feng et al 2017 steduto and hsiao 1998 suyker and verma 2008 zeggaf et al 2008 however maize generally falls into two categories one is grain maize which is used for producing grain and the other is seed maize which is used for producing seed in contrast with grain maize seed maize is cross fertilized by female and male plants which are planted between lines strictly according to the planting ratio the ratio of male to female plants numbers and female plants are seeded 7 14 d earlier than male plants to guarantee favourable fertilization conditions finally the male plants which were useless for final seed production and were removed before the harvest as a result female plants have a higher transpiration rate with a higher leaf area index than male plants during the early growing stages under these conditions female plants and male plants grow with different physiologic characteristics which have a combined interactive influence on the agricultural microclimate currently 70 of the maize seeds in china are produced in the hexi corridor where is full of solar radiation and heat resources plenty of water consumption produced by seed maize in this region it is very urgent to carry out researches on the water consumption of seed maize and increase the water use efficiency however little attention has been paid on the transpiration partitioned by female plants and male plants above the seed maize field and further research on the interactive influence between the cross fertilized crops and the agricultural microclimate is still in challenging hence the aim of our work is to quantify the water consumption difference between border irrigation under mulch bm field and drip irrigation under mulch dm field reveal the interactive influence of physiological growth characteristic of female and male plants and the agricultural microclimate under the two treatments we conducted continuous fixed station comparison observations for 3 years of the total evapotranspiration et female plant transpiration tf male plant transpiration tm and soil evaporation in seed maize fields under both border irrigation under mulch bm field and drip irrigation under mulch dm field respectively using the eddy covariance ec system and sap flow and micro lysimeter measurements to ascertain 1 the difference between the physiological growth and water consumption properties of female and male seed maize plants under bm and dm treatments under the local farming management conditions and 2 the difference in the water consumption properties between seed maize and grain maize 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site and description the experiment was conducted in wuwei experimental station for efficient water use in agricultural ministry of agriculture 37 51 n 102 53 e 1585 m alt from 2014 to 2016 the experiment site is located in a typical continental temperate climate rich in solar radiation and heat resources having yearly sunshine hours more than 3000 h average frostless season more than 150d over the years mean annual maize growth period temperature 19 20 c 0 c annual cumulative temperature higher than 3550 c average precipitation 164 mm over the years mean annual pan evaporation approximately 2000 mm and the groundwater table in the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2015a b li et al 2016 qin et al 2016 this study involved contrasting observation experiments on seed maize in a drip irrigation under mulch dm cornfield and a border irrigation under mulch bm cornfield over three years unlike grain maize seed maize is cross fertilized by female and male parents which were hybridized by ganxin professional seed companies female parents are castrated in the shooting stage so that only pollen from male plants to ensure a preferable fertilization effect male parents are always planted 7 14 d later than female parents and will be eliminated after completion of fertilization and before the final harvest period to meet different use such as feed crop or fertilizer professional semi automated machines were applied to lay out plastic mulch and sow in both seed maize experiment fields male maize seeds and female maize seeds were sown fixed distance apart within each row with one line for male plants and several lines for female plants however both experiment fields belong to different farmers so that there are slightly differences such as germination rates and planting ratios in management between two fields in that follows our measurement and analysis were based on the full respect for the local agricultural production practice the planting density and management dates of farm activities in both treatments are shown in table 2 the plastic transparent mulch applied in both treatments was plastic film of 8 μm thickness with a shortwave transmissivity reflectivity and absorptivity of 0 85 0 10 and 0 05 respectively and a longwave transmissivity of 0 74 specifically in the bm treatment the plastic mulch film with width of 1 2 m was laid out along the east and west by professional automation machinery the ratio of the film width to the inter film bare soil width was 3 1 with an area of 400 m 200 m during 2014 2016 and the ratio of female parents to male parents was 4 1 in 2014 2015 and 7 1 in 2016 the distance between seed rows under the same mulch was 0 25 m and seeds were sown 0 3 m apart within each row female and the male plants are companion planting in line according to the parents planting ratio the 1 m depth surface layer was composed of silty loam with an average soil dry unit weight of 1 52 g cm 3 and a field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 from 2014 to 2016 the dm treatment has an area of 2000 m 1000 m during 2014 2015 and 400m 200 m in 2016 the film width lay out and the mulching ratio were the same as the bm treatment the space of drip irrigation belt was 0 4 m with the distance between neighbouring emitters of 0 3 m and the ratio of female parents to male parents was 7 1 in 2014 2015 and 6 1 in 2016 the distance between seed rows under the same mulch was 0 25m seeds were sown 0 22 m apart within each row both parent plants are companion planting in line according to the parents planting ratio the soil texture at 0 0 8 m depth is silty loam and that at 0 8 1 0 m depth is silt during 2014 2016 the average soil dry bulk density and averaged θfc at 0 1 0 m depth were 1 52 g cm 3 and 0 30 cm3 cm 3 in 2014 and 1 46 g cm 3 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively qin et al 2016 the total irrigation amount in bm experiment site was 360 mm 442 mm 480 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively and 350 mm 449 mm 388 mm under dm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively detailed description of irrigation and precipitation events could be seen in qin et al 2016 2 2 measurement and data correction continuous fixed station observations were carried out on seed maize under both dm and bm treatments and each with an ec flux observation system a thermal balance sap flow system flow32 k and several micro lysimeters fig 1 2 2 1 meteorological data and eddy covariance evapotranspiration was measured using an eddy covariance ec system which was located in the central south of the maize field the eddy covariance ec system consisted of a sonic anemometer thermometer model csat3 a krypton hygrometer model kh20 a radiation meter model nr lite and a soil moisture meter model em50 in bm treatment in 2014 and a co2 h2o open path gas analyzer model ec150 a radiation meter model cnr4 a surface temperature meter model si 111 a hygrothermograph model hmp45c and a soil moisture meter model cs616 in bm treatment during 2015 2016 and in dm treatment during 2014 2016 the sonic anemometer thermometer the krypton hygrometer the co2 h2o open path gas analyser and the surface temperature meter sensors were installed at 4 0 m height above the ground level during 2014 2015 and 3 5 m in 2016 and the radiation meter was installed at a 4 0 m height above the ground level during 2014 2015 and one meter above the canopy height in 2016 the soil moisture meters were installed distributed underground 0 1 m depth in 2014 and 2016 and 0 0 8 m depth in 2015 all the probes were connected to the data logger with a sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling interval of 30 min specific observation indicators and methods are shown in table 1 then ec flux data was disposed with eddy pro 4 0 software table 1 the software has powerful function which provides almost all the essential correction procedures followed as 1 detection and elimination of raw peaks 2 the double coordinate rotation method finnigan et al 2003 paw u et al 2000 3 the frequency loss correction 4 air density correction webb et al 1980 then the quality of ec data and footprint of ec measurement were assessed based on eddy pro 4 0 the data for which the footprint extended out of the experimental area should be deleted as for the missing data the linear interpolation method was used for data gap filling when less than 4 observations missed while the mdv mean diurnal variation method was adopted when five or more missed falge et al 2001 after the above steps for daytime ec based data the measured energy budget components were forced to close using bowen ratio closure method proposed by twine et al 2000 assuming that bowen ratio is correctly measured by the ec system during nighttime periods the residual λet closure method proposed by twine et al 2000 was adopted in this study which assumed that the ec based h is accurately measured and solved for λet as the residual to the energy balance equation λet rn g h li et al 2013a b the precipitation in both treatments was the same and measured with a standard automatic weather station near the experimental croplands at a height of 2 0 m above the ground and table 3 summarizes the main meteorological parameters for border irrigation under mulch bm treatment and drip irrigation under mulch dm treatment during the three growing seasons 2 2 2 sap flow the thermal balance sap flow system model flow32 1 k system dynamax houston tx usa applied in previous research work was proved to be an effective method to measure maize transpiration ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 in our research the thermal balance sap flow system model flow32 1 k system dynamax houston tx usa was used in both treatments during 2014 2016 to obtain the seed maize plant transpiration each thermal balance system has eight probes and each probe was installed 20 cm above the ground stem part on five female plants and three male plants all the probes in each treatment were connected to a cr1000 data logger with a sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling interval of 30 min the sap flow flux data l d 1 was firstly scaled to the specific monitored plants transpiration mm d 1 per plant using the average ground area then the average monitored female male plant transpiration mm d 1 per plant calculated from the related monitored plants five female plants and three male plants was transformed to the field female male crop transpiration mm d 1 using the average monitored female male plant leaf area and the field female male plant leaf area index respectively jiang et al 2014 and the specific calculations are listed as follows 1 t i s a p 1 n s i n s i j 1 q i j l a i j l a i i where n i is the number of sap flow measurement for the male or female parent q i j is the individual sap flow rate of the male or female plant l day 1 plant 1 la i j is the individual leaf area of male or female parent m2 lai i means leaf area index of male or female parent cm2 cm 2 the measured total transpiration of maize is the sum of the transpiration of female t f sap and male t m sap parents 2 t s a p n f t f s a p n m t m s a p f m where n m and n f are the ratio of the number of male and female parents to the total number of plants f m is the mulching ratio 2 2 3 soil evaporation the micro lysimeters were installed between crops under the mulch and bare soil between mulches in the surface soil with three replications in each experiment site the micro lysimeter composed of inner and outer tubes both made from pvc tubes with the diameter of 11 cm for the outer tube and 10 cm for inner tube the height of both tubes were 20 cm the bottom of the inner tube was covered with nylon wire which was convenient for water vapour transfer in vertical direction and the downward flux past the bottom of the micro lysimeter was assumed to be negligible when calculated the soil water evaporation measured by the micro lysimeter daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter was obtained as the difference between the weights measured by an electronic scale mettler toledo pl6001 l usa with accuracy of 0 1 g at 19 00 every day and the field daily soil evaporation under mulch e ms lys at each experiment site was averaged by daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed under plastic mulch while the field soil evaporation under bare soil e bs lys was averaged by daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed under bare soil finally the total field daily soil evaporation e lys at each experiment site was calculated by the sum of e ms lys and e bs lys with weight of 3 1 the ratio of mulched soil to the bare soil besides soil water evaporation in irrigation or precipitation events was not observed because the measured data during these periods is inaccurate therefore the averaged soil water evaporation values were computed using the measured values of observed dates during each growth period and the micro lysimeters were replaced within one or two days after each irrigation and heavy rainfall to minimize the difference between soil moisture inside and outside the tubes based on previous studies yunusa et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 2 2 4 sap flow interpolation the observations of stem flow often began in the heading stage and were carried out until the end of the growing period and the early growth stage stem flow data was lost due to the thinner stems of maize plants which was not suitable to measure with the thermal balance system interpolation of the maize transpiration data acquired in the seedling period was required to determine the dynamic variation of maize transpiration over the whole study period in practice the daily variations of the transpiration by female and male parents and its relationship with the lai surface temperature ts vapour pressure difference vpd net radiation rn and average soil moisture content θ in the 0 80 cm soil layer under bm treatment and dm treatment over 2014 2016 were analysed to obtain nonlinear regression equations thereby extending the transpiration data of the plants in the seedling period within the observation period the mean values of other observational days in the growing period were used for interpolation when plant transpiration or soil evaporation data were missing due to rainfall or irrigation male plants in the dm treatment in 2014 and in the bm treatment in 2015 were not observed due to instrumental failure so the nonlinear regression equation was used for interpolation evapotranspiration after energy balance closure etec was taken as the standard and used to balance the water vapour associated with plant transpiration transpiration by the female and male plants was added proportionally determined by the thermal balance sap flow flow 32 k and the micro lysimeter observed soil evaporation elys tsap to finally calculate the evapotranspiration over the entire growing period the actual female transpiration t m male transpiration t f and evaporation e s

fig 2 shows the daily comparison between the ec observed et etec and the sum of evaporation measured by micro lysimeter and crop transpiration measured by sap flow t sap e lys crop transpiration was calculated as a weighted average using the planting ratio between male and female plants under border irrigation under mulch treatment bm and drip irrigation under mulch treatment dm during the observation period in 2014 2016 under the two treatments the growing period of male parents was 30 60 d shorter than that of female parents due to later sowing time and earlier being cut off from the seed maize field during the sap flow observation period the average values of etec tsap and elys under bm treatment were 3 84 3 41 and 0 43 mm d 1 in 2014 5 04 4 18 and 0 86 mm d 1 in 2015 and 4 94 4 39 and 0 55 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively under the dm treatment the average values of etec tsap and elys were 3 65 3 44 and 0 21 mm d 1 in 2014 4 68 4 31 and 0 37 mm d 1 in 2015 and 4 84 4 54 and 0 30 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively during the sap flow observation period in 2014 2016 the average values of evapotranspiration under dm treatment were lower than those under bm treatment by 0 19 0 56 and 0 10 mm d 1 respectively however the average transpiration values under dm treatment were greater than those under bm treatment by 0 03 0 12 and 0 15 mm d 1 respectively and the average evaporation values under dm treatment were lower than those under bm treatment by 0 22 0 24 and 0 25 mm d 1 respectively under the dm treatment more water consumption was used to the plant transpiration after forcing the energy balance to be closed the maize field evapotranspiration measured using the eddy covariance ec system etec was compared to the sum of transpiration the transpiration by the female t f sap and male plants t m sap was added proportionally measured by sap flow system and soil evaporation e lys measured by micro lysimeter fig 2 indicates that elys tsap was close to etec during the observation period in 2014 2016 the regression was not significantly different from line 1 1 with a root mean square error rmse of 0 06 0 47 mm d 1 in both treatments during three years indicating a good agreement between the measured et by two approaches thus the ec system can be used as a standard in the calculation of water vapour closure in the studied maize field 3 2 transpiration data fitting and interpolation at the two sites however since the plant stems in the early growth stage of maize are too thin for sap flow observation the transpiration data in this stage were extended by interpolation to quantify the water consumption from the transpiration of male and female plants over the entire growing period the etec value was taken as the standard and used for the water vapour closure correction of the plant transpiration measured from the sap flow flow 32 k according to the parent planting proportions and the soil evaporation measured by the micro lysimeter during the same period the plant transpiration values tm and tf after correcting for water vapour closure under the bm and dm treatments over 2014 2016 were first made person analysis with biological factors and meteorological factors and finally finding that tm and tf were significant correlation with leaf area index laim and laif surface temperature ts water vapour deficit vpd net radiation rn and average soil moisture content θ at 0 80 cm depth table 4 and nonlinear regression analysis between tm and tf under both bm and dm treatments were made with the above influencing factors and get the following empirical regression equations eq 1 4 for female plant transpiration tf and male plant transpiration t m under the bm and dm treatments 1 transpiration of female parent plants under bm during 2014

in the beginning period of growth to obtain female plant transpiration and male plant transpiration for the entire growing period after fitting female plant transpiration and male plant transpiration were added to the micro lysimeter observed soil evaporation for the same term according to the planting proportion to obtain the total et which was compared with etec with consistency index of 0 99 under both treatments during 2014 2016 respectively and the results were good consistent table 5 3 3 comparison of the transpiration between bm and dm treatments etec was taken as the standard and used for the water vapour closure correction of soil water evaporation female plant transpiration and male plant transpiration respectively seasonal variations of es tf and tm during the entire growth period under both treatments in 2014 2016 are shown in fig 3 a comparison of water vapour closure corrected daily es tf and tm values over all of the growth stages and their respective ratios against etec over the entire growing period under the bm and dm treatments in 2014 2016 is shown in table 6 the female average daily transpiration rate under dm treatment was higher than that under bm treatment by 0 19 0 23 and 0 21 mm d 1 during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the values for male plants varied due to the different removal times of male plants in the growing period fig 4 a depicts the comparison of average daily transpiration rate weighted by planting ratio between the bm field and dm field the average daily transpiration rates in the dm field were higher than the transpiration rates in the bm field by 2 8 and 7 respectively the ratios of the total female plant transpiration amount against the total evapotranspiration tf etec under the dm treatments were higher than the ratios under the bm treatments by 0 10 0 08 and 0 02 during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively additionally the planting ratios under the dm treatment were higher than the planting ratios under the bm treatment by 0 05 0 05 and 0 02 during 2014 2016 respectively even though seed maize plants grew with different planting ratios the female transpiration amount under dm treatment was generally higher than that under bm treatment and the promoting effect of female transpiration under dm treatment was greater than the effects increased by the different planting ratios in brief female plants under dm treatment generally grew with a higher transpiration rate 3 4 comparison of transpiration by female and male plants under both treatments in the early growth stage the transpiration rate of female plants was higher than that of male plants under both treatments due to their earlier seed time however male plants grew faster with a rapidly increased transpiration rate which gradually reduced the transpiration rate difference between the female and male plants during the vigorous growth stages fig 3 although the fruits of male maize plants cannot be used as commercial seeds they were sometimes left to grow longer even after the pollination period to be processed for feedstuff or fertilizer finally the male plants were removed before the female plant harvest to avoid mixture with the female plants considering the entire growing period female plants grew longer than male plants by 18 67 and 45 d under bm treatments during 2014 2016 respectively the corresponding values under the dm treatments which were 56 57 and 36 d respectively during the entire female plant growth period the average daily female transpiration rates were 2 80 2 97 and 3 26 mm d 1 under bm treatments during 2014 2016 respectively which were higher than the male transpiration rates by 0 47 0 22 and 0 19 mm d 1 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively under the dm treatments the average daily female transpiration rates were 2 99 3 19 and 3 49 mm d 1 during 2014 2016 respectively which were higher than the male transpiration rates by 0 70 0 67 and 0 02 mm d 1 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively table 6 comparisons of transpiration rates between female and male plants were performed and the results are shown in fig 4 b female plant transpiration rates were higher than male plant transpiration rates by 14 20 and 9 under bm treatment during 2014 2016 respectively under the dm treatment female plant transpiration rates exceeded male plant transpiration rates by 24 32 and 14 during 2014 2016 respectively among the comparisons of transpiration rates between female plants and male transpiration rates under the two treatments during 2014 2016 comparisons under the bm treatment in 2015 and comparisons under the dm treatment in 2014 and 2015 were obviously different from the other three comparisons with higher differences with the later removal of male plants the smaller difference was between the female plant transpiration rate and the male transpiration rate additionally the ratios of the total male plant transpiration amount against the total evapotranspiration tm etec to the total female plant transpiration amount against the total evapotranspiration tf etec were generally lower than the planting ratios under both treatments during 2014 2016 in other words female plants grow with a higher transpiration rate than the male plants and increasing transpiration of female plants would result in an increased harvest of seed maize which favours achieving the farmers production aims according to the local agricultural management 4 discussion 4 1 the transpiration rate under the dm treatment was higher than that under the bm treatment an analysis of the three year continuous experimental results indicates that transpiration rates under the dm treatment were generally higher than transpiration rates under the bm treatment under the local agricultural management conditions during 2014 2016 figs 3 and 4 and table 6 the reasons were mainly attributed to the favourable soil moisture environment and higher canopy surface temperature provided by the dm treatment fig 5 in this circumstance crops grow with a rapid transpiration rate previous research has indicated that dm could provide a more suitable moisture and nutrient environment for plant growth thereby promoting plant growth increasing water use efficiency alenazi et al 2015 bai et al 2015 hou et al 2010 ibarra et al 2007 miyauchi et al 2012 qin et al 2016 yi et al 2011 and better facilitating the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients to increase the yield of seed maize 4 2 difference in transpiration between male and female seed maize plants the male plants in the early stage were undersized and had a lower lai and a much lower transpiration rate than the female parents due to the later seed time however the male parents grew quickly and their transpiration rate increased rapidly gradually decreasing the difference in transpiration rate between the female plants and the male plants even the male transpiration rate matched that of the female plants during the late growth stage as indicated in fig 3 the later was the removal of the male plants the smaller was the difference in the transpiration rate between the female plants and the male plants fig 4 and table 6 the reason for the above finding may be on the one hand that the female plants had a weakened upward growth ability after emasculation but in turn underwent compensatory growth in reproduction hilbert et al 1981 jiang et al 2016 mcnaughton 1983 neilsen and pinkard 2003 van staalduinen and anten 2005 on the other hand the reason may be that the coating effect between the taller female plants and the mulched soil accelerated the growth of plants by preventing male seedlings from burning due to excessive heat in the daytime and from freezing at night in addition the taller female plants produced shade which required the male plants to grow faster to obtain the sunlight needed for survival 4 3 difference in crop transpiration between seed maize and grain maize in seed maize field female and male plants have different growth characteristics over the whole growth stages due to the earlier sowing date of female plants and earlier elimination date of male plants in the vigorous growth stage both the male and female plants stabilized having essentially the same transpiration rate fig 3 to date a substantial amount of researches have been conducted on grain maize across the world but little work has been focused on seed maize table 7 lists the observation methods of et soil evaporation and plant transpiration by maize in the main maize production regions worldwide and some quantitative results most findings indicate that without mulching treatment water consumption due to plant transpiration accounted for 60 80 of the total et and that due to soil evaporation accounted for 20 40 of the total et several studies found that soil evaporation accounted for less than 10 or more than 60 of the total et which was caused by differences in irrigation methods mulching greatly reduced soil evaporation ding et al 2013 martins et al 2013 zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 promoted plant growth and increased water use efficiency however the total et varied significantly depending on the climatic region and physiographic characteristics of the research region in our study the seed maize plants had lower plant heights thinner stalks a higher plant density and a shorter growing period than the plants in the above grain maize studies under the mulching treatment soil evaporation in border irrigation treatment accounted for 17 19 of the total water consumption and 12 17 of the total water consumption in drip irrigation treatment which is lower than the mean level for grain maize this result was attributed to the reduced soil evaporation by mulching and higher plant density similar to the findings of most studies on grain maize plant transpiration by seed maize is an important contributor to total water consumption accounting for 81 83 under bm treatment and 83 88 under dm treatment however female plants accounted for 85 94 of the total transpiration which is effective transpiration while male plants accounted for only 6 15 of the total which is useless transpiration for seeds production above the seed maize field in fact this useless water consumption could be smaller in principle by decreasing the planting ratio as long as there were enough male plants to adequately fertilize the female plants thus the smaller of the planting ratio and the earlier removal of the male plants the higher the water use efficiency would be obtained in the seed maize field 5 conclusions three year continuous experiments using ec thermal balance sap flow and micro lysimeter measurements were conducted to reveal the difference in transpiration rate between the bm field and dm field and the water consumption rates of female plants and male plants under both treatments and we further investigated the difference in transpiration rates between seed maize and grain maize the following three conclusions were drawn 1 dm treatment provided favourable soil moisture and higher canopy surface temperature environment conditions for the crop which promoted rapid growth with the higher transpiration rate of the crop the transpiration rates under the dm treatment were 2 8 higher than transpiration rates under the bm treatment under the local agricultural management conditions 2 generally the female plant transpiration rate exceeded the male plant transpiration rate by 9 20 in the bm field and 14 32 in the dm field however the coating effect between the first seeded and taller female plants and the mulched soil accelerated the growth of male plants by preventing male seedlings from burning due to excessive heat in the daytime and from freezing at night so that male parents grew rapidly with a high transpiration rate and gradually decreased the difference in transpiration rates between the female plants and male plants 3 the seed maize fields in the present study have a smaller proportion of soil evaporation and a higher plant density than those in other grain maize field studies around the world decreasing the planting ratio and removing the male plants earlier would increase the water use efficiency in seed maize fields due to the useless transpiration between reproduction and the final seed production by the male plants agricultural microclimate environmental conditions have a marked impact on crop growth and the different growth conditions of female plants and male plants in the seed maize field would influence the energy transfer process above the cropland and further influence the estimations of crop transpiration and water consumption accordingly when estimating the total plant transpiration and water consumption the influence of male plants should be considered however it is difficult to effectively distinguish between the parent plants of seed maize using existing models an in depth study on the regulation of transpiration and water consumption by female and male seed maize plants will play a vital role in the establishment and improvement of models acknowledgements we greatly

11188,drip irrigation under mulch dm has been widely promoted and applied in arid regions the process of crop growth and surface water and energy transfer will change significantly under the dual control of mulch and drip irrigation compared with those under the traditional border irrigation under mulch bm method which will further affect the regional eco hydrology process the hexi corridor has become the largest seed maize production base in china due to its abundant solar radiation and heat resources and large diurnal temperature difference unlike grain maize seed maize can be divided into female and male parent plants the growth conditions of the parent plants differ male plants are planted 7 14 d later than female plants to produce preferable fertilization conditions which distinctly influences the energy transfer process between the different parent plants and the soil and ultimately leads to significantly different plant water consumption in the maize field to determine the difference in the transpiration rate between a bm field and a dm field and to reveal the difference in water consumption characteristics between female and male plants eddy covariance system ec measurements a thermal balance sap flow system and micro lysimeters were applied to conduct continuous fixed location comparison measurements of the total evapotranspiration from 2014 to 2016 the total evapotranspiration et transpiration rates of the female tf and male plants tm and the soil evaporation e s in seed maize fields were separately analysed in both the bm field and dm fields results indicated that tf et tm et and e s et dynamically varied with the crop growth during the whole growth period transpiration rates under the dm treatment were 2 8 higher than those under the bm treatment under the local agricultural management conditions besides the female plant transpiration rate exceeded the male plant transpiration rate by 9 20 in the bm treatment and by 14 32 in the dm treatment field during the whole growth stages however male plant transpiration produced after the pollination of female plants is useless to final seed production it is more practical to decrease the planting ratio of male to female plants to the appropriate level and remove the male plants earlier to increase the water use efficiency in seed maize fields moreover the seed maize field in this study had a smaller proportion of soil evaporation than those in other grain maize field studies conducted around the world which was probably due to the mulching effect and higher plant density keywords drip irrigation evapotranspiration eddy covariance micro lysimeter sap flow seed maize 1 introduction drip irrigation under film mulch is a new agricultural water saving irrigation technology which has been extensively used in arid regions in recent years for its effect in increasing the water use efficiency eid et al 2013 liu et al 2017 yaghi et al 2013 and promoting the crop growth hou et al 2010 qin et al 2016 tiwari et al 2003 1998 under the dual controls of mulching and drip irrigation technologies water and energy transfer process would significantly change li et al 2017 wang et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 zotarelli et al 2009 which will further affect the regional eco hydrology process maize is a densely planted crop in which crop transpiration represents most of the total evapotranspiration al kaisi et al 1989 ding et al 2013 kang et al 2003 zhou et al 2017 and has been widely planted in arid areas many studies have been conducted on the water consumption of maize to reduce soil evaporation abu awwad 1998 li et al 2013a b martins et al 2013 promote crop transpiration wu et al 2011 yang et al 2012 and improve water use efficiency howell et al 1998 kang et al 2003 li et al 2008 payero et al 2008 in addition studies have shown that the agricultural microclimate that results from farming control measures and the physiological and growth characteristics of maize have important influences on water consumption by maize djaman et al 2013 feng et al 2017 steduto and hsiao 1998 suyker and verma 2008 zeggaf et al 2008 however maize generally falls into two categories one is grain maize which is used for producing grain and the other is seed maize which is used for producing seed in contrast with grain maize seed maize is cross fertilized by female and male plants which are planted between lines strictly according to the planting ratio the ratio of male to female plants numbers and female plants are seeded 7 14 d earlier than male plants to guarantee favourable fertilization conditions finally the male plants which were useless for final seed production and were removed before the harvest as a result female plants have a higher transpiration rate with a higher leaf area index than male plants during the early growing stages under these conditions female plants and male plants grow with different physiologic characteristics which have a combined interactive influence on the agricultural microclimate currently 70 of the maize seeds in china are produced in the hexi corridor where is full of solar radiation and heat resources plenty of water consumption produced by seed maize in this region it is very urgent to carry out researches on the water consumption of seed maize and increase the water use efficiency however little attention has been paid on the transpiration partitioned by female plants and male plants above the seed maize field and further research on the interactive influence between the cross fertilized crops and the agricultural microclimate is still in challenging hence the aim of our work is to quantify the water consumption difference between border irrigation under mulch bm field and drip irrigation under mulch dm field reveal the interactive influence of physiological growth characteristic of female and male plants and the agricultural microclimate under the two treatments we conducted continuous fixed station comparison observations for 3 years of the total evapotranspiration et female plant transpiration tf male plant transpiration tm and soil evaporation in seed maize fields under both border irrigation under mulch bm field and drip irrigation under mulch dm field respectively using the eddy covariance ec system and sap flow and micro lysimeter measurements to ascertain 1 the difference between the physiological growth and water consumption properties of female and male seed maize plants under bm and dm treatments under the local farming management conditions and 2 the difference in the water consumption properties between seed maize and grain maize 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site and description the experiment was conducted in wuwei experimental station for efficient water use in agricultural ministry of agriculture 37 51 n 102 53 e 1585 m alt from 2014 to 2016 the experiment site is located in a typical continental

station is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2015a b li et al 2016 qin et al 2016 this study involved contrasting observation experiments on seed maize in a drip irrigation under mulch dm cornfield and a border irrigation under mulch bm cornfield over three years unlike grain maize seed maize is cross fertilized by female and male parents which were hybridized by ganxin professional seed companies female parents are castrated in the shooting stage so that only pollen from male plants to ensure a preferable fertilization effect male parents are always planted 7 14 d later than female parents and will be eliminated after completion of fertilization and before the final harvest period to meet different use such as feed crop or fertilizer professional semi automated machines were applied to lay out plastic mulch and sow in both seed maize experiment fields male maize seeds and female maize seeds were sown fixed distance apart within each row with one line for male plants and several lines for female plants however both experiment fields belong to different farmers so that there are slightly differences such as germination rates and planting ratios in management between two fields in that follows our measurement and analysis were based on the full respect for the local agricultural production practice the planting density and management dates of farm activities in both treatments are shown in table 2 the plastic transparent mulch applied in both treatments was plastic film of 8 μm thickness with a shortwave transmissivity reflectivity and absorptivity of 0 85 0 10 and 0 05 respectively and a longwave transmissivity of 0 74 specifically in the bm treatment the plastic mulch film with width of 1 2 m was laid out along the east and west by professional automation machinery the ratio of the film width to the inter film bare soil width was 3 1 with an area of 400 m 200 m during 2014 2016 and the ratio of female parents to male parents

line according to the parents planting ratio the 1 m depth surface layer was composed of silty loam with an average soil dry unit weight of 1 52 g cm 3 and a field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 from 2014 to 2016 the dm treatment has an area of 2000 m 1000 m during 2014 2015 and 400m 200 m in 2016 the film width lay out and the mulching ratio were the same as the bm treatment the space of drip irrigation belt was 0 4 m with the distance between neighbouring emitters of 0 3 m and the ratio of female parents to male parents was 7 1 in 2014 2015 and 6 1 in 2016 the distance between seed rows under the same mulch was 0 25m seeds were sown 0 22 m apart within each row both parent plants are companion planting in line according to the parents planting ratio the soil texture at 0 0 8 m depth is silty loam and that at 0 8 1 0 m depth is silt during 2014 2016 the average soil dry bulk density and averaged θfc at 0 1 0 m depth were 1 52 g cm 3 and 0 30 cm3 cm 3 in 2014 and 1 46 g cm 3 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively qin et al 2016 the total irrigation amount in bm experiment site was 360 mm 442 mm 480 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively and 350 mm 449 mm 388 mm under dm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively detailed description of irrigation and precipitation events could be seen in qin et al 2016 2 2 measurement and data correction continuous fixed station observations were carried out on seed maize under both dm and bm treatments and each with an ec flux observation system a thermal balance sap flow system flow32 k and several micro lysimeters fig 1 2 2 1 meteorological data and eddy covariance evapotranspiration was measured using an eddy covariance ec system which was located in the central south of the maize field the eddy covariance ec system consisted of a sonic anemometer thermometer model csat3 a krypton hygrometer model kh20 a radiation meter model nr lite and a soil moisture meter model em50 in bm treatment in 2014 and a co2 h2o open path gas analyzer model ec150 a radiation meter model cnr4 a surface temperature meter model si 111 a hygrothermograph model hmp45c and a soil moisture meter model cs616 in bm treatment during 2015 2016 and in dm treatment during 2014 2016 the sonic anemometer thermometer the krypton hygrometer the co2 h2o open path gas analyser and the surface temperature meter sensors were installed at 4 0 m height above the ground level during 2014 2015 and 3 5 m in 2016 and the radiation meter was installed at a 4 0 m height above the ground level during 2014 2015 and one meter above the canopy height in 2016 the soil moisture meters were installed distributed underground 0 1 m depth in 2014 and 2016 and 0 0 8 m depth in 2015 all the probes were connected to the data logger with a sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling interval of 30 min specific observation indicators and methods are shown in table 1 then ec flux data was disposed with eddy pro 4 0 software table 1 the software has powerful function which provides almost all the essential correction procedures followed as 1 detection and elimination of raw peaks 2 the double coordinate rotation method finnigan et al 2003 paw u et al 2000 3 the frequency loss correction 4 air density correction webb et al 1980 then the quality of ec data and footprint of ec measurement were assessed based on eddy pro 4 0 the data for which the footprint extended out of the experimental area should be deleted as for the missing data the linear interpolation method was used for data gap filling when less than 4 observations missed while the mdv mean diurnal variation method was adopted when five or more missed falge et al 2001 after the above steps for daytime ec based data the measured energy budget components were forced to close using bowen ratio closure method proposed by twine et al 2000 assuming that bowen ratio is correctly measured by the ec system during nighttime periods the residual λet closure method proposed by twine et al 2000 was adopted in this study which assumed that the ec based h is accurately measured and solved for λet as the residual to the energy balance equation λet rn g h li et al 2013a b the precipitation in both treatments was the same and measured with a standard automatic weather station near the experimental croplands at a height of 2 0 m above the ground and table 3 summarizes the main meteorological parameters for border irrigation under mulch bm treatment and drip irrigation under mulch dm treatment during the three growing seasons 2 2 2 sap flow the thermal balance sap flow system model flow32 1 k system dynamax houston tx usa applied in previous research work was proved to be an effective method to measure maize transpiration ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 in our research the thermal balance sap flow system model flow32 1 k system dynamax houston tx usa was used in both treatments during 2014 2016 to obtain the seed maize plant transpiration each thermal balance system has eight probes and each probe was installed 20 cm above the ground stem part on five female plants and three male plants all the probes in each treatment were connected to a cr1000 data logger with a sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling interval of 30 min the sap flow flux data l d 1 was firstly scaled to the specific monitored plants transpiration mm d 1 per plant using the average ground area then the average monitored female male plant transpiration mm d 1 per plant calculated from the related monitored plants five female plants and three male plants was transformed to the field female male crop transpiration mm d 1 using the average monitored female male plant leaf area and the field female male plant leaf area index respectively jiang et al 2014 and the specific calculations are listed as follows 1 t i s a p 1 n s i n s i j 1 q i j l a i j l a i i where n i is the number of sap flow measurement for the male or female parent q i j is the individual sap flow rate of the male or female plant l day 1 plant 1 la i j is the individual leaf area of male or female parent m2 lai i means leaf area index of male or female parent cm2 cm 2 the measured total transpiration of maize is the sum of the transpiration of female t f sap and male t m sap parents 2 t s a p n f t f s a p n m t m s a p f m where n m and n f are the ratio of the number of male and female parents to the total number of plants f m is the mulching ratio 2 2 3 soil evaporation the micro lysimeters were installed between crops under the mulch and bare soil between mulches in the surface soil with three replications in each experiment site the micro lysimeter composed of inner and outer tubes both made from pvc tubes with the diameter of 11 cm for the outer tube and 10 cm for inner tube the height of both tubes were 20 cm the bottom of the inner tube was covered with nylon wire which was convenient for water vapour transfer in vertical direction and the downward flux past the bottom of the micro lysimeter was assumed to be negligible when calculated the soil water evaporation measured by the micro lysimeter daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter was obtained as the difference between the weights measured by an electronic scale mettler toledo pl6001 l usa with accuracy of 0 1 g at 19 00 every day and the field daily soil evaporation under mulch e ms lys at each experiment site was averaged by daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed under plastic mulch while the field soil evaporation under bare soil e bs lys was averaged by daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed under bare soil finally the total field daily soil evaporation e lys at each experiment site was calculated by the sum of e ms lys and e bs lys with weight of 3 1 the ratio of mulched soil to the bare soil besides soil water evaporation in irrigation or precipitation events was not observed because the measured data during these periods is inaccurate therefore the averaged soil water evaporation values were computed using the measured values of observed dates during each growth period and the micro lysimeters were replaced within one or two days after each irrigation and heavy rainfall to minimize the difference between soil moisture inside and outside the tubes based on previous studies yunusa et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 2 2 4 sap flow interpolation the observations of stem flow often began in the heading stage and were carried out until the end of the growing period and the early growth stage stem flow data was lost due to the thinner stems of maize plants which was not suitable to measure with the thermal balance system interpolation of the maize transpiration data acquired in the seedling period was required to determine the dynamic variation of maize transpiration over the whole study period in practice the daily variations of the transpiration by female and male parents and its relationship with the lai surface temperature ts vapour pressure difference vpd net radiation rn and average soil moisture content θ in the 0 80 cm soil layer under bm treatment and dm treatment over 2014 2016 were analysed to obtain nonlinear regression equations thereby extending the transpiration data of the plants in the seedling period within the observation period the mean values of other observational days in the growing period were used for interpolation when plant transpiration or soil evaporation data were missing due to rainfall or irrigation male plants in the dm treatment in 2014 and in the bm treatment in 2015 were not observed due to instrumental failure so the nonlinear regression equation was used for interpolation evapotranspiration after energy balance closure etec was taken as the standard and used to balance the water vapour associated with plant transpiration transpiration by the female and male plants was added proportionally determined by the thermal balance sap flow flow 32 k and the micro lysimeter observed soil evaporation elys tsap to finally calculate the evapotranspiration over the entire growing period the actual female transpiration t m male transpiration t f and evaporation e s

fig 2 shows the daily comparison between the ec observed et etec and the sum of evaporation measured by micro lysimeter and crop transpiration measured by sap flow t sap e lys crop transpiration was calculated as a weighted average using the planting ratio between male and female plants under border irrigation under mulch treatment bm and drip irrigation under mulch treatment dm during the observation period in 2014 2016 under the two treatments the growing period of male parents was 30 60 d shorter than that of female parents due to later sowing time and earlier being cut off from the seed maize field during the sap flow observation period the average values of etec tsap and elys under bm treatment were 3 84 3 41 and 0 43 mm d 1 in 2014 5 04 4 18 and 0 86 mm d 1 in 2015 and 4 94 4 39 and 0 55 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively under the dm treatment the average values of etec tsap and elys were 3 65 3 44 and 0 21 mm d 1 in 2014 4 68 4 31 and 0 37 mm d 1 in 2015 and 4 84 4 54 and 0 30 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively during the sap flow observation period in 2014 2016 the average values of evapotranspiration under dm treatment were lower than those under bm treatment by 0 19 0 56 and 0 10 mm d 1 respectively however the average transpiration values under dm treatment were greater than those under bm treatment by 0 03 0 12 and 0 15 mm d 1 respectively and the average evaporation values under dm treatment were lower than those under bm treatment by 0 22 0 24 and 0 25 mm d 1 respectively under the dm treatment more water consumption was used to the plant transpiration after forcing the energy balance to be closed the maize field evapotranspiration measured using the eddy covariance ec system etec was compared to the sum of transpiration the transpiration by the female t f sap and male plants t m sap was added proportionally measured by sap flow system and soil evaporation e lys measured by micro lysimeter fig 2 indicates that elys tsap was close to etec during the observation period in 2014 2016 the regression was not significantly different from line 1 1 with a root mean square error rmse of 0 06 0 47 mm d 1 in both treatments during three years indicating a good agreement between the measured et by two approaches thus the ec system can be used as a standard in the calculation of water vapour closure in the studied maize field 3 2 transpiration data fitting and interpolation at the two sites however since the plant stems in the early growth stage of maize are too thin for sap flow observation the transpiration data in this stage were extended by interpolation to quantify the water consumption from the transpiration of male and female plants over the entire growing period the etec value was taken as the standard and used for the water vapour closure correction of the plant transpiration measured from the sap flow flow 32 k according to the parent planting proportions and the soil evaporation measured by the micro lysimeter during the same period the plant transpiration values tm and tf after correcting for water vapour closure under the bm and dm treatments over 2014 2016 were first made person analysis with biological factors and meteorological factors and finally finding that tm and tf were significant correlation with leaf area index laim and laif surface temperature ts water vapour deficit vpd net radiation rn and average soil moisture content θ at 0 80 cm depth table 4 and nonlinear regression analysis between tm and tf under both bm and dm treatments were made with the above influencing factors and get the following empirical regression equations eq 1 4 for female plant transpiration tf and male plant transpiration t m under the bm and dm treatments 1 transpiration of female parent plants under bm during 2014

in the beginning period of growth to obtain female plant transpiration and male plant transpiration for the entire growing period after fitting female plant transpiration and male plant transpiration were added to the micro lysimeter observed soil evaporation for the same term according to the planting proportion to obtain the total et which was compared with etec with consistency index of 0 99 under both treatments during 2014 2016 respectively and the results were good consistent table 5 3 3 comparison of the transpiration between bm and dm treatments etec was taken as the standard and used for the water vapour closure correction of soil water evaporation female plant transpiration and male plant transpiration respectively seasonal variations of es tf and tm during the entire growth period under both treatments in 2014 2016 are shown in fig 3 a comparison of water vapour closure corrected daily es tf and tm values over all of the growth stages and their respective ratios against etec over the entire growing period under the bm and dm treatments in 2014 2016 is shown in table 6 the female average daily transpiration rate under dm treatment was higher than that under bm treatment by 0 19 0 23 and 0 21 mm d 1 during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the values for male plants varied due to the different removal times of male plants in the growing period fig 4 a depicts the comparison of average daily transpiration rate weighted by planting ratio between the bm field and dm field the average daily transpiration rates in the dm field were higher than the transpiration rates in the bm field by 2 8 and 7 respectively the ratios of the total female plant transpiration amount against the total evapotranspiration tf etec under the dm treatments were higher than the ratios under the bm treatments by 0 10 0 08 and 0 02 during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively additionally the planting ratios under the dm treatment were higher than the planting ratios under the bm treatment by 0 05 0 05 and 0 02 during 2014 2016 respectively even though seed maize plants grew with different planting ratios the female transpiration amount under dm treatment was generally higher than that under bm treatment and the promoting effect of female transpiration under dm treatment was greater than the effects increased by the different planting ratios in brief female plants under dm treatment generally grew with a higher transpiration rate 3 4 comparison of transpiration by female and male plants under both treatments in the early growth stage the transpiration rate of female plants was higher than that of male plants under both treatments due to their earlier seed time however male plants grew faster with a rapidly increased transpiration rate which gradually reduced the transpiration rate difference between the female and male plants during the vigorous growth stages fig 3 although the fruits of male maize plants cannot be used as commercial seeds they were sometimes left to grow longer even after the pollination period to be processed for feedstuff or fertilizer finally the male plants were removed before the female plant harvest to avoid mixture with the female plants considering the entire growing period female plants grew longer than male plants by 18 67 and 45 d under bm treatments during 2014 2016 respectively the corresponding values under the dm treatments which were 56 57 and 36 d respectively during the entire female plant growth period the average daily female transpiration rates were 2 80 2 97 and 3 26 mm d 1 under bm treatments during 2014 2016 respectively which were higher than the male transpiration rates by 0 47 0 22 and 0 19 mm d 1 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively under the dm treatments the average daily female transpiration rates were 2 99 3 19 and 3 49 mm d 1 during 2014 2016 respectively which were higher than the male transpiration rates by 0 70 0 67 and 0 02 mm d 1 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively table 6 comparisons of transpiration rates between female and male plants were performed and the results are shown in fig 4 b female plant transpiration rates were higher than male plant transpiration rates by 14 20 and 9 under bm treatment during 2014 2016 respectively under the dm treatment female plant transpiration rates exceeded male plant transpiration rates by 24 32 and 14 during 2014 2016 respectively among the comparisons of transpiration rates between female plants and male transpiration rates under the two treatments during 2014 2016 comparisons under the bm treatment in 2015 and comparisons under the dm treatment in 2014 and 2015 were obviously different from the other three comparisons with higher differences with the later removal of male plants the smaller difference was between the female plant transpiration rate and the male transpiration rate additionally the ratios of the total male plant transpiration amount against the total evapotranspiration tm etec to the total female plant transpiration amount against the total evapotranspiration tf etec were generally lower than the planting ratios under both treatments during 2014 2016 in other words female plants grow with a higher transpiration rate than the male plants and increasing transpiration of female plants would result in an increased harvest of seed maize which favours achieving the farmers production aims according to the local agricultural management 4 discussion 4 1 the transpiration rate under the dm treatment was higher than that under the bm treatment an analysis of the three year continuous experimental results indicates that transpiration rates under the dm treatment were generally higher than transpiration rates under the bm treatment under the local agricultural management conditions during 2014 2016 figs 3 and 4 and table 6 the reasons were mainly attributed to the favourable soil moisture environment and higher canopy surface temperature provided by the dm treatment fig 5 in this circumstance crops grow with a rapid transpiration rate previous research has indicated that dm could provide a more suitable moisture and nutrient environment for plant growth thereby promoting plant growth increasing water use efficiency alenazi et al 2015 bai et al 2015 hou et al 2010 ibarra et al 2007 miyauchi et al 2012 qin et al 2016 yi et al 2011 and better facilitating the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients to increase the yield of seed maize 4 2 difference in transpiration between male and female seed maize plants the male plants in the early stage were undersized and had a lower lai and a much lower transpiration rate than the female parents due to the later seed time however the male parents grew quickly and their transpiration rate increased rapidly gradually decreasing the difference in transpiration rate between the female plants and the male plants even the male transpiration rate matched that of the female plants during the late growth stage as indicated in fig 3 the later was the removal of the male plants the smaller was the difference in the transpiration rate between the female plants and the male plants fig 4 and table 6 the reason for the above finding may be on the one hand that the female plants had a weakened upward growth ability after emasculation but in turn underwent compensatory growth in reproduction hilbert et al 1981 jiang et al 2016 mcnaughton 1983 neilsen and pinkard 2003 van staalduinen and anten 2005 on the other hand the reason may be that the coating effect between the taller female plants and the mulched soil accelerated the growth of plants by preventing male seedlings from burning due to excessive heat in the daytime and from freezing at night in addition the taller female plants produced shade which required the male plants to grow faster to obtain the sunlight needed for survival 4 3 difference in crop transpiration between seed maize and grain maize in seed maize field female and male plants have different growth characteristics over the whole growth stages due to the earlier sowing date of female plants and earlier elimination date of male plants in the vigorous growth stage both the male and female plants stabilized having essentially the same transpiration rate fig 3 to date a substantial amount of researches have been conducted on grain maize across the world but little work has been focused on seed maize table 7 lists the observation methods of et soil evaporation and plant transpiration by maize in the main maize production regions worldwide and some quantitative results most findings indicate that without mulching treatment water consumption due to plant transpiration accounted for 60 80 of the total et and that due to soil evaporation accounted for 20 40 of the total et several studies found that soil evaporation accounted for less than 10 or more than 60 of the total et which was caused by differences in irrigation methods mulching greatly reduced soil evaporation ding et al 2013 martins et al 2013 zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 promoted plant growth and increased water use efficiency however the total et varied significantly depending on the climatic region and physiographic characteristics of the research region in our study the seed maize plants had lower plant heights thinner stalks a higher plant density and a shorter growing period than the plants in the above grain maize studies under the mulching treatment soil evaporation in border irrigation treatment accounted for 17 19 of the total water consumption and 12 17 of the total water consumption in drip irrigation treatment which is lower than the mean level for grain maize this result was attributed to the reduced soil evaporation by mulching and higher plant density similar to the findings of most studies on grain maize plant transpiration by seed maize is an important contributor to total water consumption accounting for 81 83 under bm treatment and 83 88 under dm treatment however female plants accounted for 85 94 of the total transpiration which is effective transpiration while male plants accounted for only 6 15 of the total which is useless transpiration for seeds production above the seed maize field in fact this useless water consumption could be smaller in principle by decreasing the planting ratio as long as there were enough male plants to adequately fertilize the female plants thus the smaller of the planting ratio and the earlier removal of the male plants the higher the water use efficiency would be obtained in the seed maize field 5 conclusions three year continuous experiments using ec thermal balance sap flow and micro lysimeter measurements were conducted to reveal the difference in transpiration rate between the bm field and dm field and the water consumption rates of female plants and male plants under both treatments and we further investigated the difference in transpiration rates between seed maize and grain maize the following three conclusions were drawn 1 dm treatment provided favourable soil moisture and higher canopy surface temperature environment conditions for the crop which promoted rapid growth with the higher transpiration rate of the crop the transpiration rates under the dm treatment were 2 8 higher than transpiration rates under the bm treatment under the local agricultural management conditions 2 generally the female plant transpiration rate exceeded the male plant transpiration rate by 9 20 in the bm field and 14 32 in the dm field however the coating effect between the first seeded and taller female plants and the mulched soil accelerated the growth of male plants by preventing male seedlings from burning due to excessive heat in the daytime and from freezing at night so that male parents grew rapidly with a high transpiration rate and gradually decreased the difference in transpiration rates between the female plants and male plants 3 the seed maize fields in the present study have a smaller proportion of soil evaporation and a higher plant density than those in other grain maize field studies around the world decreasing the planting ratio and removing the male plants earlier would increase the water use efficiency in seed maize fields due to the useless transpiration between reproduction and the final seed production by the male plants agricultural microclimate environmental conditions have a marked impact on crop growth and the different growth conditions of female plants and male plants in the seed maize field would influence the energy transfer process above the cropland and further influence the estimations of crop transpiration and water consumption accordingly when estimating the total plant transpiration and water consumption the influence of male plants should be considered however it is difficult to effectively distinguish between the parent plants of seed maize using existing models an in depth study on the regulation of transpiration and water consumption by female and male seed maize plants will play a vital role in the establishment and improvement of models acknowledgements we greatly

11189,reservoirs have played a vital role in sustaining agricultural production and human livelihood with changing environments and demands while expanding the storage capacity of a reservoir is deemed a robust structural adaptation that improves water allocation few studies have discussed the sensitivity of this approach to climatic stresses in this study we investigated the effectiveness of building and upsizing reservoirs on addressing water scarcity under climate change in a simple reservoir system in south korea we employed a sensitivity based framework that combines a stochastic system analysis and climate projections and assessed the response of mean water scarcity to climatic stresses results showed that building or upsizing a reservoir made system performance more responsive to climatic stresses although additional reservoir capacity can help reducing water scarcity the effectiveness of such an approach is expected to diminish rapidly when climate becomes drier if existing climate changes towards drier conditions performance achieved through additional storage capacity decreases more rapidly resulting in lager performance loss than before making structural measures this study suggests that the direction of climate change and operational upgrades should be considered to reduce potential shortcomings associated with the structural adaptation strategies for a simple reservoir system keywords performance sensitivity to climate change managing storage capacity drying climate performance loss 1 introduction by intervening in natural river flows reservoirs have provided additional water availability and benefits to humans biemans et al 2011 more than half of river systems in the world are regulated by reservoirs to sustain irrigation and economic activities nilsson et al 2005 however climatic change driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions could pose challenges to reservoir systems steinschneider and brown 2012 nonstationary climate may alter probabilistic behaviors of hydrologic processes thereby undermines heuristic operation policies by which most reservoirs and river systems have been traditionally managed whateley et al 2014 georgakakos et al 2012 among various adaptation strategies to address climate change for agricultural systems upsizing or building reservoirs is deemed a robust strategy that can reduce the spatiotemporal variation of surface water availability iglesias and garrote 2015 hallegatte 2009 although a structural intervention in a natural river system may lead to environmental adverse effects poff and olden 2017 poff and schmidt 2016 ngigi 2003 the human made water holding capacity and allocation inarguably plays a crucial role in satisfying agricultural demands ehsani et al 2017 khagram 2004 in particular micro storage facilities e g small reservoirs farm ponds and underground tanks require relatively low effort for construction and maintenance and thus seem more economically viable than large scale water infrastructure wisser et al 2010 in india for example small reservoirs have rapidly spread over agricultural regions during the past two decades approximately supplying 20 of the total irrigation downing et al 2006 li and gowing 2005 wisser et al 2010 highlighted that construction of small reservoirs can increase the global cereal production by 35 hence structural investments such as building small reservoirs appear to be an attractive solution to reduce climate change risks in low yield regions under drought prone environments nonetheless an efficient adaptation mechanism is to reduce sensitivity or improve robustness of agricultural systems to climate change stresses wilby and dessai 2010 adgar et al 2005 in practice policymakers may seek low regret options that enable a given system to withstand a certain level of climatic stresses without substantial losses rather than selecting options that maximizes benefits weaver et al 2013 in this regard questions arise as to whether building or upsizing reservoirs can lower responsiveness of a water supply system to climatic stresses and to whether a structural investment can be a low regret adaptation policy those questions seem to have been overlooked in many studies that explored efficiency improvements for existing large and complex reservoir systems under changing socioeconomic and climatic constraints e g georgakakos et al 2012 eum and simonovic 2010 furthermore many climate change impact assessments have depended on few projections of general circulation models gcm gcm based top down assessments i e from climate projections to system analysis have the difficulty to provide the information necessary for decision making such as visualization of climatic risks and sensitivity of system performance brown and wilby 2012 although novel decision centric approaches have emerged e g steinschneider et al 2015 whateley et al 2014 turner et al 2014 few studies have focused on responses of micro storage facilities to climate change the purpose of this study is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of structural improvements under climate change via a case study for a small reservoir that provides agricultural water in a region of south korea to understand sensitivity of the reservoir performance to climate change we employed a decision centric method that combines a stochastic system analysis and gcm projections the response functions were developed between a pre defined water scarcity metric and a set of climatic variables climate change impacts were assessed by overlaying numerous gcm projections on the response functions 2 description of study area and data 2 1 yangak agricultural reservoir the study area is the yangak reservoir located in central south korea fig 1 the relatively small reservoir system is designed to supply irrigation water to rice planting lands at the downstream area we conceptualized the agricultural reservoir system as a simple node and link model with single supply and demand nodes representing the watershed and the agricultural sector respectively the reservoir interplays between the supply and demand nodes by regulating natural river flows the watershed has an area of 13 4 km2 and the rice planting lands account for 3 75 ha the reservoir has a storage capacity of 2 3 mm3 with a dead storage of 0 09 mm3 to reduce climatic risk the korea rural community corporation recently expanded the storage capacity of the reservoir to 3 3 mm3 water management in the study area is affected by typical monsoonal climate that brings wet summer seasons approximately 60 70 of precipitation falls from late june to september generating high streamflow because the streamflow continuously reduces after a rainy season water stored in the reservoir during a dry season is essential to meet the large demand for rice transplanting in may and june due to low winter precipitation snowmelt has minimal contribution to water supply in the spring season bae et al 2008 2 2 climate data to simulate reservoir inflows and agricultural water demand we used gridded daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures for 1976 2015 at 3 km resolution produced by a geospatial interpolation technique daly et al 2008 with 60 automated synoptic observing stations asos of the korea meteorological administration eum 2015 jung and eum jung and eum 2015 validated the performance of the gridded daily data set using separate observations at 243 automated weather stations across south korea we averaged grid data within the boundary of the watershed and at the rice planting pixels respectively long term climate of the reservoir system i e mean annual precipitation and temperatures was represented by averages between the watershed and the agricultural sector the mean annual precipitation and temperature were 1563 mm and 11 9 c during 1976 1995 both values increased to 1650 mm and 12 2 c during 1996 2015 indicating that atmospheric water supply i e precipitation and evaporative demand i e potential evapotranspiration pet seem to rise over time 3 methodology 3 1 proposed framework we employed the bottom up decision scaling framework brown et al 2012 that combines a system sensitivity analysis with climate projections while a typical scenario based impact assessment investigates changes in model outputs forced by downscaled gcms e g raje and mujumdar 2010 vano et al 2010 the decision scaling uses the climate response function crf developed by system models and stochastically generated climatic inputs the impacts of climate change can be assessed using the sensitivity of the performance indicator to changing climates via plotting multiple gcm projections on the crf this sensitivity based bottom up assessment i e from system analyses to climate projections allows policymakers to integrate system responses to different climate conditions for a given decision criterion because numerous gcm projections can be assessed together using the crf the decision scaling framework makes it possible to avoid risky adaptation policies from a small collection of climate change projections with substantial uncertainty brown et al 2012 in this work we assessed climate change impacts on water scarcity in the agricultural demand sector first we defined the water scarcity index using monthly estimates of water supply and demand as 1 i t s t d t d t where it st and dt are water scarcity index unitless water supply mm3 and water demand mm3 at month t respectively it represents the magnitude of water shortage relative to water demand the primary focus of this study is the magnitude of water scarcity in the reservoir system under various climatic stresses since climate change is typically represented by climatological changes for a decade or longer period ipcc 2007 we defined the mean water scarcity which is equivalent to the definition of vulnerability in hashimoto et al 1982 for a bi decadal period ν using the average of negative it values 2 υ e i t i t 0 we analyzed responses of mean water scarcity to bi decadal mean precipitation and temperature hereafter referred to as pavg and tavg respectively to develop the relationship of ν to pavg and tavg stochastic generations are essential because only one set of mean precipitation and temperature can be achieved from 20 year long climatic data the following section describes the stochastic weather generations applied 3 2 stochastic generation of climate data precipitation and temperatures should be major drivers of natural inflows and agricultural water demand to have extensive climatic data required for developing the crfs we used a markov chain model and the first order vector autoregressive var1 model formulated by wilks 1999 which have been widely used in many studies e g keller et al 2015 srikanthan and pegram 2009 we briefly described the stochastic generations here and more details about the models are found in wilks 1999 the precipitation generator uses the markov chain and the mixed exponential distribution for precipitation occurrence and amount processes respectively using the precipitation datasets for 1976 2015 we estimated the transition probabilities of the markov chain and the parameters of the mixed exponential distribution for each month from january to december a pair of 10 000 year long daily precipitation time series was generated for the watershed and demand nodes using spatially correlated random numbers for temperature generation the parameter matrices of the var1 model were analytically estimated with the vector of temperature data sets standardized by a single wave cosine function using the parameter matrices daily maximum and minimum temperatures were generated for the watershed and demand nodes for the same length of stochastic precipitation while the skewed distribution of the precipitation model could provide a relatively wide range of bi decadal averages from 10 000 year long generations the symmetric gaussian distribution of the var1 model produced a minimal variation in bi decadal mean temperatures to extend the narrow range of the mean temperatures we did a simple post processing for the stochastic temperatures the 10 000 year long daily temperatures were divided into 120 000 sets for each year and each month from january to december i e 10 000 sets for each month we sorted the 10 000 daily temperature sets of each month by their averages in ascending order i e sorting from the coldest to the warmest years then the twelve sets with the same order were recombined to represent the annual variations from january to december this reordering allowed to have an extended range of bi decadal mean temperatures from the coldest to the warmest bi decadal periods even after post processing stochastic daily temperatures are still plausible values reproducing the averages and variances of the daily observations 3 3 simulation of reservoir inflows the conceptual streamflow model gr4j perrin et al 2003 was used to simulate daily inflows to the yangak reservoir using the stochastic precipitation and temperatures gr4j conceptualizes the watershed response to atmospheric drivers daily precipitation and pet with four free parameters that represent soil water storage groundwater exchange routing storage and the basetime of unit hydrograph gr4j is widely used under diverse hydro climatic conditions based on its parsimonious structure and robust predictions zhang et al 2015 computational details for streamflow simulations are available in perrin et al 2003 since no inflow records were available for the yangak reservoir we applied an approach for ungauged basins kim et al 2017 evaluated the predictive performance of a parameter regionalization approach in comparison to the calibration against a regional flow duration curve fdc concluding that transferring parameter sets from nearby gauged watersheds is preferable in south korea the median nash sutcliffe efficiency of the proximity based parameter regionalization was 0 65 with an interquartile range of 0 27 to simulate the reservoir inflows we used the parameter sets of the five gauged watersheds in kim et al 2017 in proximity to the yangak reservoir we took the averages of five daily runoff time series simulated using the stochastic inputs and the transferred parameters and the monthly inflows were gained by aggregating the daily flows in the runoff simulations the temperature based model proposed by oudin et al 2005 was used to estimate pet 3 4 estimation of water demands the water demand at rice planting lands was estimated using the guideline of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 the crop water requirements were calculated using the fao penman monteith equation on a daily basis as 3a e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 3b e t c k c e t o where eto is reference et mm d 1 rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 t is mean air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively δ is the slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 kc is the crop coefficient unitless and etc is the crop et mm d 1 for etc estimation using the stochastically generated temperatures we used the average u2 values on each day of year obtained from observations at the nearest weather station to the yangak reservoir ea was estimated using the minimum temperature as the recommendation of allen et al 1998 crop coefficient kc was from an experimental study conducted by yoo et al 2006 at an interval of 10 days for south korea along with etc we considered the water requirement for preparing and transplanting rice seedlings which is a common rice cropping practice in south korea typically 140 mm of water is needed to prepare rice seedbeds for 4 days i e 35 mm d 1 over 1 20 of the planting area for the next 30 days etc of seedlings becomes the water requirement over the area of rice seedbeds the rice seedlings are transplanted for the following 20 days requiring additional 14 mm of irrigation per day over the planting area the total growing period was assumed as 150 days from a typical beginning date of preparing rice seedbeds april 15th the diversion efficiency was assumed to be 0 7 between the reservoir and the rice planting lands cho et al 2016 in addition we considered the environmental water demand in south korea it is recommended that streamflow should be maintained above the standard drought flow which could be estimated as the flow at the exceedance probability of 355 365 from the period of record fdc we simulated streamflow in the watershed using gr4j with observed precipitation and temperatures for 1976 2015 and determined the environmental demand to be 0 035 m3 s 1 3 5 reservoir operation more than 17 000 small agricultural reservoirs are spread over south korea hence it has been difficult to operationally monitor reservoir inflows and outflows no outflow records were available for the yangak reservoir too thus we hypothesized that the standard operating policy sop loucks and van beek 2016 stedinger 1984 maass et al 1962 was applied to the reservoir system because it is the optimal operating policy when the loss function is linear hashimoto et al 1982 the sop therefore may be the best option for this case study to minimize water scarcity at a single demand sector a hedging rule which saves water for future benefits even under unsatisfactory water availability e g eum et al 2011 is unlikely activated because future water supply may not compensate early crop failures or yield losses from water stress the sop for the yangak reservoir fig 2 was set by the average demands for the twelve months i e fixed demand targets for each month obtained from the monthly demand estimates for 1976 2015 the expected water availability at the beginning of a given month was calculated by summing water availability at the end of the previous month and the expected inflow minus evaporation loss in the current month in other words it was assumed that the water manager supplies water to the demand sector based on averages of historical inflows and demands this management may produce operational water shortage when the expected water availability or demand is less or greater than actual 3 6 developing climate response functions we produced a 10 000 year long time series of it using the monthly estimates of water supply i e reservoir outflows and demands subsequently the mean water scarcity ν was quantified for each 20 year time slice after discarding the ν value of the first 20 year slice that initializes the runoff simulation and reservoir operations crf of mean water scarcity was developed by a multiple regression between the remaining 499 ν values and the corresponding bi decadal means of tavg and pavg the logarithmic transformations were needed for normality of residuals the variation of mean water scarcity could be explained by tavg c and pavg mm with the following equation 4 log υ a b log t a v g c log p a v g where a b and c are regression coefficients and ε is gaussian noise that explain the randomness of ν respectively equation 4 allows linking directly between mean water scarcity and climatic conditions for comparative assessment we developed crfs for three modeling cases by changing the storage capacity of the reservoir the applied storage capacities were 0 mm3 no reservoir 2 3 mm3 before upsizing and 3 3 mm3 after upsizing 3 7 downscaling gcms a total of 26 daily gcms were collected from the archive of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012 to assess water scarcity under global warming for 2020 2099 table 1 the

assessments tavg and pavg of the bias corrected gcms were calculated for the bi decadal time slices of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean water scarcity under stochastic climates fig 3 illustrates temporal variations of monthly water supply demand and water scarcity simulated by the stochastic precipitation and temperatures for two bi decadal periods with distinct climatological means the reservoir storage significantly contributed to reducing water scarcity at the demand site with no reservoir storage fig 3a d natural water supply was often unable to satisfy the irrigation demand in the early planting season as described earlier the rainy season begins typically in late june such that streamflow is high in summer occasional rainfall events during the dry season october to may insufficiently recharge the watershed generating low streamflow in the early rice planting season late april to early june when irrigation water demand is high fig 3b shows that the reservoir with storage of 2 3 mm3 could nullify discrepancies between the natural water supply and demand under a favorable climate tavg 11 5 c pavg 1529 mm however water scarcity was becoming more frequent and more severe with increasing tavg and decreasing pavg in an unfavorable climate tavg 15 4 c pavg 1442 mm water scarcity continued for multiple months even during rainy seasons upsizing the reservoir to 3 3 mm3 fig 3c could alleviate the severe water scarcity under the unfavorable climate one main driver of severe water scarcity was insufficient inflows under unfavorable climates the runoff ratio the total streamflow divided by total precipitation decreased by 33 from the favorable to the unfavorable climates in fig 3 indicating that the reservoir inflows sensitive to changes in pavg and tavg primarily due to the soil moisture status and significant et loss in the watershed on the other hand the total water demand showed low variability in the two stochastic climates since the transplanting water requirement and the environmental demand were nearly constant fig 4 displays the scatter plots between mean water scarcity and stochastic climates of tavg and pavg for three scenarios of the reservoir storage capacity the results show that increasing reservoir capacity significantly contributed to reducing mean scarcity while its effectiveness was becoming more sensitive to changing climate all mean water scarcity values in fig 4a zero storage capacity were greater than the other cases implying that rice production is unsustainable without reservoir storages when upsizing the reservoir to 3 3 mm3 fig 4c the mean water scarcity became less than 0 1 for all the pairs of pavg tavg however it is also clearly indicated that a larger reservoir capacity made system performance more responsive to climatic changes with the largest capacity among the three cases the highest sensitivity of the mean scarcity was produced to changes in tavg and pavg the coefficients of determination of the crfs were 0 45 0 78 and 0 86 for capacities of 0 mm3 2 3 mm3 and 3 3 mm3 respectively this implies that the correlation between climatic means and mean water scarcity becomes stronger with increasing reservoir capacity this is because the major factor affecting discrepancies between inflows and demand in the early planting stage is not the climatic means but the intra annual climatic seasonality in other words water demands in this watershed cannot be satisfied by unregulated natural flows in fig 3a with zero reservoir storage severe water scarcity from april to june occurred irrespective of the climatic means the reservoir storage can reduce or nullify the water scarcity from climatic seasonality unexplained by tavg and pavg thus as the storage capacity increases tavg and pavg could explain the more variation of mean water scarcity briefly the system analysis indicates that increasing the reservoir capacity made reservoir performance more sensitive and more correlated to shifting climatic means 4 2 assessing impacts of global warming on water scarcity fig 5 presents the bias corrected tavg and pavg projections by the 26 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ghg emission scenarios the four points of tavg and pavg for the bi decadal time slices of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 were connected by the continuous lines on the contoured crfs the gcm projections showed a large spread as expected from prior studies e g whateley et al 2014 orlowsky and senevirantne 2013 the large spread could be associated with cascade errors of gcm projections primarily induced from climate forcing stainforth et al 2005 cloud feedbacks dufresne and bony 2008 initial conditions deser et al 2012 and other insufficiently understood physical processes new and hulme 2000 implying that deep uncertainties are present in gcm projections despite sizeable incongruities between the gcms the ensemble of 26 models indicates that the study area may experience unprecedented severe water scarcity under both scenarios it is worthy to focus on the contribution of temperature to water scarcity higher tavg produced higher mean water scarcity refer to fig 5 for rcp 4 5 and rcp8 5 in the case of capacity 3 3 mm3 mainly due to larger et losses since the rcp4 5 scenario assumes stabilization of ghg concentration after 2050 changes in tavg were expected to decrease with time pavg was expected to increase until 2060 2079 and slightly decrease in 2080 2099 although individual gcms provided a transition of tavg with time the ensemble projected continuously rising tavg for the four time slices under the rcp 8 5 scenario hypothesizing increasing ghg concentration until 2100 on the other hand the ensemble expected increasing pavg under rcp8 5 while the individual projections were diverging based on the ensemble projections the mean water scarcity was expected to be 0 07 and 0 13 for the case of 3 3 mm3 of reservoir capacity i e after upsizing under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively these are approximately 250 and 550 changes relative to 1996 2015 with 2 3 mm3 of reservoir capacity i e before upsizing the mean water scarcity would become 0 12 and 0 15 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which are 33 and 67 changes relative to 1996 2015 fig 5 highlights that the structural investment to the reservoir forced the system to be more responsive to shifting climatic means upsizing the reservoir seems more efficient when climatic changes are less severe i e rcp4 5 under rcp8 5 scenario the augmented capacity would minimally contribute to reducing the mean water scarcity during 2080 2099 nonetheless it is noteworthy that the upsized reservoir system always provided the highest water supply performance among the three capacity scenarios the system analysis already showed that the mean water scarcity with the expanded capacity was always less severe than the others upsizing the reservoir appears a paradoxical adaptation strategy it improves water supply performance however the agricultural system was forced to be more responsive to climatic stresses 4 3 sensitivity of structural adaptations to climate change by comparing between fig 5b and c it is shown that system performance became more sensitive to rising temperatures than precipitation changes after upsizing the reservoir this is because the additional capacity cannot reduce et losses that occur across the watershed while impacts of deficient precipitation can be minimized by extending the residence time of streamflow thus as the reservoir capacity increases increasing et loss with rising temperatures would become a more significant factor to control system performance than decreasing precipitation a physical property explaining et losses may explain the high sensitivity of increasing reservoir capacity to climate stresses fig 6 presents a scatter plot between mean water scarcity and bi decadal runoff ratio sampled by the stochastic performance tests when climate becomes drier from high to low runoff ratios mean water scarcity under the three storage scenarios appears to converge this is the reason for the higher sensitivity of the system with a larger reservoir capacity at an extremely dry climate the reservoir becomes a run of river dam to supply water demands since the inflows are inadequate due to et losses in this case there is no effectiveness from building or upsizing the reservoir thus the mean water scarcity under the three modeling conditions should be the same if climate alters towards extreme dryness the improved performance gained from building or upsizing should rapidly decrease to converge to zero supply performance due to no surface water fig 7 conceptualizes the relationship between mean water scarcity and climate change under complete dryness with no surface water mean water scarcity should become 100 i e no water supply regardless of storage capacity while complete dryness is an unlikely scenario the convergence determines the sensitivity of mean water scarcity to climate change when a reservoir is constructed or upsized mean water scarcity would decrease through the path of a b or b c if climate is becoming drier water scarcity would become severe through the path of b b or c c importantly the performance loss through the path of c c is the highest among the three storage capacities it should be noted that the relationship of water scarcity to runoff ration in fig 6 was non linear hence water scarcity could exponentially increase if climate becomes drier fig 7 implies that managing the storage capacity could be an option to increase benefits from the system under a stationary climate rather than a low regret strategy for minimizing potential losses the gcm projections driven by ghg emission scenarios have led to a controversial paradigm of dry gets drier wet gets wetter chou et al 2013 allan et al 2010 seager and vecchi 2010 held and soden 2006 liu and allan 2013 greve et al 2014 if this prediction is realized building or upsizing reservoirs in dry regions may become a regretful decision in a decision theory humans tend to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains kahneman and tversky 1979 managing the storage capacity in a drying environment may produce large potential regrets if no soft measures e g upgrading operations are included 4 4 limitations the focus of this study was the sensitivity of water supply performance to climatic changes in a simple reservoir system with no consideration of socioeconomic conditions thus this work may appear to be counterintuitive to other studies conducted in larger and complex regions e g ehsani et al 2017 collective responses of many reservoirs to climatic stressors could differ from those of a small reservoir with a single demand sector since it always improves water supply performance augmenting storage capacity can become a necessary adaptive measure for satisfying water demands in addition the temperature based pet model used in this study oudin et al 2005 may overestimate the system sensitivity to rising temperatures several studies suggest that all four primary meteorological variables i e radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity need to be considered for assessing long term trends in et since declining rates of observed near surface wind speed seem to be widespread across the globe e g mcvicar et al 2012 sheffield et al 2012 while oudin et al 2005 proposed an efficient pet equation for lumped rainfall runoff models other pet models need to be tested for improving reliability of the crfs 5 conclusions with growing concerns about the anthropogenic climate change and associated water scarcity risks preparing appropriate adaptation strategies is of great importance especially for agriculture dominated regions in this paper we showed that building or upsizing reservoirs make the system performance more sensitive to climatic stresses via a case study for a simple agricultural reservoir system upsizing the reservoir obviously provides effectiveness on reducing water scarcity however due to the high sensitivity to climatic stresses it is expected to produce a minimal contribution in the study area for 2080 2099 under rcp8 5 scenario a larger reservoir capacity should result in a more sensitive effectiveness to climate change since the system performance converges on zero impact under extreme dryness irrespective of reservoir capacity a key lesson from this study is that water supply performance of a small reservoir can exponentially decrease under a drying climate as a consequence potential losses in system performance could be much larger than before augmenting storage capacity therefore it is worth emphasizing that the direction of climate change i e drying or wetting should be considered before applying a structural change for a simple reservoir system it would also be necessary to formulate operational measures along with the structural changes for reducing sensitivity of the reservoir system to climatic stressors acknowledgements this study was supported

11189,reservoirs have played a vital role in sustaining agricultural production and human livelihood with changing environments and demands while expanding the storage capacity of a reservoir is deemed a robust structural adaptation that improves water allocation few studies have discussed the sensitivity of this approach to climatic stresses in this study we investigated the effectiveness of building and upsizing reservoirs on addressing water scarcity under climate change in a simple reservoir system in south korea we employed a sensitivity based framework that combines a stochastic system analysis and climate projections and assessed the response of mean water scarcity to climatic stresses results showed that building or upsizing a reservoir made system performance more responsive to climatic stresses although additional reservoir capacity can help reducing water scarcity the effectiveness of such an approach is expected to diminish rapidly when climate becomes drier if existing climate changes towards drier conditions performance achieved through additional storage capacity decreases more rapidly resulting in lager performance loss than before making structural measures this study suggests that the direction of climate change and operational upgrades should be considered to reduce potential shortcomings associated with the structural adaptation strategies for a simple reservoir system keywords performance sensitivity to climate change managing storage capacity drying climate performance loss 1 introduction by intervening in natural river flows reservoirs have provided additional water availability and benefits to humans biemans et al 2011 more than half of river systems in the world are regulated by reservoirs to sustain irrigation and economic activities nilsson et al 2005 however climatic change driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions could pose challenges to reservoir systems steinschneider and brown 2012 nonstationary climate may alter probabilistic behaviors of hydrologic processes thereby undermines heuristic operation policies by which most reservoirs and river systems have been traditionally managed whateley et al 2014 georgakakos et al 2012 among various adaptation strategies to address climate change for agricultural systems upsizing or building reservoirs is deemed a robust strategy that can reduce the spatiotemporal variation of surface water availability iglesias and garrote 2015 hallegatte 2009 although a structural intervention in a natural river system may lead to environmental adverse effects poff and olden 2017 poff and schmidt 2016 ngigi 2003 the human made water holding capacity and allocation inarguably plays a crucial role in satisfying agricultural demands ehsani et al 2017 khagram 2004 in particular micro storage facilities e g small reservoirs farm ponds and underground tanks require relatively low effort for construction and maintenance and thus seem more economically viable than large scale water infrastructure wisser et al 2010 in india for example small reservoirs have rapidly spread over agricultural regions during the past two decades approximately supplying 20 of the total irrigation downing et al 2006 li and gowing 2005 wisser et al 2010 highlighted that construction of small reservoirs can increase the global cereal production by 35 hence structural investments such as building small reservoirs appear to be an attractive solution to reduce climate change risks in low yield regions under drought prone environments nonetheless an efficient adaptation mechanism is to reduce sensitivity or improve robustness of agricultural systems to climate change stresses wilby and dessai 2010 adgar et al 2005 in practice policymakers may seek low regret options that enable a given system to withstand a certain level of climatic stresses without substantial losses rather than selecting options that maximizes benefits weaver et al 2013 in this regard questions arise as to whether building or upsizing reservoirs can lower responsiveness of a water supply system to climatic stresses and to whether a structural investment can be a low regret adaptation policy those questions seem to have been overlooked in many studies that explored efficiency improvements for existing large and complex reservoir systems under changing socioeconomic and climatic constraints e g georgakakos et al 2012 eum and simonovic 2010 furthermore many climate change impact assessments have depended on few projections of general circulation models gcm gcm based top down assessments i e from climate projections to system analysis have the difficulty to provide the information necessary for decision making such as visualization of climatic risks and sensitivity of system performance brown and wilby 2012 although novel decision centric approaches have emerged e g steinschneider et al 2015 whateley et al 2014 turner et al 2014 few studies have focused on responses of micro storage facilities to climate change the purpose of this study is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of structural improvements under climate change via a case study for a small reservoir that provides agricultural water in a region of south korea to understand sensitivity of the reservoir performance to climate change we employed a decision centric method that combines a stochastic system analysis and gcm projections the response functions were developed between a pre defined water scarcity metric and a set of climatic variables climate change impacts were assessed by overlaying numerous gcm projections on the response functions 2 description of study area and data 2 1 yangak agricultural reservoir the study area is the yangak reservoir located in central south korea fig 1 the relatively small reservoir system is designed to supply irrigation water to rice planting lands at the downstream area we conceptualized the agricultural reservoir system as a simple node and link model with single supply and demand nodes representing the watershed and the agricultural sector respectively the reservoir interplays between the supply and demand nodes by regulating natural river flows the watershed has an area of 13 4 km2 and the rice planting lands account for 3 75 ha the reservoir has a storage capacity of 2 3 mm3 with a dead storage of 0 09 mm3 to reduce climatic risk the korea rural community corporation recently expanded the storage capacity of the reservoir to 3 3 mm3 water management in the study area is affected by typical monsoonal climate that brings wet summer seasons approximately 60 70 of precipitation falls from late june to september generating high streamflow because the streamflow continuously reduces after a rainy season water stored in the reservoir during a dry season is essential to meet the large demand for rice transplanting in may and june due to low winter precipitation snowmelt has minimal contribution to water supply in the spring season bae et al 2008 2 2 climate data to simulate reservoir inflows and agricultural water demand we used gridded daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures for 1976 2015 at 3 km resolution produced by a geospatial interpolation technique daly et al 2008 with 60 automated synoptic observing stations asos of the korea meteorological administration eum 2015 jung and eum jung and eum 2015 validated the performance of the gridded daily data set using separate observations at 243 automated weather stations across south korea we averaged grid data within the boundary of the watershed and at the rice planting pixels respectively long term climate of the reservoir system i e mean annual precipitation and temperatures was represented by averages between the watershed and the agricultural sector the mean annual precipitation and temperature were 1563 mm and 11 9 c during 1976 1995 both values increased to 1650 mm and 12 2 c during 1996 2015 indicating that atmospheric water supply i e precipitation and evaporative demand i e potential evapotranspiration pet seem to rise over time 3 methodology 3 1 proposed framework we employed the bottom up decision scaling framework brown et al 2012 that combines a system sensitivity analysis with climate projections while a typical scenario based impact assessment investigates changes in model outputs forced by downscaled gcms e g raje and mujumdar 2010 vano et al 2010 the decision scaling uses the climate response function crf developed by system models and stochastically generated climatic inputs the impacts of climate change can be assessed using the sensitivity of the performance indicator to changing climates via plotting multiple gcm projections on the crf this sensitivity based bottom up assessment i e from system analyses to climate projections allows policymakers to integrate system responses to different climate conditions for a given decision criterion because numerous gcm projections can be assessed together using the crf the decision scaling framework makes it possible to avoid risky adaptation policies from a small collection of climate change projections with substantial uncertainty brown et al 2012 in this work we assessed climate change impacts on water scarcity in the agricultural demand sector first we defined the water scarcity index using monthly estimates of water supply and demand as 1 i t s t d t d t where it st and dt are water scarcity index unitless water supply mm3 and water demand mm3 at month t respectively it represents the magnitude of water shortage relative to water demand the primary focus of this study is the magnitude of water scarcity in the reservoir system under various climatic stresses since climate change is typically represented by climatological changes for a decade or longer period ipcc 2007 we defined the mean water scarcity which is equivalent to the definition of vulnerability in hashimoto et al 1982 for a bi decadal period ν using the average of negative it values 2 υ e i t i t 0 we analyzed responses of mean water scarcity to bi decadal mean precipitation and temperature hereafter referred to as pavg and tavg respectively to develop the relationship of ν to pavg and tavg stochastic generations are essential because only one set of mean precipitation and temperature can be achieved from 20 year long climatic data the following section describes the stochastic weather generations applied 3 2 stochastic generation of climate data precipitation and temperatures should be major drivers of natural inflows and agricultural water demand to have extensive climatic data required for developing the crfs we used a markov chain model and the first order vector autoregressive var1 model formulated by wilks 1999 which have been widely used in many studies e g keller et al 2015 srikanthan and pegram 2009 we briefly described the stochastic generations here and more details about the models are found in wilks 1999 the precipitation generator uses the markov chain and the mixed exponential distribution for precipitation occurrence and amount processes respectively using the precipitation datasets for 1976 2015 we estimated the transition probabilities of the markov chain and the parameters of the mixed exponential distribution for each month from january to december a pair of 10 000 year long daily precipitation time series was generated for the watershed and demand nodes using spatially correlated random numbers for temperature generation the parameter matrices of the var1 model were analytically estimated with the vector of temperature data sets standardized by a single wave cosine function using the parameter matrices daily maximum and minimum temperatures were generated for the watershed and demand nodes for the same length of stochastic precipitation while the skewed distribution of the precipitation model could provide a relatively wide range of bi decadal averages from 10 000 year long generations the symmetric gaussian distribution of the var1 model produced a minimal variation in bi decadal mean temperatures to extend the narrow range of the mean temperatures we did a simple post processing for the stochastic temperatures the 10 000 year long daily temperatures were divided into 120 000 sets for each year and each month from january to december i e 10 000 sets for each month we sorted the 10 000 daily temperature sets of each month by their averages in ascending order i e sorting from the coldest to the warmest years then the twelve sets with the same order were recombined to represent the annual variations from january to december this reordering allowed to have an extended range of bi decadal mean temperatures from the coldest to the warmest bi decadal periods even after post processing stochastic daily temperatures are still plausible values reproducing the averages and variances of the daily observations 3 3 simulation of reservoir inflows the conceptual streamflow model gr4j perrin et al 2003 was used to simulate daily inflows to the yangak reservoir using the stochastic precipitation and temperatures gr4j conceptualizes the watershed response to atmospheric drivers daily precipitation and pet with four free parameters that represent soil water storage groundwater exchange routing storage and the basetime of unit hydrograph gr4j is widely used under diverse hydro climatic conditions based on its parsimonious structure and robust predictions zhang et al 2015 computational details for streamflow simulations are available in perrin et al 2003 since no inflow records were available for the yangak reservoir we applied an approach for ungauged basins kim et al 2017 evaluated the predictive performance of a parameter regionalization approach in comparison to the calibration against a regional flow duration curve fdc concluding that transferring parameter sets from nearby gauged watersheds is preferable in south korea the median nash sutcliffe efficiency of the proximity based parameter regionalization was 0 65 with an interquartile range of 0 27 to simulate the reservoir inflows we used the parameter sets of the five gauged watersheds in kim et al 2017 in proximity to the yangak reservoir we took the averages of five daily runoff time series simulated using the stochastic inputs and the transferred parameters and the monthly inflows were gained by aggregating the daily flows in the runoff simulations the temperature based model proposed by oudin et al 2005 was used to estimate pet 3 4 estimation of water demands the water demand at rice planting lands was estimated using the guideline of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 the crop water requirements were calculated using the fao penman monteith equation on a daily basis as 3a e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 3b e t c k c e t o where eto is reference et mm d 1 rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 t is mean air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively δ is the slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 kc is the crop coefficient unitless and etc is the crop et mm d 1 for etc estimation using the stochastically generated temperatures we used the average u2 values on each day of year obtained from observations at the nearest weather station to the yangak reservoir ea was estimated using the minimum temperature as the recommendation of allen et al 1998 crop coefficient kc was from an experimental study conducted by yoo et al 2006 at an interval of 10 days for south korea along with etc we considered the water requirement for preparing and transplanting rice seedlings which is a common rice cropping practice in south korea typically 140 mm of water is needed to prepare rice seedbeds for 4 days i e 35 mm d 1 over 1 20 of the planting area for the next 30 days etc of seedlings becomes the water requirement over the area of rice seedbeds the rice seedlings are transplanted for the following 20 days requiring additional 14 mm of irrigation per day over the planting area the total growing period was assumed as 150 days from a typical beginning date of preparing rice seedbeds april 15th the diversion efficiency was assumed to be 0 7 between the reservoir and the rice planting lands cho et al 2016 in addition we considered the environmental water demand in south korea it is recommended that streamflow should be maintained above the standard drought flow which could be estimated as the flow at the exceedance probability of 355 365 from the period of record fdc we simulated streamflow in the watershed using gr4j with observed precipitation and temperatures for 1976 2015 and determined the environmental demand to be 0 035 m3 s 1 3 5 reservoir operation more than 17 000 small agricultural reservoirs are spread over south korea hence it has been difficult to operationally monitor reservoir inflows and outflows no outflow records were available for the yangak reservoir too thus we hypothesized that the standard operating policy sop loucks and van beek 2016 stedinger 1984 maass et al 1962 was applied to the reservoir system because it is the optimal operating policy when the loss function is linear hashimoto et al 1982 the sop therefore may be the best option for this case study to minimize water scarcity at a single demand sector a hedging rule which saves water for future benefits even under unsatisfactory water availability e g eum et al 2011 is unlikely activated because future water supply may not compensate early crop failures or yield losses from water stress the sop for the yangak reservoir fig 2 was set by the average demands for the twelve months i e fixed demand targets for each month obtained from the monthly demand estimates for 1976 2015 the expected water availability at the beginning of a given month was calculated by summing water availability at the end of the previous month and the expected inflow minus evaporation loss in the current month in other words it was assumed that the water manager supplies water to the demand sector based on averages of historical inflows and demands this management may produce operational water shortage when the expected water availability or demand is less or greater than actual 3 6 developing climate response functions we produced a 10 000 year long time series of it using the monthly estimates of water supply i e reservoir outflows and demands subsequently the mean water scarcity ν was quantified for each 20 year time slice after discarding the ν value of the first 20 year slice that initializes the runoff simulation and reservoir operations crf of mean water scarcity was developed by a multiple regression between the remaining 499 ν values and the corresponding bi decadal means of tavg and pavg the logarithmic transformations were needed for normality of residuals the variation of mean water scarcity could be explained by tavg c and pavg mm with the following equation 4 log υ a b log t a v g c log p a v g where a b and c are regression coefficients and ε is gaussian noise that explain the randomness of ν respectively equation 4 allows linking directly between mean water scarcity and climatic conditions for comparative assessment we developed crfs for three modeling cases by changing the storage capacity of the reservoir the applied storage capacities were 0 mm3 no reservoir 2 3 mm3 before upsizing and 3 3 mm3 after upsizing 3 7 downscaling gcms a total of 26 daily gcms were collected from the archive of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012 to assess water scarcity under global warming for 2020 2099 table 1 the projections of daily precipitation and temperature were downloaded for the representative concentration pathways rcp of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 available at https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 have been commonly used as scenarios of the stabilized and increasing ghg concentrations respectively e g he and zhou 2015 the daily projections of gcms were bias corrected using the quantile delta mapping qdm that explicitly preserves gcm driven relative and absolute changes in all quantiles cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2016 it is an advanced quantile mapping method not only to adjust the marginal distributions of raw gcms towards those of observations but also to preserve gcm driven climate signals especially changes in extreme events further details and discussion are found in cannon et al 2015 and eum and cannon eum and cannon 2016 the baseline period was 1976 2005 to downscale the gcms to the study area while the forecast period was 2006 2099 for the impact assessments tavg and pavg of the bias corrected gcms were calculated for the bi decadal time slices of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean water scarcity under stochastic climates fig 3 illustrates temporal variations of monthly water supply demand and water scarcity simulated by the stochastic precipitation and temperatures for two bi decadal periods with distinct climatological means the reservoir storage significantly contributed to reducing water scarcity at the demand site with no reservoir storage fig 3a d natural water supply was often unable to satisfy the irrigation demand in the early planting season as described earlier the rainy season begins typically in late june such that streamflow is high in summer occasional rainfall events during the dry season october to may insufficiently recharge the watershed generating low streamflow in the early rice planting season late april to early june when irrigation water demand is high fig 3b shows that the reservoir with storage of 2 3 mm3 could nullify discrepancies between the natural water supply and demand under a favorable climate tavg 11 5 c pavg 1529 mm however water scarcity was becoming more frequent and more severe with increasing tavg and decreasing pavg in an unfavorable climate tavg 15 4 c pavg 1442 mm water scarcity continued for multiple months even during rainy seasons upsizing the reservoir to 3 3 mm3 fig 3c could alleviate the severe water scarcity under the unfavorable climate one main driver of severe water scarcity was insufficient inflows under unfavorable climates the runoff ratio the total streamflow divided by total precipitation decreased by 33 from the favorable to the unfavorable climates in fig 3 indicating that the reservoir inflows sensitive to changes in pavg and tavg primarily due to the soil moisture status and significant et loss in the watershed on the other hand the total water demand showed low variability in the two stochastic climates since the transplanting water requirement and the environmental demand were nearly constant fig 4 displays the scatter plots between mean water scarcity and stochastic climates of tavg and pavg for three scenarios of the reservoir storage capacity the results show that increasing reservoir capacity significantly contributed to reducing mean scarcity while its effectiveness was becoming more sensitive to changing climate all mean water scarcity values in fig 4a zero storage capacity were greater than the other cases implying that rice production is unsustainable without reservoir storages when upsizing the reservoir to 3 3 mm3 fig 4c the mean water scarcity became less than 0 1 for all the pairs of pavg tavg however it is also clearly indicated that a larger reservoir capacity made system performance more responsive to climatic changes with the largest capacity among the three cases the highest sensitivity of the mean scarcity was produced to changes in tavg and pavg the coefficients of determination of the crfs were 0 45 0 78 and 0 86 for capacities of 0 mm3 2 3 mm3 and 3 3 mm3 respectively this implies that the correlation between climatic means and mean water scarcity becomes stronger with increasing reservoir capacity this is because the major factor affecting discrepancies between inflows and demand in the early planting stage is not the climatic means but the intra annual climatic seasonality in other words water demands in this watershed cannot be satisfied by unregulated natural flows in fig 3a with zero reservoir storage severe water scarcity from april to june occurred irrespective of the climatic means the reservoir storage can reduce or nullify the water scarcity from climatic seasonality unexplained by tavg and pavg thus as the storage capacity increases tavg and pavg could explain the more variation of mean water scarcity briefly the system analysis indicates that increasing the reservoir capacity made reservoir performance more sensitive and more correlated to shifting climatic means 4 2 assessing impacts of global warming on water scarcity fig 5 presents the bias corrected tavg and pavg projections by the 26 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ghg emission scenarios the four points of tavg and pavg for the bi decadal time slices of 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 were connected by the continuous lines on the contoured crfs the gcm projections showed a large spread as expected from prior studies e g whateley et al 2014 orlowsky and senevirantne 2013 the large spread could be associated with cascade errors of gcm projections primarily induced from climate forcing stainforth et al 2005 cloud feedbacks dufresne and bony 2008 initial conditions deser et al 2012 and other insufficiently understood physical processes new and hulme 2000 implying that deep uncertainties are present in gcm projections despite sizeable incongruities between the gcms the ensemble of 26 models indicates that the study area may experience unprecedented severe water scarcity under both scenarios it is worthy to focus on the contribution of temperature to water scarcity higher tavg produced higher mean water scarcity refer to fig 5 for rcp 4 5 and rcp8 5 in the case of capacity 3 3 mm3 mainly due to larger et losses since the rcp4 5 scenario assumes stabilization of ghg concentration after 2050 changes in tavg were expected to decrease with time pavg was expected to increase until 2060 2079 and slightly decrease in 2080 2099 although individual gcms provided a transition of tavg with time the ensemble projected continuously rising tavg for the four time slices under the rcp 8 5 scenario hypothesizing increasing ghg concentration until 2100 on the other hand the ensemble expected increasing pavg under rcp8 5 while the individual projections were diverging based on the ensemble projections the mean water scarcity was expected to be 0 07 and 0 13 for the case of 3 3 mm3 of reservoir capacity i e after upsizing under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively these are approximately 250 and 550 changes relative to 1996 2015 with 2 3 mm3 of reservoir capacity i e before upsizing the mean water scarcity would become 0 12 and 0 15 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which are 33 and 67 changes relative to 1996 2015 fig 5 highlights that the structural investment to the reservoir forced the system to be more responsive to shifting climatic means upsizing the reservoir seems more efficient when climatic changes are less severe i e rcp4 5 under rcp8 5 scenario the augmented capacity would minimally contribute to reducing the mean water scarcity during 2080 2099 nonetheless it is noteworthy that the upsized reservoir system always provided the highest water supply performance among the three capacity scenarios the system analysis already showed that the mean water scarcity with the expanded capacity was always less severe than the others upsizing the reservoir appears a paradoxical adaptation strategy it improves water supply performance however the agricultural system was forced to be more responsive to climatic stresses 4 3 sensitivity of structural adaptations to climate change by comparing between fig 5b and c it is shown that system performance became more sensitive to rising temperatures than precipitation changes after upsizing the reservoir this is because the additional capacity cannot reduce et losses that occur across the watershed while impacts of deficient precipitation can be minimized by extending the residence time of streamflow thus as the reservoir capacity increases increasing et loss with rising temperatures would become a more significant factor to control system performance than decreasing precipitation a physical property explaining et losses may explain the high sensitivity of increasing reservoir capacity to climate stresses fig 6 presents a scatter plot between mean water scarcity and bi decadal runoff ratio sampled by the stochastic performance tests when climate becomes drier from high to low runoff ratios mean water scarcity under the three storage scenarios appears to converge this is the reason for the higher sensitivity of the system with a larger reservoir capacity at an extremely dry climate the reservoir becomes a run of river dam to supply water demands since the inflows are inadequate due to et losses in this case there is no effectiveness from building or upsizing the reservoir thus the mean water scarcity under the three modeling conditions should be the same if climate alters towards extreme dryness the improved performance gained from building or upsizing should rapidly decrease to converge to zero supply performance due to no surface water fig 7 conceptualizes the relationship between mean water scarcity and climate change under complete dryness with no surface water mean water scarcity should become 100 i e no water supply regardless of storage capacity while complete dryness is an unlikely scenario the convergence determines the sensitivity of mean water scarcity to climate change when a reservoir is constructed or upsized mean water scarcity would decrease through the path of a b or b c if climate is becoming drier water scarcity would become severe through the path of b b or c c importantly the performance loss through the path of c c is the highest among the three storage capacities it should be noted that the relationship of water scarcity to runoff ration in fig 6 was non linear hence water scarcity could exponentially increase if climate becomes drier fig 7 implies that managing the storage capacity could be an option to increase benefits from the system under a stationary climate rather than a low regret strategy for minimizing potential losses the gcm projections driven by ghg emission scenarios have led to a controversial paradigm of dry gets drier wet gets wetter chou et al 2013 allan et al 2010 seager and vecchi 2010 held and soden 2006 liu and allan 2013 greve et al 2014 if this prediction is realized building or upsizing reservoirs in dry regions may become a regretful decision in a decision theory humans tend to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains kahneman and tversky 1979 managing the storage capacity in a drying environment may produce large potential regrets if no soft measures e g upgrading operations are included 4 4 limitations the focus of this study was the sensitivity of water supply performance to climatic changes in a simple reservoir system with no consideration of socioeconomic conditions thus this work may appear to be counterintuitive to other studies conducted in larger and complex regions e g ehsani et al 2017 collective responses of many reservoirs to climatic stressors could differ from those of a small reservoir with a single demand sector since it always improves water supply performance augmenting storage capacity can become a necessary adaptive measure for satisfying water demands in addition the temperature based pet model used in this study oudin et al 2005 may overestimate the system sensitivity to rising temperatures several studies suggest that all four primary meteorological variables i e radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity need to be considered for assessing long term trends in et since declining rates of observed near surface wind speed seem to be widespread across the globe e g mcvicar et al 2012 sheffield et al 2012 while oudin et al 2005 proposed an efficient pet equation for lumped rainfall runoff models other pet models need to be tested for improving reliability of the crfs 5 conclusions with growing concerns about the anthropogenic climate change and associated water scarcity risks preparing appropriate adaptation strategies is of great importance especially for agriculture dominated regions in this paper we showed that building or upsizing reservoirs make the system performance more sensitive to climatic stresses via a case study for a simple agricultural reservoir system upsizing the reservoir obviously provides effectiveness on reducing water scarcity however due to the high sensitivity to climatic stresses it is expected to produce a minimal contribution in the study area for 2080 2099 under rcp8 5 scenario a larger reservoir capacity should result in a more sensitive effectiveness to climate change since the system performance converges on zero impact under extreme dryness irrespective of reservoir capacity a key lesson from this study is that water supply performance of a small reservoir can exponentially decrease under a drying climate as a consequence potential losses in system performance could be much larger than before augmenting storage capacity therefore it is worth emphasizing that the direction of climate change i e drying or wetting should be considered before applying a structural change for a simple reservoir system it would also be necessary to formulate operational measures along with the structural changes for reducing sensitivity of the reservoir system to climatic stressors acknowledgements this study was supported
