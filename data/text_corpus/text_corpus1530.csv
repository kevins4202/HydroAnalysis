7650,study region puerto rico a tropical island in the caribbean sea study focus this study examines how water stress in puerto rico is influenced by its physical geography using a new usgs soil water balance model version 2 0 applied to three periods a baseline climatology 1981 2010 a recent decade 2010 2019 and multiple drought years 1991 1994 1997 2015 new hydrological insights for the region oceanic islands often experience chronic water stress due to their size population land use and geomorphology yet more severe acute stress arises due to atmospheric forcing droughts in which decreased precipitation is accompanied by increased temperatures evapotranspiration and water withdrawals based on our analysis of the physical geography of puerto rico we find that water stress is more likely in southern puerto rico during both baseline and recent decade conditions due to reduced net infiltration within the rain shadow of the cordillera central on the contrary chronic stress is lower in mountainous and vegetated areas on the remainder of the island as well as where coastal aquifers are available for augmenting surface water during drought events water stress is more common in central and eastern puerto rico mainly due to reductions in precipitation and net infiltration increased evapotranspiration and limited groundwater availability drought imposes additional chronic stresses by reducing recharge to coastal aquifers these coastal aquifers are recharged by direct rainfall and streamflow from central puerto rico the decreased precipitation and net infiltration in those areas constrain water availability during drought graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought water stress tropical climate puerto rico caribbean islands data availability all links to my data are available in the manuscript 1 introduction the insular caribbean has great cultural diversity among the islands but the region shares similarities regarding its rich biodiversity including but not limited to tropical rain forests endemic species and coral reefs geoghegan and renard 2002 however this rich environment has limited water resources due to the islands small sizes geomorphic characteristics and prevailing climate geological composition affects water availability because topography and geology play critical roles in the physiographic control of rainfall patterns and the availability of surface and subsurface water hendry 1996 in the caribbean carbonate islands most of the water resources are located within the subsurface while the limited amount of surface water is frequently hypersaline because of high evaporative demand therefore these islands are particularly vulnerable to drought as rainwater catchments and groundwater freshwater lenses are the main water supply options and both rely on rainfall driven recharge cant 1996 falkland 1999 water supplies on volcanic islands on the other hand are usually obtained from surface sources due to limited percolation steep terrain and high runoff hendry 1996 additionally the topography of the islands can also affect the magnitude and the location of rainfall with orographic uplift from the mountains resulting in more rainfall occurring on the windward side of caribbean islands jury 2020 martinez et al 2019 sobel et al 2011 the geology topography climate and lack of economic diversity in the insular caribbean make drought one of the most frequent climate hazards resulting in economic losses and water shortages farrell et al 2010 the seasonal rainfall variability and the physical geography of the caribbean limit the ability to capture water during rainy seasons and retain it during dry seasons and multi year drought events consequently many islands experience problems in meeting water demand during drier periods of the year ault 2016 cashman et al 2010 holding et al 2016 a significant drying trend has occurred in the caribbean since 1950 and drought is expected to be more frequent and severe in the caribbean cashman et al 2010 herrera et al 2018 karnauskas et al 2018 moraes et al 2022 predictions based on projected changes in climate also indicate that freshwater stress will be one of the main environmental concerns for small island states until the end of the century karnauskas et al 2018 understanding the water balance is important for predicting the effects of long term climate change on oceanic islands in tropical climates this knowledge is vital for preparing local governments as water stress increases over time therefore this work focused on the main island of puerto rico as a case study in the insular caribbean the island is used to examine the role of physical geography on water budget components including potential groundwater recharge comparing a baseline period and multiple drought years puerto rico is part of the greater antilles in the caribbean sea rising from sea level to 1075 m high at the top of the luquillo mountains over a distance of only 10 20 km along its east coast garcia martino et al 1996 together with the extreme climatic events that affect the island the mountainous landscape introduces complexities related to variations in soils vegetation and rainfall past studies analyzing the hydroclimatic characteristics of puerto rico have focused on understanding the hydrological consequences of major hurricanes miller et al 2019 the precipitation variability keellings and hernández ayala 2019 ramseyer and mote 2018 the historical and projected climate change jury 2022 as well as the spatial temporal variability of meteorological drought events on the island sorí et al 2021 and the connection between drought and the saharan air layer miller et al 2021 mote et al 2017 recent studies have used water budget models to predict local hydrology within the rainforest area of the luquillo mountains zhang et al 2018 understand the role of vegetation on streamflow hall et al 2022 and characterize island wide hydrology harmsen et al 2021 however there is a gap in the literature regarding the use of high resolution model to understand how the island s physical geography e g topography soils climate affects its water balance island wise especially during periods drought therefore this work reduces that gap by applying the newly released open access soil water balance model swb2 version 2 0 developed by the u s geological survey westenbroek et al 2018 to analyze the temporal and spatial variability in puerto rico s water balance and potential groundwater recharge the model provided a high resolution 300 m platform to investigate how puerto rico s physical geography influences its water budget during a baseline period 1981 2010 a recent decade 2010 2019 and multiple drought years 1991 1994 1997 2015 additionally this work provided an opportunity to evaluate model performance without first calibrating to field observations considering many oceanic islands in tropical climates lack such information and an opportunity to compare the results with another recently released regional model goes prweb harmsen et al 2021 by demonstrating the utility of the swb2 model in puerto rico we seek to enhance the capability of other water stressed oceanic islands in tropical settings to assess plan and manage their water resources 2 data and methods 2 1 study area puerto rico s main island is located in the western tropical atlantic extends approximately 180 km from west to east and 65 km from north to south and has a quasi rectangular shape with an area of approximately 11 700 km2 fig 1 the main island is predominantly mountainous 53 of the area with a maximum altitude of 1340 m above sea level while most of the northwest coast is karstic underlain by carbonates the southern coast is predominantly discontinuous coastal sedimentary plains these regions are divided by a central mountain range extending from east to west called the cordillera central mendez tejeda et al 2016 miller et al 1997 torres valcárcel et al 2014 topographically driven drainage is predominantly radial from the central highlands to the sea and consists of short deeply incised streams that have steep gradients in the upper reaches miller et al 1997 puerto rico has few perennial streams along the southern coast and those rivers flow requires precipitation and sustained wet periods annual precipitation is also topographically driven with orographic uplift causing rainfall variation based on elevation aspect and the prevailing wind direction the topography causes greater rainfall on the eastern mountainous windward side an average of 4000 mm yr 1 while the southern leeward side is drier an average of 700 mm yr 1 garcia martino et al 1996 mote et al 2017 hosannah et al 2019 seasonal variation in precipitation also affects runoff which is greater in puerto rico during the april november rainy seasons there is less flow during the dry season december march except in larger streams that originate in igneous and volcanic rocks of the interior miller et al 1997 most precipitation in puerto rico is lost to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration due to the high average temperature but some water is stored within eleven surface water reservoirs that are used for hydroelectric power generation and irrigation miller et al 1997 dieter et al 2018 provide estimates of 2015 daily water withdrawals from surface water and groundwater sources as a function of the water use category they presented the total water withdrawals by source together with the total population thousands to show the most used source and type of water the population is primarily served by public water utilities with agricultural irrigation withdrawing more surface and groundwater than all other users dieter et al 2018 table 3a 4a approximately 22 of all freshwater needs are met by groundwater withdrawals dieter et al 2018 from three important aquifer systems alluvial valley aquifers the south coast aquifer and the north coast limestone aquifer these aquifers provide critical water sources during high water demand periods miller et al 1997 figures 67 74 the 3 to 8 km wide and 70 km long south coast aquifer is the primary aquifer in southern puerto rico mendez tejeda et al 2016 while the north coast limestone aquifer is the most extensive and productive freshwater aquifer on the island lugo et al 2001 maihemuti et al 2015 although the quality of water in the aquifers is normally appropriate for most uses both the north coast limestone aquifer and the south coast aquifer have been compromised by saltwater intrusion miller et al 1997 xu 2016 also these aquifers depend on direct rainfall for recharge which makes them vulnerable to water stress due to the high population density industry tourism and irrigated agriculture all placing increasing demands on limited water resources mendez tejeda et al 2016 2 2 the soil water balance model version 2 0 swb2 this work includes an estimation of the water budget components and water availability measured as net infiltration to assess the role of puerto rico s physical geography e g topography soils climate on the island s water resources we used the swb2 model developed by westenbroek et al 2018 to accomplish this objective the model was originally developed for application to the tropical oceanic island of maui hawai i in the central pacific ocean but it has been successfully applied to other oceanic tropical islands since its release brewington et al 2019 day 2019 harlow and hagedorn 2018 swb2 is an updated version of swb which includes an option for additional input data to estimate irrigation amounts as well as capabilities to allow the use of grids with different spatial extents and projections to be combined without requiring resampling and resizing of the grids unlike watersheds in the usa oceanic islands in tropical climates typically lack detailed daily and historical onsite meteorologic hydrologic geologic edaphic soils and vegetation information thus swb2 was selected because it requires commonly available tabular and gridded data types including temperature precipitation land use classification hydrologic soil group flow direction and soil water capacity westenbroek et al 2018 another consideration was the model s prior application to an oceanic tropical island in the pacific which is similar to puerto rico in terms of climatic and topographic characteristics moreover the caribbean and pacific islands share vulnerabilities related to their isolation dependence on imports and dependence on local sources of freshwater which make them vulnerable to drought they are also uniquely different from most of the mainland regions for reasons including but not limited to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise threatening their coastal aquifers gould et al 2018 even the previous versions of swb were applied recently in other regions of the u s and small tropical islands successfully brewington et al 2019 day 2019 harlow and hagedorn 2018 it is also important to highlight that this study aims to analyze the role of puerto rico s physical geography on its water balance island wise which makes swb2 also a better fit when compared to other open source water budget models such as soil and water assessment tool swat model swat is a basin scale model and is considered an effective tool for simulating hydrologic processes and water quantity assessments based on watershed specifics gassman et al 2007 which is not the focus of this study moreover the open source user friendly characteristic of swb2 and the possibility to employ a high resolution 300 m analysis of water budget components are other reasons why swb2 is a better fit than for example the goes prweb model harmsen et al 2021 which uses a coarser 1 km resolution water and energy balance model harmsen et al 2021 swb2 is also superior to swat modeling which lumps landscape features into watershed scale parameters however goes prweb has been validated and used extensively in puerto rico so it is used here for comparison with swb2 to evaluate model predictions the swb2 model estimates net infiltration instead of groundwater recharge while not estimating groundwater recharge directly swb2 models net infiltration as a proxy net infiltration corresponds to deep percolation which is the downward water flux in the unsaturated zone below the root zone the difference between net infiltration and recharge is the lag time required for water to move vertically through the unsaturated zone to the water table healy 2010 westenbroek et al 2018 there is also a time lag between aquifer recharge and discharge to local streams which is a function of hydrogeologic conditions thus we follow the swb2 modeling terminology and use net infiltration to refer to potential groundwater recharge the swb2 model uses a modified thornthwaite and mather 1957 soil moisture accounting method to calculate net infiltration at a daily frequency on a grid by grid cell basis it uses sources and sinks of water within each grid cell based on input climate data and landscape characteristics while running the model soil moisture is updated every day as the difference between these sources and sinks and net infiltration is only computed when soil moisture exceeds the field capacity otherwise it is zero eq 1 summarizes the water budget components used in this study and explains how swb2 quantifies net infiltration ni which is defined as the deep percolation i e soil percolation below the root zone that eventually becomes groundwater recharge 1 ni r i roff aet s where r is gross precipitation i is interception roff is runoff aet is actual evapotranspiration and δs is change in soil moisture both i and δs are considered storage components within the swb2 model model outputs are reported in english units inches but are converted to si units here the swb2 model grid cell resolution was defined as 300 m for this study this study used the following input datasets for the swb2 model daily gridded climate data from daymet version 3 at 1 km resolution precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature from 1980 to 2019 hydrologic soil types and available water soil capacity awc 0 1 m depth from gridded soil survey geographic gssurgo database at 10 m resolution usda 2020 and two land use and land cover lulc datasets at 30 m resolution the 2001 lulc dataset is from the national land cover database and the 2010 lulc dataset is from noaa office for coastal management noaa ocm all the non transient swb2 input data are shown in fig 2 note that daymet version 3 was used instead of version 4 because preliminary analysis indicates that version 3 performs better in puerto rico when compared to observed runoff jazlynn hall columbia university pers comm the swb2 model requires that gross precipitation r exceeds the assigned interception i before net precipitation reaches the ground harlow and hagedorn 2018 westenbroek et al 2018 thus we determined interception amounts for the different lulc types based on previous studies harlow and hagedorn 2018 we defined the growing season as the period corresponding to the april november rainy seasons in puerto rico while the dry season december march is the non growing season table 1 the model estimates direct runoff roff using the curve number method for the different lulc classes and hydrologic soil groups we assigned curve numbers based on published values huffman et al 2011 kent 1973 westenbroek et al 2018 presented in table 2 group a b c d a d b d and c d soils are originally from the gssurgo dataset usda 2020 while the group w and rout soils correspond to water and rock outcrop categories created by the authors to account for gaps within the gssurgo dataset we assign group w soils to all water and wetland landscapes e g riverwash alluvial land and open water and assign group rout soils to all rock outcrops and rocky lands we assign group c soils to grid cells with no data available which corresponds to the main soil type in the region i e silty clay loam according to local experts eric harmssen university of puerto rico mayagüez pers comm we assign group c d soils to urban lands due to their lower permeability swb2 avoids the overestimation of net infiltration by allowing the user to assign maximum infiltration rates that specify the maximum amount of daily recharge for each hydrologic soil type table 2 after reaching the maximum daily net infiltration the remaining water is classified as rejected net infiltration and is diverted to surface water therefore the total runoff roff is the sum of the direct runoff and the rejected net infiltration in this study we use the same maximum infiltration rates used by westenbroek et al 2018 additionally three potential evapotranspiration pet estimation methods are available in the swb2 model we employed the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 which is considered a simplified version of the fao penman monteith method that is not included in the model the hargreaves samani method requires spatially distributed minimum and maximum daily temperatures which we obtained from daymet version 3 then swb2 estimates actual et aet as a function of pet net precipitation and the current soil moisture within each grid cell the model assumes that aet equals pet whenever net precipitation exceeds pet otherwise aet is equal to the amount of water that can be extracted from the soil via aet considering the computed values of soil moisture retention tables of thornthwaite and mather 1957 and modified by westenbroek et al 2010 the thornthwaite mather function requires estimates of the maximum soil moisture storage capacity which was determined using awc data from gssurgo multiplied by the rooting depth within each hydrologic soil type which was defined using westenbroek et al 2018 table s1 in supplementary material finally the swb2 model requires an initial amount of soil moisture to calculate potential soil saturation and net infiltration or evapotranspiration on day 1 which was determined using the reference value provided by westenbroek et al 2018 for the swb2 model in maui hawai i additionally we also ran the swb2 model for a one year warm up period prior to the analysis period to account for initial transients a detailed control file including all the parameters used to run the swb2 model for puerto rico is provided in supplementary material table s2 2 3 data periods two periods were selected for modeling a baseline period 1981 2010 and a recent decade 2010 2019 this data bifurcation created a climatology reference period baseline that is used to evaluate whether changes are occurring in the latter period to account for possible differences in lulc in puerto rico we ran the baseline climatology using lulc from 2001 and the recent decade with an updated lulc from 2010 with differences shown in fig 2 after defining the baseline climatology 1981 2010 and the recent decade 2010 2019 to run the swb2 model we identified four drought years 10 of the period of analysis based on the lowest annual average rainfall amounts in puerto rico 1994 1997 1991 and 2015 in descending order then we averaged swb2 outputs from these years to create drought years water budget annual maps this allowed us to compare the spatial distribution of net infiltration over puerto rico during the baseline climatology 1981 2010 with drought years to determine regions with greater water scarcity 2 4 model evaluation our goal was to test a model that requires no calibration which is dependent on input parameters that accurately represent field conditions and do not require modification we employ this strategy because many oceanic islands in tropical climates lack field data for model calibration developing field datasets in these settings is laborious expensive and requires long term commitments we know that multiple methods are used to assess water budget models based on the availability of data in this study we assessed the swb2 outputs in two ways 1 by comparing swb2 against the goes prweb mecikalski and harmsen 2019 harmsen et al 2021 which is an existing water budget model for puerto rico and 2 by comparing swb2 to observed watershed streamflow from us geological survey usgs stream gauges fig 3 compares swb2 with goes prweb model outputs for the decade of overlapping data i e 2009 2019 rainfall and runoff comparisons fig 3 a d both demonstrated a positive correlation between swb2 and goes prweb models of 0 6 and 0 5 respectively however only rainfall correlation was statistically significant p 0 10 while the relationship between runoff was not statistically significant from 2009 2014 the rainfall input from swb2 presented at least 30 more annual average rainfall than the goes prweb model although further investigation is needed to assess which rainfall input data is more accurate daymet version 3 used in swb2 or noaa s advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps used in goes prweb both models rainfall amounts from 2015 to 2019 are in good agreement which includes at least two extreme events the intense drought of 2015 and hurricanes irma and maria in 2017 the models correlation for aet was 0 5 which is statistically significant p 0 10 although swb2 seemed to overestimate aet when compared to goes prweb finally the correlation between the swb2 and goes prweb net infiltration was very strong 0 8 and statistically significant p 0 01 therefore considering that the models used different approaches to estimate the water budget as well as different input data sources the statistically significant correlation together with the similarities among models results of annual net infiltration suggest that they should both be considered suitable options for estimating net infiltration in puerto rico we also analyzed the swb2 model performance in comparison with observed streamflow data from the usgs the watersheds selection in puerto rico was based on their spatial distribution over the island and the availability of data that overlapped the most with our period of study 1981 2019 the following watersheds were included in this study from larger to smaller manati 330 7 km2 guanajibo 310 5 km2 cibuco 226 8 km2 fajardo 38 3 km2 and espiritu santo 22 5 km2 fig 4 from the swb2 model we used roff runoff rejected net infiltration and converted the model outputs to streamflow m3 s 1 to create the simulated data and compare it with the observation in the observation data we performed baseflow separation through the web based hydrograph analysis tool what system which used the eckhardt filter method and was tested to provide more consistent results than a manual separation of baseflow lim et al 2005 we selected the parameter perennial streams with hard rock aquifers for all watersheds analyzed because they are all located in the mountainous area of the island finally we compared the simulated versus observed direct runoff by running three model performance statistical tests commonly used in previous studies ang and oeurng 2018 kumar et al 2017 moriasi et al 2007 which are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and the percent bias pbias we perform the statistical tests separately for each period of analysis because we have used different lulc to run the swb2 the definition of each model performance test is summarized below with additional details available in moriasi et al 2007 nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line by a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured data variance information nse ranges from and 1 0 1 inclusive where 1 0 is the optimal value values between 0 0 and 1 0 are viewed as acceptable levels of performance rsr standardizes the rmse which is one of the commonly used error index statistics using the observations standard deviation rsr is calculated as the ratio of the rmse and standard deviation of measured data it varies from the optimal value of 0 which indicates zero residual variation and perfect model simulation to a large positive value therefore the lower the rsr the better the model simulation pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data the optimal value is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values mean model underestimation bias and negative values mean model overestimation bias the timeseries presented in figs s1 and s2 provide a comparison of the monthly average simulated versus observed direct runoff for puerto rico during the baseline climatology and recent decade respectively overall the model was consistent in predicting peak flows over time mainly in the larger area watersheds while it underestimated most of the low flows in the small watersheds located in the luquillo mountains such as fajardo and espiritu santo the model slightly underestimated the flow over time these poor predictions of lower flows are likely due to the lack of consideration of aquifer hydraulic behavior in the swb2 model fig 5 shows both scenarios together and reinforces that the model better simulated average and peak flows mainly for manati cibuco guanajibo but underestimated low flows while for fajardo and espiritu santo basins the model is overall underestimating the flow however the relationship between the simulated and observed data is very strong and statistically significant p 0 01 for all watersheds with a correlation coefficient 0 8 except for manati in the recent decade which presented a correlation coefficient of 0 7 moreover the model performance statistics for puerto rico for the baseline climatology table 3 indicated that the best simulation occurred in guanajibo with both nse 0 75 and rsr 0 50 rating as good model performance while its pbias indicates the model has a very good performance with an overestimation of only 2 9 of the flow cibuco came next with a similar model performance indicating a good rate for nse 0 71 and rsr 0 54 and very good for pbias 8 2 while the simulation of direct runoff for manati was satisfactory in all model performance statistics nse 0 52 rsr 0 69 pbias 23 5 for smaller basins swb2 was very close to satisfactory for fajardo s nse 0 45 and rsr 0 74 but it did not have a satisfactory performance for espiritu santo in the recent decade on the other hand the swb2 performed slightly better for fajardo and espiritu santo but slightly worse for manati cibuco and guanajibo in fact the fajardo simulation in the recent decade had a satisfactory nse 0 60 and rsr 0 63 with a pbias indicating the model underestimated only 34 of the flow table 3 for guanajibo and cibuco the model performed very similarly and kept a good nse and rsr and very good pbias while manati was slightly below the satisfactory performance overall espiritu santo was the watershed simulation with the worst performance when comparing all the statistical tests and periods which was expected as the smaller watershed analyzed here the slightly better performance of the model in the larger watersheds during the baseline climatology 1981 2010 than in the recent decade 2010 2019 may be related to the fact that the caribbean in general has been presenting a negative trend in drought index indicating more frequent and severe drought events herrera and ault 2017 herrera et al 2018 moraes et al 2022 because the model did not well reproduce low flows in puerto rico we hypothesize that the increase in the occurrence and intensity of drought events may have affected the overall model performance in the recent decade together with the fact that there is a lack of consideration of aquifer hydraulic behavior in the swb2 model therefore this limitation of the model should be taken into consideration when analyzing the results from the drought years particularly because they are linked to low flows on the other hand the observed improvement in swb2 performance during the recent decade in smaller watersheds located within the luquillo mountains could be related to the increase in data availability and equipment recently installed by the long term ecological research lter project within the tropical rainforest this along with newly available daily rainfall data from an updated version of global historical climate network thornton et al 2016 has probably improved model performance in fajardo and espiritu santo however we believe that the accuracy of the daymet rainfall data and its spatial resolution of 1 km may have a larger effect in smaller watersheds like espiritu santo when compared to the larger basins this basin contains fewer than 22 grid cells of rainfall data a coarse resolution for the accuracy and analysis of rainfall needed in the steeply slope terrain located in the luquillo mountains moreover the basins where the model performed better e g manati cibuco guanajibo fajardo all have a large portion of group c soils e g silty clay loam which is the most common soil type in puerto rico this may indicate that the swb2 model performs satisfactorily for most of the areas on the island although we recommend caution interpreting the results of the swb2 model mainly for areas located in the steep slope of the luquillo mountains where the model is mostly underestimating streamflow we believe the model has performed well in puerto rico without the need for calibration and it should be considered as an option for future studies interested in water budget modeling on this and other oceanic islands with tropical climates 3 results 3 1 baseline climatology versus recent decade annual net infiltration in puerto rico had a similar spatial distribution when comparing the baseline climatology 1981 2010 and the recent decade 2010 2019 figs 6 a and 7 a show that the estimated net infiltration was greater in the central west and northern portion of the island ranging from 600 to 900 mm yr 1 baseline to 700 1000 mm yr 1 recent decade the greatest net infiltration occurred in eastern puerto rico in lower elevations of the luquillo mountains el yunque national forest where it reached values greater than 1500 mm yr 1 during both periods of analysis when examining the other water budget elements we see that central and eastern puerto rico were areas with greater values of aet and runoff when compared to other areas within the island but they were also the areas with the greatest annual rainfall 2500 mm yr 1 therefore the abundant rainfall in those areas provided extra water available for net infiltration another characteristic of the areas with greater net infiltration in puerto rico is that they are in the heavily vegetated mountainous areas of the island i e cordillera central and luquillo mountains and have soil types b and c with greater infiltration rates fig 2 c southern puerto rico on the other side was where the lowest amount of net infiltration occurred in both periods that region is known for its dry climate and we can see that while the annual rainfall was 1000 mm yr 1 the annual aet was as high as in the rest of the island 750 mm yr 1 which contributed to its lower annual net infiltration 200 mm yr 1 while water budget components are geographically similar between periods there are some important differences in the amount of water distributed across the island which can be evaluated by taking the difference between the recent decade minus the baseline climatology fig 8 in central and western areas net infiltration was at least 250 mm yr 1 greater in the recent decade than in the baseline climatology while aet was similar and runoff increased in the recent decade 100 mm yr 1 the increased rainfall on most of the island could explain these differences with the central west region receiving at least 400 mm yr 1 more rainfall in the recent decade than during the baseline climatology yet the opposite occurred in the luquillo mountains where less rainfall was registered from 2010 to 2019 250 mm yr 1 along with less runoff 200 mm yr 1 and less aet 50 mm yr 1 consequently net infiltration decreased in eastern puerto rico in the recent decade 100 mm yr 1 in addition to the spatial distribution of rainfall the temporal distribution is also important the greatest rainfall occurred in the recent decade fig 9 with hurricanes irma and maria in 2017 and other large events in 2010 and 2011 three of the four years with the lowest rainfall totals i e 1991 1994 1997 occurred during the baseline period while only one 2015 occurred during the recent decade along with rainfall lulc changes may also affect net infiltration differences between the baseline climatology and the recent decade in fig 2 a b we see a reduction in the herbaceous category between 2001 and 2010 lulc with a concomitant increase in cultivated crops in the central area greater rainfall in central puerto rico and less herbaceous vegetation to intercept rainfall increases net infiltration on the other hand the conversion of herbaceous to developed land in eastern puerto rico together with decreased rainfall may have contributed to the decrease in net infiltration during the recent decade 3 2 drought years versus baseline climatology we selected four years in descending order 1994 1997 1991 2015 to represent drought conditions see methods section fig 10 shows the annual spatial distribution of the water budget components during those drought years and indicated a much smaller area as well as lower values of net infiltration when compared to the baseline climatology during drought years puerto rico had only small areas of net infiltration still occurring in the central west of the island with values between 300 and 500 mm yr 1 and in the lower elevations of luquillo mountains el yunque national forest 800 mm yr 1 most of the island however has minimal net infiltration 200 mm yr 1 most of southern puerto rico receives less than 700 mm yr 1 of rainfall while a similar amount of water was lost through aet fig 10 b c which resulted in little water for net infiltration 100 mm yr 1 the northern area of puerto rico also suffered from lower precipitation and higher aet resulting in infiltration concentrated in a small area puerto rico had a reduction in net infiltration of at least 150 mm yr 1 during drought years except for some rock outcrops located in the north of the island which showed no difference fig 11 however the areas most affected by drought were parts of central and northern puerto rico as well as the luquillo mountains where the reduction in net infiltration was more than 400 mm yr 1 below the baseline period central and eastern puerto rico were areas where the greatest departure in precipitation occurred 700 mm yr 1 together with a reduction in runoff 400 mm yr 1 although aet mostly decreased over the island during drought years central west and eastern puerto rico registered similar amounts of aet when compared to the baseline climatology together with large reductions in rainfall higher aet could also explain why central west and eastern puerto rico had the greatest difference in net infiltration during drought years the difference in net infiltration in southern puerto rico was smaller than the rest of the island 100 mm yr 1 when comparing drought years and the baseline climatology 4 discussion 4 1 baseline climatology versus recent decade the role of physical geography e g topography vegetation climate on the water cycle is evident when comparing the drier south with the wetter east and central puerto rico figs 6 and 7 southern puerto rico is known as a drier region lower humidity and precipitation higher pet and is classified as a dry forest holdridge 1967 the lower humidity is related to its geographic location on the leeward side of the central mountain range i e cordillera central which creates a shield blocking the atlantic moisture and making the south drier than other regions of puerto rico torres valcárcel et al 2014 moreover recent studies confirmed the dryness of this region by showing that the potential evapotranspiration is greater than rainfall from 2009 to 2018 indicating a greater water demand than water supply and resulting in dry soils and low groundwater recharge in southern puerto rico harmsen 2019 the presence of group d soils with lower infiltration rates fig 2 c could also contributed to lower net infiltration rates in the south orographic uplift of northeasterly winds from the atlantic ocean along the cordillera central and luquillo mountains results in greater rainfall that makes these regions wetter than the rest of the island hosannah et al 2019 sobel et al 2011 additionally these mountains are covered by evergreen tropical vegetation with the luquillo mountains being the location of the el yunque national forest the presence of forests can affect the water cycle through their high absorption of solar radiation due to low albedo resulting in energy available for evapotranspiration of water cloud formation and possible local showers scheffer et al 2005 in eastern puerto rico the decrease in rainfall in the recent decade may be influenced by the saharan air layer sal intrusion in the island in 2015 for example the caribbean registered the highest dust concentration from 1980 to 2016 while an increasing trend in dust mass concentration has been reported since 1991 hosannah et al 2019 it is known that sal peaks from late june to mid august and can propagate westward across the atlantic ocean bringing anomalously hot dry air in the low to the middle troposphere around 700 hpa producing thermodynamically stable conditions and limiting rainfall in the insular caribbean in general and in puerto rico in particular kuciauskas et al 2018 mote et al 2017 therefore with the increase in dust concentration in the recent decade the orographic effect that plays an important role in keeping eastern puerto rico wetter than most of the island may have been suppressed however local factors may have played an additional role in precipitation variability with the observed rainfall increase in central west puerto rico during the recent decade being related to local island processes such as surface heating orographic uplift and sea breeze trade wind convergence that can overcome drought and sal episodes hosannah et al 2019 these local variations in precipitation over puerto rico were well represented during the 2015 drought event when the east was severely affected by drought miller and ramseyer 2020 mote et al 2017 while the western side had sites registering positive precipitation anomalies hosannah et al 2019 4 2 drought years versus baseline climatology overall the island had much less net infiltration during drought years with areas in the south close to 0 mm yr 1 when analyzing the relationship between rainfall runoff and aet fig 10 over the island during the drought years it is also possible to see that at least two thirds of the rainfall was lost as aet and the remaining third was divided between runoff and net infiltration past studies suggested that high aet is one of the primary reasons for the lack of surface water availability the vulnerability to drought and changes in groundwater recharge on small tropical islands gamble 2004 holding et al 2016 a recent study analyzing historical meteorological drought in puerto rico from 1950 to 2019 indicated a high frequency of monthly extreme drought conditions in the northeast of the island sorí et al 2021 this is the region where we found the decrease in net infiltration to be greater than 400 mm yr 1 below the baseline period during drought years we know that for drought years such as 1994 and 2015 one of the reasons for the greater reduction in rainfall in eastern puerto rico was the intrusion of the sal as previously discussed the inhibition of rainfall produced by sal was likely more intense over the mountainous regions of puerto rico due to the stable thermodynamic conditions that suppressed the orographic uplift resulting in less local rainfall miller and ramseyer 2020 mote et al 2017 additionally the drought events of 1994 and 2015 were also related to the positive phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao that occurred during the winter preceding the sal intrusion and the drought event mote et al 2017 this contributed to a stronger north atlantic subtropical high nahp and stronger trader winds over tropical north atlantic which could have helped to bring more dust from sal events toward puerto rico the greater intensity of the 1994 and 2015 droughts in puerto rico was registered in other studies álvarez berríos et al 2018 mote et al 2017 and the water budget presented here fig 9 suggested they also share a water deficit occurring in the prior year this indicates that an imbalance in water before a year with low rainfall are ingredients that may result in intense droughts although recent work indicated that intense drought events are becoming more common on the east side of the island and its rainforest in the luquillo mountains álvarez berríos et al 2018 mote et al 2017 a recent study suggested that forested areas are more resilient than deforested areas when drought events occur hall et al 2022 the authors demonstrated that forest cover increases water storage and hillslope infiltration that may reduce drought impacts on streamflow in puerto rico highlighting maintenance of forest cover as an important water management strategy to increase infiltration hall et al 2022 it is also important to highlight the potential effects of drought on aquifers the area in northern puerto rico where net infiltration reduction occurred is situated above the north coast limestone aquifer fig 2 b which indicates a substantial reduction in groundwater recharge during drought events the north coast limestone aquifer is considered the most extensive and productive freshwater aquifer on the island with its groundwater serving as an important source for local ecosystems and public water supply lugo et al 2001 maihemuti et al 2015 padilla et al 2011 therefore the reduced rainfall in north and central puerto rico during drought years fig 11 b may directly affect the recharge of the north coast aquifer because parts of this aquifer are almost exclusively recharged by direct rainfall while other areas are recharged both by direct rainfall and the streams from cordillera central on the volcanic rocks that infiltrate underground when they cross onto the karst areas mendez tejeda et al 2016 differences in net infiltration in southern puerto rico where the south coast aquifer is located were smaller than on the rest of the island 100 mm yr 1 during drought years when compared to the baseline climatology this aquifer is also recharged by direct rainfall and streams flowing out of the cordillera central mendez tejeda et al 2016 therefore the impacts of drought in the south coast aquifer recharge may come not only from the reduction in local rainfall and net infiltration but also from the decreased rainfall felt in central puerto rico which affected the mountainous river s streamflow southeastern puerto rico was classified as the area of the island most exposed to any classification of drought from 2000 to 2016 álvarez berríos et al 2018 while some studies indicated that the south coast aquifer has already been suffering from lower recharge and higher groundwater demand in the recent decade harmsen 2019 torres gonzalez and rodriguez 2016 moreover the south coast aquifer s groundwater was the principal source of potable water for cities along the southern coast of puerto rico and the primary source of water for agricultural irrigation torres gonzalez and rodriguez 2016 therefore the lack of net infiltration and groundwater recharge during drought events when surface water is limited creates severe water stress while one solution would be to develop energy intensive desalination plants as an alternative water supply this creates additional problems as desalinization is based on the use of fossil fuels increased use of desalinization would increase air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gasses in the island mendez tejeda et al 2016 5 conclusions this study analyzed how the physical geography of puerto rico affects the island s water budget during a baseline climatology 1981 2010 a recent decade 2010 2019 and drought years 1991 1994 1997 and 2015 results indicated that central west north and eastern puerto rico had greater net infiltration than the south during baseline climatology and the recent decade the greatest net infiltration occurred in mountainous and highly vegetated areas of the island such as the cordillera central and the luquillo mountains highlighting the important role of topography in creating orographic rainfall and vegetation as a source of moisture the presence of group b and c soils with higher infiltration rates may have also contributed to the greater amount of net infiltration in those areas however rainfall variability in the recent decade has affected the net infiltration with the central west and northern puerto rico receiving more rainfall followed by greater net infiltration and the east registering a decrease in both variables which could be a consequence of large scale atmospheric circulation mechanisms meanwhile southern puerto rico experienced lower net infiltration during both analysis periods the location of the south on the leeward side of the cordillera central together with the presence of more group d soils with lower infiltration rates and greater areas of cultivated crops than natural vegetation may have all combined to cause lower net infiltration there during drought years the entire island reduced its net infiltration as a consequence of reduced rainfall with the worst scenarios occurring in the central west and eastern puerto rico potentially affecting tropical forests and their soil moisture as well as in parts of the north where the productive north coast aquifer is located while reductions in net infiltration during drought events were less dramatic in southern puerto rico than in other areas of the island these reductions aggravated the persistent water stress by reducing recharge in the south coast aquifer which already suffers from low recharge and high groundwater demand these findings are the first that we know of to highlight the role of physical geography on puerto rico s water budget and net infiltration while comparing the baseline climatology the recent decade and drought years thus we expect they will be useful to help the local government in planning for water management and drought events moreover we showed that swb2 a newly released open source water budget model provides a useful platform for incorporating the physical geography of a tropical oceanic island in water planning and management even without calibration the model performed satisfactorily and very well in some cases in matching observed streamflow from watersheds across puerto rico this suggests that the model is suitable for use on other oceanic islands in tropical settings where data suitable for model calibration are lacking finally the authors note the limitations of the swb2 model mainly in reproducing low flows therefore we suggest that future work should test the swb2 model performance in puerto rico using different model parameters we have used here and even testing different datasets as well as adding input data we did not find by the time of this research such as fog interception or irrigation the application of the swb2 model in other caribbean islands would also be interesting and allow for the comparison of swb2 performance in different areas of the caribbean funding this work was supported by the nsf

7650,study region puerto rico a tropical island in the caribbean sea study focus this study examines how water stress in puerto rico is influenced by its physical geography using a new usgs soil water balance model version 2 0 applied to three periods a baseline climatology 1981 2010 a recent decade 2010 2019 and multiple drought years 1991 1994 1997 2015 new hydrological insights for the region oceanic islands often experience chronic water stress due to their size population land use and geomorphology yet more severe acute stress arises due to atmospheric forcing droughts in which decreased precipitation is accompanied by increased temperatures evapotranspiration and water withdrawals based on our analysis of the physical geography of puerto rico we find that water stress is more likely in southern puerto rico during both baseline and recent decade conditions due to reduced net infiltration within the rain shadow of the cordillera central on the contrary chronic stress is lower in mountainous and vegetated areas on the remainder of the island as well as where coastal aquifers are available for augmenting surface water during drought events water stress is more common in central and eastern puerto rico mainly due to reductions in precipitation and net infiltration increased evapotranspiration and limited groundwater availability drought imposes additional chronic stresses by reducing recharge to coastal aquifers these coastal aquifers are recharged by direct rainfall and streamflow from central puerto rico the decreased precipitation and net infiltration in those areas constrain water availability during drought graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought water stress tropical climate puerto rico caribbean islands data availability all links to my data are available in the manuscript 1 introduction the insular caribbean has great cultural diversity among the islands but the region shares similarities regarding its rich biodiversity including but not limited to tropical rain forests endemic species and coral reefs geoghegan and renard 2002 however this rich environment has limited water resources due to the islands small sizes geomorphic characteristics and prevailing climate geological composition affects water availability because topography and geology play critical roles in the physiographic control of rainfall patterns and the availability of surface and subsurface water hendry 1996 in the caribbean carbonate islands most of the water resources are located within the subsurface while the limited amount of surface water is frequently hypersaline because of high evaporative demand therefore these islands are particularly vulnerable to drought as rainwater catchments and groundwater freshwater lenses are the main water supply options and both rely on rainfall driven recharge cant 1996 falkland 1999 water supplies on volcanic islands on the other hand are usually obtained from surface sources due to limited percolation steep terrain and high runoff hendry 1996 additionally the topography of the islands can also affect the magnitude and the location of rainfall with orographic uplift from the mountains resulting in more rainfall occurring on the windward side of caribbean islands jury 2020 martinez et al 2019 sobel et al 2011 the geology topography climate and lack of economic diversity in the insular caribbean make drought one of the most frequent climate hazards resulting in economic losses and water shortages farrell et al 2010 the seasonal rainfall variability and the physical geography of the caribbean limit the ability to capture water during rainy seasons and retain it during dry seasons and multi year drought events consequently many islands experience problems in meeting water demand during drier periods of the year ault 2016 cashman et al 2010 holding et al 2016 a significant drying trend has occurred in the caribbean since 1950 and drought is expected to be more frequent and severe in the caribbean cashman et al 2010 herrera et al 2018 karnauskas et al 2018 moraes et al 2022 predictions based on projected changes in climate also indicate that freshwater stress will be one of the main environmental concerns for small island states until the end of the century karnauskas et al 2018 understanding the water balance is important for predicting the effects of long term climate change on oceanic islands in tropical climates this knowledge is vital for preparing local governments as water stress increases over time therefore this work focused on the main island of puerto rico as a case study in the insular caribbean the island is used to examine the role of physical geography on water budget components including potential groundwater recharge comparing a baseline period and multiple drought years puerto rico is part of the greater antilles in the caribbean sea rising from sea level to 1075 m high at the top of the luquillo mountains over a distance of only 10 20 km along its east coast garcia martino et al 1996 together with the extreme climatic events that affect the island the mountainous landscape introduces complexities related to variations in soils vegetation and rainfall past studies analyzing the hydroclimatic characteristics of puerto rico have focused on understanding the hydrological consequences of major hurricanes miller et al 2019 the precipitation variability keellings and hernández ayala 2019 ramseyer and mote 2018 the historical and projected climate change jury 2022 as well as the spatial temporal variability of meteorological drought events on the island sorí et al 2021 and the connection between drought and the saharan air layer miller et al 2021 mote et al 2017 recent studies have used water budget models to predict local hydrology within the rainforest area of the luquillo mountains zhang et al 2018 understand the role of vegetation on streamflow hall et al 2022 and characterize island wide hydrology harmsen et al 2021 however there is a gap in the literature regarding the use of high resolution model to understand how the island s physical geography e g topography soils climate affects its water balance island wise especially during periods drought therefore this work reduces that gap by applying the newly released open access soil water balance model swb2 version 2 0 developed by the u s geological survey westenbroek et al 2018 to analyze the temporal and spatial variability in puerto rico s water balance and potential groundwater recharge the model provided a high resolution 300 m platform to investigate how puerto rico s physical geography influences its water budget during a baseline period 1981 2010 a recent decade 2010 2019 and multiple drought years 1991 1994 1997 2015 additionally this work provided an opportunity to evaluate model performance without first calibrating to field observations considering many oceanic islands in tropical climates lack such information and an opportunity to compare the results with another recently released regional model goes prweb harmsen et al 2021 by demonstrating the utility of the swb2 model in puerto rico we seek to enhance the capability of other water stressed oceanic islands in tropical settings to assess plan and manage their water resources 2 data and methods 2 1 study area puerto rico s main island is located in the western tropical atlantic extends approximately 180 km from west to east and 65 km from north to south and has a quasi rectangular shape with an area of approximately 11 700 km2 fig 1 the main island is predominantly mountainous 53 of the area with a maximum altitude of 1340 m above sea level while most of the northwest coast is karstic underlain by carbonates the southern coast is predominantly discontinuous coastal sedimentary plains these regions are divided by a central mountain range extending from east to west called the cordillera central mendez tejeda et al 2016 miller et al 1997 torres valcárcel et al 2014 topographically driven drainage is predominantly radial from the central highlands to the sea and consists of short deeply incised streams that have steep gradients in the upper reaches miller et al 1997 puerto rico has few perennial streams along the southern coast and those rivers flow requires precipitation and sustained wet periods annual precipitation is also topographically driven with orographic uplift causing rainfall variation based on elevation aspect and the prevailing wind direction the topography causes greater rainfall on the eastern mountainous windward side an average of 4000 mm yr 1 while the southern leeward side is drier an average of 700 mm yr 1 garcia martino et al 1996 mote et al 2017 hosannah et al 2019 seasonal variation in precipitation also affects runoff which is greater in puerto rico during the april november rainy seasons there is less flow during the dry season december march except in larger streams that originate in igneous and volcanic rocks of the interior miller et al 1997 most precipitation in puerto rico is lost to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration due to the high average temperature but some water is stored within eleven surface water reservoirs that are used for hydroelectric power generation and irrigation miller et al 1997 dieter et al 2018 provide estimates of 2015 daily water withdrawals from surface water and groundwater sources as a function of the water use category they presented the total water withdrawals by source together with the total population thousands to show the most used source and type of water the population is primarily served by public water utilities with agricultural irrigation withdrawing more surface and groundwater than all other users dieter et al 2018 table 3a 4a approximately 22 of all freshwater needs are met by groundwater withdrawals dieter et al 2018 from three important aquifer systems alluvial valley aquifers the south coast aquifer and the north coast limestone aquifer these aquifers provide critical water sources during high water demand periods miller et al 1997 figures 67 74 the 3 to 8 km wide and 70 km long south coast aquifer is the primary aquifer in southern puerto rico mendez tejeda et al 2016 while the north coast limestone aquifer is the most extensive and productive freshwater aquifer on the island lugo et al 2001 maihemuti et al 2015 although the quality of water in the aquifers is normally appropriate for most uses both the north coast limestone aquifer and the south coast aquifer have been compromised by saltwater intrusion miller et al 1997 xu 2016 also these aquifers depend on direct rainfall for recharge which makes them vulnerable to water stress due to the high population density industry tourism and irrigated agriculture all placing increasing demands on limited water resources mendez tejeda et al 2016 2 2 the soil water balance model version 2 0 swb2 this work includes an estimation of the water budget components and water availability measured as net infiltration to assess the role of puerto rico s physical geography e g topography soils climate on the island s water resources we used the swb2 model developed by westenbroek et al 2018 to accomplish this objective the model was originally developed for application to the tropical oceanic island of maui hawai i in the central pacific ocean but it has been successfully applied to other oceanic tropical islands since its release brewington et al 2019 day 2019 harlow and hagedorn 2018 swb2 is an updated version of swb which includes an option for additional input data to estimate irrigation amounts as well as capabilities to allow the use of grids with different spatial extents and projections to be combined without requiring resampling and resizing of the grids unlike watersheds in the usa oceanic islands in tropical climates typically lack detailed daily and historical onsite meteorologic hydrologic geologic edaphic soils and vegetation information thus swb2 was selected because it requires commonly available tabular and gridded data types including temperature precipitation land use classification hydrologic soil group flow direction and soil water capacity westenbroek et al 2018 another consideration was the model s prior application to an oceanic tropical island in the pacific which is similar to puerto rico in terms of climatic and topographic characteristics moreover the caribbean and pacific islands share vulnerabilities related to their isolation dependence on imports and dependence on local sources of freshwater which make them vulnerable to drought they are also uniquely different from most of the mainland regions for reasons including but not limited to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise threatening their coastal aquifers gould et al 2018 even the previous versions of swb were applied recently in other regions of the u s and small tropical islands successfully brewington et al 2019 day 2019 harlow and hagedorn 2018 it is also important to highlight that this study aims to analyze the role of puerto rico s physical geography on its water balance island wise which makes swb2 also a better fit when compared to other open source water budget models such as soil and water assessment tool swat model swat is a basin scale model and is considered an effective tool for simulating hydrologic processes and water quantity assessments based on watershed specifics gassman et al 2007 which is not the focus of this study moreover the open source user friendly characteristic of swb2 and the possibility to employ a high resolution 300 m analysis of water budget components are other reasons why swb2 is a better fit than for example the goes prweb model harmsen et al 2021 which uses a coarser 1 km resolution water and energy balance model harmsen et al 2021 swb2 is also superior to swat modeling which lumps landscape features into watershed scale parameters however goes prweb has been validated and used extensively in puerto rico so it is used here for comparison with swb2 to evaluate model predictions the swb2 model estimates net infiltration instead of groundwater recharge while not estimating groundwater recharge directly swb2 models net infiltration as a proxy net infiltration corresponds to deep percolation which is the downward water flux in the unsaturated zone below the root zone the difference between net infiltration and recharge is the lag time required for water to move vertically through the unsaturated zone to the water table healy 2010 westenbroek et al 2018 there is also a time lag between aquifer recharge and discharge to local streams which is a function of hydrogeologic conditions thus we follow the swb2 modeling terminology and use net infiltration to refer to potential groundwater recharge the swb2 model uses a modified thornthwaite and mather 1957 soil moisture accounting method to calculate net infiltration at a daily frequency on a grid by grid cell basis it uses sources and sinks of water within each grid cell based on input climate data and landscape characteristics while running the model soil moisture is updated every day as the difference between these sources and sinks and net infiltration is only computed when soil moisture exceeds the field capacity otherwise it is zero eq 1 summarizes the water budget components used in this study and explains how swb2 quantifies net infiltration ni which is defined as the deep percolation i e soil percolation below the root zone that eventually becomes groundwater recharge 1 ni r i roff aet s where r is gross precipitation i is interception roff is runoff aet is actual evapotranspiration and δs is change in soil moisture both i and δs are considered storage components within the swb2 model model outputs are reported in english units inches but are converted to si units here the swb2 model grid cell resolution was defined as 300 m for this study this study used the following input datasets for the swb2 model daily gridded climate data from daymet version 3 at 1 km resolution precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature from 1980 to 2019 hydrologic soil types and available water soil capacity awc 0 1 m depth from gridded soil survey geographic gssurgo database at 10 m resolution usda 2020 and two land use and land cover lulc datasets at 30 m resolution the 2001 lulc dataset is from the national land cover database and the 2010 lulc dataset is from noaa office for coastal management noaa ocm all the non transient swb2 input data are shown in fig 2 note that daymet version 3 was used instead of version 4 because preliminary analysis indicates that version 3 performs better in puerto rico when compared to observed runoff jazlynn hall columbia university pers comm the swb2 model requires that gross precipitation r exceeds the assigned interception i before net precipitation reaches the ground harlow and hagedorn 2018 westenbroek et al 2018 thus we determined interception amounts for the different lulc types based on previous studies harlow and hagedorn 2018 we defined the growing season as the period corresponding to the april november rainy seasons in puerto rico while the dry season december march is the non growing season table 1 the model estimates direct runoff roff using the curve number method for the different lulc classes and hydrologic soil groups we assigned curve numbers based on published values huffman et al 2011 kent 1973 westenbroek et al 2018 presented in table 2 group a b c d a d b d and c d soils are originally from the gssurgo dataset usda 2020 while the group w and rout soils correspond to water and rock outcrop categories created by the authors to account for gaps within the gssurgo dataset we assign group w soils to all water and wetland landscapes e g riverwash alluvial land and open water and assign group rout soils to all rock outcrops and rocky lands we assign group c soils to grid cells with no data available which corresponds to the main soil type in the region i e silty clay loam according to local experts eric harmssen university of puerto rico mayagüez pers comm we assign group c d soils to urban lands due to their lower permeability swb2 avoids the overestimation of net infiltration by allowing the user to assign maximum infiltration rates that specify the maximum amount of daily recharge for each hydrologic soil type table 2 after reaching the maximum daily net infiltration the remaining water is classified as rejected net infiltration and is diverted to surface water therefore the total runoff roff is the sum of the direct runoff and the rejected net infiltration in this study we use the same maximum infiltration rates used by westenbroek et al 2018 additionally three potential evapotranspiration pet estimation methods are available in the swb2 model we employed the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 which is considered a simplified version of the fao penman monteith method that is not included in the model the hargreaves samani method requires spatially distributed minimum and maximum daily temperatures which we obtained from daymet version 3 then swb2 estimates actual et aet as a function of pet net precipitation and the current soil moisture within each grid cell the model assumes that aet equals pet whenever net precipitation exceeds pet otherwise aet is equal to the amount of water that can be extracted from the soil via aet considering the computed values of soil moisture retention tables of thornthwaite and mather 1957 and modified by westenbroek et al 2010 the thornthwaite mather function requires estimates of the maximum soil moisture storage capacity which was determined using awc data from gssurgo multiplied by the rooting depth within each hydrologic soil type which was defined using westenbroek et al 2018 table s1 in supplementary material finally the swb2 model requires an initial amount of soil moisture to calculate potential soil saturation and net infiltration or evapotranspiration on day 1 which was determined using the reference value provided by westenbroek et al 2018 for the swb2 model in maui hawai i additionally we also ran the swb2 model for a one year warm up period prior to the analysis period to account for initial transients a detailed control file including all the parameters used to run the swb2 model for puerto rico is provided in supplementary material table s2 2 3 data periods two periods were selected for modeling a baseline period 1981 2010 and a recent decade 2010 2019 this data bifurcation created a climatology reference period baseline that is used to evaluate whether changes are occurring in the latter period to account for possible differences in lulc in puerto rico we ran the baseline climatology using lulc from 2001 and the recent decade with an updated lulc from 2010 with differences shown in fig 2 after defining the baseline climatology 1981 2010 and the recent decade 2010 2019 to run the swb2 model we identified four drought years 10 of the period of analysis based on the lowest annual average rainfall amounts in puerto rico 1994 1997 1991 and 2015 in descending order then we averaged swb2 outputs from these years to create drought years water budget annual maps this allowed us to compare the spatial distribution of net infiltration over puerto rico during the baseline climatology 1981 2010 with drought years to determine regions with greater water scarcity 2 4 model evaluation our goal was to test a model that requires no calibration which is dependent on input parameters that accurately represent field conditions and do not require modification we employ this strategy because many oceanic islands in tropical climates lack field data for model calibration developing field datasets in these settings is laborious expensive and requires long term commitments we know that multiple methods are used to assess water budget models based on the availability of data in this study we assessed the swb2 outputs in two ways 1 by comparing swb2 against the goes prweb mecikalski and harmsen 2019 harmsen et al 2021 which is an existing water budget model for puerto rico and 2 by comparing swb2 to observed watershed streamflow from us geological survey usgs stream gauges fig 3 compares swb2 with goes prweb model outputs for the decade of overlapping data i e 2009 2019 rainfall and runoff comparisons fig 3 a d both demonstrated a positive correlation between swb2 and goes prweb models of 0 6 and 0 5 respectively however only rainfall correlation was statistically significant p 0 10 while the relationship between runoff was not statistically significant from 2009 2014 the rainfall input from swb2 presented at least 30 more annual average rainfall than the goes prweb model although further investigation is needed to assess which rainfall input data is more accurate daymet version 3 used in swb2 or noaa s advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps used in goes prweb both models rainfall amounts from 2015 to 2019 are in good agreement which includes at least two extreme events the intense drought of 2015 and hurricanes irma and maria in 2017 the models correlation for aet was 0 5 which is statistically significant p 0 10 although swb2 seemed to overestimate aet when compared to goes prweb finally the correlation between the swb2 and goes prweb net infiltration was very strong 0 8 and statistically significant p 0 01 therefore considering that the models used different approaches to estimate the water budget as well as different input data sources the statistically significant correlation together with the similarities among models results of annual net infiltration suggest that they should both be considered suitable options for estimating net infiltration in puerto rico we also analyzed the swb2 model performance in comparison with observed streamflow data from the usgs the watersheds selection in puerto rico was based on their spatial distribution over the island and the availability of data that overlapped the most with our period of study 1981 2019 the following watersheds were included in this study from larger to smaller manati 330 7 km2 guanajibo 310 5 km2 cibuco 226 8 km2 fajardo 38 3 km2 and espiritu santo 22 5 km2 fig 4 from the swb2 model we used roff runoff rejected net infiltration and converted the model outputs to streamflow m3 s 1 to create the simulated data and compare it with the observation in the observation data we performed baseflow separation through the web based hydrograph analysis tool what system which used the eckhardt filter method and was tested to provide more consistent results than a manual separation of baseflow lim et al 2005 we selected the parameter perennial streams with hard rock aquifers for all watersheds analyzed because they are all located in the mountainous area of the island finally we compared the simulated versus observed direct runoff by running three model performance statistical tests commonly used in previous studies ang and oeurng 2018 kumar et al 2017 moriasi et al 2007 which are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and the percent bias pbias we perform the statistical tests separately for each period of analysis because we have used different lulc to run the swb2 the definition of each model performance test is summarized below with additional details available in moriasi et al 2007 nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line by a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured data variance information nse ranges from and 1 0 1 inclusive where 1 0 is the optimal value values between 0 0 and 1 0 are viewed as acceptable levels of performance rsr standardizes the rmse which is one of the commonly used error index statistics using the observations standard deviation rsr is calculated as the ratio of the rmse and standard deviation of measured data it varies from the optimal value of 0 which indicates zero residual variation and perfect model simulation to a large positive value therefore the lower the rsr the better the model simulation pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data the optimal value is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values mean model underestimation bias and negative values mean model overestimation bias the timeseries presented in figs s1 and s2 provide a comparison of the monthly average simulated versus observed direct runoff for puerto rico during the baseline climatology and recent decade respectively overall the model was consistent in predicting peak flows over time mainly in the larger area watersheds while it underestimated most of the low flows in the small watersheds located in the luquillo mountains such as fajardo and espiritu santo the model slightly underestimated the flow over time these poor predictions of lower flows are likely due to the lack of consideration of aquifer hydraulic behavior in the swb2 model fig 5 shows both scenarios together and reinforces that the model better simulated average and peak flows mainly for manati cibuco guanajibo but underestimated low flows while for fajardo and espiritu santo basins the model is overall underestimating the flow however the relationship between the simulated and observed data is very strong and statistically significant p 0 01 for all watersheds with a correlation coefficient 0 8 except for manati in the recent decade which presented a correlation coefficient of 0 7 moreover the model performance statistics for puerto rico for the baseline climatology table 3 indicated that the best simulation occurred in guanajibo with both nse 0 75 and rsr 0 50 rating as good model performance while its pbias indicates the model has a very good performance with an overestimation of only 2 9 of the flow cibuco came next with a similar model performance indicating a good rate for nse 0 71 and rsr 0 54 and very good for pbias 8 2 while the simulation of direct runoff for manati was satisfactory in all model performance statistics nse 0 52 rsr 0 69 pbias 23 5 for smaller basins swb2 was very close to satisfactory for fajardo s nse 0 45 and rsr 0 74 but it did not have a satisfactory performance for espiritu santo in the recent decade on the other hand the swb2 performed slightly better for fajardo and espiritu santo but slightly worse for manati cibuco and guanajibo in fact the fajardo simulation in the recent decade had a satisfactory nse 0 60 and rsr 0 63 with a pbias indicating the model underestimated only 34 of the flow table 3 for guanajibo and cibuco the model performed very similarly and kept a good nse and rsr and very good pbias while manati was slightly below the satisfactory performance overall espiritu santo was the watershed simulation with the worst performance when comparing all the statistical tests and periods which was expected as the smaller watershed analyzed here the slightly better performance of the model in the larger watersheds during the baseline climatology 1981 2010 than in the recent decade 2010 2019 may be related to the fact that the caribbean in general has been presenting a negative trend in drought index indicating more frequent and severe drought events herrera and ault 2017 herrera et al 2018 moraes et al 2022 because the model did not well reproduce low flows in puerto rico we hypothesize that the increase in the occurrence and intensity of drought events may have affected the overall model performance in the recent decade together with the fact that there is a lack of consideration of aquifer hydraulic behavior in the swb2 model therefore this limitation of the model should be taken into consideration when analyzing the results from the drought years particularly because they are linked to low flows on the other hand the observed improvement in swb2 performance during the recent decade in smaller watersheds located within the luquillo mountains could be related to the increase in data availability and equipment recently installed by the long term ecological research lter project within the tropical rainforest this along with newly available daily rainfall data from an updated version of global historical climate network thornton et al 2016 has probably improved model performance in fajardo and espiritu santo however we believe that the accuracy of the daymet rainfall data and its spatial resolution of 1 km may have a larger effect in smaller watersheds like espiritu santo when compared to the larger basins this basin contains fewer than 22 grid cells of rainfall data a coarse resolution for the accuracy and analysis of rainfall needed in the steeply slope terrain located in the luquillo mountains moreover the basins where the model performed better e g manati cibuco guanajibo fajardo all have a large portion of group c soils e g silty clay loam which is the most common soil type in puerto rico this may indicate that the swb2 model performs satisfactorily for most of the areas on the island although we recommend caution interpreting the results of the swb2 model mainly for areas located in the steep slope of the luquillo mountains where the model is mostly underestimating streamflow we believe the model has performed well in puerto rico without the need for calibration and it should be considered as an option for future studies interested in water budget modeling on this and other oceanic islands with tropical climates 3 results 3 1 baseline climatology versus recent decade annual net infiltration in puerto rico had a similar spatial distribution when comparing the baseline climatology 1981 2010 and the recent decade 2010 2019 figs 6 a and 7 a show that the estimated net infiltration was greater in the central west and northern portion of the island ranging from 600 to 900 mm yr 1 baseline to 700 1000 mm yr 1 recent decade the greatest net infiltration occurred in eastern puerto rico in lower elevations of the luquillo mountains el yunque national forest where it reached values greater than 1500 mm yr 1 during both periods of analysis when examining the other water budget elements we see that central and eastern puerto rico were areas with greater values of aet and runoff when compared to other areas within the island but they were also the areas with the greatest annual rainfall 2500 mm yr 1 therefore the abundant rainfall in those areas provided extra water available for net infiltration another characteristic of the areas with greater net infiltration in puerto rico is that they are in the heavily vegetated mountainous areas of the island i e cordillera central and luquillo mountains and have soil types b and c with greater infiltration rates fig 2 c southern puerto rico on the other side was where the lowest amount of net infiltration occurred in both periods that region is known for its dry climate and we can see that while the annual rainfall was 1000 mm yr 1 the annual aet was as high as in the rest of the island 750 mm yr 1 which contributed to its lower annual net infiltration 200 mm yr 1 while water budget components are geographically similar between periods there are some important differences in the amount of water distributed across the island which can be evaluated by taking the difference between the recent decade minus the baseline climatology fig 8 in central and western areas net infiltration was at least 250 mm yr 1 greater in the recent decade than in the baseline climatology while aet was similar and runoff increased in the recent decade 100 mm yr 1 the increased rainfall on most of the island could explain these differences with the central west region receiving at least 400 mm yr 1 more rainfall in the recent decade than during the baseline climatology yet the opposite occurred in the luquillo mountains where less rainfall was registered from 2010 to 2019 250 mm yr 1 along with less runoff 200 mm yr 1 and less aet 50 mm yr 1 consequently net infiltration decreased in eastern puerto rico in the recent decade 100 mm yr 1 in addition to the spatial distribution of rainfall the temporal distribution is also important the greatest rainfall occurred in the recent decade fig 9 with hurricanes irma and maria in 2017 and other large events in 2010 and 2011 three of the four years with the lowest rainfall totals i e 1991 1994 1997 occurred during the baseline period while only one 2015 occurred during the recent decade along with rainfall lulc changes may also affect net infiltration differences between the baseline climatology and the recent decade in fig 2 a b we see a reduction in the herbaceous category between 2001 and 2010 lulc with a concomitant increase in cultivated crops in the central area greater rainfall in central puerto rico and less herbaceous vegetation to intercept rainfall increases net infiltration on the other hand the conversion of herbaceous to developed land in eastern puerto rico together with decreased rainfall may have contributed to the decrease in net infiltration during the recent decade 3 2 drought years versus baseline climatology we selected four years in descending order 1994 1997 1991 2015 to represent drought conditions see methods section fig 10 shows the annual spatial distribution of the water budget components during those drought years and indicated a much smaller area as well as lower values of net infiltration when compared to the baseline climatology during drought years puerto rico had only small areas of net infiltration still occurring in the central west of the island with values between 300 and 500 mm yr 1 and in the lower elevations of luquillo mountains el yunque national forest 800 mm yr 1 most of the island however has minimal net infiltration 200 mm yr 1 most of southern puerto rico receives less than 700 mm yr 1 of rainfall while a similar amount of water was lost through aet fig 10 b c which resulted in little water for net infiltration 100 mm yr 1 the northern area of puerto rico also suffered from lower precipitation and higher aet resulting in infiltration concentrated in a small area puerto rico had a reduction in net infiltration of at least 150 mm yr 1 during drought years except for some rock outcrops located in the north of the island which showed no difference fig 11 however the areas most affected by drought were parts of central and northern puerto rico as well as the luquillo mountains where the reduction in net infiltration was more than 400 mm yr 1 below the baseline period central and eastern puerto rico were areas where the greatest departure in precipitation occurred 700 mm yr 1 together with a reduction in runoff 400 mm yr 1 although aet mostly decreased over the island during drought years central west and eastern puerto rico registered similar amounts of aet when compared to the baseline climatology together with large reductions in rainfall higher aet could also explain why central west and eastern puerto rico had the greatest difference in net infiltration during drought years the difference in net infiltration in southern puerto rico was smaller than the rest of the island 100 mm yr 1 when comparing drought years and the baseline climatology 4 discussion 4 1 baseline climatology versus recent decade the role of physical geography e g topography vegetation climate on the water cycle is evident when comparing the drier south with the wetter east and central puerto rico figs 6 and 7 southern puerto rico is known as a drier region lower humidity and precipitation higher pet and is classified as a dry forest holdridge 1967 the lower humidity is related to its geographic location on the leeward side of the central mountain range i e cordillera central which creates a shield blocking the atlantic moisture and making the south drier than other regions of puerto rico torres valcárcel et al 2014 moreover recent studies confirmed the dryness of this region by showing that the potential evapotranspiration is greater than rainfall from 2009 to 2018 indicating a greater water demand than water supply and resulting in dry soils and low groundwater recharge in southern puerto rico harmsen 2019 the presence of group d soils with lower infiltration rates fig 2 c could also contributed to lower net infiltration rates in the south orographic uplift of northeasterly winds from the atlantic ocean along the cordillera central and luquillo mountains results in greater rainfall that makes these regions wetter than the rest of the island hosannah et al 2019 sobel et al 2011 additionally these mountains are covered by evergreen tropical vegetation with the luquillo mountains being the location of the el yunque national forest the presence of forests can affect the water cycle through their high absorption of solar radiation due to low albedo resulting in energy available for evapotranspiration of water cloud formation and possible local showers scheffer et al 2005 in eastern puerto rico the decrease in rainfall in the recent decade may be influenced by the saharan air layer sal intrusion in the island in 2015 for example the caribbean registered the highest dust concentration from 1980 to 2016 while an increasing trend in dust mass concentration has been reported since 1991 hosannah et al 2019 it is known that sal peaks from late june to mid august and can propagate westward across the atlantic ocean bringing anomalously hot dry air in the low to the middle troposphere around 700 hpa producing thermodynamically stable conditions and limiting rainfall in the insular caribbean in general and in puerto rico in particular kuciauskas et al 2018 mote et al 2017 therefore with the increase in dust concentration in the recent decade the orographic effect that plays an important role in keeping eastern puerto rico wetter than most of the island may have been suppressed however local factors may have played an additional role in precipitation variability with the observed rainfall increase in central west puerto rico during the recent decade being related to local island processes such as surface heating orographic uplift and sea breeze trade wind convergence that can overcome drought and sal episodes hosannah et al 2019 these local variations in precipitation over puerto rico were well represented during the 2015 drought event when the east was severely affected by drought miller and ramseyer 2020 mote et al 2017 while the western side had sites registering positive precipitation anomalies hosannah et al 2019 4 2 drought years versus baseline climatology overall the island had much less net infiltration during drought years with areas in the south close to 0 mm yr 1 when analyzing the relationship between rainfall runoff and aet fig 10 over the island during the drought years it is also possible to see that at least two thirds of the rainfall was lost as aet and the remaining third was divided between runoff and net infiltration past studies suggested that high aet is one of the primary reasons for the lack of surface water availability the vulnerability to drought and changes in groundwater recharge on small tropical islands gamble 2004 holding et al 2016 a recent study analyzing historical meteorological drought in puerto rico from 1950 to 2019 indicated a high frequency of monthly extreme drought conditions in the northeast of the island sorí et al 2021 this is the region where we found the decrease in net infiltration to be greater than 400 mm yr 1 below the baseline period during drought years we know that for drought years such as 1994 and 2015 one of the reasons for the greater reduction in rainfall in eastern puerto rico was the intrusion of the sal as previously discussed the inhibition of rainfall produced by sal was likely more intense over the mountainous regions of puerto rico due to the stable thermodynamic conditions that suppressed the orographic uplift resulting in less local rainfall miller and ramseyer 2020 mote et al 2017 additionally the drought events of 1994 and 2015 were also related to the positive phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao that occurred during the winter preceding the sal intrusion and the drought event mote et al 2017 this contributed to a stronger north atlantic subtropical high nahp and stronger trader winds over tropical north atlantic which could have helped to bring more dust from sal events toward puerto rico the greater intensity of the 1994 and 2015 droughts in puerto rico was registered in other studies álvarez berríos et al 2018 mote et al 2017 and the water budget presented here fig 9 suggested they also share a water deficit occurring in the prior year this indicates that an imbalance in water before a year with low rainfall are ingredients that may result in intense droughts although recent work indicated that intense drought events are becoming more common on the east side of the island and its rainforest in the luquillo mountains álvarez berríos et al 2018 mote et al 2017 a recent study suggested that forested areas are more resilient than deforested areas when drought events occur hall et al 2022 the authors demonstrated that forest cover increases water storage and hillslope infiltration that may reduce drought impacts on streamflow in puerto rico highlighting maintenance of forest cover as an important water management strategy to increase infiltration hall et al 2022 it is also important to highlight the potential effects of drought on aquifers the area in northern puerto rico where net infiltration reduction occurred is situated above the north coast limestone aquifer fig 2 b which indicates a substantial reduction in groundwater recharge during drought events the north coast limestone aquifer is considered the most extensive and productive freshwater aquifer on the island with its groundwater serving as an important source for local ecosystems and public water supply lugo et al 2001 maihemuti et al 2015 padilla et al 2011 therefore the reduced rainfall in north and central puerto rico during drought years fig 11 b may directly affect the recharge of the north coast aquifer because parts of this aquifer are almost exclusively recharged by direct rainfall while other areas are recharged both by direct rainfall and the streams from cordillera central on the volcanic rocks that infiltrate underground when they cross onto the karst areas mendez tejeda et al 2016 differences in net infiltration in southern puerto rico where the south coast aquifer is located were smaller than on the rest of the island 100 mm yr 1 during drought years when compared to the baseline climatology this aquifer is also recharged by direct rainfall and streams flowing out of the cordillera central mendez tejeda et al 2016 therefore the impacts of drought in the south coast aquifer recharge may come not only from the reduction in local rainfall and net infiltration but also from the decreased rainfall felt in central puerto rico which affected the mountainous river s streamflow southeastern puerto rico was classified as the area of the island most exposed to any classification of drought from 2000 to 2016 álvarez berríos et al 2018 while some studies indicated that the south coast aquifer has already been suffering from lower recharge and higher groundwater demand in the recent decade harmsen 2019 torres gonzalez and rodriguez 2016 moreover the south coast aquifer s groundwater was the principal source of potable water for cities along the southern coast of puerto rico and the primary source of water for agricultural irrigation torres gonzalez and rodriguez 2016 therefore the lack of net infiltration and groundwater recharge during drought events when surface water is limited creates severe water stress while one solution would be to develop energy intensive desalination plants as an alternative water supply this creates additional problems as desalinization is based on the use of fossil fuels increased use of desalinization would increase air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gasses in the island mendez tejeda et al 2016 5 conclusions this study analyzed how the physical geography of puerto rico affects the island s water budget during a baseline climatology 1981 2010 a recent decade 2010 2019 and drought years 1991 1994 1997 and 2015 results indicated that central west north and eastern puerto rico had greater net infiltration than the south during baseline climatology and the recent decade the greatest net infiltration occurred in mountainous and highly vegetated areas of the island such as the cordillera central and the luquillo mountains highlighting the important role of topography in creating orographic rainfall and vegetation as a source of moisture the presence of group b and c soils with higher infiltration rates may have also contributed to the greater amount of net infiltration in those areas however rainfall variability in the recent decade has affected the net infiltration with the central west and northern puerto rico receiving more rainfall followed by greater net infiltration and the east registering a decrease in both variables which could be a consequence of large scale atmospheric circulation mechanisms meanwhile southern puerto rico experienced lower net infiltration during both analysis periods the location of the south on the leeward side of the cordillera central together with the presence of more group d soils with lower infiltration rates and greater areas of cultivated crops than natural vegetation may have all combined to cause lower net infiltration there during drought years the entire island reduced its net infiltration as a consequence of reduced rainfall with the worst scenarios occurring in the central west and eastern puerto rico potentially affecting tropical forests and their soil moisture as well as in parts of the north where the productive north coast aquifer is located while reductions in net infiltration during drought events were less dramatic in southern puerto rico than in other areas of the island these reductions aggravated the persistent water stress by reducing recharge in the south coast aquifer which already suffers from low recharge and high groundwater demand these findings are the first that we know of to highlight the role of physical geography on puerto rico s water budget and net infiltration while comparing the baseline climatology the recent decade and drought years thus we expect they will be useful to help the local government in planning for water management and drought events moreover we showed that swb2 a newly released open source water budget model provides a useful platform for incorporating the physical geography of a tropical oceanic island in water planning and management even without calibration the model performed satisfactorily and very well in some cases in matching observed streamflow from watersheds across puerto rico this suggests that the model is suitable for use on other oceanic islands in tropical settings where data suitable for model calibration are lacking finally the authors note the limitations of the swb2 model mainly in reproducing low flows therefore we suggest that future work should test the swb2 model performance in puerto rico using different model parameters we have used here and even testing different datasets as well as adding input data we did not find by the time of this research such as fog interception or irrigation the application of the swb2 model in other caribbean islands would also be interesting and allow for the comparison of swb2 performance in different areas of the caribbean funding this work was supported by the nsf

7651,study region we define two northern study areas one covering all of canada and alaska and a second smaller subregion surrounding the peace athabasca delta for testing study focus this study aims to use bias correction to improve satellite precipitation data over a relatively data sparse high latitude region using a network of in situ rain gauges we evaluate the satellite data and derive a linear bias elevation relationship and apply the correction with a digital elevation model at a monthly scale and further disaggregate it to produce corrected data at a daily scale new hydrological insights for the region we find that the underestimation in the satellite data increases linearly with increasing elevation above 500 m a s l at the continental scale and for all elevations at the regional scale bias also varies seasonally with higher bias in summer and lower bias in winter compared with uncalibrated data the monthly continental correction reduces absolute bias by 16 and the root mean squared error by 6 while the daily continental correction improves absolute bias by 17 but degrades root mean squared error slightly by 2 we conclude that applying elevation based bias correction reduces systematic elevational bias in northern high latitude satellite precipitation data graphical abstract ga1 keywords imerg satellite precipitation bias correction high latitude rain

introduction precipitation is a critical part of the global water cycle and quality precipitation measurements with high temporal resolution are vital to applications such as hydrological modeling including flood and drought monitoring and prediction however because precipitation is highly variable over time high temporal resolution measurement of precipitation is complicated common approaches to quantifying precipitation include in situ rain gauges ground based radar and satellite based retrievals while rain gauges provide temporally continuous relatively accurate measurements they are limited to point measurements ground based radars provide greater spatial coverage but estimate precipitation indirectly and are still limited to a prescribed radius around the instrument and line of sight visibility young et al 1999 both are commonly located near population centers leaving remote areas and high latitudes severely under sampled satellite precipitation products spps offer global or near global coverage but suffer from known biases and missing data related to topography season precipitation intensity and satellite orbit maggioni et al 2016 high spatial and temporal coverage make spps particularly valuable in remote and mountainous regions with low rain gauge density boluwade et al 2017 spps generally incorporate precipitation retrievals from satellite based passive microwave pmw infrared ir and or radar sensors examples of spps include the climate prediction center cpc morphing method cmorph joyce et al 2004 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap aonashi et al 2009 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2014 and most recently the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 used here prior to imerg spps have been limited geographically to lower latitudes imerg s predecessor tmpa for example is limited to 50ºn 50ºs where pmw sensor coverage is available from its network of three satellites huffman et al 2019 imerg is the first spp to offer coverage poleward of 60º n s for which it uses retrievals from a larger network of pmw and ir sensors however its gauge calibrated product lacks consistent coverage at these high latitudes spps tend to characterize long term e g monthly to yearly precipitation conditions well but struggle to capture short term e g sub hourly to daily variability accurately at shorter time scales spps often correlate poorly with rain gauge measurements chokngamwong and chiu 2008 ebrahimi et al 2017 fenta et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 spp accuracy and bias also vary with temperature and season asong et al 2017 hosseini moghari and tang 2022 kim et al 2017 watters 2021 finally elevation and topographic relief can have a confounding effect on spps because orographic effects on precipitation are not well parameterized maggioni et al 2016 previous studies consistently find that spp performance worsens with higher elevations in a variety of environments choubin et al 2019 fenta et al 2018 hashemi et al 2017 kim et al 2017 lu et al 2020 retalis et al 2020 saber and yilmaz 2018 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 and that spp performance varied with aspect for a mountainous region where the windward side received more precipitation derin and yilmaz 2014 relief a measure of the variability of elevation within a predefined window has more recently been considered and high relief found to be correlated with higher errors in spp data pirmoradian et al 2022 bias correction of spps can improve their accuracy and utility in modeling applications where precipitation data is needed hinge et al 2022 setti et al 2020 wang et al 2020 bias corrections are done in a variety of ways including statistical distribution based quantile mapping chaudhary and dhanya 2019 gowan and horel 2020 jaiswal et al 2021 linear scaling based on precipitation intensity moravej 2020 vernimmen et al 2012 ziarh et al 2021 and spatial interpolation of bias at rain gauges arshad et al 2021 condom et al 2011 kumar et al 2021 another approach that is frequently used is calculating a simple linear scaling factor for subsets of the data such as each month of the year saber and yilmaz 2018 jaiswal et al 2021 chaudhary and dhanya 2019 or elevation bins yeh et al 2020 this approach offers the advantages of being straightforward to implement compared to other methods mentioned above while allowing for seasonal or elevational variations in bias hashemi et al 2017 similarly allow for seasonal variations in bias while also accounting for elevation dependency in bias with linear regression further hashemi et al 2020 leverages higher resolution elevation data to produce a bias corrected precipitation dataset at higher spatial resolution than the original spp bias correction studies for high latitudes are limited in part due to limitations in the spatial coverage of spps a literature search identified two studies focusing on bias correcting imerg data at latitudes above 60º gowan and horel 2020 evaluate and correct imerg early run data using a quantile mapping approach while moravej 2020 calculates a monthly precipitation intensity based correction for daily imerg final run data previous studies have evaluated imerg data in canada with a focus on seasonal and regional differences asong et al 2017 moazami and najafi 2021 but neither investigated topography as a source of bias and are more limited in their temporal domain than our study our aim is to produce an improved high coverage daily satellite precipitation dataset for canada and alaska for hydrologic applications the introduction section presented an overview of commonly used precipitation datasets data biases and shortfalls of available data one such shortfall is a lack of accurate monthly and daily satellite precipitation data in the high latitudes of canada and alaska our study is the first to perform an elevation based evaluation and bias correction on imerg s final run data in canada and alaska at daily and monthly scales for the full 20 years of imerg data availability new with imerg version 06 our methodology involves evaluating the accuracy of two imerg precal and hq satellite precipitation estimates over canada and alaska using in situ rain gauges monthly relationships between elevation and bias are derived and applied using a digital elevation model dem to create a final bias corrected dataset canak our results demonstrate the differences between our new canak data and the official precal and hq data by evaluating the data against gauge data using continuous and categorical metrics finally we discuss the study s broader implications such as the importance of high accuracy data over high density lake areas and some recommendations for future work 2 methods 2 1 study areas we define two northern study areas a primary study region including all of canada and alaska and a secondary subregion for testing centered on the peace athabasca delta pad and adjacent canadian shield fig 1 results focused on the primary study region are found in the main text while

varies between about 0 8 1 6 mm day menne et al 2012 june july and august make up the wettest months while december january and february are driest fig 1c the pad a unesco world heritage site is one of the largest inland boreal deltas on the planet and provides important habitat for birds and bison timoney 2013 the delta relies on hydrological recharge from precipitation in addition to groundwater and inflow from the peace and athabasca rivers pavelsky and smith 2008 periodic ice jam flooding is also an important process affecting the delta s hydrology and is associated with total winter precipitation beltaos et al 2006 the hydrological and ecological significance of the region motivates our initial use of the pad and surrounding areas as a testing region before applying our methodology to the larger canada alaska domain 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite precipitation product the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg satellite precipitation product is one of the most advanced spps available currently with a spatial resolution of 0 1º and temporal resolution of 30 min and near global coverage huffman et al 2019 the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is a joint venture of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa with the gpm core satellite launched in 2014 imerg incorporates visible ir and passive microwave retrievals from a constellation of satellites as well as the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr sensor onboard gpm to produce worldwide precipitation estimates in version 6 the most recent update of the imerg algorithm the algorithm was also retrospectively applied to trmm retrievals from june 2000 until the gpm era huffman et al 2019 precipitation estimate outputs are based on 1 pmw only retrievals hqprecipitation hq 2 ir only retrievals irprecipitation 3 the integrated product with pmw and ir retrievals precipitationuncal and 4 the integrated product calibrated against a precipitation gauge network precipitationcal precal for this study we use the pmw only variable hq daily 3b day ms mrg 3imerg from imerg though precal monthly 3b mo ms mrg 3imerg and daily 3b day ms mrg 3imerg calibrated precipitation is generally considered to be the most accurate product it provides only partial coverage north of 60ºn providing limited and inconsistent observations at the daily scale huffman et al 2019 see fig 2 while our use of the uncalibrated dataset will produce lower accuracy measurements compared with the calibrated dataset see moazami and najafi 2021 tan et al 2016 we prioritize spatial coverage in our bias corrected dataset and seek to demonstrate that reasonable tradeoffs can be made in accuracy for higher coverage in our high latitude area imerg data are available for three processing levels that correspond to data quality and latency these include the 1 early run available after 4 h and designed for short term uses like flood forecasting 2 late run available within 14 h that incorporates any delayed retrievals and 3 the research quality final run available two to three months later in which the precal variable is calibrated to monthly rain gauge data imerg uses the global precipitation climatology center gpcc gridded dataset based on station data from ghcn for the calibration of precal so this should be noted when considering our evaluation of imerg precal schneider et al 2014 for the purpose of our study we use the non gridded point based ghcn station data to analyze the uncalibrated hq variable menne et al 2012 a full list of available products and variables can be found in huffman et al 2019 for this study the final run daily data were downloaded from goddard earth sciences data and information center ges disc and subset to the study area which extends from 41º 72ºn for the period june 1 2000 to december 31 2020 for reference a map of daily average precipitation for this period can be found in fig s1 within the pad subarea imerg pixels over some lakes in both hq and precal data were found to have consistently anomalously high values likely due to an issue with the algorithm over inland water bodies see also tang et al 2016 tian and peters lidard 2007 these anomalous pixels and all inland water pixels for the larger area were removed from analysis due to observed data unreliability the reference mask used to remove water can be found in fig s2 2 2 2 ground based precipitation observations the national centers for environmental information maintains the global historical climatology network ghcn a quality controlled global dataset of daily weather station observations menne et al 2012 the ghcn dataset includes daily precipitation measurements with variable temporal domains from over 100 000 stations worldwide and is here used to obtain precipitation ground truth data for our study area subsetting the global stations to canada and alaska yielded a total of 9984 ghcn stations with daily data between june 1 2000 and december 31 2020 stations with identical coordinates were combined such that for days when multiple stations reported measurements at the same location the value was taken from the entry with the longest total record within the study period as per lawrimore et al 2011 the total number of unique stations remaining after this process was 4011 in canada and alaska and 214 in the smaller pad subarea stations in the larger domain had an average of 13 4 years 65 coverage and those in the smaller domain had an average of 7 years of data 34 coverage over the 20 5 years of the study temporal domain 2 2 3 digital elevation model the multi error removed improved terrain merit digital elevation model dem yamazaki et al 2017 was used to investigate the effects of elevation and topographical relief on errors and bias in the imerg data the merit dem was also used to estimate the elevations of ghcn stations surface and imerg pixel elevations the merit dem was downloaded from the yamazaki lab research website http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit dem and has a native resolution of 90 m yamazaki et al 2017 the dataset was aggregated to 300 m pixels to reduce processing times while maintaining a high resolution relative to the 10 km resolution imerg precipitation data 2 3 methods 2 3 1 clustering using hierarchical clustering ghcn stations were clustered spatially and by precipitation quantiles to create groups of geographically and climatically similar stations facilitating the comparison between the station measurements and gridded imerg data first geographic latitude longitude elevation and climatic 50th and 75th percentiles of precipitation values variables for each station were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 standardization adjusts for the effect of the scale of the variables on the clustering analysis the standardized variables representing latitude and longitude were multiplied by two to increase their relative weight de sarbo et al 1984 we do this to prioritize geographic proximity over other variables and to encourage contiguous clusters as fouedijo 2016 shows that adding geographical coordinates as clustering variables is not sufficient to provide contiguity the agglomerative nesting hierarchical clustering method from the agnes r package was run on the five geographic and climatic factors as described in kaufman and rosseeuw 1990 silhouette scores a measure of distance between and within clusters were used to select an optimal number of clusters for the smaller subarea shahapure and nicholas 2020 the number of clusters for the larger canada alaska domain was chosen such that the average number of stations per cluster was consistent across the domain the stations in each cluster were aggregated into cohesive spatial units made using an iterative buffering reducing process as follows first circular buffers of 100 km were created around each individual station within a cluster and then dissolved enclosing all stations within a single cluster perimeter polygon next the cluster polygon was inwardly buffered or reduced by 90 km to create a polygon closely fitted to all stations in that cluster the clustered concave hull polygons were then used to extract the average value of the imerg data within the buffered hull and the cluster averaged imerg data were evaluated against the average station values within each cluster 2 3 2 evaluation biases and errors for hq and precal were assessed by season elevation and topographic relief table 1 daily imerg hq and clustered ghcn data were aggregated to a monthly scale such that months with fewer than 25 coverage were considered to have insufficient data the continuous evaluation metrics used which measure the satellite s error relative to in situ data were absolute bias relative bias pearson s correlation coefficient root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae metrics were calculated for each cluster for the entire data record and for month climatologies according to the equations in table 1 categorical metrics which measure the skill of the satellite data in identifying rain events were applied using a threshold of 0 5 mm precipitation day to define rainy vs non rainy days as in asong et al 2017 the metrics used were probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far frequency bias index fbi critical success index csi and heidke skill score hss as defined in the equations below elevational and relief based biases were examined through bias elevation scatterplots and through a comparison of clusters below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of average cluster elevation seasonal biases were examined by comparing average bias for boreal spring march april may mam summer june july august jja fall september october november son and winter december january february djf after the bias correction all metrics were calculated for hq the corrected canak and precal and used to evaluate canak s performance compared to the original hq data and compared to precal seasonal error in hq canak and precal is also considered by calculating the average rmse for each month of the year 2 3 3 linear regression bias correction in this study a linear regression between bias and elevation of the clusters was calculated for each month of the year then applied to the original gridded imerg data for the full study area a flowchart summarizing the methodology described is provided in fig 3 the mean bias for each station cluster for each of the twelve months was plotted against the mean elevation for each station cluster a climatologically based linear model was fit to the monthly data using a simple linear regression algorithm the results of which can be found in the supplement table s1 the slope and intercept of the regression lines were used to calculate a monthly additive correction for the whole scene using the merit dem resampled to match imerg pixels for dem cell values falling outside the domain of average elevation of the clusters the correction corresponding to the nearest end of the domain was used i e the same magnitude of correction was applied to every pixel above 2926 m the highest average cluster elevation the monthly correction was disaggregated into a daily correction using the proportion of total precipitation in the month that fell on a particular day according to the original data based on a methodology established by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 and fan et al 2019 the daily correction was then applied to the original daily imerg data to create the final bias corrected daily product the monthly and daily corrections were applied first for the pad testing subarea and then for the canada alaska domain for the pad we added additional rainy pixels based on the proportion of days that report rain for a 13 day moving window centered on each day of the year this enhanced daily data was used to disaggregate the monthly correction in the same manner as described above because the pad subarea is used as an algorithm testing site the results for the regional pad correction can be found in the supplement while the remainder of the text will focus on reporting the results of the bias correction at the continental scale finally we compare the uncorrected hq precipitation data our corrected canak data and imerg s calibrated precal data using the metrics described in section 2 3 2 for all clusters for clusters at high elevation those affected by our bias correction with mean ghcn station elevation 500 m and for clusters at high latitudes those with mean ghcn station latitude 60º we also compare rmse for hq canak and precal for each of the two decades included in our study s temporal domain 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 and for boreal winter djf and summer jja temporal coverage for the study area was also calculated for hq and precal as part of the evaluation for each variable the proportion of days across the entire time span that had a precipitation estimate available was calculated canak was created using the hq data so it will have the same coverage as the hq data though we limit the correction to land areas only masking out pixels over lakes and the ocean 3 results 3 1 clustering clustering the ghcn stations improved correlations between ground and satellite data as compared to direct point to pixel analysis and helped to lessen the spatial bias in station location fig 4 in the canada alaska domain 750 station clusters were created with 1 33 stations in each cluster the mean number of stations per cluster was uniform between the canada alaska and pad study areas 5 35 stations per cluster the elevation range changed from 0 2926 m among individual stations to 2 2186 m among clusters temporal coverage increased from about 8 years to 13 4 years among clusters out of the total 20 5 years of the study domain however the clusters retained much of the broad scale location bias of the stations concentrated in areas that were typically located in the south with sparse coverage in the more remote central and northern canada and alaska some clusters highlighted a high level of disagreement between the elevation reported in the ghcn dataset and the merit dem averaged over the buffered hull see fig 4b for example one cluster consisted of a single ghcn station that was located in a valley between two ridges resulting in imerg data being extracted over an area with a higher elevation than the station s location because we are interested in bias related to elevation we only used clusters where the difference between the gauge and imerg averaged merit dem elevations was less than 200 m highlighted in blue in fig 4b 3 2 evaluation substantial negative bias underestimation in the hq data was observed with bias magnitude increasing with elevation fig 5 biases reported here are for the monthly data because these are used to calculate the bias correction the difference between mean bias in the monthly and daily data is subtle within the canada alaska domain the mean absolute bias for all clusters was 2 51 mm day the correlation between absolute bias and elevation is not identifiable below 500 m elevation of the station clusters examined in this study only 23 of clusters are above 500 m and are able to be corrected bias for clusters in the overall lowest 10th percentile of elevation was 4 80 mm day and in the 90th percentile of elevation was 1 57 mm day when considering the full elevation range of clusters fig s3 above 500 m elevation bias for clusters in the lowest 10th percentile of elevation 538 m was 1 43 mm day and in the 90th percentile of elevation 1128 m was 2 01 mm day while elevation is the dominant contributor to topographically driven biases a bias dependence on relief was also found bias for clusters in the lowest 10th percentile of relief 1 1 m was 3 00 mm day while bias in the highest 90th percentile of relief 30 5 m was 4 77 mm day finally seasonal bias was examined among all clusters bias was highest in son the wettest season 2 58 mm day and lowest in mam the driest season 2 12 mm day bias for djf and jja were 2 27 mm day and 2 30 mm day respectively above 500 m elevation the difference in bias was greatest between djf 0 99 mm day and jja 1 80 mm day bias in the precal data is smaller in magnitude than in the hq data shows overestimation rather than underestimation and no correlation with elevation is observed fig s4 mean bias for precal across all clusters was 0 99 mm day there is a difference between bias for clusters in the lowest 10th percentile of elevation 3 20 mm day and highest 90th percentile of elevation 0 30 mm day but this difference reflects a wider spread of mean biases for low elevation clusters than high elevations rather than a clear bias elevation dependence considering only clusters above 500 m elevation as above the lowest 10th percentile had a mean bias of 0 24 mm day and the highest 90th percentile had a mean bias of 0 59 mm day there was a stronger difference between bias for high relief and low relief clusters for precal than for hq the lowest 10th percentile of relief had a mean bias of 1 26 mm day while the highest 90th percentile had a mean bias of 3 24 mm day elevation and relief percentiles are the same as those specified above as in the hq data the highest bias was seen in son the wettest season 1 20 mm day and lowest in mam the driest season 0 64 mm day while bias for djf and jja were 0 68 mm day and 0 86 mm day respectively 3 3 bias correction our regression based bias correction improved the monthly precipitation data as compared to the original hq data fig 6 fig 7 results for the monthly correction for the smaller pad subregion can be found in the supplement in fig 6 it is shown that most metrics improved with the correction absolute bias relative bias rmse mae pod fbi and csi while a few worsened correlation coefficient far and hss on average the absolute bias was reduced by 16 0 relative bias by 34 7 rmse by 5 5 and mae by 6 1 pod increased by 26 2 fbi by 34 3 and csi by 19 6 however correlation coefficient decreased by 0 9 far increased by 94 5 and hss decreased by 25 7 fig 7 includes two arbitrarily chosen months august 2000 fig 7a and december 2010 fig 7b to show the impact of the correction for different seasons due to the limitation of only correcting elevations above 500 m the differences in the uncorrected and corrected data in fig 7 are seen along and to the west of the rocky mountains as well as higher elevation areas of southeastern canada at the northern end of the appalachian mountains our regression based correction also improved the daily precipitation data as compared to the original hq data fig 8 fig 9 results for the daily correction for the smaller pad subregion can be found in the supplement at the continental scale the correction improved the absolute bias relative bias pod fbi csi and hss while far was worsened and correlation coefficient rmse and mae were relatively unchanged fig 8 on average absolute bias was reduced by 17 0 and relative bias by 28 5 pod increased by 15 9 fbi by 24 9 csi by 8 6 and hss by 3 4 however far increased by 17 rmse increased by 2 2 mae increased by 3 4 and correlation coefficient increased by 0 1 fig 9 shows examples of the pre correction hq and corrected canak precipitation values on two arbitrarily chosen days the correction is non stationary and affects the days differently as can be seen in the disparity in the difference between subplots a and b and c and d while canak improves upon hq precal outperforms both at the monthly and daily scale across all clusters in most metrics fig 6 fig 8 at the monthly scale precal shows better results than hq and canak for all metrics except for far fig 6 while at the daily scale precal shows better results for all metrics except for rmse mae and far fig 8 absolute bias relative bias correlation coefficient pod fbi csi and hss are all substantially or slightly better for daily precal than for daily hq and canak though canak generally outperforms hq mean rmse and mae are slightly higher for precal than for both hq or canak and far is significantly higher worse for precal when rmse is separated by winter djf and summer jja hq canak and precal all show a slightly higher mean rmse for jja than djf but a smaller upper extreme fig 10a rmse for the two decades also show a consistent pattern across hq canak and precal with lower rmse for 2000 2010 and higher rmse for 2010 2020 fig 10b rmse for precal is lower than for hq and canak as in fig 8 at high latitudes 60º n and high elevations 500 m canak shows a great improvement upon hq and nearly matches precal s performance fig 11 fig 12 at high latitudes 60º n canak sees a more marked decrease in bias compared to hq than at all latitudes fig 11 it should be also noted that due to poorer coverage of daily precal data at high latitudes the observations with which the metrics are calculated are much fewer for precal than for hq and canak that is precal has lower errors when data is available but data is available inconsistently and irregularly less than every four days on average finally at high elevations 500 m where the correction was applied canak nearly matches precal s performance in terms of bias and improves upon hq substantially for most other metrics though the correction worsens rmse mae and far compared to hq fig 12 overall canak bias corrected daily satellite precipitation data provides daily continuous precipitation data with similar errors to the calibrated precal product temporal coverage differs greatly between hq and precal with hq offering near 100 coverage over all areas and precal dropping substantially above 60º n fig 2 at the monthly scale precal shows good coverage over the land surface however at the daily scale precal s coverage above 60º n is 23 6 while hq s average coverage is 99 9 4 discussion this study finds a strongly negative bias underestimation of precipitation in canadian and alaskan imerg hq data that is associated with elevation this pattern is evident above 500 m a s l for the continental canada alaska scale fig 5 this finding is consistent with other studies that report similar negative elevation associated biases in satellite precipitation data over the conterminous u s hashemi et al 2017 japan takido et al 2016 and india kumar et al 2021 for example we also find that bias varies by season consistent with previous findings for imerg data in the u s hashemi et al 2017 seasonal rmse findings that show a higher mean rmse in jja but a smaller standard deviation fig 10b are also consistent with previous findings for imerg data in canada moazami and najafi 2021 however while pirmoradian et al 2022 find better performance for imerg after 2010 over the conterminous u s we find an increase in rmse in 2010 2020 as opposed to 2000 2010 fig 10a at the continental scale we find additional biases unassociated with elevation especially below 500 m a s l these include numerous ghcn station clusters with large biases along the pacific coast atlantic coast and southern ontario fig 4 this finding corroborates asong et al 2017 and moazami and najafi 2021 who report lower accuracies along coastal regions of canada as opposed to the central prairie region in the u s drier regions were also found to perform better than wet regions hosseini moghari and tang 2022 additionally some areas of high relief e g coastal british columbia have large 500 m mismatches between reported ghcn station elevations and our spatially averaged merit dem values surrounding them nevertheless above 500 m we find a strong negative bias with a negative linear trend hashemi et al 2017 2020 for example report a similar negative bias with a negative linear trend above 1500 m a s l in the continental u s as in the referenced studies we conclude here that such orographically induced biases can be mitigated using simple regression based techniques and a dem our regression based corrections effectively reduced elevation driven precipitation biases in monthly and daily imerg hq data absolute and relative biases were reduced for both time scales following our corrections and more evident for clusters at high elevation and high latitude than when considering all clusters both monthly and daily corrections increase the number of precipitation pixels in the imerg product decreasing pod while also necessarily increasing far figs 6 8 11 12 while our corrections improve upon hq precal outperforms both hq and canak consistent with other studies which found worse performance for hq compared to precal in canada moazami and najafi 2021 and southern coastal china sui et al 2020 for example however these results are heavily influenced by clusters at low elevations that our method is unable to correct for high elevation clusters where the correction is applied canak performs similarly to precal fig 12 at high latitude clusters precal still moderately outperforms canak but due to the low coverage of precal at high latitudes the metrics are based on fewer observations fig 11 the coverage of hq and therefore canak greatly improves upon the coverage of precal fig 2 limitations of the presented approach include a sparse uneven spatial distribution of ghcn stations available rain gauges are heavily skewed towards populated areas with most located in alberta and southern ontario quebec and manitoba fig 1 by contrast vast areas of northern canada and alaska have few or scattered rain gauges available to reduce the influence of the uneven spatial distribution of the ghcn stations in space and time we aggregate neighboring stations with similar precipitation signatures to assess and correct biases in the imerg hqprecipitation data we use all available ghcn stations in the cluster aggregation and compare the corrected imerg data with the same ghcn clusters we use the entire collection of ghcn stations to ensure accuracy over the period of record and do not separate training and validation data as would be done in examinations seeking to develop models that are transferable in space and time in addition to orographic effects other negative bias es found in canadian and alaskan imerg data may be due to decreased accuracy of the hq variable especially over snowy surfaces huffman et al 2019 poorer performance of the imerg algorithm at higher latitudes mahmoud et al 2021 regional climatological differences in canada and alaska particularly in precipitation amount asong et al 2017 gowan and horel 2020 moazami and najafi 2021 and bias associated with precipitation intensity bogerd et al 2021 fenta et al 2018 moravej 2020 tian et al 2018 further study is needed to identify and correct other imerg hq non elevation biases such as those related to precipitation intensity and other aspects of topography lastly there are known errors associated with in situ rain gauge measurements such as under catch due to wind which are here treated as ground truths use of an additional ground based observation reference dataset such as the gridded canadian precipitation analysis capa mahfouf et al 2007 or adjusted precipitation for canada daily apc2 daily mekis and vincent 2011 may help to decrease sensitivity of our final product to errors in the rain gauge dataset we found through visual inspection that imerg pixels over water bodies tended to have anomalously high average values compared to surrounding non water pixels few studies have investigated this systematic error previously tang et al 2016 tian and peters lidard 2007 we expect that deeper investigation of this finding would lead to interesting and important insights especially in our study region covering the canadian shield which has the highest density of lake surface area in the world messager et al 2016 lehner and döll 2004 report a total lake area of 678 103 km2 and total wetland area of 1601 103 km2 for canada alone a mean error of 2 mm day calculated without the anomalous pixels over lakes translates to a volumetric error of 1 356 109 m3 precipitation input to lake systems across canada per day underscoring the importance of high quality precipitation data in this region 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrate the utility of a very simple linear regression based correction to reduce elevation based biases our correction is limited to two dominant signals in the error seasonally based and elevation based biases we therefore expect that a correction that takes into account additional biases related to precipitation intensity or other aspects of topography as well as allowing for non stationary relationships between bias and topography throughout the study region might yield marginal improvements to accuracy a more complex algorithm such as the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 2008 may yield better results at the cost of more methodological complexity further one of the motivating factors for correcting elevation based biases is the availability of higher resolution elevation data as compared to the 10 km imerg data performing the correction for elevation at a finer spatial scale as in hashemi et al 2020 would allow us to produce a downscaled dataset which is necessary for basin scale hydrological modeling abdollahipour et al 2022 ma et al 2018 and is another direction for future work in addition to testing our bias corrected dataset against the original uncorrected imerg precipitationhq variable we compare our dataset to imerg s station corrected precal variable while our bias corrected canak dataset is still slightly outperformed by precal for latitudes north of 60ºn our dataset provides much higher spatial and temporal coverage at these latitudes and improves upon imerg s hq variable our use of the high coverage imerg precipitationhq data expands the spatial coverage of higher accuracy gauge calibrated satellite precipitation at high latitudes we suggest that researchers looking for gridded satellite based precipitation data for studies focused on high latitudes and high elevations in north america will find it preferable to use our bias corrected canak dataset over imerg s precipitationcal which offers irregular data above 60º n or the uncalibrated precipitationhq which shows underestimation and elevation dependent bias our dem based corrections of daily northern high latitude imerg precipitation data reduce absolute and relative bias by 16 and 35 at a monthly scale and by 17 and 29 at a daily scale across canada and alaska we perform the correction using a large dataset of 750 precipitation station clusters across canada and alaska we conclude that dem based orographic corrections can significantly reduce observed bias in imerg hq precipitation data particularly for elevations 500 m a s

7651,study region we define two northern study areas one covering all of canada and alaska and a second smaller subregion surrounding the peace athabasca delta for testing study focus this study aims to use bias correction to improve satellite precipitation data over a relatively data sparse high latitude region using a network of in situ rain gauges we evaluate the satellite data and derive a linear bias elevation relationship and apply the correction with a digital elevation model at a monthly scale and further disaggregate it to produce corrected data at a daily scale new hydrological insights for the region we find that the underestimation in the satellite data increases linearly with increasing elevation above 500 m a s l at the continental scale and for all elevations at the regional scale bias also varies seasonally with higher bias in summer and lower bias in winter compared with uncalibrated data the monthly continental correction reduces absolute bias by 16 and the root mean squared error by 6 while the daily continental correction improves absolute bias by 17 but degrades root mean squared error slightly by 2 we conclude that applying elevation based bias correction reduces systematic elevational bias in northern high latitude satellite precipitation data graphical abstract ga1 keywords imerg satellite precipitation bias correction high latitude rain

introduction precipitation is a critical part of the global water cycle and quality precipitation measurements with high temporal resolution are vital to applications such as hydrological modeling including flood and drought monitoring and prediction however because precipitation is highly variable over time high temporal resolution measurement of precipitation is complicated common approaches to quantifying precipitation include in situ rain gauges ground based radar and satellite based retrievals while rain gauges provide temporally continuous relatively accurate measurements they are limited to point measurements ground based radars provide greater spatial coverage but estimate precipitation indirectly and are still limited to a prescribed radius around the instrument and line of sight visibility young et al 1999 both are commonly located near population centers leaving remote areas and high latitudes severely under sampled satellite precipitation products spps offer global or near global coverage but suffer from known biases and missing data related to topography season precipitation intensity and satellite orbit maggioni et al 2016 high spatial and temporal coverage make spps particularly valuable in remote and mountainous regions with low rain gauge density boluwade et al 2017 spps generally incorporate precipitation retrievals from satellite based passive microwave pmw infrared ir and or radar sensors examples of spps include the climate prediction center cpc morphing method cmorph joyce et al 2004 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap aonashi et al 2009 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2014 and most recently the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 used here prior to imerg spps have been limited geographically to lower latitudes imerg s predecessor tmpa for example is limited to 50ºn 50ºs where pmw sensor coverage is available from its network of three satellites huffman et al 2019 imerg is the first spp to offer coverage poleward of 60º n s for which it uses retrievals from a larger network of pmw and ir sensors however its gauge calibrated product lacks consistent coverage at these high latitudes spps tend to characterize long term e g monthly to yearly precipitation conditions well but struggle to capture short term e g sub hourly to daily variability accurately at shorter time scales spps often correlate poorly with rain gauge measurements chokngamwong and chiu 2008 ebrahimi et al 2017 fenta et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 spp accuracy and bias also vary with temperature and season asong et al 2017 hosseini moghari and tang 2022 kim et al 2017 watters 2021 finally elevation and topographic relief can have a confounding effect on spps because orographic effects on precipitation are not well parameterized maggioni et al 2016 previous studies consistently find that spp performance worsens with higher elevations in a variety of environments choubin et al 2019 fenta et al 2018 hashemi et al 2017 kim et al 2017 lu et al 2020 retalis et al 2020 saber and yilmaz 2018 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 and that spp performance varied with aspect for a mountainous region where the windward side received more precipitation derin and yilmaz 2014 relief a measure of the variability of elevation within a predefined window has more recently been considered and high relief found to be correlated with higher errors in spp data pirmoradian et al 2022 bias correction of spps can improve their accuracy and utility in modeling applications where precipitation data is needed hinge et al 2022 setti et al 2020 wang et al 2020 bias corrections are done in a variety of ways including statistical distribution based quantile mapping chaudhary and dhanya 2019 gowan and horel 2020 jaiswal et al 2021 linear scaling based on precipitation intensity moravej 2020 vernimmen et al 2012 ziarh et al 2021 and spatial interpolation of bias at rain gauges arshad et al 2021 condom et al 2011 kumar et al 2021 another approach that is frequently used is calculating a simple linear scaling factor for subsets of the data such as each month of the year saber and yilmaz 2018 jaiswal et al 2021 chaudhary and dhanya 2019 or elevation bins yeh et al 2020 this approach offers the advantages of being straightforward to implement compared to other methods mentioned above while allowing for seasonal or elevational variations in bias hashemi et al 2017 similarly allow for seasonal variations in bias while also accounting for elevation dependency in bias with linear regression further hashemi et al 2020 leverages higher resolution elevation data to produce a bias corrected precipitation dataset at higher spatial resolution than the original spp bias correction studies for high latitudes are limited in part due to limitations in the spatial coverage of spps a literature search identified two studies focusing on bias correcting imerg data at latitudes above 60º gowan and horel 2020 evaluate and correct imerg early run data using a quantile mapping approach while moravej 2020 calculates a monthly precipitation intensity based correction for daily imerg final run data previous studies have evaluated imerg data in canada with a focus on seasonal and regional differences asong et al 2017 moazami and najafi 2021 but neither investigated topography as a source of bias and are more limited in their temporal domain than our study our aim is to produce an improved high coverage daily satellite precipitation dataset for canada and alaska for hydrologic applications the introduction section presented an overview of commonly used precipitation datasets data biases and shortfalls of available data one such shortfall is a lack of accurate monthly and daily satellite precipitation data in the high latitudes of canada and alaska our study is the first to perform an elevation based evaluation and bias correction on imerg s final run data in canada and alaska at daily and monthly scales for the full 20 years of imerg data availability new with imerg version 06 our methodology involves evaluating the accuracy of two imerg precal and hq satellite precipitation estimates over canada and alaska using in situ rain gauges monthly relationships between elevation and bias are derived and applied using a digital elevation model dem to create a final bias corrected dataset canak our results demonstrate the differences between our new canak data and the official precal and hq data by evaluating the data against gauge data using continuous and categorical metrics finally we discuss the study s broader implications such as the importance of high accuracy data over high density lake areas and some recommendations for future work 2 methods 2 1 study areas we define two northern study areas a primary study region including all of canada and alaska and a secondary subregion for testing centered on the peace athabasca delta pad and adjacent canadian shield fig 1 results focused on the primary study region are found in the main text while results focused on the secondary testing region pad are found in the supplement the primary canada alaska study area covers nearly 12 106 km2 ranging from 41ºn 72ºn latitude 0 6190 m a s l in elevation having a large climate and environmental gradient rain gauge stations having consistent observations at least 90 coverage report a range of 0 2 15 mm day mean precipitation across the domain menne et al 2012 due to the domain s continental scale different regions show diverse seasonal patterns overall september october and november are the wettest months while february march and april are the driest fig 1b the pad subarea used as a smaller scale test region to develop our methodology covers 1255199 km2 and is bounded by 120 3ºw 96 74ºw 54 58ºn and 62 84ºn with portions in alberta saskatchewan manitoba british columbia northwest territories and nunavut it contains many shallow freshwater lakes and has a relatively low elevation gradient 0 3935 m a s l mean daily precipitation varies between about 0 8 1 6 mm day menne et al 2012 june july and august make up the wettest months while december january and february are driest fig 1c the pad a unesco world heritage site is one of the largest inland boreal deltas on the planet and provides important habitat for birds and bison timoney 2013 the delta relies on hydrological recharge from precipitation in addition to groundwater and inflow from the peace and athabasca rivers pavelsky and smith 2008 periodic ice jam flooding is also an important process affecting the delta s hydrology and is associated with total winter precipitation beltaos et al 2006 the hydrological and ecological significance of the region motivates our initial use of the pad and surrounding areas as a testing region before applying our methodology to the larger canada alaska domain 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite precipitation product the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg satellite precipitation product is one of the most advanced spps available currently with a spatial resolution of 0 1º and temporal resolution of 30 min and near global coverage huffman et al 2019 the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is a joint venture of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa with the gpm core satellite launched in 2014 imerg incorporates visible ir and passive microwave retrievals from a constellation of satellites as well as the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr sensor onboard gpm to produce worldwide precipitation estimates in version 6 the most recent update of the imerg algorithm the algorithm was also retrospectively applied to trmm retrievals from june 2000 until the gpm era huffman et al 2019 precipitation estimate outputs are based on 1 pmw only retrievals hqprecipitation hq 2 ir only retrievals irprecipitation 3 the integrated product with pmw and ir retrievals precipitationuncal and 4 the integrated product calibrated against a precipitation gauge network precipitationcal precal for this study we use the pmw only variable hq daily 3b day ms mrg 3imerg from imerg though precal monthly 3b mo ms mrg 3imerg and daily 3b day ms mrg 3imerg calibrated precipitation is generally considered to be the most accurate product it provides only partial coverage north of 60ºn providing limited and inconsistent observations at the daily scale huffman et al 2019 see fig 2 while our use of the uncalibrated dataset will produce lower accuracy measurements compared with the calibrated dataset see moazami and najafi 2021 tan et al 2016 we prioritize spatial coverage in our bias corrected dataset and seek to demonstrate that reasonable tradeoffs can be made in accuracy for higher coverage in our high latitude area imerg data are available for three processing levels that correspond to data quality and latency these include the 1 early run available after 4 h and designed for short term uses like flood forecasting 2 late run available within 14 h that incorporates any delayed retrievals and 3 the research quality final run available two to three months later in which the precal variable is calibrated to monthly rain gauge data imerg uses the global precipitation climatology center gpcc gridded dataset based on station data from ghcn for the calibration of precal so this should be noted when considering our evaluation of imerg precal schneider et al 2014 for the purpose of our study we use the non gridded point based ghcn station data to analyze the uncalibrated hq variable menne et al 2012 a full list of available products and variables can be found in huffman et al 2019 for this study the final run daily data were downloaded from goddard earth sciences data and information center ges disc and subset to the study area which extends from 41º 72ºn for the period june 1 2000 to december 31 2020 for reference a map of daily average precipitation for this period can be found in fig s1 within the pad subarea imerg pixels over some lakes in both hq and precal data were found to have consistently anomalously high values likely due to an issue with the algorithm over inland water bodies see also tang et al 2016 tian and peters lidard 2007 these anomalous pixels and all inland water pixels for the larger area were removed from analysis due to observed data unreliability the reference mask used to remove water can be found in fig s2 2 2 2 ground based precipitation observations the national centers for environmental information maintains the global historical climatology network ghcn a quality controlled global dataset of daily weather station observations menne et al 2012 the ghcn dataset includes daily precipitation measurements with variable temporal domains from over 100 000 stations worldwide and is here used to obtain precipitation ground truth data for our study area subsetting the global stations to canada and alaska yielded a total of 9984 ghcn stations with daily data between june 1 2000 and december 31 2020 stations with identical coordinates were combined such that for days when multiple stations reported measurements at the same location the value was taken from the entry with the longest total record within the study period as per lawrimore et al 2011 the total number of unique stations remaining after this process was 4011 in canada and alaska and 214 in the smaller pad subarea stations in the larger domain had an average of 13 4 years 65 coverage and those in the smaller domain had an average of 7 years of data 34 coverage over the 20 5 years of the study temporal domain 2 2 3 digital elevation model the multi error removed improved terrain merit digital elevation model dem yamazaki et al 2017 was used to investigate the effects of elevation and topographical relief on errors and bias in the imerg data the merit dem was also used to estimate the elevations of ghcn stations surface and imerg pixel elevations the merit dem was downloaded from the yamazaki lab research website http hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit dem and has a native resolution of 90 m yamazaki et al 2017 the dataset was aggregated to 300 m pixels to reduce processing times while maintaining a high resolution relative to the 10 km resolution imerg precipitation data 2 3 methods 2 3 1 clustering using hierarchical clustering ghcn stations were clustered spatially and by precipitation quantiles to create groups of geographically and climatically similar stations facilitating the comparison between the station measurements and gridded imerg data first geographic latitude longitude elevation and climatic 50th and 75th percentiles of precipitation values variables for each station were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 standardization adjusts for the effect of the scale of the variables on the clustering analysis the standardized variables representing latitude and longitude were multiplied by two to increase their relative weight de sarbo et al 1984 we do this to prioritize geographic proximity over other variables and to encourage contiguous clusters as fouedijo 2016 shows that adding geographical coordinates as clustering variables is not sufficient to provide contiguity the agglomerative nesting hierarchical clustering method from the agnes r package was run on the five geographic and climatic factors as described in kaufman and rosseeuw 1990 silhouette scores a measure of distance between and within clusters were used to select an optimal number of clusters for the smaller subarea shahapure and nicholas 2020 the number of clusters for the larger canada alaska domain was chosen such that the average number of stations per cluster was consistent across the domain the stations in each cluster were aggregated into cohesive spatial units made using an iterative buffering reducing process as follows first circular buffers of 100 km were created around each individual station within a cluster and then dissolved enclosing all stations within a single cluster perimeter polygon next the cluster polygon was inwardly buffered or reduced by 90 km to create a polygon closely fitted to all stations in that cluster the clustered concave hull polygons were then used to extract the average value of the imerg data within the buffered hull and the cluster averaged imerg data were evaluated against the average station values within each cluster 2 3 2 evaluation biases and errors for hq and precal were assessed by season elevation and topographic relief table 1 daily imerg hq and clustered ghcn data were aggregated to a monthly scale such that months with fewer than 25 coverage were considered to have insufficient data the continuous evaluation metrics used which measure the satellite s error relative to in situ data were absolute bias relative bias pearson s correlation coefficient root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae metrics were calculated for each cluster for the entire data record and for month climatologies according to the equations in table 1 categorical metrics which measure the skill of the satellite data in identifying rain events were applied using a threshold of 0 5 mm precipitation day to define rainy vs non rainy days as in asong et al 2017 the metrics used were probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far frequency bias index fbi critical success index csi and heidke skill score hss as defined in the equations below elevational and relief based biases were examined through bias elevation scatterplots and through a comparison of clusters below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of average cluster elevation seasonal biases were examined by comparing average bias for boreal spring march april may mam summer june july august jja fall september october november son and winter december january february djf after the bias correction all metrics were calculated for hq the corrected canak and precal and used to evaluate canak s performance compared to the original hq data and compared to precal seasonal error in hq canak and precal is also considered by calculating the average rmse for each month of the year 2 3 3 linear regression bias correction in this study a linear regression between bias and elevation of the clusters was calculated for each month of the year then applied to the original gridded imerg data for the full study area a flowchart summarizing the methodology described is provided in fig 3 the mean bias for each station cluster for each of the twelve months was plotted against the mean elevation for each station cluster a climatologically based linear model was fit to the monthly data using a simple linear regression algorithm the results of which can be found in the supplement table s1 the slope and intercept of the regression lines were used to calculate a monthly additive correction for the whole scene using the merit dem resampled to match imerg pixels for dem cell values falling outside the domain of average elevation of the clusters the correction corresponding to the nearest end of the domain was used i e the same magnitude of correction was applied to every pixel above 2926 m the highest average cluster elevation the monthly correction was disaggregated into a daily correction using the proportion of total precipitation in the month that fell on a particular day according to the original data based on a methodology established by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 and fan et al 2019 the daily correction was then applied to the original daily imerg data to create the final bias corrected daily product the monthly and daily corrections were applied first for the pad testing subarea and then for the canada alaska domain for the pad we added additional rainy pixels based on the proportion of days that report rain for a 13 day moving window centered on each day of the year this enhanced daily data was used to disaggregate the monthly correction in the same manner as described above because the pad subarea is used as an algorithm testing site the results for the regional pad correction can be found in the supplement while the remainder of the text will focus on reporting the results of the bias correction at the continental scale finally we compare the uncorrected hq precipitation data our corrected canak data and imerg s calibrated precal data using the metrics described in section 2 3 2 for all clusters for clusters at high elevation those affected by our bias correction with mean ghcn station elevation 500 m and for clusters at high latitudes those with mean ghcn station latitude 60º we also compare rmse for hq canak and precal for each of the two decades included in our study s temporal domain 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 and for boreal winter djf and summer jja temporal coverage for the study area was also calculated for hq and precal as part of the evaluation for each variable the proportion of days across the entire time span that had a precipitation estimate available was calculated canak was created using the hq data so it will have the same coverage as the hq data though we limit the correction to land areas only masking out pixels over lakes and the ocean 3 results 3 1 clustering clustering the ghcn stations improved correlations between ground and satellite data as compared to direct point to pixel analysis and helped to lessen the spatial bias in station location fig 4 in the canada alaska domain 750 station clusters were created with 1 33 stations in each cluster the mean number of stations per cluster was uniform between the canada alaska and pad study areas 5 35 stations per cluster the elevation range changed from 0 2926 m among individual stations to 2 2186 m among clusters temporal coverage increased from about 8 years to 13 4 years among clusters out of the total 20 5 years of the study domain however the clusters retained much of the broad scale location bias of the stations concentrated in areas that were typically located in the south with sparse coverage in the more remote central and northern canada and alaska some clusters highlighted a high level of disagreement between the elevation reported in the ghcn dataset and the merit dem averaged over the buffered hull see fig 4b for example one cluster consisted of a single ghcn station that was located in a valley between two ridges resulting in imerg data being extracted over an area with a higher elevation than the station s location because we are interested in bias related to elevation we only used clusters where the difference between the gauge and imerg averaged merit dem elevations was less than 200 m highlighted in blue in fig 4b 3 2 evaluation substantial negative bias underestimation in the hq data was observed with bias magnitude increasing with elevation fig 5 biases reported here are for the monthly data because these are used to calculate the bias correction the difference between mean bias in the monthly and daily data is subtle within the canada alaska domain the mean absolute bias for all clusters was 2 51 mm day the correlation between absolute bias and elevation is not identifiable below 500 m elevation of the station clusters examined in this study only 23 of clusters are above 500 m and are able to be corrected bias for clusters in the overall lowest 10th percentile of elevation was 4 80 mm day and in the 90th percentile of elevation was 1 57 mm day when considering the full elevation range of clusters fig s3 above 500 m elevation bias for clusters in the lowest 10th percentile of elevation 538 m was 1 43 mm day and in the 90th percentile of elevation 1128 m was 2 01 mm day while elevation is the dominant contributor to topographically driven biases a bias dependence on relief was also found bias for clusters in the lowest 10th percentile of relief 1 1 m was 3 00 mm day while bias in the highest 90th percentile of relief 30 5 m was 4 77 mm day finally seasonal bias was examined among all clusters bias was highest in son the wettest season 2 58 mm day and lowest in mam the driest season 2 12 mm day bias for djf and jja were 2 27 mm day and 2 30 mm day respectively above 500 m elevation the difference in bias was greatest between djf 0 99 mm day and jja 1 80 mm day bias in the precal data is smaller in magnitude than in the hq data shows overestimation rather than underestimation and no correlation with elevation is observed fig s4 mean bias for precal across all clusters was 0 99 mm day there is a difference between bias for clusters in the lowest 10th percentile of elevation 3 20 mm day and highest 90th percentile of elevation 0 30 mm day but this difference reflects a wider spread of mean biases for low elevation clusters than high elevations rather than a clear bias elevation dependence considering only clusters above 500 m elevation as above the lowest 10th percentile had a mean bias of 0 24 mm day and the highest 90th percentile had a mean bias of 0 59 mm day there was a stronger difference between bias for high relief and low relief clusters for precal than for hq the lowest 10th percentile of relief had a mean bias of 1 26 mm day while the highest 90th percentile had a mean bias of 3 24 mm day elevation and relief percentiles are the same as those specified above as in the hq data the highest bias was seen in son the wettest season 1 20 mm day and lowest in mam the driest season 0 64 mm day while bias for djf and jja were 0 68 mm day and 0 86 mm day respectively 3 3 bias correction our regression based bias correction improved the monthly precipitation data as compared to the original hq data fig 6 fig 7 results for the monthly correction for the smaller pad subregion can be found in the supplement in fig 6 it is shown that most metrics improved with the correction absolute bias relative bias rmse mae pod fbi and csi while a few worsened correlation coefficient far and hss on average the absolute bias was reduced by 16 0 relative bias by 34 7 rmse by 5 5 and mae by 6 1 pod increased by 26 2 fbi by 34 3 and csi by 19 6 however correlation coefficient decreased by 0 9 far increased by 94 5 and hss decreased by 25 7 fig 7 includes two arbitrarily chosen months august 2000 fig 7a and december 2010 fig 7b to show the impact of the correction for different seasons due to the limitation of only correcting elevations above 500 m the differences in the uncorrected and corrected data in fig 7 are seen along and to the west of the rocky mountains as well as higher elevation areas of southeastern canada at the northern end of the appalachian mountains our regression based correction also improved the daily precipitation data as compared to the original hq data fig 8 fig 9 results for the daily correction for the smaller pad subregion can be found in the supplement at the continental scale the correction improved the absolute bias relative bias pod fbi csi and hss while far was worsened and correlation coefficient rmse and mae were relatively unchanged fig 8 on average absolute bias was reduced by 17 0 and relative bias by 28 5 pod increased by 15 9 fbi by 24 9 csi by 8 6 and hss by 3 4 however far increased by 17 rmse increased by 2 2 mae increased by 3 4 and correlation coefficient increased by 0 1 fig 9 shows examples of the pre correction hq and corrected canak precipitation values on two arbitrarily chosen days the correction is non stationary and affects the days differently as can be seen in the disparity in the difference between subplots a and b and c and d while canak improves upon hq precal outperforms both at the monthly and daily scale across all clusters in most metrics fig 6 fig 8 at the monthly scale precal shows better results than hq and canak for all metrics except for far fig 6 while at the daily scale precal shows better results for all metrics except for rmse mae and far fig 8 absolute bias relative bias correlation coefficient pod fbi csi and hss are all substantially or slightly better for daily precal than for daily hq and canak though canak generally outperforms hq mean rmse and mae are slightly higher for precal than for both hq or canak and far is significantly higher worse for precal when rmse is separated by winter djf and summer jja hq canak and precal all show a slightly higher mean rmse for jja than djf but a smaller upper extreme fig 10a rmse for the two decades also show a consistent pattern across hq canak and precal with lower rmse for 2000 2010 and higher rmse for 2010 2020 fig 10b rmse for precal is lower than for hq and canak as in fig 8 at high latitudes 60º n and high elevations 500 m canak shows a great improvement upon hq and nearly matches precal s performance fig 11 fig 12 at high latitudes 60º n canak sees a more marked decrease in bias compared to hq than at all latitudes fig 11 it should be also noted that due to poorer coverage of daily precal data at high latitudes the observations with which the metrics are calculated are much fewer for precal than for hq and canak that is precal has lower errors when data is available but data is available inconsistently and irregularly less than every four days on average finally at high elevations 500 m where the correction was applied canak nearly matches precal s performance in terms of bias and improves upon hq substantially for most other metrics though the correction worsens rmse mae and far compared to hq fig 12 overall canak bias corrected daily satellite precipitation data provides daily continuous precipitation data with similar errors to the calibrated precal product temporal coverage differs greatly between hq and precal with hq offering near 100 coverage over all areas and precal dropping substantially above 60º n fig 2 at the monthly scale precal shows good coverage over the land surface however at the daily scale precal s coverage above 60º n is 23 6 while hq s average coverage is 99 9 4 discussion this study finds a strongly negative bias underestimation of precipitation in canadian and alaskan imerg hq data that is associated with elevation this pattern is evident above 500 m a s l for the continental canada alaska scale fig 5 this finding is consistent with other studies that report similar negative elevation associated biases in satellite precipitation data over the conterminous u s hashemi et al 2017 japan takido et al 2016 and india kumar et al 2021 for example we also find that bias varies by season consistent with previous findings for imerg data in the u s hashemi et al 2017 seasonal rmse findings that show a higher mean rmse in jja but a smaller standard deviation fig 10b are also consistent with previous findings for imerg data in canada moazami and najafi 2021 however while pirmoradian et al 2022 find better performance for imerg after 2010 over the conterminous u s we find an increase in rmse in 2010 2020 as opposed to 2000 2010 fig 10a at the continental scale we find additional biases unassociated with elevation especially below 500 m a s l these include numerous ghcn station clusters with large biases along the pacific coast atlantic coast and southern ontario fig 4 this finding corroborates asong et al 2017 and moazami and najafi 2021 who report lower accuracies along coastal regions of canada as opposed to the central prairie region in the u s drier regions were also found to perform better than wet regions hosseini moghari and tang 2022 additionally some areas of high relief e g coastal british columbia have large 500 m mismatches between reported ghcn station elevations and our spatially averaged merit dem values surrounding them nevertheless above 500 m we find a strong negative bias with a negative linear trend hashemi et al 2017 2020 for example report a similar negative bias with a negative linear trend above 1500 m a s l in the continental u s as in the referenced studies we conclude here that such orographically induced biases can be mitigated using simple regression based techniques and a dem our regression based corrections effectively reduced elevation driven precipitation biases in monthly and daily imerg hq data absolute and relative biases were reduced for both time scales following our corrections and more evident for clusters at high elevation and high latitude than when considering all clusters both monthly and daily corrections increase the number of precipitation pixels in the imerg product decreasing pod while also necessarily increasing far figs 6 8 11 12 while our corrections improve upon hq precal outperforms both hq and canak consistent with other studies which found worse performance for hq compared to precal in canada moazami and najafi 2021 and southern coastal china sui et al 2020 for example however these results are heavily influenced by clusters at low elevations that our method is unable to correct for high elevation clusters where the correction is applied canak performs similarly to precal fig 12 at high latitude clusters precal still moderately outperforms canak but due to the low coverage of precal at high latitudes the metrics are based on fewer observations fig 11 the coverage of hq and therefore canak greatly improves upon the coverage of precal fig 2 limitations of the presented approach include a sparse uneven spatial distribution of ghcn stations available rain gauges are heavily skewed towards populated areas with most located in alberta and southern ontario quebec and manitoba fig 1 by contrast vast areas of northern canada and alaska have few or scattered rain gauges available to reduce the influence of the uneven spatial distribution of the ghcn stations in space and time we aggregate neighboring stations with similar precipitation signatures to assess and correct biases in the imerg hqprecipitation data we use all available ghcn stations in the cluster aggregation and compare the corrected imerg data with the same ghcn clusters we use the entire collection of ghcn stations to ensure accuracy over the period of record and do not separate training and validation data as would be done in examinations seeking to develop models that are transferable in space and time in addition to orographic effects other negative bias es found in canadian and alaskan imerg data may be due to decreased accuracy of the hq variable especially over snowy surfaces huffman et al 2019 poorer performance of the imerg algorithm at higher latitudes mahmoud et al 2021 regional climatological differences in canada and alaska particularly in precipitation amount asong et al 2017 gowan and horel 2020 moazami and najafi 2021 and bias associated with precipitation intensity bogerd et al 2021 fenta et al 2018 moravej 2020 tian et al 2018 further study is needed to identify and correct other imerg hq non elevation biases such as those related to precipitation intensity and other aspects of topography lastly there are known errors associated with in situ rain gauge measurements such as under catch due to wind which are here treated as ground truths use of an additional ground based observation reference dataset such as the gridded canadian precipitation analysis capa mahfouf et al 2007 or adjusted precipitation for canada daily apc2 daily mekis and vincent 2011 may help to decrease sensitivity of our final product to errors in the rain gauge dataset we found through visual inspection that imerg pixels over water bodies tended to have anomalously high average values compared to surrounding non water pixels few studies have investigated this systematic error previously tang et al 2016 tian and peters lidard 2007 we expect that deeper investigation of this finding would lead to interesting and important insights especially in our study region covering the canadian shield which has the highest density of lake surface area in the world messager et al 2016 lehner and döll 2004 report a total lake area of 678 103 km2 and total wetland area of 1601 103 km2 for canada alone a mean error of 2 mm day calculated without the anomalous pixels over lakes translates to a volumetric error of 1 356 109 m3 precipitation input to lake systems across canada per day underscoring the importance of high quality precipitation data in this region 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrate the utility of a very simple linear regression based correction to reduce elevation based biases our correction is limited to two dominant signals in the error seasonally based and elevation based biases we therefore expect that a correction that takes into account additional biases related to precipitation intensity or other aspects of topography as well as allowing for non stationary relationships between bias and topography throughout the study region might yield marginal improvements to accuracy a more complex algorithm such as the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 2008 may yield better results at the cost of more methodological complexity further one of the motivating factors for correcting elevation based biases is the availability of higher resolution elevation data as compared to the 10 km imerg data performing the correction for elevation at a finer spatial scale as in hashemi et al 2020 would allow us to produce a downscaled dataset which is necessary for basin scale hydrological modeling abdollahipour et al 2022 ma et al 2018 and is another direction for future work in addition to testing our bias corrected dataset against the original uncorrected imerg precipitationhq variable we compare our dataset to imerg s station corrected precal variable while our bias corrected canak dataset is still slightly outperformed by precal for latitudes north of 60ºn our dataset provides much higher spatial and temporal coverage at these latitudes and improves upon imerg s hq variable our use of the high coverage imerg precipitationhq data expands the spatial coverage of higher accuracy gauge calibrated satellite precipitation at high latitudes we suggest that researchers looking for gridded satellite based precipitation data for studies focused on high latitudes and high elevations in north america will find it preferable to use our bias corrected canak dataset over imerg s precipitationcal which offers irregular data above 60º n or the uncalibrated precipitationhq which shows underestimation and elevation dependent bias our dem based corrections of daily northern high latitude imerg precipitation data reduce absolute and relative bias by 16 and 35 at a monthly scale and by 17 and 29 at a daily scale across canada and alaska we perform the correction using a large dataset of 750 precipitation station clusters across canada and alaska we conclude that dem based orographic corrections can significantly reduce observed bias in imerg hq precipitation data particularly for elevations 500 m a s

7652,study region alberta province canada study focus the global average surface temperature has continuously warmed at an unprecedentedly rapid rate since the mid 20th century employing cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 climate projections this study suggested a comprehensive framework with state of the art techniques and evaluated potential changes in climate indices under the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c in alberta canada new hydrological insights for the region main finding of this study is that a significant warming trend in annual mean temperature was projected from all of the selected cmip6 climate projections in alberta while there was no distinct trend in annual precipitation under the gmt changes from 1 5 c to 5 c extreme cold temperature indices were warming at a larger rate in response to the gmt warming in particular the warming rate of the annual coldest minimum temperature in alberta was 2 5 times faster than gmt warming in addition a potential decrease in summer precipitation was projected under the gmt warming leading to a drier and warmer summer in the central and southern parts of alberta furthermore more extreme drought conditions were projected in alberta under the gmt warming indicating that the extreme drought conditions are likely to become more common in alberta along with the gmt warming graphical abstract ga1 keywords cmip6 global warming potential changes climate indices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global average surface temperature has continuously warmed since 1880 ipcc 2013 especially at an unprecedentedly rapid rate since the mid 20th century mainly due to human activities superimposed on natural variability wuebbles et al 2017 global warming has further caused long term changes in the climate system and subsequently resulted in substantial alterations in human and natural systems such as an increase in extreme climate events e g drought and flood sea level rise and huge impacts on arctic ecosystems ipcc 2015 mysiak et al 2016 global warming further has induced larger effects on climatology at regional or local scales for instance the annual average temperature on land in canada has warmed by 1 7 c since 1948 bush et al 2019 especially with a stronger warming trend in the north and west parts of canada vincent et al 2015 in particular alberta has various climate landscape and vegetation characteristics driven by diverse topographic characteristics ranging from high mountains to prairies natural regions committee 2006 thus the warming may result in profound effects on terrestrial and aquatic systems at different levels varying with the topographic characteristics in alberta in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 the latest climate projections derived from multiple global climate models gcms have been available to evaluate the impacts of climate change although the climate projections provide fundamental information to understand climate change impacts at a global scale direct applications of gcms outputs have been impeded at regional or local scales due to considerable biases mainly driven by a coarse resolution 100 km and imperfect physical parameters and processes bárdossy 1997 eum et al 2016 gutmann et al 2014 fowler et al 2007 sillmann et al 2013 therefore a downscaling technique has been incorporated into impact studies not only to refine spatial resolution but also to remove biases in gcms outputs cannon et al 2015 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 maurer and hidalgo 2008 wood et al 2004 among two main downscaling categories i e dynamical and statistical approaches in the literature many studies have actively applied statistical downscaling techniques that provide a computationally efficient way to reproduce important statistics of locally observed climate data abatzoglou and brown 2012 cannon et al 2016 eum and cannon 2017 hwang and graham 2013 stoner et al 2013 as prior studies concluded that a non parametric approach e g quantile mapping qm outperforms parametric approaches with regard to removing systematic biases in gcms outputs gudmundsson et al 2012 many qm based approaches were progressively developed to avoid unintended distortion of gcm driven climate signals in essential statistics and extremes bürger et al 2013 cannon et al 2015 however the qm based techniques are a univariate approach that is usually implemented for individual climate variables regardless of biases in inter variables dependence thus multivariate statistical downscaling methods were proposed to improve the inter variables dependence between hydro climate variables cannon 2016 guo et al 2019 li et al 2010 vrac and friederichs 2015 particularly the multivariate downscaling methods considerably improved snow related processes by better representing precipitation phases i e rain mix and snow phases which are mainly determined by inter variable dependence between precipitation and temperature meyer et al 2019 eum et al 2020 proposed a multivariate bias correction combined with a distribution free shuffle approach mbcds that preserves gcm driven long term trends and the inter dependence between hydro climate variables specifically mbcds outperformed not only hydrologic processes affected by multiple climate variables e g snow related processes but also computational efficiency by directly incorporating the gaussian rank correlation between climate variables instead of an iterative procedure that is usually employed to improve the multivariate gaussianity in multivariate statistical downscaling methods cannon 2018 incorporating the mbcds method this study produced high resolution cmip6 climate projections for the alberta province canada as a large number of cmip6 climate projections are available most impact studies are likely to include as many projections as possible to take into account the uncertainty in future climate conditions however it is not practical to include all of the climate projections available for impact studies e g hydrologic and ecologic modeling due to crucial constraints such as time labor and computational burden cannon 2015 seo et al 2019 alternatively it is more pragmatic to systematically select a subset of representative climate projections that capture a full range of projected future changes farjad et al 2019 suggested a novel geometric algorithm to select representative climate scenarios for various spatial scales e g sub continental regional and local scales this study also applied the same approach to identify a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections to be statistically downscaled by applying mbcds for the alberta province many studies have actively investigated hydroclimatic variability and potential climate change impacts in alberta hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 masud et al 2017 the majority of the previous studies have paid attention to potential changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme climate events between baseline historical and future periods for example the special report on emission scenarios sres of cmip phase 3 cmip3 meehl et al 2007 projected a 20 and 4 4 c increase in winter precipitation and temperature respectively in the late twenty first century from a baseline period jiang et al 2017 after the paris agreement that aims not only to keep the global mean temperature gmt below 2 c above pre industrial levels but also to limit the gmt increase further to 1 5 c many scientific communities have investigated the potential impacts of gmt warming of 1 5 c and higher levels of warming at a global scale allen et al 2019 furthermore the local impacts of the gmt change at various levels of warming e g 1 5 4 c have also been evaluated to assess vulnerability to gmt warming jeong et al 2019 shrestha et al 2020 in particular hayhoe and stoner 2019 have examined potential changes in alberta under gmt changes of 1 c 1 5 c 2 c 3 c and 4 c which have been driven by the cmip phase 5 cmip5 climate projections they concluded that a 2 c increase in winter temperature was projected under 1 5 c gmt change while 6 8 c under 4 c gmt change indicating that a temperature warming rate in alberta might be larger than a gmt warming rate most of the previous studies evaluated potential changes in climate under global warming based on all combinations of gcm projections available in a repository for example hayhoe and stoner 2019 were based on 20 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 i e total 40 climate projections as aforementioned however it is not practical to apply the 40 climate projections but only a subset of the climate projections might likely be employed into impact studies depending on the aim of studies human resources and computational burden of selected impact modes resulting in inconsistent climate change impact assessment in addition most previous studies employed univariate statistical downscaling methods which may cause unexpected biases in hydrologic and ecological projections derived from interactions between multiple climate variables at a watershed scale given the up to date cmip6 climate projections furthermore it is of the utmost important to understand how sensitively local climate responses to gmt warming especially sub regions delineated by climatic and topographic characteristics in alberta thus this study proposed a framework comprised of state of the art techniques for consistent and more reliable climate change impact assessment at a local scale under the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c driven by the latest cmip6 climate projections note that this study examined only potential changes in various climate indices at a local scale under gmt warming through the framework thus the framework proposed in this study is comprised of the following tasks a selecting a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections to capture a full range of potential changes in extreme climate indices b identifying future 30 year windows that reach the thresholds of gcm warming from 1 5 c to 5 c relative to the pre industrial pi period from 1850 to 1900 ipcc 2018 c applying the mbcds method for the selected representative cmip6 climate projections to produce high resolution cmip6 climate projections and d evaluating potential changes and trends in various climate indices to investigate the impacts of climate change under the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c the framework can be also applicable for other regions under a new subset of representative climate projections thus the aims of this study are to 1 propose a comprehensive framework for climate change impact assessment 2 examine trends in essential climate variables precipitation and temperature in this study and 3 quantitatively evaluate the impacts of gmt warming on various climate indices in alberta 2 method 2 1 study domain and climate data 2 1 1 natural sub region in alberta alberta has very diverse terrain in north america such as mountains foothills and plains the topographical characteristics affect ecologic systems at different levels of solar and climatic influences furthermore climatic and physiographic patterns determine vegetation and soil distributions in other words the interaction of attributes between atmosphere and land plays a crucial role in delineating ecological land classification while ecozones ecoregions and ecodistricts have been delineated at a national scale the alberta environmental protection 1994 defined natural nat regions based on climate physiographic vegetation soil wildlife and land use which is comprised of six natural nat regions in alberta as shown in fig 1 i e rocky mountain foothills grassland parkland boreal forest and canadian shield it is noteworthy that the nat is recognized as a provincial ecological unit for sustainable resources management natural regions committee 2006 along with global warming climate and ecological conditions may be altered at different levels corresponding to the level of gmt warming in particular changes in hydroclimate variables e g precipitation and temperature may cause an alteration in atmospheric conditions water cycle and water availability that influences socio economic systems therefore understanding climate change impacts in the nat regions is essential for developing sustainable resources management and adaptations to climate change with spatially averaged gridded climate data within the nat regions this study evaluated changes in various climate indices under different levels of gmt warming from 1 5 c to 5 c 2 1 2 historical observed data as the station density is not evenly distributed over alberta especially much lower in western mountainous and northern parts of alberta the observational station data may provide inconsistent accuracy and data length depending on network density in and around a study domain therefore science communities have actively applied gridded climate datasets that provide consistent long term climate data at a regular spacing resolution which is useful for intercomparison and impact studies eum et al 2014 wong et al 2017 islam and déry 2017 werner and cannon 2016 although a number of high resolution gridded climate datasets have been produced from station based hutchinson et al 2009 werner et al 2019 multiple source based lespinas et al 2015 and reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 datasets impact studies have suffered from inconsistencies in spatial accuracies period of record number of climate variables and spatial coverage for large scale modeling studies in particular multiple gridded climate datasets have been combined to cover all climate variables and intended simulation period over entire study domains without evaluating the performance of individual climate datasets subsequently it often results in assembling a poor forcing dataset which leads to unexpected and misleading modeling outputs for impact studies faramarzi et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 eum and gupta 2019 proposed a framework called reference reliability evaluation system refres which systematically ranks multiple climate datasets available within a study area based on various performance measures and generates a hybrid climate dataset daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature for the study region by extracting the best available data based on the ranking from multiple candidates more details on the refres and the hybrid climate dataset can be found in eum and gupta 2019 the hybrid climate dataset prepared in 2019 has been updated by extending the spatial domain to cover the portions of river basins in adjacent provinces as shown in fig 2 and the temporal period until 2019 accordingly the hybrid climate dataset now provides daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature from 1950 to 2019 at 10 km spatial resolution total of 19 700 grid cells within the spatial boundary in fig 2 this study employed the hybrid climate dataset as an observed climate dataset to be incorporated into the multivariate statistical downscaling method i e mbcds 2 1 3 cmip6 climate projections a working group of climate and ocean variability predictability and change clivar part of the world climate research program has established the coupled model intercomparison project cmip not only to provide multiple climate model outputs but also to intercompare the performance of climate models cmip has evolved over five phases since 1995 and become a major international multi model research activity in cmip1 and cmip2 for example the experimental designs were very simple that there were no interannual changes in radiative forcing while atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration increased at a rate of 1 per year meehl et al 2000 in cmip3 and cmip5 more diverse climate scenarios have been projected under the special report on emissions scenarios sres meehl et al 2007 and representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 the cmip3 and cmip5 climate projections were publicly available resulting in an explosion of scientific outcomes derived from multiple gcms and impact models at diverse spatial scales stouffer et al 2017 cmip is currently in phase 6 cmip6 to produce the latest climate data derived from state of the art climate models which will be fundamental climate information for the ipcc 6th assessment report eyring et al 2016 many scientific communities are putting greater efforts into validating advances in cmip6 by intercomparison mainly between cmip5 and cmip6 their studies proved that cmip6 has added values to indian summer monsoon rainfall gusain et al 2020 and extreme precipitation and temperature chen et al 2021 kim et al 2020 compared to cmip5 cmip6 introduced a parallel approach that consists of cmip5 rcps and alternative shared socioeconomic pathways ssps moss et al 2010 in other words new cmip6 climate projections have been produced to reflect the combined effects of future climate and socio economic changes o neill et al 2017 in cmip6 five alternative ssps have been developed to describe the main characteristics in demographic human development economy institution technology and environment o neill et al 2017 for example ssp1 represents a societal scenario that achieves green growth and a green economy while ssp5 assumes an energy intensive fossil based economy more details on ssps are found in o neill et al 2017 the combinations of ssp and rcps are represented by sspxy where x and y are the specific ssp and the forcing pathway i e global average radiative forcing level respectively for example ssp585 represents a combination of ssp5 and rcp8 5 this study compiled cmip6 projections that provide 1 historical 1850 2014 and 2 future 2015 2100 scenarios forced by the ssp rcp combinations for three climate variables i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature at the daily time scale among the combinations of ssps and rcps this study compiled climate projections forced by ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 this study compiled twelve historical runs and forty one cmip6 climate projections driven by twelve gcms refer to table s 1 while all of gcms provide historical climate scenarios from 1850 to 2014 not all gcms produce the four ssp rcp climate projections in summary a total of twelve historical runs and forty one climate projections were collected and clipped for the spatial domain of the hybrid climate data eum and gupta 2019 as shown in fig 2 all of the collected cmip6 climate data were interpolated to the grid cells of the hybrid climate data 19 700 grid cells using the inverse distance method for further statistical downscaling 2 2 selection of a subset of cmip6 climate projections for alberta it has been widely recommended to use outputs from multiple gcms with different forcing scenarios to capture climate variabilities and uncertainties in climate projections however sufficient resources are seldom available for downscaling a large number of gcms as the number of available gcms has increased at a rapid pace over the past decades in impact studies that implement domain specific numerical models the computational cost is further expensive to fully employ all gcm outputs available in a data repository moreover it is always neither feasible nor practical to include as many climate projections as possible mainly due to the computational burden and limited resources to address this limitation an integrated geometry algorithm quickhull ramper douglas peucker qh rdp farjad et al 2019 was used to identify a subset of representative gcm scenarios that cover the spread of projections the quickhull algorithm provides a convex hull that covers extreme points for a high dimensional dataset however the identified convex hull may not cover a range of extreme points when a user defines a specific number of gcm scenarios thus the quickhull was integrated with the rdp algorithm that identifies a simplified convex hull by filtering out less prominent scenarios for a given number of gcm scenarios the selection of representative gcm scenarios is comprised of the following steps 1 reducing the data dimension etccdi indices using principal component analysis pca 2 capturing the extreme points of the reduced dimension data set using the quickhull algorithm 3 capturing the most prominent extreme gcms using the ramer douglas peucker algorithm and 4 validating the conservation of the projection spread these steps are described in detail in farjad et al 2019 this study spatially averaged daily precipitation and temperature over alberta to produce a single time series to calculate all etccdi for the 41 cmip6 climate projections compiled in this study refer to table s 1 then relative changes in all etccdis between the baseline 1986 2014 and far future 2071 2100 periods were evaluated to be applied for the qh rdp approach to select a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections for alberta as a higher level of dimension comes with the more complicated problem to efficiently select a subset of extreme points the large set of indices was reduced by pca to a small set that still contains most of the information of the original set the reduced set of etccdi indices was employed in the qh rdp algorithm to identify a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections it is noteworthy that the selected ensemble is the smallest gcm ensemble that preserves a full spread of the projections table 1 shows the identified twelve cmip6 climate projections that fully capture a range of the etccdi changes driven by the 41 cmip6 climate projections for alberta consisting of four ssp123 forced scenarios one ssp245 forced scenario four ssp370 forced scenarios and three ssp585 forced scenarios the selected twelve cmip6 climate projections were employed to assess climate change impacts on the climate indices in alberta 2 3 multivariate statistical downscaling method climate data statistically or dynamically downscaled are employed into domain specific models that require multiple hydro climate variables as input data as a univariate method conducts spatial downscaling and bias correction for each climate variable individually abatzoglou and brown 2012 eum and cannon 2017 hidalgo et al 2008 hwang and graham 2013 wood et al 2004 the univariate method has a challenge to correct inter dependence between hydro climate variables to improve the performance of impact models the inter dependence between hydro climate variables e g precipitation and temperature plays an important role in hydrologic processes in cold regions for instance the separation of rain and snow from precipitation entirely depends on precipitation and temperature while snow accumulation is mutually dependent on solar radiation wind and relative humidity as well as precipitation and temperature thus multivariate bias correction mbc algorithms have been actively introduced in climate change studies to bias correct the multivariate dependence structure of gcm outputs bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 guo et al 2019 li et al 2014 vrac and friederichs 2015 eum et al 2020 proposed an alternative mbc method that combines the quantile delta method qdm cannon et al 2015 with a distribution free shuffle approach iman and conover 1982 called mbcds as the mbcds method employs the gaussian rank correlation of transformed matrices by the van der waerden scores guo et al 2019 an iterative process is not necessary to improve multivariate gaussianity cannon 2016 2018 resulting in enhancing computational efficiency after spatially disaggregating gcm outputs to a target resolution by the inverse distance weighting method in the mbcds processes qdm is firstly applied to bias correct individual climate variables while preserving gcm driven climate signals cannon 2015 eum and cannon 2017 then the distribution free shuffle approach is implemented to reproduce the inter variable dependence structure including transforming the bias corrected values by the van der waerden scores decomposing the covariance matrix by the cholesky decomposition approach to calculate new score matrices with the upper triangular matrix and ordering the bias corrected values obtained by qdm according to the ordinal ranks of the new score matrices as proved in eum et al 2020 mbcds improved computational efficiency by up to 53 compared with existing mbc methods more details on mbcds can be found in eum et al 2020 in this study the mbcds method was applied to statistically bias correct the selected twelve cmip6 climate projections for daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature 2 4 future periods at specific levels of gmt change as gcms differently respond to the same ssp and the forcing pathways schleussner et al 2016 a trajectory of temperature change varies with individual gcms in other words all gcms project different periods that reach a specific level of gmt change refer to fig s 1 this study calculated the gmt change for a given year relative to the gmt of the pi period using a 30 year sliding window at the center of a given year for example gmt change in 2000 was calculated by the difference in gmt between the pi period and the 30 year window from 1985 to 2014 thus the gmt changes from 2085 to 2100 are a constant value because the same 30 year window is used to calculate the gmt change by the fact that the gmt projections are available only until 2100 in this way this study identified future 30 year periods that reach a specific gmt change level for the twelve representative cmip6 climate projections selected by the qh rdp algorithm as aforementioned the target gmt change of the paris agreement is 1 5 c and few cmip6 gcms projected gmt changes above 5 c this study identified future 30 year periods that reach gmt change levels of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c to evaluate the potential changes in the climate indices under gmt warming 2 5 analyses for the selected twelve cmip6 climate scenarios table 1 statistically downscaled by mbcds the change decade in annual mean temperature tnannual and txannual and total precipitation rannual was evaluated for the six nat regions in alberta during the historical 1950 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods furthermore the m k trend test for the projected tnannual txannual and rannual was also implemented at the 5 significance level in addition this study evaluated various climate indices categorized into two classes 1 univariate and 2 multivariate indices the univariate temperature and precipitation related climate indices shown in table 2 include the world meteorological organization s expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang et al 2011 and annual seasonal values for each variable i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature table 2 also includes the multivariate indices growing season length gsl diurnal temperature range dtr and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among the multivariate climate indices in table 2 the spei accounts for the monthly difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet to quantify water surplus or deficit over different time scales ranging from 1 month to 48 months this study estimated pet by a temperature based pet estimation method the hargreaves method that requires minimum and maximum temperature droogers and allen 2002 as the previous studies examining the spei have shown that the temperature based pet estimation methods are efficient to evaluate the spei influenced by the continental climate in north america where the correlation between temperature and radiation is evident beguería et al 2014 dibike et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010 in addition this study calculated the speis at 3 month spei 3 and 12 month spei 12 time scales to capture hydroclimatic conditions over the summer growing season ending in august and the water year ending in september respectively the spei is also useful to identify the severe drought periods based on predefined spei thresholds that correspond to a non exceeding probability for example the spei of 0 corresponds to 50 of non exceeding probability representing a normal water balance condition this study selected the spei values below 1 28 corresponding to less than 10 of non exceeding probability as a threshold to identify severe dry conditions bonsal and cuell 2017 dibike et al 2017 to quantify the impacts of gmt changes on all of the climate indices a non parametric method the mann kendall m k test kendall 1975 was applied as there is no necessity in assuming any probabilistic distributions and it is suitable for climatic and environmental variables jiang et al 2017 as the m k test is useful for the small size of time series it has been actively applied for determining the significance of a trend eum and cannon 2017 gobena and gan 2013 shrestha et al 2020 this study tested the significance of trend at a 5 significance level by the m k test with prewhitened time series to avoid the effects of serial correlation in nonparametric trend analysis nunifu et al 2019 razavi and vogel 2018 yue et al 2002 zhang and zwiers 2004 in addition the trend magnitude was estimated by the theil sen slope estimator that is defined as the median of all possible pairs for the whole dataset expressed by eq 1 1 β median y j y i j i i j 1 n where β is the estimated trend slope y j and y i are the ith and jth values in a time series and n is the length of y as the estimator β is not sensitive to outliers it provides a more accurate estimator than that of simple linear regression for skewed and heteroskedastic data thus the theil sen slope has been popularly used to estimate a linear trend as a non parametric approach hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 furthermore this study evaluated potential changes in the climate indices relative to the baseline period 1985 2014 for the future 30 year windows identified by the gmt change thresholds this estimator also enables us to quantify potential changes in response to 1 c gmt change i e change gmt which provides a guideline as to how the climate indices are sensitive to gmt warming 3 results 3 1 future 30 year windows under gmt warming thresholds given the gmt changes relative to the pi period 1850 1900 over the whole time horizon 1901 2100 for each climate scenario refer to fig s 1 in supplement this study identified future 30 year windows that reach 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c gmt changes for the selected twelve cmip6 climate projections as shown in table 3 the ensemble numbers of each gmt threshold varied with the combinations of gcm and ssp for example the climate projection of bcc csm2 mr under ssp126 reached up to only 2 c gmt change threshold while the climate projection of cnrm cm6 1 under ssp585 reached up to 5 c gmt change threshold accordingly all of the twelve climate projections reached 1 5 c and 2 c gmt change while only three ensemble members reached 5 c gmt change given different ensemble members this study evaluated potential changes in the climate indices to assess the effects of gmt warming in alberta in table 3 the central year of the 30 year periods averaged over the selected cmip6 climate projections for 1 5 c gmt change was 2019 while 2035 2059 2073 and 2077 for 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c gmt changes respectively it is noteworthy that the interval periods between the thresholds of gmt changes are shorter as gmt warming is stronger in particular cnrm cm6 1 under ssp585 projected the interval period of 18 years from 2 3 c while 11 years from 4 5 c 3 2 trends in historical and projected precipitation and temperature for the selected cmip6 climate scenarios the change decade in annual mean temperature tnannual and txannual and total precipitation rannual was evaluated for the six nat regions in alberta during the historical 1950 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods as shown in table 4 the ensemble mean range and agreement percentage of the change decade in tnannual txannual and rannual are presented for the selected cmip6 climate scenarios the range was defined by the minimum and maximum values of the change decade among the cmip6 climate scenarios the agreement percentage is calculated from the number of the cmip6 scenarios with a significant upward downward trend thus for example an upward trend with the agreement percentage of 100 indicates that all of the cmip6 climate scenarios project a significant upward trend a prominent increasing trend in temperature minimum and maximum during the historical period 1950 2014 were detected from the cmip6 historical scenarios which is consistent with the trends in the observed data refer to table s 2 the increasing trends were also intensified at a rapid rate during the future period in particular two times larger than those of the historical period across the nat regions with the largest change decade in the canadian shield it is noteworthy that all of the cmip6 gcms projected a significant increasing trend in temperature i e 100 agreement in all nat regions indicating that the temperature is likely to be increasing at a larger rate in the nat regions in alberta during the future period in contrast there is no significant trend in the annual precipitation in the foothills parkland and boreal forest during the historical period while only 1 or 2 climate scenarios i e 8 18 showed a significant trend at the rocky mountain grassland and canadian shield regions which is also consistent with the trends in the observed precipitation data that there is no significant increasing decreasing trend except for at the rocky mountain region refer to table s 2 the range of the change decade spread from negative decreasing to positive increasing values at all of the nat regions for the historical and future periods which illustrates a larger uncertainty in precipitation realizations and projections the ensemble mean of the cmip6 climate projections presented an increasing trend during the future period along with an increase in the agreement percentage 17 42 on a significant increasing trend in the annual precipitation illustrating that an increase in the annual precipitation is likely to be expected in alberta particularly more at the rocky mountain boreal forest and canadian shield regions i e high elevation or latitude regions in alberta fig 3 shows the evolution of annual mean minimum temperature tnannual and annual precipitation rannual during the historical and future periods since the trend in annual mean maximum temperature txannual is similar to that in tnannual the time series of only tnannual and rannual are presented in fig 3 the black line represents the observed data while the ensemble mean values for historical 1950 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods are represented by blue and red lines respectively the shaded envelope in fig 3 also illustrates the range of tnannual and rannual derived from the twelve cmip6 climate scenarios during the historical blue colored and future red colored periods the observed tnannual and rannual were within the shaded envelope during the historical period indicating that the cmip6 climate scenarios are bias corrected well subsequently may provide reliable climate information to evaluate potential changes under climate change furthermore the time series of tnannual in fig 3 a showed a prominent warming trend with a wider spread in the far future period i e a relatively larger uncertainty in the temperature projections during the far future while there were no distinct increasing decreasing trends in rannual at the nat regions in alberta 3 3 effects of gmt change on climate indices 3 3 1 climate indices at a grid scale the relative changes of the climate indices between the baseline period 1985 2014 and the identified 30 year time windows were evaluated to assess the effects of gmt changes on the temperature precipitation related and multivariate climate indices at all grid cells and the nat regions in alberta the results were derived from different ensemble members varying with the thresholds of gmt changes with the climate indices for the twelve cmip6 climate projections during the baseline period and the identified future 30 year windows this study calculated an ensemble mean of the relative changes in the climate indices at all grid cells and spatially averaged over all grid points within alberta refer to supplement table s 3 change gmt last column in table s 3 represents the slope of the relative change to the gmt changes i e a larger positive or negative change gmt indicates more sensitivity to gmt warming overall a prominent increase in the temperature related climate indices was projected under gmt warming while a moderate increase in the precipitation related climate indices it is also noteworthy that the drought indices spei 3 and spei 12 decreased proportionally to gmt warming although all of the climate indices investigated in this study provide fundamental information to detect climate change some of them showed less sensitivity to gmt changes i e insubstantial increasing decreasing trend and even a similar tendency with other indices among the full set of climate indices listed in table 1 thus this study selected a subset of the climate indices to efficiently detect the impacts of gmt changes at the nat regions in alberta

and sepi 12 for the multivariate climate indices in particular spring precipitation rmam was selected as it showed a relatively large change gmt and contributes to spring freshet and rain on snow ros that cause natural hazards e g floods in snow dominant watersheds in alberta 3 3 2 temperature related indices given the selected temperature related climate indices calculated at the nat regions for the selected twelve cmip6 climate scenarios the calculated climate indices from 1950 to 2100 were organized corresponding to the baseline 1985 2014 and the gmt warming 1 5 c to 5 c periods fig 4 illustrates potential changes in the temperature related climate indices at the nat regions under the gmt changes the spreads of box whisker plots were derived from the twelve cmip6 climate projections the median value of each climate index for the baseline period expressed by hist was presented by the red line while the median value of each box whisker plot was also presented to quantitatively evaluate potential changes in the climate indices under the gmt changes all of the temperature related climate indices showed a prominent warming trend in particular a relatively larger warming change between 2 c and 4 c was detected in all of the climate indices for example the change in tnn at grassland under the gmt change from 2 c to 3 c was 3 1 c from 32 5 c to 29 4 c while only 0 7 c from 27 2 c to 26 5 c under the gmt change from 4 c to 5 c indicating that alberta climate may be altered at an unprecedentedly rapid rate when the gmt change reaches between 2 c and 4 c it is also noteworthy that the annual mean minimum temperatures tnannual at the grassland and parkland regions the southern part of alberta were switched from a negative value to a positive value under the gmt warming of 3 c to 5 c resulting in a larger decrease in the frozen day fd which may lead to more rain phase precipitation on a wet day over a year under the gmt changes as shown in fig 4 the sensitivity to gmt warming varied with the climate indices and the nat regions thus it is essential to identify which climate indices are more sensitive and which sub regions in alberta are relatively vulnerable to gmt warming given the relative change above the baseline period under the gmt changes from 1 5 c to 5 c this study evaluated a slope of the relative change to the gmt change implying how the climate indices are responding to the gmt changes for example the slope of 2 c c for a climate index implies that the climate index is projected to increases by 2 c whenever gmt warms up 1 c indicating that the warming ratio of the climate index may be twice as fast as gmt warming in table 5 it is prominent that the slopes change gmt of cold temperature indices tnn and tndjf are larger than those of warm temperature indices txx and txjja for instance the slopes change gmt in tnn and txx at the canadian shield region are 2 88 c c and 1 05 c c respectively indicating that the gmt warming may contribute more considerably to warming the cold temperature climate indices in alberta although the change gmt varied with the nat regions the slopes in most maximum temperature related climate indices txx txannual and txjja are approximately proportional to the gmt change while a change gmt much larger than 1 c c in most minimum temperature related climate indices tnn tnannual and tndjf in particular the change gmt averaged over the nat regions for txx was 1 26 c c while 2 53 c c for tnn these results indicate that the minimum temperature related climate indices i e cold temperature indices are sensitive to gmt warming more than the maximum temperature related climate indices warm temperature indices especially the change gmt in tnn was twice as large as that in txx with regard to the nat regions the change gmt in the maximum temperature related climate indices su txx txannual and txjja at the grassland regions was relatively larger than in other nat regions while a relatively larger change gmt at the boreal forest and canadian shield regions for minimum temperature related climate indices fd tnn tnannual and tndjf these results indicate that the maximum temperature related climate indices in the southern part of alberta may be more sensitive to gmt warming while in the northern part of alberta for the minimum temperature related climate indices in the rocky mountain and foothills regions higher elevation areas in alberta most temperature related climate indices were less sensitive to the gmt change except for fd although a prominent warming trend was detected across the climate indices 3 3 3 precipitation related indices as for the temperature related climate indices this study calculated the selected precipitation related indices in the nat regions under the gmt changes as shown in fig 5 while there is no distinct increase in the annual precipitation rannual an increase in extreme precipitation events rx1day and r95ptot were projected under the gmt warming and also a larger increase under higher gmt are expected it is also noteworthy that a larger increase was detected at the rocky mountain and canadian shield regions among the seasonal precipitation rmam rjja and rdjf there is no distinct increasing decreasing trend in the winter precipitation rdjf however a considerable increase in the spring precipitation rmam was detected across the nat regions under the gmt changes while a minor decrease in the summer precipitation rjja was projected at the nat regions except for the canadian shield region table 6 illustrates the slope of the relative change to the gmt change for the precipitation related climate indices while a nat region with the largest slope varied with the climate indices a positive slope was detected in the nat regions for all of the precipitation related climate indices except for the summer precipitation rjja among them a relatively larger slope in r95ptot 8 77 mm c and rmam 5 82 mm c was found indicating that these precipitation related indices are more sensitive to the gmt warming in alberta it is also noteworthy that among the nat regions the largest slope in the summer precipitation rjja 3 79 mm c and the summer temperature txjja 1 34 c c at the grassland region which may lead to drier and warmer summer in the southern alberta region under the gmt warming a considerable negative slope decreasing in the summer precipitation was also detected at the high elevation region rocky mountain and foothills and the southern alberta region grassland and parkland while a positive slope increasing in the northern alberta region boreal forest and canadian shield 3 3 4 multivariate indices fig 6 illustrates the potential changes in the multivariate climate indices under the gmt changes as expected a prominent increase in gls was found in all of the nat regions ranging from 37 days to 55 days under the gmt change of 5 c relative to the baseline period with a larger increase at the rocky mountain and grassland regions while an increase in the annual precipitation rannual and mean temperatures txannual and tnannual was found a decrease in the spei 12 was detected in all nat regions in addition the slope of the spei 3 is also a negative decrease which is mainly driven by a decrease in the summer precipitation rjja and an increase in the summer temperature txjja fig 7 shows the evolution of the spei 3 and spei 12 over the whole period from 1950 to 2100 in the nat regions of alberta black blue and red lines represent the observed speis and the ensemble mean values of historical and projected speis respectively blue and red colored envelopes are a range of speis derived from the representative cmip6 climate scenarios following bonsal and cueil 2017 and dibike et al 2017 this study defined an extreme drought ed condition as below the spei of 1 24 which corresponds to less than 10 of the cumulative density function of the three parameter log logistic distribution a black dotted line in fig 7 represents the threshold of the ed conditions as expected from the results in fig 7 a downward trend in both the spei 3 and spei 12 can be found in all of the nat regions resulting in more frequent extreme drought conditions during the future period 2015 2100 relative to the historical period 1950 2014 table 7 also illustrates a slope of the relative change to the gmt change for the multivariate climate indices the largest slope was detected at the rocky mountain region the headwater area for most major watersheds in alberta for all of the multivariate climate indices indicating that the rocky mountain region is the most sensitive to the gmt changes to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of the gmt changes on the frequency of the extreme drought conditions the number of the ed events was counted for the spei 3 and spei 12 as shown in fig 8 it is prominent that a higher number of the ed conditions was projected in all of the nat regions under higher gmt changes with a larger increase in the rocky mountain grassland and parkland regions it is also notable that the ensemble mean values of the ed conditions in the canadian shield for the spei 3 and spei 12 were 4 3 and 4 5 respectively during the baseline period much larger than those in the other nat regions resulting in a decrease in the number of the ed conditions under the gmt changes this study also empirically calculated the return period of the ed for the spei 3 and spei 12 from the inverse of the ed number 30 year when two ed events are counted during the 30 year baseline period for example the return period becomes 15 year given the ensemble mean values of the ed numbers for the baseline and the gmt change periods the return periods were calculated for the nat regions as shown in table 8 during the baseline period the return period of extreme summer spei 3 and water year spei 12 droughts were 20 to 26 year and 33 to 36 year respectively in the middle and southern alberta i e rocky mountain foothills grassland and parkland while 7 to 17 year and 7 to 20 year in the northern alberta i e boreal forest and canadian shield under 1 5 c gmt change the return periods of the ed conditions in the middle and southern alberta considerably decreased by approximately half of the return period relative to those during the baseline period indicating the ed conditions may occur twice as frequent as the baseline period under 1 5 c gmt change it is also found that the return periods of the ed condition were shortened under the higher gmt changes especially 6 year on an average for the spei 3 and spei 12 under 5 c gmt change 4 summary and discussion this study suggested an integrated framework to assess climate change impacts under various projected gmt changes under cmip6 climate projections while selecting representative cmip6 climate projections in this study it is assumed that individual climate projections have the same likelihood in the future however it is also crucial to quantify the likelihood of climate projections in space and time based on a set of performance measures over the past eum et al 2012 fowler and ekström 2009 giorgi and mearns 2002 which may provide additional information on choosing more skillful gcms incorporating a set of cmip6 gcms pre screened based on the performance over a past period into the climate change framework more feasible climate projections can be systematically selected by a selection algorithm with less uncertainty in future climate conditions given the projected monthly global temperature this study identified the future 30 year windows that reach the thresholds of gmt warming of 1 5 5 c above the preindustrial period 1850 1900 the average central years of the 30 year windows for the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c were 2019 2035 2059 2073 and 2077 respectively thus the selected cmip6 gcms projected that gmt warming may exceed 1 5 c in near future the target gmt change of the paris agreement implying that it is crucial to proactively implement emission reduction strategies to mitigate the rate of gmt warming in addition the interval year to warm up every 1 c was shortened from 24 year from 2 c to 3 c to only 4 year from 4 c to 5 c based on the average central years of the 30 year windows for the gmt changes these results indicate that the rate of gmt change may be dramatically accelerated under higher gmt warming consequently it is necessary to limit the gmt change under 2 c to mitigate unexpected damages from the higher gmt warming given the slope of the relative change per gmt change change gmt for the temperature related climate indices in table 5 a slope larger than 1 0 c c was expected for all of the climate indices with the unit of celsius degree i e txx txannual txjja tnn tnannual and tndjf indicating that a rate of warming of the temperature related climate indices in alberta is larger than the gmt warming it is also noteworthy that the slope in the extreme warm and cold temperature indices i e txx and tnn was larger than those in annual and seasonal temperatures in particular the average slope of tnn coldest temperature in a year was 2 53 c c which represents that the warming rate of tnn is 2 5 times faster than gmt warming hayhoe and stoner 2019 projected about 3 0 c c for tnn which was estimated from gmt warming of 1 5 4 c under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 however the representative cmip6 climate projections selected in this study included more various socio economic and emission scenarios encompassing ssp126 to ssp585 to fully account for feasible future climate conditions nevertheless it is noteworthy that both studies showed a consistent larger warming trends in the coldest temperature of the year these results indicate that gmt warming has considerable impacts on extreme cold temperature events in alberta rain on snow ros events caused destructive and costly floods when substantial liquid rain phase precipitation falls on extensive snowcover li et al 2019 mccabe et al 2007 musselman et al 2018 most major watersheds in alberta are snow dominated regions where snow is substantially accumulated during winter and snowmelt considerably contributes to flows during subsequent spring and summer thus the risk of ros induced flooding in alberta may increase in response to changing trends in spring precipitation and temperature this study found that the slope of the spring precipitation rmam will increase by 5 82 mm c refer to table 6 at the same time an increase in the spring temperature txmam and tnmam in table s 3 was projected under the gmt changes these results indicate that more intense rain phase precipitation may occur during the spring season which may cause ros induced flooding more frequently in watersheds in alberta thus it is necessary to investigate the role of ros in ros related natural hazards e g flooding and avalanche under climate change and to identify snow dominated watersheds vulnerable to ros in alberta this study also found a relatively larger positive increase slope in the winter temperature tndjf and an increasing trend in the spring temperature which may cause a decrease in snow accumulation by more rain phase precipitation and earlier snowmelt the larger increasing trend in winter temperature is consistent with the previous studies in alberta hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 for example hayhoe and stoner 2019 projected about 2 0 c c for winter temperature while 1 5 c c for summer temperature in addition a decrease in the summer precipitation rjja was projected under the gmt warming in particular the largest decrease in rjja 3 79 mm c and increase in the summer temperature txjja 1 47 c c were detected at the grassland region given the potential decrease in snow contribution to river flows during the spring and summer seasons the decrease in the summer precipitation may cause challenges in water supply during the summer season over central and southern parts of alberta i e rocky mountain foothills parkland and grassland among them a more severe dry and hot summer under gmt warming was projected in the grassland region of southern alberta while a decrease in summer precipitation was projected in alberta the changes was not consistent over alberta i e an increase in boreal forest and canadian shield the little and inconsistent change in summer precipitation was also found in the work of hayhoe and stoner 2019 in table 4 the change in annual precipitation showed a wider range including negative to positive values while a consistent warming trend in temperature was projected from the selected cmip6 climate projections in other words the warming trend in temperature related indices is likely to occur in the future under all of feasible climate scenarios while the trend in precipitation is uncertain if it will be increasing or decreasing the previous studies also pointed out the higher uncertainties in precipitation projections in alberta hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 the uncertainties in climate projections are sourced from a model chain that mainly consists of emission forcing ssp rcp combinations in this study gcms and climate downscaling clark et al 2016 chen et al 2011 as aforementioned identifying a set of skillful gcms is necessary to exclude poor performance gcms as the uncertainties are mainly from the choice of gcms dobler et al 2012 kay et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 among them the selection of representative climate projections might be a key factor to reduce the uncertainties in climate projections as the potential changes may differ from a subset of representative climate projections thus one way to better deal with the higher uncertainty in precipitation sensitive regions i e much wider range of precipitation changes is that a new set of climate indices comprised of more precipitation related indices is employed in the selection process to identify more precipitation oriented representative climate projections rather than 27 etccdi indices used in this study the other way is that multivariate climate indices e g spei 3 or spei 12 are employed into the selection process to comprehensively take into account potential changes in study regions this study for example calculated drought indices spei 3 or spei 12 that require precipitation and temperature showing a consistent decreasing trend in response to the decrease in the summer precipitation and the increase in the summer temperature a negative decreasing slope in the spei 3 summer drought index was detected at all of the nat regions while an increasing trend i e a positive slope in both annual temperature txannual and tnannual and precipitation rannual was projected a negative decreasing slope in the sepi 12 was detected in all nat regions these results indicate that an increase in evapotranspiration driven by the temperature increase may be a dominant factor in determining a drought condition rather than the precipitation increases in alberta under the gmt changes it is noteworthy that among the nat region the largest negative slopes in the spei 3 and spei 12 occurred in the rocky mountain region headwater areas for major watersheds in alberta these results indicate that the water availability in the headwater regions of major watersheds will be considerably deteriorated by gmt warming which may cause more extreme water scarcity across downstream regions in alberta to quantitatively assess the impacts of the gmt changes on drought conditions this study also evaluated the frequency of the ed conditions for the summer spei 3 and water year spei 12 drought indices during the baseline period and future 30 year windows under the gmt changes as the ed threshold spei of 1 28 was defined from the non exceedance probability of 10 theoretically the return period of the ed conditions during the historical period from 1950 to 2014 is 10 year the return period in this study was empirically obtained from the inverse of the number of ed events over the 30 year baseline period and future 30 year windows under the gmt thresholds under the gmt changes the return years of the ed events were considerably shortened especially by 6 year on average for the spei 3 and spei 12 under 5 c gmt change which means that the summer and water year ed conditions may occur every six years total five times in 30 years under 5 c gmt change in other words the summer and water year ed events are likely to become more common in the nat regions under the gmt changes 5 conclusions this study suggested a comprehensive framework that comprised of selection of representative climate projections multivariate statistical downscaling and evaluation of climate change impacts on various climate indices under gmt warming of 1 5 5 c with the latest forty one cmip6 climate projections across ssp126 to ssp585 twelve representative cmip6 climate projections were identified for alberta by the quickhull ramper douglas peucker qh rdp algorithm a multivariate statistical downscaling method mbcds was applied to produce high resolution climate projections at 10 km resolution in alberta in addition this study identified 30 year time windows that reach the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c above the pre industrial period 1850 1900 to evaluate the impacts of gmt warming on temperature related precipitation related and multivariate climate indices at the nat regions in alberta the results showed that an interval term that warms up 1 c gmt was considerably shortened by only 5 years 2073 2077 from 4 c to 5 c while 24 years 2035 2059 to reach the gmt change from 2 c to 3 c this result indicates that the rate of gmt warming is likely to be drastically accelerated under a warmer gmt a significant and consistent warming trend in annual mean temperature txannual and tnannual was also projected by all of the selected cmip6 climate projections in all nat regions in alberta while there were no distinct increasing decreasing trends in annual precipitation rannual under the gmt warming a larger positive slope of the relative change to gmt change was detected in the cold temperature indices i e tnn and tndfj compared with those of the warm temperature indices i e txx and txjja specifically 2 53 c c on average for tnn while 1 26 c c for txx this results indicate that the cold temperature indices are more sensitive to the gmt warming in particular 2 5 times faster than the gmt warming for tnn in alberta regarding precipitation related indices a larger slope in rmam 5 82 mm c were projected along with an increase in the spring temperature under the gmt warming indicating more rain phase precipitation will be expected during the spring season which may cause more ros induced natural hazards in the nat regions of alberta a negative slope in rjja was projected in the central and southern nat regions of alberta in particular the largest negative slope in the grassland region in addition to a potential decrease in snow accumulation and earlier snow melting driven by an increase in the spring and winter temperature the decrease in the summer precipitation may cause a drier and warmer summer over central and southern parts of alberta among the six nat regions the largest negative slope in the spei under the gmt changes was observed in the rocky mountain region headwater areas of major watersheds in alberta causing a decrease in snow accumulation during winter and subsequent spring and summer flows these results indicate that the water availability in the headwater regions of major watersheds in alberta will be considerably threatened by gmt warming resulting in more water scarcity across downstream regions in alberta under the gmt warming the reoccurrence intervals of the summer and water year extreme drought ed were shortened drastically specifically the return period of 6 year on average for the spei 12 under 5 c gmt change these results indicate that the ed events are likely to occur more frequently and consequently become more common in the nat regions under the gmt changes this study produced a set of main hydro climate variables i e daily precipitation minimum maximum temperature and maximum temperature however more climate variables need to be produced by the mbcds technique to enhance the applicability of high resolution cmip6 climate projections for various impact models that usually require additional meteorological forcing data such as wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and solar radiation it is also necessary to employ the selected high resolution cmip6 climate projections into impact models to quantitatively assess the impacts of climate change on hydrologic and ecological systems in alberta furthermore the findings of this study e g projected more severe drought conditions in the headwater areas of major watersheds in alberta provide fundamental and useful information to not only identify vulnerable spots but also to develop adaptations to climate change for sustainable water resources management

7652,study region alberta province canada study focus the global average surface temperature has continuously warmed at an unprecedentedly rapid rate since the mid 20th century employing cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 climate projections this study suggested a comprehensive framework with state of the art techniques and evaluated potential changes in climate indices under the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c in alberta canada new hydrological insights for the region main finding of this study is that a significant warming trend in annual mean temperature was projected from all of the selected cmip6 climate projections in alberta while there was no distinct trend in annual precipitation under the gmt changes from 1 5 c to 5 c extreme cold temperature indices were warming at a larger rate in response to the gmt warming in particular the warming rate of the annual coldest minimum temperature in alberta was 2 5 times faster than gmt warming in addition a potential decrease in summer precipitation was projected under the gmt warming leading to a drier and warmer summer in the central and southern parts of alberta furthermore more extreme drought conditions were projected in alberta under the gmt warming indicating that the extreme drought conditions are likely to become more common in alberta along with the gmt warming graphical abstract ga1 keywords cmip6 global warming potential changes climate indices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global average surface temperature has continuously warmed since 1880 ipcc 2013 especially at an unprecedentedly rapid rate since the mid 20th century mainly due to human activities superimposed on natural variability wuebbles et al 2017 global warming has further caused long term changes in the climate system and subsequently resulted in substantial alterations in human and natural systems such as an increase in extreme climate events e g drought and flood sea level rise and huge impacts on arctic ecosystems ipcc 2015 mysiak et al 2016 global warming further has induced larger effects on climatology at regional or local scales for instance the annual average temperature on land in canada has warmed by 1 7 c since 1948 bush et al 2019 especially with a stronger warming trend in the north and west parts of canada vincent et al 2015 in particular alberta has various climate landscape and vegetation characteristics driven by diverse topographic characteristics ranging from high mountains to prairies natural regions committee 2006 thus the warming may result in profound effects on terrestrial and aquatic systems at different levels varying with the topographic characteristics in alberta in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 the latest climate projections derived from multiple global climate models gcms have been available to evaluate the impacts of climate change although the climate projections provide fundamental information to understand climate change impacts at a global scale direct applications of gcms outputs have been impeded at regional or local scales due to considerable biases mainly driven by a coarse resolution 100 km and imperfect physical parameters and processes bárdossy 1997 eum et al 2016 gutmann et al 2014 fowler et al 2007 sillmann et al 2013 therefore a downscaling technique has been incorporated into impact studies not only to refine spatial resolution but also to remove biases in gcms outputs cannon et al 2015 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 maurer and hidalgo 2008 wood et al 2004 among two main downscaling categories i e dynamical and statistical approaches in the literature many studies have actively applied statistical downscaling techniques that provide a computationally efficient way to reproduce important statistics of locally observed climate data abatzoglou and brown 2012 cannon et al 2016 eum and cannon 2017 hwang and graham 2013 stoner et al 2013 as prior studies concluded that a non parametric approach e g quantile mapping qm outperforms parametric approaches with regard to removing systematic biases in gcms outputs gudmundsson et al 2012 many qm based approaches were progressively developed to avoid unintended distortion of gcm driven climate signals in essential statistics and extremes bürger et al 2013 cannon et al 2015 however the qm based techniques are a univariate approach that is usually implemented for individual climate variables regardless of biases in inter variables dependence thus multivariate statistical downscaling methods were proposed to improve the inter variables dependence between hydro climate variables cannon 2016 guo et al 2019 li et al 2010 vrac and friederichs 2015 particularly the multivariate downscaling methods considerably improved snow related processes by better representing precipitation phases i e rain mix and snow phases which are mainly determined by inter variable dependence between precipitation and temperature meyer et al 2019 eum et al 2020 proposed a multivariate bias correction combined with a distribution free shuffle approach mbcds that preserves gcm driven long term trends and the inter dependence between hydro climate variables specifically mbcds outperformed not only hydrologic processes affected by multiple climate variables e g snow related processes but also computational efficiency by directly incorporating the gaussian rank correlation between climate variables instead of an iterative procedure that is usually employed to improve the multivariate gaussianity in multivariate statistical downscaling methods cannon 2018 incorporating the mbcds method this study produced high resolution cmip6 climate projections for the alberta province canada as a large number of cmip6 climate projections are available most impact studies are likely to include as many projections as possible to take into account the uncertainty in future climate conditions however it is not practical to include all of the climate projections available for impact studies e g hydrologic and ecologic modeling due to crucial constraints such as time labor and computational burden cannon 2015 seo et al 2019 alternatively it is more pragmatic to systematically select a subset of representative climate projections that capture a full range of projected future changes farjad et al 2019 suggested a novel geometric algorithm to select representative climate scenarios for various spatial scales e g sub continental regional and local scales this study also applied the same approach to identify a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections to be statistically downscaled by applying mbcds for the alberta province many studies have actively investigated hydroclimatic variability and potential climate change impacts in alberta hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 masud et al 2017 the majority of the previous studies have paid attention to potential changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme climate events between baseline historical and future periods for example the special report on emission scenarios sres of cmip phase 3 cmip3 meehl et al 2007 projected a 20 and 4 4 c increase in winter precipitation and temperature respectively in the late twenty first century from a baseline period jiang et al 2017 after the paris agreement that aims not only to keep the global mean temperature gmt below 2 c above pre industrial levels but also to limit the gmt increase further to 1 5 c many scientific communities have investigated the potential impacts of gmt warming of 1 5 c and higher levels of warming at a global scale allen et al 2019 furthermore the local impacts of the gmt change at various levels of warming e g 1 5 4 c have also been evaluated to assess vulnerability to gmt warming jeong et al 2019 shrestha et al 2020 in particular hayhoe and stoner 2019 have examined potential changes in alberta under gmt changes of 1 c 1 5 c 2 c 3 c and 4 c which have been driven by the cmip phase 5 cmip5 climate projections they concluded that a 2 c increase in winter temperature was projected under 1 5 c gmt change while 6 8 c under 4 c gmt change indicating that a temperature warming rate in alberta might be larger than a gmt warming rate most of the previous studies evaluated potential changes in climate under global warming based on all combinations of gcm projections available in a repository for example hayhoe and stoner 2019 were based on 20 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 i e total 40 climate projections as aforementioned however it is not practical to apply the 40 climate projections but only a subset of the climate projections might likely be employed into impact studies depending on the aim of studies human resources and computational burden of selected impact modes resulting in inconsistent climate change impact assessment in addition most previous studies employed univariate statistical downscaling methods which may cause unexpected biases in hydrologic and ecological projections derived from interactions between multiple climate variables at a watershed scale given the up to date cmip6 climate projections furthermore it is of the utmost important to understand how sensitively local climate responses to gmt warming especially sub regions delineated by climatic and topographic characteristics in alberta thus this study proposed a framework comprised of state of the art techniques for consistent and more reliable climate change impact assessment at a local scale under the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c driven by the latest cmip6 climate projections note that this study examined only potential changes in various climate indices at a local scale under gmt warming through the framework thus the framework proposed in this study is comprised of the following tasks a selecting a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections to capture a full range of potential changes in extreme climate indices b identifying future 30 year windows that reach the thresholds of gcm warming from 1 5 c to 5 c relative to the pre industrial pi period from 1850 to 1900 ipcc 2018 c applying the mbcds method for the selected representative cmip6 climate projections to produce high resolution cmip6 climate projections and d evaluating potential changes and trends in various climate indices to investigate the impacts of climate change under the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c the framework can be also applicable for other regions under a new subset of representative climate projections thus the aims of this study are to 1 propose a comprehensive framework for climate change impact assessment 2 examine trends in essential climate variables precipitation and temperature in this study and 3 quantitatively evaluate the impacts of gmt warming on various climate indices in alberta 2 method 2 1 study domain and climate data 2 1 1 natural sub region in alberta alberta has very diverse terrain in north america such as mountains foothills and plains the topographical characteristics affect ecologic systems at different levels of solar and climatic influences furthermore climatic and physiographic patterns determine vegetation and soil distributions in other words the interaction of attributes between atmosphere and land plays a crucial role in delineating ecological land classification while ecozones ecoregions and ecodistricts have been delineated at a national scale the alberta environmental protection 1994 defined natural nat regions based on climate physiographic vegetation soil wildlife and land use which is comprised of six natural nat regions in alberta as shown in fig 1 i e rocky mountain foothills grassland parkland boreal forest and canadian shield it is noteworthy that the nat is recognized as a provincial ecological unit for sustainable resources management natural regions committee 2006 along with global warming climate and ecological conditions may be altered at different levels corresponding to the level of gmt warming in particular changes in hydroclimate variables e g precipitation and temperature may cause an alteration in atmospheric conditions water cycle and water availability that influences socio economic systems therefore understanding climate change impacts in the nat regions is essential for developing sustainable resources management and adaptations to climate change with spatially averaged gridded climate data within the nat regions this study evaluated changes in various climate indices under different levels of gmt warming from 1 5 c to 5 c 2 1 2 historical observed data as the station density is not evenly distributed over alberta especially much lower in western mountainous and northern parts of alberta the observational station data may provide inconsistent accuracy and data length depending on network density in and around a study domain therefore science communities have actively applied gridded climate datasets that provide consistent long term climate data at a regular spacing resolution which is useful for intercomparison and impact studies eum et al 2014 wong et al 2017 islam and déry 2017 werner and cannon 2016 although a number of high resolution gridded climate datasets have been produced from station based hutchinson et al 2009 werner et al 2019 multiple source based lespinas et al 2015 and reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 datasets impact studies have suffered from inconsistencies in spatial accuracies period of record number of climate variables and spatial coverage for large scale modeling studies in particular multiple gridded climate datasets have been combined to cover all climate variables and intended simulation period over entire study domains without evaluating the performance of individual climate datasets subsequently it often results in assembling a poor forcing dataset which leads to unexpected and misleading modeling outputs for impact studies faramarzi et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 eum and gupta 2019 proposed a framework called reference reliability evaluation system refres which systematically ranks multiple climate datasets available within a study area based on various performance measures and generates a hybrid climate dataset daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature for the study region by extracting the best available data based on the ranking from multiple candidates more details on the refres and the hybrid climate dataset can be found in eum and gupta 2019 the hybrid climate dataset prepared in 2019 has been updated by extending the spatial domain to cover the portions of river basins in adjacent provinces as shown in fig 2 and the temporal period until 2019 accordingly the hybrid climate dataset now provides daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature from 1950 to 2019 at 10 km spatial resolution total of 19 700 grid cells within the spatial boundary in fig 2 this study employed the hybrid climate dataset as an observed climate dataset to be incorporated into the multivariate statistical downscaling method i e mbcds 2 1 3 cmip6 climate projections a working group of climate and ocean variability predictability and change clivar part of the world climate research program has established the coupled model intercomparison project cmip not only to provide multiple climate model outputs but also to intercompare the performance of climate models cmip has evolved over five phases since 1995 and become a major international multi model research activity in cmip1 and cmip2 for example the experimental designs were very simple that there were no interannual changes in radiative forcing while atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration increased at a rate of 1 per year meehl et al 2000 in cmip3 and cmip5 more diverse climate scenarios have been projected under the special report on emissions scenarios sres meehl et al 2007 and representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 the cmip3 and cmip5 climate projections were publicly available resulting in an explosion of scientific outcomes derived from multiple gcms and impact models at diverse spatial scales stouffer et al 2017 cmip is currently in phase 6 cmip6 to produce the latest climate data derived from state of the art climate models which will be fundamental climate information for the ipcc 6th assessment report eyring et al 2016 many scientific communities are putting greater efforts into validating advances in cmip6 by intercomparison mainly between cmip5 and cmip6 their studies proved that cmip6 has added values to indian summer monsoon rainfall gusain et al 2020 and extreme precipitation and temperature chen et al 2021 kim et al 2020 compared to cmip5 cmip6 introduced a parallel approach that consists of cmip5 rcps and alternative shared socioeconomic pathways ssps moss et al 2010 in other words new cmip6 climate projections have been produced to reflect the combined effects of future climate and socio economic changes o neill et al 2017 in cmip6 five alternative ssps have been developed to describe the main characteristics in demographic human development economy institution technology and environment o neill et al 2017 for example ssp1 represents a societal scenario that achieves green growth and a green economy while ssp5 assumes an energy intensive fossil based economy more details on ssps are found in o neill et al 2017 the combinations of ssp and rcps are represented by sspxy where x and y are the specific ssp and the forcing pathway i e global average radiative forcing level respectively for example ssp585 represents a combination of ssp5 and rcp8 5 this study compiled cmip6 projections that provide 1 historical 1850 2014 and 2 future 2015 2100 scenarios forced by the ssp rcp combinations for three climate variables i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature at the daily time scale among the combinations of ssps and rcps this study compiled climate projections forced by ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 this study compiled twelve historical runs and forty one cmip6 climate projections driven by twelve gcms refer to table s 1 while all of gcms provide historical climate scenarios from 1850 to 2014 not all gcms produce the four ssp rcp climate projections in summary a total of twelve historical runs and forty one climate projections were collected and clipped for the spatial domain of the hybrid climate data eum and gupta 2019 as shown in fig 2 all of the collected cmip6 climate data were interpolated to the grid cells of the hybrid climate data 19 700 grid cells using the inverse distance method for further statistical downscaling 2 2 selection of a subset of cmip6 climate projections for alberta it has been widely recommended to use outputs from multiple gcms with different forcing scenarios to capture climate variabilities and uncertainties in climate projections however sufficient resources are seldom available for downscaling a large number of gcms as the number of available gcms has increased at a rapid pace over the past decades in impact studies that implement domain specific numerical models the computational cost is further expensive to fully employ all gcm outputs available in a data repository moreover it is always neither feasible nor practical to include as many climate projections as possible mainly due to the computational burden and limited resources to address this limitation an integrated geometry algorithm quickhull ramper douglas peucker qh rdp farjad et al 2019 was used to identify a subset of representative gcm scenarios that cover the spread of projections the quickhull algorithm provides a convex hull that covers extreme points for a high dimensional dataset however the identified convex hull may not cover a range of extreme points when a user defines a specific number of gcm scenarios thus the quickhull was integrated with the rdp algorithm that identifies a simplified convex hull by filtering out less prominent scenarios for a given number of gcm scenarios the selection of representative gcm scenarios is comprised of the following steps 1 reducing the data dimension etccdi indices using principal component analysis pca 2 capturing the extreme points of the reduced dimension data set using the quickhull algorithm 3 capturing the most prominent extreme gcms using the ramer douglas peucker algorithm and 4 validating the conservation of the projection spread these steps are described in detail in farjad et al 2019 this study spatially averaged daily precipitation and temperature over alberta to produce a single time series to calculate all etccdi for the 41 cmip6 climate projections compiled in this study refer to table s 1 then relative changes in all etccdis between the baseline 1986 2014 and far future 2071 2100 periods were evaluated to be applied for the qh rdp approach to select a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections for alberta as a higher level of dimension comes with the more complicated problem to efficiently select a subset of extreme points the large set of indices was reduced by pca to a small set that still contains most of the information of the original set the reduced set of etccdi indices was employed in the qh rdp algorithm to identify a subset of representative cmip6 climate projections it is noteworthy that the selected ensemble is the smallest gcm ensemble that preserves a full spread of the projections table 1 shows the identified twelve cmip6 climate projections that fully capture a range of the etccdi changes driven by the 41 cmip6 climate projections for alberta consisting of four ssp123 forced scenarios one ssp245 forced scenario four ssp370 forced scenarios and three ssp585 forced scenarios the selected twelve cmip6 climate projections were employed to assess climate change impacts on the climate indices in alberta 2 3 multivariate statistical downscaling method climate data statistically or dynamically downscaled are employed into domain specific models that require multiple hydro climate variables as input data as a univariate method conducts spatial downscaling and bias correction for each climate variable individually abatzoglou and brown 2012 eum and cannon 2017 hidalgo et al 2008 hwang and graham 2013 wood et al 2004 the univariate method has a challenge to correct inter dependence between hydro climate variables to improve the performance of impact models the inter dependence between hydro climate variables e g precipitation and temperature plays an important role in hydrologic processes in cold regions for instance the separation of rain and snow from precipitation entirely depends on precipitation and temperature while snow accumulation is mutually dependent on solar radiation wind and relative humidity as well as precipitation and temperature thus multivariate bias correction mbc algorithms have been actively introduced in climate change studies to bias correct the multivariate dependence structure of gcm outputs bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 guo et al 2019 li et al 2014 vrac and friederichs 2015 eum et al 2020 proposed an alternative mbc method that combines the quantile delta method qdm cannon et al 2015 with a distribution free shuffle approach iman and conover 1982 called mbcds as the mbcds method employs the gaussian rank correlation of transformed matrices by the van der waerden scores guo et al 2019 an iterative process is not necessary to improve multivariate gaussianity cannon 2016 2018 resulting in enhancing computational efficiency after spatially disaggregating gcm outputs to a target resolution by the inverse distance weighting method in the mbcds processes qdm is firstly applied to bias correct individual climate variables while preserving gcm driven climate signals cannon 2015 eum and cannon 2017 then the distribution free shuffle approach is implemented to reproduce the inter variable dependence structure including transforming the bias corrected values by the van der waerden scores decomposing the covariance matrix by the cholesky decomposition approach to calculate new score matrices with the upper triangular matrix and ordering the bias corrected values obtained by qdm according to the ordinal ranks of the new score matrices as proved in eum et al 2020 mbcds improved computational efficiency by up to 53 compared with existing mbc methods more details on mbcds can be found in eum et al 2020 in this study the mbcds method was applied to statistically bias correct the selected twelve cmip6 climate projections for daily precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature 2 4 future periods at specific levels of gmt change as gcms differently respond to the same ssp and the forcing pathways schleussner et al 2016 a trajectory of temperature change varies with individual gcms in other words all gcms project different periods that reach a specific level of gmt change refer to fig s 1 this study calculated the gmt change for a given year relative to the gmt of the pi period using a 30 year sliding window at the center of a given year for example gmt change in 2000 was calculated by the difference in gmt between the pi period and the 30 year window from 1985 to 2014 thus the gmt changes from 2085 to 2100 are a constant value because the same 30 year window is used to calculate the gmt change by the fact that the gmt projections are available only until 2100 in this way this study identified future 30 year periods that reach a specific gmt change level for the twelve representative cmip6 climate projections selected by the qh rdp algorithm as aforementioned the target gmt change of the paris agreement is 1 5 c and few cmip6 gcms projected gmt changes above 5 c this study identified future 30 year periods that reach gmt change levels of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c to evaluate the potential changes in the climate indices under gmt warming 2 5 analyses for the selected twelve cmip6 climate scenarios table 1 statistically downscaled by mbcds the change decade in annual mean temperature tnannual and txannual and total precipitation rannual was evaluated for the six nat regions in alberta during the historical 1950 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods furthermore the m k trend test for the projected tnannual txannual and rannual was also implemented at the 5 significance level in addition this study evaluated various climate indices categorized into two classes 1 univariate and 2 multivariate indices the univariate temperature and precipitation related climate indices shown in table 2 include the world meteorological organization s expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang et al 2011 and annual seasonal values for each variable i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature table 2 also includes the multivariate indices growing season length gsl diurnal temperature range dtr and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among the multivariate climate indices in table 2 the spei accounts for the monthly difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet to quantify water surplus or deficit over different time scales ranging from 1 month to 48 months this study estimated pet by a temperature based pet estimation method the hargreaves method that requires minimum and maximum temperature droogers and allen 2002 as the previous studies examining the spei have shown that the temperature based pet estimation methods are efficient to evaluate the spei influenced by the continental climate in north america where the correlation between temperature and radiation is evident beguería et al 2014 dibike et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010 in addition this study calculated the speis at 3 month spei 3 and 12 month spei 12 time scales to capture hydroclimatic conditions over the summer growing season ending in august and the water year ending in september respectively the spei is also useful to identify the severe drought periods based on predefined spei thresholds that correspond to a non exceeding probability for example the spei of 0 corresponds to 50 of non exceeding probability representing a normal water balance condition this study selected the spei values below 1 28 corresponding to less than 10 of non exceeding probability as a threshold to identify severe dry conditions bonsal and cuell 2017 dibike et al 2017 to quantify the impacts of gmt changes on all of the climate indices a non parametric method the mann kendall m k test kendall 1975 was applied as there is no necessity in assuming any probabilistic distributions and it is suitable for climatic and environmental variables jiang et al 2017 as the m k test is useful for the small size of time series it has been actively applied for determining the significance of a trend eum and cannon 2017 gobena and gan 2013 shrestha et al 2020 this study tested the significance of trend at a 5 significance level by the m k test with prewhitened time series to avoid the effects of serial correlation in nonparametric trend analysis nunifu et al 2019 razavi and vogel 2018 yue et al 2002 zhang and zwiers 2004 in addition the trend magnitude was estimated by the theil sen slope estimator that is defined as the median of all possible pairs for the whole dataset expressed by eq 1 1 β median y j y i j i i j 1 n where β is the estimated trend slope y j and y i are the ith and jth values in a time series and n is the length of y as the estimator β is not sensitive to outliers it provides a more accurate estimator than that of simple linear regression for skewed and heteroskedastic data thus the theil sen slope has been popularly used to estimate a linear trend as a non parametric approach hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 furthermore this study evaluated potential changes in the climate indices relative to the baseline period 1985 2014 for the future 30 year windows identified by the gmt change thresholds this estimator also enables us to quantify potential changes in response to 1 c gmt change i e change gmt which provides a guideline as to how the climate indices are sensitive to gmt warming 3 results 3 1 future 30 year windows under gmt warming thresholds given the gmt changes relative to the pi period 1850 1900 over the whole time horizon 1901 2100 for each climate scenario refer to fig s 1 in supplement this study identified future 30 year windows that reach 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c gmt changes for the selected twelve cmip6 climate projections as shown in table 3 the ensemble numbers of each gmt threshold varied with the combinations of gcm and ssp for example the climate projection of bcc csm2 mr under ssp126 reached up to only 2 c gmt change threshold while the climate projection of cnrm cm6 1 under ssp585 reached up to 5 c gmt change threshold accordingly all of the twelve climate projections reached 1 5 c and 2 c gmt change while only three ensemble members reached 5 c gmt change given different ensemble members this study evaluated potential changes in the climate indices to assess the effects of gmt warming in alberta in table 3 the central year of the 30 year periods averaged over the selected cmip6 climate projections for 1 5 c gmt change was 2019 while 2035 2059 2073 and 2077 for 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c gmt changes respectively it is noteworthy that the interval periods between the thresholds of gmt changes are shorter as gmt warming is stronger in particular cnrm cm6 1 under ssp585 projected the interval period of 18 years from 2 3 c while 11 years from 4 5 c 3 2 trends in historical and projected precipitation and temperature for the selected cmip6 climate scenarios the change decade in annual mean temperature tnannual and txannual and total precipitation rannual was evaluated for the six nat regions in alberta during the historical 1950 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods as shown in table 4 the ensemble mean range and agreement percentage of the change decade in tnannual txannual and rannual are presented for the selected cmip6 climate scenarios the range was defined by the minimum and maximum values of the change decade among the cmip6 climate scenarios the agreement percentage is calculated from the number of the cmip6 scenarios with a significant upward downward trend thus for example an upward trend with the agreement percentage of 100 indicates that all of the cmip6 climate scenarios project a significant upward trend a prominent increasing trend in temperature minimum and maximum during the historical period 1950 2014 were detected from the cmip6 historical scenarios which is consistent with the trends in the observed data refer to table s 2 the increasing trends were also intensified at a rapid rate during the future period in particular two times larger than those of the historical period across the nat regions with the largest change decade in the canadian shield it is noteworthy that all of the cmip6 gcms projected a significant increasing trend in temperature i e 100 agreement in all nat regions indicating that the temperature is likely to be increasing at a larger rate in the nat regions in alberta during the future period in contrast there is no significant trend in the annual precipitation in the foothills parkland and boreal forest during the historical period while only 1 or 2 climate scenarios i e 8 18 showed a significant trend at the rocky mountain grassland and canadian shield regions which is also consistent with the trends in the observed precipitation data that there is no significant increasing decreasing trend except for at the rocky mountain region refer to table s 2 the range of the change decade spread from negative decreasing to positive increasing values at all of the nat regions for the historical and future periods which illustrates a larger uncertainty in precipitation realizations and projections the ensemble mean of the cmip6 climate projections presented an increasing trend during the future period along with an increase in the agreement percentage 17 42 on a significant increasing trend in the annual precipitation illustrating that an increase in the annual precipitation is likely to be expected in alberta particularly more at the rocky mountain boreal forest and canadian shield regions i e high elevation or latitude regions in alberta fig 3 shows the evolution of annual mean minimum temperature tnannual and annual precipitation rannual during the historical and future periods since the trend in annual mean maximum temperature txannual is similar to that in tnannual the time series of only tnannual and rannual are presented in fig 3 the black line represents the observed data while the ensemble mean values for historical 1950 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods are represented by blue and red lines respectively the shaded envelope in fig 3 also illustrates the range of tnannual and rannual derived from the twelve cmip6 climate scenarios during the historical blue colored and future red colored periods the observed tnannual and rannual were within the shaded envelope during the historical period indicating that the cmip6 climate scenarios are bias corrected well subsequently may provide reliable climate information to evaluate potential changes under climate change furthermore the time series of tnannual in fig 3 a showed a prominent warming trend with a wider spread in the far future period i e a relatively larger uncertainty in the temperature projections during the far future while there were no distinct increasing decreasing trends in rannual at the nat regions in alberta 3 3 effects of gmt change on climate indices 3 3 1 climate indices at a grid scale the relative changes of the climate indices between the baseline period 1985 2014 and the identified 30 year time windows were evaluated to assess the effects of gmt changes on the temperature precipitation related and multivariate climate indices at all grid cells and the nat regions in alberta the results were derived from different ensemble members varying with the thresholds of gmt changes with the climate indices for the twelve cmip6 climate projections during the baseline period and the identified future 30 year windows this study calculated an ensemble mean of the relative changes in the climate indices at all grid cells and spatially averaged over all grid points within alberta refer to supplement table s 3 change gmt last column in table s 3 represents the slope of the relative change to the gmt changes i e a larger positive or negative change gmt indicates more sensitivity to gmt warming overall a prominent increase in the temperature related climate indices was projected under gmt warming while a moderate increase in the precipitation related climate indices it is also noteworthy that the drought indices spei 3 and spei 12 decreased proportionally to gmt warming although all of the climate indices investigated in this study provide fundamental information to detect climate change some of them showed less sensitivity to gmt changes i e insubstantial increasing decreasing trend and even a similar tendency with other indices among the full set of climate indices listed in table 1 thus this study selected a subset of the climate indices to efficiently detect the impacts of gmt changes at the nat regions in alberta 1 su txx txannual txjja fd tnn tnannual and tndjf for the temperature related climate indices 2 rx1day r95ptot rannual rmam rjja and rdjf for the precipitation related climate indices and 3 gsl spei 3 and sepi 12 for the multivariate climate indices in particular spring precipitation rmam was selected as it showed a relatively large change gmt and contributes to spring freshet and rain on snow ros that cause natural hazards e g floods in snow dominant watersheds in alberta 3 3 2 temperature related indices given the selected temperature related climate indices calculated at the nat regions for the selected twelve cmip6 climate scenarios the calculated climate indices from 1950 to 2100 were organized corresponding to the baseline 1985 2014 and the gmt warming 1 5 c to 5 c periods fig 4 illustrates potential changes in the temperature related climate indices at the nat regions under the gmt changes the spreads of box whisker plots were derived from the twelve cmip6 climate projections the median value of each climate index for the baseline period expressed by hist was presented by the red line while the median value of each box whisker plot was also presented to quantitatively evaluate potential changes in the climate indices under the gmt changes all of the temperature related climate indices showed a prominent warming trend in particular a relatively larger warming change between 2 c and 4 c was detected in all of the climate indices for example the change in tnn at grassland under the gmt change from 2 c to 3 c was 3 1 c from 32 5 c to 29 4 c while only 0 7 c from 27 2 c to 26 5 c under the gmt change from 4 c to 5 c indicating that alberta climate may be altered at an unprecedentedly rapid rate when the gmt change reaches between 2 c and 4 c it is also noteworthy that the annual mean minimum temperatures tnannual at the grassland and parkland regions the southern part of alberta were switched from a negative value to a positive value under the gmt warming of 3 c to 5 c resulting in a larger decrease in the frozen day fd which may lead to more rain phase precipitation on a wet day over a year under the gmt changes as shown in fig 4 the sensitivity to gmt warming varied with the climate indices and the nat regions thus it is essential to identify which climate indices are more sensitive and which sub regions in alberta are relatively vulnerable to gmt warming given the relative change above the baseline period under the gmt changes from 1 5 c to 5 c this study evaluated a slope of the relative change to the gmt change implying how the climate indices are responding to the gmt changes for example the slope of 2 c c for a climate index implies that the climate index is projected to increases by 2 c whenever gmt warms up 1 c indicating that the warming ratio of the climate index may be twice as fast as gmt warming in table 5 it is prominent that the slopes change gmt of cold temperature indices tnn and tndjf are larger than those of warm temperature indices txx and txjja for instance the slopes change gmt in tnn and txx at the canadian shield region are 2 88 c c and 1 05 c c respectively indicating that the gmt warming may contribute more considerably to warming the cold temperature climate indices in alberta although the change gmt varied with the nat regions the slopes in most maximum temperature related climate indices txx txannual and txjja are approximately proportional to the gmt change while a change gmt much larger than 1 c c in most minimum temperature related climate indices tnn tnannual and tndjf in particular the change gmt averaged over the nat regions for txx was 1 26 c c while 2 53 c c for tnn these results indicate that the minimum temperature related climate indices i e cold temperature indices are sensitive to gmt warming more than the maximum temperature related climate indices warm temperature indices especially the change gmt in tnn was twice as large as that in txx with regard to the nat regions the change gmt in the maximum temperature related climate indices su txx txannual and txjja at the grassland regions was relatively larger than in other nat regions while a relatively larger change gmt at the boreal forest and canadian shield regions for minimum temperature related climate indices fd tnn tnannual and tndjf these results indicate that the maximum temperature related climate indices in the southern part of alberta may be more sensitive to gmt warming while in the northern part of alberta for the minimum temperature related climate indices in the rocky mountain and foothills regions higher elevation areas in alberta most temperature related climate indices were less sensitive to the gmt change except for fd although a prominent warming trend was detected across the climate indices 3 3 3 precipitation related indices as for the temperature related climate indices this study calculated the selected precipitation related indices in the nat regions under the gmt changes as shown in fig 5 while there is no distinct increase in the annual precipitation rannual an increase in extreme precipitation events rx1day and r95ptot were projected under the gmt warming and also a larger increase under higher gmt are expected it is also noteworthy that a larger increase was detected at the rocky mountain and canadian shield regions among the seasonal precipitation rmam rjja and rdjf there is no distinct increasing decreasing trend in the winter precipitation rdjf however a considerable increase in the spring precipitation rmam was detected across the nat regions under the gmt changes while a minor decrease in the summer precipitation rjja was projected at the nat regions except for the canadian shield region table 6 illustrates the slope of the relative change to the gmt change for the precipitation related climate indices while a nat region with the largest slope varied with the climate indices a positive slope was detected in the nat regions for all of the precipitation related climate indices except for the summer precipitation rjja among them a relatively larger slope in r95ptot 8 77 mm c and rmam 5 82 mm c was found indicating that these precipitation related indices are more sensitive to the gmt warming in alberta it is also noteworthy that among the nat regions the largest slope in the summer precipitation rjja 3 79 mm c and the summer temperature txjja 1 34 c c at the grassland region which may lead to drier and warmer summer in the southern alberta region under the gmt warming a considerable negative slope decreasing in the summer precipitation was also detected at the high elevation region rocky mountain and foothills and the southern alberta region grassland and parkland while a positive slope increasing in the northern alberta region boreal forest and canadian shield 3 3 4 multivariate indices fig 6 illustrates the potential changes in the multivariate climate indices under the gmt changes as expected a prominent increase in gls was found in all of the nat regions ranging from 37 days to 55 days under the gmt change of 5 c relative to the baseline period with a larger increase at the rocky mountain and grassland regions while an increase in the annual precipitation rannual and mean temperatures txannual and tnannual was found a decrease in the spei 12 was detected in all nat regions in addition the slope of the spei 3 is also a negative decrease which is mainly driven by a decrease in the summer precipitation rjja and an increase in the summer temperature txjja fig 7 shows the evolution of the spei 3 and spei 12 over the whole period from 1950 to 2100 in the nat regions of alberta black blue and red lines represent the observed speis and the ensemble mean values of historical and projected speis respectively blue and red colored envelopes are a range of speis derived from the representative cmip6 climate scenarios following bonsal and cueil 2017 and dibike et al 2017 this study defined an extreme drought ed condition as below the spei of 1 24 which corresponds to less than 10 of the cumulative density function of the three parameter log logistic distribution a black dotted line in fig 7 represents the threshold of the ed conditions as expected from the results in fig 7 a downward trend in both the spei 3 and spei 12 can be found in all of the nat regions resulting in more frequent extreme drought conditions during the future period 2015 2100 relative to the historical period 1950 2014 table 7 also illustrates a slope of the relative change to the gmt change for the multivariate climate indices the largest slope was detected at the rocky mountain region the headwater area for most major watersheds in alberta for all of the multivariate climate indices indicating that the rocky mountain region is the most sensitive to the gmt changes to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of the gmt changes on the frequency of the extreme drought conditions the number of the ed events was counted for the spei 3 and spei 12 as shown in fig 8 it is prominent that a higher number of the ed conditions was projected in all of the nat regions under higher gmt changes with a larger increase in the rocky mountain grassland and parkland regions it is also notable that the ensemble mean values of the ed conditions in the canadian shield for the spei 3 and spei 12 were 4 3 and 4 5 respectively during the baseline period much larger than those in the other nat regions resulting in a decrease in the number of the ed conditions under the gmt changes this study also empirically calculated the return period of the ed for the spei 3 and spei 12 from the inverse of the ed number 30 year when two ed events are counted during the 30 year baseline period for example the return period becomes 15 year given the ensemble mean values of the ed numbers for the baseline and the gmt change periods the return periods were calculated for the nat regions as shown in table 8 during the baseline period the return period of extreme summer spei 3 and water year spei 12 droughts were 20 to 26 year and 33 to 36 year respectively in the middle and southern alberta i e rocky mountain foothills grassland and parkland while 7 to 17 year and 7 to 20 year in the northern alberta i e boreal forest and canadian shield under 1 5 c gmt change the return periods of the ed conditions in the middle and southern alberta considerably decreased by approximately half of the return period relative to those during the baseline period indicating the ed conditions may occur twice as frequent as the baseline period under 1 5 c gmt change it is also found that the return periods of the ed condition were shortened under the higher gmt changes especially 6 year on an average for the spei 3 and spei 12 under 5 c gmt change 4 summary and discussion this study suggested an integrated framework to assess climate change impacts under various projected gmt changes under cmip6 climate projections while selecting representative cmip6 climate projections in this study it is assumed that individual climate projections have the same likelihood in the future however it is also crucial to quantify the likelihood of climate projections in space and time based on a set of performance measures over the past eum et al 2012 fowler and ekström 2009 giorgi and mearns 2002 which may provide additional information on choosing more skillful gcms incorporating a set of cmip6 gcms pre screened based on the performance over a past period into the climate change framework more feasible climate projections can be systematically selected by a selection algorithm with less uncertainty in future climate conditions given the projected monthly global temperature this study identified the future 30 year windows that reach the thresholds of gmt warming of 1 5 5 c above the preindustrial period 1850 1900 the average central years of the 30 year windows for the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c were 2019 2035 2059 2073 and 2077 respectively thus the selected cmip6 gcms projected that gmt warming may exceed 1 5 c in near future the target gmt change of the paris agreement implying that it is crucial to proactively implement emission reduction strategies to mitigate the rate of gmt warming in addition the interval year to warm up every 1 c was shortened from 24 year from 2 c to 3 c to only 4 year from 4 c to 5 c based on the average central years of the 30 year windows for the gmt changes these results indicate that the rate of gmt change may be dramatically accelerated under higher gmt warming consequently it is necessary to limit the gmt change under 2 c to mitigate unexpected damages from the higher gmt warming given the slope of the relative change per gmt change change gmt for the temperature related climate indices in table 5 a slope larger than 1 0 c c was expected for all of the climate indices with the unit of celsius degree i e txx txannual txjja tnn tnannual and tndjf indicating that a rate of warming of the temperature related climate indices in alberta is larger than the gmt warming it is also noteworthy that the slope in the extreme warm and cold temperature indices i e txx and tnn was larger than those in annual and seasonal temperatures in particular the average slope of tnn coldest temperature in a year was 2 53 c c which represents that the warming rate of tnn is 2 5 times faster than gmt warming hayhoe and stoner 2019 projected about 3 0 c c for tnn which was estimated from gmt warming of 1 5 4 c under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 however the representative cmip6 climate projections selected in this study included more various socio economic and emission scenarios encompassing ssp126 to ssp585 to fully account for feasible future climate conditions nevertheless it is noteworthy that both studies showed a consistent larger warming trends in the coldest temperature of the year these results indicate that gmt warming has considerable impacts on extreme cold temperature events in alberta rain on snow ros events caused destructive and costly floods when substantial liquid rain phase precipitation falls on extensive snowcover li et al 2019 mccabe et al 2007 musselman et al 2018 most major watersheds in alberta are snow dominated regions where snow is substantially accumulated during winter and snowmelt considerably contributes to flows during subsequent spring and summer thus the risk of ros induced flooding in alberta may increase in response to changing trends in spring precipitation and temperature this study found that the slope of the spring precipitation rmam will increase by 5 82 mm c refer to table 6 at the same time an increase in the spring temperature txmam and tnmam in table s 3 was projected under the gmt changes these results indicate that more intense rain phase precipitation may occur during the spring season which may cause ros induced flooding more frequently in watersheds in alberta thus it is necessary to investigate the role of ros in ros related natural hazards e g flooding and avalanche under climate change and to identify snow dominated watersheds vulnerable to ros in alberta this study also found a relatively larger positive increase slope in the winter temperature tndjf and an increasing trend in the spring temperature which may cause a decrease in snow accumulation by more rain phase precipitation and earlier snowmelt the larger increasing trend in winter temperature is consistent with the previous studies in alberta hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 for example hayhoe and stoner 2019 projected about 2 0 c c for winter temperature while 1 5 c c for summer temperature in addition a decrease in the summer precipitation rjja was projected under the gmt warming in particular the largest decrease in rjja 3 79 mm c and increase in the summer temperature txjja 1 47 c c were detected at the grassland region given the potential decrease in snow contribution to river flows during the spring and summer seasons the decrease in the summer precipitation may cause challenges in water supply during the summer season over central and southern parts of alberta i e rocky mountain foothills parkland and grassland among them a more severe dry and hot summer under gmt warming was projected in the grassland region of southern alberta while a decrease in summer precipitation was projected in alberta the changes was not consistent over alberta i e an increase in boreal forest and canadian shield the little and inconsistent change in summer precipitation was also found in the work of hayhoe and stoner 2019 in table 4 the change in annual precipitation showed a wider range including negative to positive values while a consistent warming trend in temperature was projected from the selected cmip6 climate projections in other words the warming trend in temperature related indices is likely to occur in the future under all of feasible climate scenarios while the trend in precipitation is uncertain if it will be increasing or decreasing the previous studies also pointed out the higher uncertainties in precipitation projections in alberta hayhoe and stoner 2019 jiang et al 2017 the uncertainties in climate projections are sourced from a model chain that mainly consists of emission forcing ssp rcp combinations in this study gcms and climate downscaling clark et al 2016 chen et al 2011 as aforementioned identifying a set of skillful gcms is necessary to exclude poor performance gcms as the uncertainties are mainly from the choice of gcms dobler et al 2012 kay et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 among them the selection of representative climate projections might be a key factor to reduce the uncertainties in climate projections as the potential changes may differ from a subset of representative climate projections thus one way to better deal with the higher uncertainty in precipitation sensitive regions i e much wider range of precipitation changes is that a new set of climate indices comprised of more precipitation related indices is employed in the selection process to identify more precipitation oriented representative climate projections rather than 27 etccdi indices used in this study the other way is that multivariate climate indices e g spei 3 or spei 12 are employed into the selection process to comprehensively take into account potential changes in study regions this study for example calculated drought indices spei 3 or spei 12 that require precipitation and temperature showing a consistent decreasing trend in response to the decrease in the summer precipitation and the increase in the summer temperature a negative decreasing slope in the spei 3 summer drought index was detected at all of the nat regions while an increasing trend i e a positive slope in both annual temperature txannual and tnannual and precipitation rannual was projected a negative decreasing slope in the sepi 12 was detected in all nat regions these results indicate that an increase in evapotranspiration driven by the temperature increase may be a dominant factor in determining a drought condition rather than the precipitation increases in alberta under the gmt changes it is noteworthy that among the nat region the largest negative slopes in the spei 3 and spei 12 occurred in the rocky mountain region headwater areas for major watersheds in alberta these results indicate that the water availability in the headwater regions of major watersheds will be considerably deteriorated by gmt warming which may cause more extreme water scarcity across downstream regions in alberta to quantitatively assess the impacts of the gmt changes on drought conditions this study also evaluated the frequency of the ed conditions for the summer spei 3 and water year spei 12 drought indices during the baseline period and future 30 year windows under the gmt changes as the ed threshold spei of 1 28 was defined from the non exceedance probability of 10 theoretically the return period of the ed conditions during the historical period from 1950 to 2014 is 10 year the return period in this study was empirically obtained from the inverse of the number of ed events over the 30 year baseline period and future 30 year windows under the gmt thresholds under the gmt changes the return years of the ed events were considerably shortened especially by 6 year on average for the spei 3 and spei 12 under 5 c gmt change which means that the summer and water year ed conditions may occur every six years total five times in 30 years under 5 c gmt change in other words the summer and water year ed events are likely to become more common in the nat regions under the gmt changes 5 conclusions this study suggested a comprehensive framework that comprised of selection of representative climate projections multivariate statistical downscaling and evaluation of climate change impacts on various climate indices under gmt warming of 1 5 5 c with the latest forty one cmip6 climate projections across ssp126 to ssp585 twelve representative cmip6 climate projections were identified for alberta by the quickhull ramper douglas peucker qh rdp algorithm a multivariate statistical downscaling method mbcds was applied to produce high resolution climate projections at 10 km resolution in alberta in addition this study identified 30 year time windows that reach the gmt changes of 1 5 c 2 c 3 c 4 c and 5 c above the pre industrial period 1850 1900 to evaluate the impacts of gmt warming on temperature related precipitation related and multivariate climate indices at the nat regions in alberta the results showed that an interval term that warms up 1 c gmt was considerably shortened by only 5 years 2073 2077 from 4 c to 5 c while 24 years 2035 2059 to reach the gmt change from 2 c to 3 c this result indicates that the rate of gmt warming is likely to be drastically accelerated under a warmer gmt a significant and consistent warming trend in annual mean temperature txannual and tnannual was also projected by all of the selected cmip6 climate projections in all nat regions in alberta while there were no distinct increasing decreasing trends in annual precipitation rannual under the gmt warming a larger positive slope of the relative change to gmt change was detected in the cold temperature indices i e tnn and tndfj compared with those of the warm temperature indices i e txx and txjja specifically 2 53 c c on average for tnn while 1 26 c c for txx this results indicate that the cold temperature indices are more sensitive to the gmt warming in particular 2 5 times faster than the gmt warming for tnn in alberta regarding precipitation related indices a larger slope in rmam 5 82 mm c were projected along with an increase in the spring temperature under the gmt warming indicating more rain phase precipitation will be expected during the spring season which may cause more ros induced natural hazards in the nat regions of alberta a negative slope in rjja was projected in the central and southern nat regions of alberta in particular the largest negative slope in the grassland region in addition to a potential decrease in snow accumulation and earlier snow melting driven by an increase in the spring and winter temperature the decrease in the summer precipitation may cause a drier and warmer summer over central and southern parts of alberta among the six nat regions the largest negative slope in the spei under the gmt changes was observed in the rocky mountain region headwater areas of major watersheds in alberta causing a decrease in snow accumulation during winter and subsequent spring and summer flows these results indicate that the water availability in the headwater regions of major watersheds in alberta will be considerably threatened by gmt warming resulting in more water scarcity across downstream regions in alberta under the gmt warming the reoccurrence intervals of the summer and water year extreme drought ed were shortened drastically specifically the return period of 6 year on average for the spei 12 under 5 c gmt change these results indicate that the ed events are likely to occur more frequently and consequently become more common in the nat regions under the gmt changes this study produced a set of main hydro climate variables i e daily precipitation minimum maximum temperature and maximum temperature however more climate variables need to be produced by the mbcds technique to enhance the applicability of high resolution cmip6 climate projections for various impact models that usually require additional meteorological forcing data such as wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and solar radiation it is also necessary to employ the selected high resolution cmip6 climate projections into impact models to quantitatively assess the impacts of climate change on hydrologic and ecological systems in alberta furthermore the findings of this study e g projected more severe drought conditions in the headwater areas of major watersheds in alberta provide fundamental and useful information to not only identify vulnerable spots but also to develop adaptations to climate change for sustainable water resources management

7653,study region northern great plains ngp region north dakota usa study focus understanding climate change impacts on surface water dynamics of permanent and seasonal water areas under drought to deluge conditions in the devils lake basin dlb utilizing a high resolution global surface water dataset gswd new hydrologic insights four phases of dry and wet conditions were experienced in the dlb during the 1990 2018 study period wetting 1990 1999 stable 2000 2003 recent wetting 2004 2013 and recent drying 2014 2018 a substantial transition from bare land to permanent and seasonal water area is observed during the wetting period 1990 99 while during the stable period 2000 2003 changes are barely observed despite ngp wide drought in the recent wetting period 2004 2013 a noticeable gain of permanent water from seasonal and bare land is observed during the recent drying period 2014 2018 a significant loss of seasonal water area to bare land occurred the difference between the spring and summer surface water areas is high during the recent wetting period e g 2009 2011 2013 but much lower as the dlb approaches a drought condition the inter annual and intra annual water dynamics of permanent and seasonal water areas show different rates of change and varying hydrological lags to changing hydroclimatic drivers and these changes are sensitive to basin antecedent conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords northern great plain ngp total water area twa permanent water area pwa seasonal water area swa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustained wetting and drying phases in cold continental semiarid regions that experience seasonally frozen soil conditions exert a strong influence on surface water area water storage and wetland connectivity e g labaugh et al 1998 liu schwartz 2012 kolmakova 2012 hayashi et al 2016 mckenna et al 2017 recent studies show that global climate change in cold region plains e g northern great plains ngp plains of russia has resulted in a substantial increase in precipitation with a cascading effect on cold region hydrologic processes and surface water area e g mitsch and hernandez 2013 robarts et al 2013 these cold region plains are expected to experience continued wetting in the future however the impacts of recent wet periods on surface water area and the relationship positive and negative feedbacks between surface water area and cold region hydrologic processes are not well understood paleoclimatology studies based upon multiple proxy records show the regional climate has oscillated between multi decadal wet and dry periods over the past 4500 years with relatively rapid transitions between the two modes grimm et al 2011 hobbs et al 2011 the absence of a stable long term regional climate is a defining regional climatic feature laird et al 2003 the historical record of lake level variations at devils lake north dakota show three temporal scales of variation fig s1 first are century scale variations of long duration low frequency and high amplitude second are decadal scale variations of shorter duration higher frequency and lower amplitude third are inter annual variations of very short duration high frequency and low amplitude these three temporal scales are evident in fig s1 the climate of the ngp transitioned from a century long drought cycle to a long term wet cycle beginning in the mid 1900s mckenna et al 2017 todhunter 2016 within this longer term transition to wetter conditions were three decadal scale wet spells beginning near 1950 1970 and 1993 and two decadal scale dry spells beginning near 1955 and 1988 inter annual variation characterizes the entire lake level time series hydroclimatic conditions over the last three decades in the ngp are marked by an overall trend toward deluge conditions todhunter 2016 van hoy et al 2020 but which include brief dry spells and significant inter annual fluctuations in the precipitation regime this general trend toward increased wetness has resulted in the expansion of existing wetlands and lakes and the generation of new wetlands in many watersheds dumanski et al 2015 since 1991 the ngp experienced a prolonged period of elevated precipitation that has resulted in devastating flooding 1993 99 todhunter 2016 and 2006 2013 rodell et al 2018 van hoy et al 2020 embedded within this longer term deluge period was one drought period 2000 2003 e g dumanski et al 2015 mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 and a second drought period 2014 present following the most recent wet period prairie wetland complexes adjust to these variable precipitation regime shifts by experiencing dynamic changes in the abundance mean size permanence and water quality of prairie wetlands winter and rosenberry 1998 many studies have used remotely sensed imagery e g vanderhoof et al 2016 2018 to report a substantial increase in the number size and permanence of surface water bodies during this drought to deluge transition most studies attributed these changes to an increase in precipitation since 1993 e g niemuth et al 2010 and have treated it as a single transition from long term drier to wetter conditions however there were two hydrological drought periods 2000 2003 and 2014 present in this novel ngp wet continuum the timing duration and spatial pattern of the drought periods vary in the ngp our analysis only pertains to northeastern north dakota we know of no studies that have provided a detailed analyses of the surface water response during this deluge to drought transition in ngp that included an assessment of changes during the 2000 2003 mahmood et al 2017 and 2014 present van hoy et al 2020 drought periods studies have also focused upon inter annual variations of surface water area with no examination of intra annual changes recent studies in the prairie pothole region ppr of the ngp were conducted in a large area where different cold region hydroclimatic systems exist and were often limited to an examination of either large lakes or regional wetland complexes vanderhoof and alexander 2016 vanderhoof et al 2016 for example the northern ppr experiences higher snow accumulation strongly influenced by snow processes in winter and spring season frozen land and surface water conditions and a longer winter compared to the southern ppr region e g coles and mcdonnell 2018 van hoy et al 2020 as a result surface water area response to specific hydroclimatic inputs is subdued and has been missed in previous studies in addition the temporal resolution of these recent studies was limited to one image per year and in some cases spring and summer imagery for only a limited number of years thus a comprehensive analysis of intra annual variability has not been undertaken previous studies indicate that remote sensing technology and image classification techniques can reliably quantify the extent of surface water area fluctuations e g vanderhoof et al 2018 in addition to remote sensing another way to determine water area is to use a stage area relation that has been developed for specific lakes within the area to determine changes in area that would give much better temporal resolution of changes in area however stage area relationships for smaller lakes and wetlands are normally not available sethre et al 2005 used a traditional density slicing technique of the short wave infrared swir band band 5 from landsat thematic mapper tm images to delineate water bodies and examine wetland and lake area fluctuations in the devils lake basin dlb todhunter and rundquist 2004 utilized landsat imagery to classify density slicing and mixed pixel analyses waterbodies and identified a three fold increase in total open water in nelson county southeastern area of the dlb from 1992 to 2001 vanderhoof and alexander 2016 used landsat images to classify waterbodies and found that wetland connectivity increased as the area of devils lake expanded however all these studies used cloud free imagery of specific dates since it is challenging to obtain cloud free imagery for the same season every year none of these studies could develop a comprehensive time series of surface water areas for example vanderhoof et al 2018 used only 15 landsat images 2 spring 6 summer and 7 fall for the 1990 2011 study period in the dlb so inter annual and intra annual surface water area variability were not sufficiently captured we believe there is greater variability of surface water area than that shown by treating the 1990 2018 period as a single drought to deluge cycle most studies e g vanderhoof et al 2018 report on surface water area increases over the entire drought to deluge transition a more critical study of surface water area variability is needed to identify surface water area response to hydroclimatic drivers at more detailed temporal and spatial scales and with greater attention to inter annual and intra annual climatic variability within the broader drought to deluge transition to address this knowledge gap we utilize the global surface water dataset gswd developed by pekel et al 2016 which consists of an annual water dataset of permanent and seasonal water area from all available landsat imageries based upon a big data algorithm in addition to the annual time series pekel et al 2016 developed a monthly surface water area time series using unsupervised classification based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and hue saturation value hsv of multi spectral landsat series imageries the pekel et al 2016 method provides an excellent dataset to investigate inter annual and intra annual surface water area change in the dlb the impact of climatic variability on surface water area is a vital research topic because even though lake and wetland areas are always changing the potential for changes over an increased range in areas is greater and unknown during a time of climate change feyisa et al 2014 our research questions are what is the impact of the recent drought to deluge period on annual surface water area permanent and seasonal water area in the dlb during 1990 2018 is this period adequately represented as a single wet period with increasing surface water area or are multiple periods of wetter or drier phases embedded within this longer drought to deluge period each with distinct hydrologic responses to climatic variability how does surface water area vary on an intra annual spring to summer time scale during this study period and how is this seasonality connected with the hydrologic change in the dlb in the ngp water levels peak during the spring season and recede to the lowest point during the summer or fall season our primary means to address these research questions is to analyze yearly and monthly water pixels from remotely sensed imagery for 1990 2018 we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water area to investigate how surface water area responds to variations in the precipitation regime and other critical hydroclimatic drivers such as streamflow and evaporation we hypothesize that two embedded dry periods within the longer term climatic wetting transition will have a pronounced impact on streamflow and open water evaporation which will influence the surface water area of lakes and wetlands our study is of special scientific interest as the region is expected to experience wetter climatic conditions over the next few decades vecchia 2008 which will result in even larger lake and wetland areas that result in substantial human impact in addition depletion of terrestrial water storage in mid century and slight gains in late century from gcm results under rcp 6 0 scenario are anticipated by pokhrel et al 2021 2 study area methodology 2 1 study area the dlb is in north central north dakota usa fig 1 and extends from the southern slopes of the turtle mountains to stump lake swenson and colby 1955 the basin topography is of glacial origin and has a great number of shallow depressions of small lakes ponds and wetlands moraines outwash plains and drumlins swenson and colby 1955 zhang et al 2009 shook et al 2013 the millions of pothole depressions in the ppr have great ecological significance for waterfowl although federal programs have marginalized rangeland from agricultural purposes to enhance waterfowl breeding zhang et al 2009 the ppr is a vital north american agricultural production area vanderhoof and alexander 2016 and the dlb is dominated by herbaceous vegetation hay pasture and cultivated crops fig 1g vanderhoof and alexander 2016 the fine textured soils are a result of glacial outwash and have a low vertical permeability van der kamp and hayashi 1998 basin relief is about 206 m with the highest point of elevation in the northwestern basin tip at 673 m and the lowest point of elevation at the center of the southern part of the basin at 413 m fig 1f regional precipitation and evaporation have been affected by global climate change zhang et al 2009 ludden et al 1983 in recent decades the dlb has experienced a century scale shift from a dry to a wet cycle that commenced in about 1940 and accelerated sharply in 1993 fig s1 ballard et al 2014 sethre et al 2005 rodell et al 2018 under these sustained wet conditions the low basin relief led to extreme flooding due to spring runoff events and increased precipitation with evaporation being the only major loss of water from the basin vanderhoof and alexander 2016 ludden et al 1983 swenson and colby 1955 the shift to wetter conditions produced large water level fluctuations in both wetlands and permanent lakes and showed that wetlands and lakes should be examined concurrently to assess the impact of increasing regional wetness on total surface water extent sethre et al 2005 the open water areas in the ngp are a mix of permanent lakes semi permanent wetlands and seasonal wetlands the wetlands expand in number size permanence and connectivity by both fill and spill shook et al 2013 and fill and merge processes leibowitz et al 2016 the distinction between lakes more permanent wetlands and seasonal wetlands is not always clear as wetlands can merge with other wetlands merge with expanding lakes and transition from seasonal wetlands to semi permanent lakes vanderhoof and alexander 2016 vanderhoof et al 2016 wetland complex hydrology in the dlb follows similar principles to those in the canadian prairie pothole region with the dominant source of runoff being snowmelt the most important hydrological event on the prairie spence et al 2019 todhunter 2018 mcdonnell et al 2021 much of the runoff drains internally to smaller prairie pothole wetlands and only slowly infiltrates to groundwater due to low soil permeability when wetland storage capacity is exceeded outflow occurs creating spillage into lower relief potholes shook et al 2013 because of long periods without spilling large portions of the region are non contributing to local streams when potholes fill however wetland connectivity allows water to travel to a stream and increase the overall contributing area making it difficult to quantify depressional storage of wetlands shook et al 2013 water input to prairie wetlands by blowing snow wind transport melting of snow and direct precipitation onto open water surfaces are primary runoff generators shook et al 2013 fig 2b shows recent fluctuations of streamflow at the outlet gauge of the mauvais coulee basin and gauge height at the lake alice irvine channel near churchs ferry nd the gauge at the lake alice irvine channel near churchs ferry nd was moved to near hwy 2 fig 2 a because of high flooding conditions in fig 2b the gauge height can be considered a proxy for lake level as both gauges are located at the bank of the lake the lake level rise is strongly associated with peak streamflow at mauvais coulee basin during 1998 2011 because of climatic wetting the peak flow substantially increased from 60 m3 sec to 100 m3 sec which was responsible for a 2 0 m lake level rise however during the post 2011 period the recession of lake level to streamflow at the mauvais coulee gauge was inconclusive as peak flows were not strongly correlated with lake level table s1 2 2 methodology we used remotely sensed yearly permanent and seasonal and monthly water area pixels to accomplish the research goals since our objective was to report annual changes in surface water area we utilized a global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 that reported both annual permanent water area pwa and seasonal water area swa we also use the gswd s monthly total water area to examine the intra annual or seasonal variation to determine surface water extent we downloaded data from the yearly and monthly water dataset gswd for 1990 2018 since our objectives included assessing the accuracy of the methods we used aerial imagery from the national agriculture imagery program naip and google earth engine after compiling the surface water extent time series we investigated the relationship of remotely sensed surface water extent with hydroclimatic variables such as streamflow precipitation and open water evaporation these relationships helped identify the key hydroclimatic drivers and their relative impact upon surface water extent dynamics 2 2 1 remotely sensed data processing the global surface water dataset gswd yearly and monthly water pixels pekel et al 2016 were used to create time series of annual and monthly surface water area this dataset is free and contains 30 m resolution class images for 35 years 1984 2018 using unsupervised classification based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and hue saturation value hsv of multi spectral landsat series imageries including landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli the annual https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog jrc gsw1 3 yearlyhistory and monthly https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog jrc gsw1 3 monthlyhistory gswd water histories are available via google earth search engine since the data processing uses multiple imagery 16 days overpass and oblique angle for a month it can classify a pixel as water or non water in case of obstruction by cloud cover for one or two scenes however in some months we are not able to extract water data due to substantial cloud cover during all landsat overpasses we believe such an approach of using composite imagery at monthly and annual scale over regional scale can give us much better temporal resolution than using landsat scenes of selected dates the gswd dataset has been cited by more than 1800 research articles over the last five years and used in many surface water body change studies e g zhang et al 2017 tan et al 2019 open water is a highly variable land surface feature and a confusing spectral target due to the sensitivity of its spectral properties at the wavelengths measured by the tm etm and oli sensors to chlorophyll concentration total suspended solids colored dissolved organic matter load depths and bed load material for shallow waters as well as variations in observation conditions sun target sensor geometry and optical thickness pekel et al 2016 addressed these challenges by using the big data technology systems named as expert systems lu and weng 2007 kartikeyan et al 1995 shoshany 2008 visual analytics keim et al 2008 and evidential reasoning yang and xu 2002 expert systems allow the user to deal with the range of conditions encountered that discriminate water pixels from other pixels while visual analytics tie human cognitive and perceptual abilities to the storage and processing capabilities of the cloud computing platforms finally evidential reasoning was used to solve the problems of emergent data uncertainties and quality issues detailed equations describing the likely water cluster hull and cluster overlaps in the multidimensional feature space are given in the supplementary information of pekel et al 2016 2 2 2 accuracy assessment although the high resolution water maps from pekel et al 2016 were evaluated globally we believe the accuracy of this dataset needs to be reevaluated in the context of the dlb as its accuracy assessment lacked sufficient number of locations where accuracy could be assessed in the ngp ideally we would like to assess pekel et al 2016 data against field observations however field observations on water non water occurrence over a large area like devils lake basin are rare thus we utilized the imagery from naip and google earth pro as a proxy for field data for water area evaluation we did not use naip and google earth pro to achieve our research goals due to their limited availability their availability only extends back to 2002 whereas our study begins in 1990 in contrast the pekel et al 2016 dataset starts from 1984 and provides a long time series of water areas in the dlb region the use of the imagery from naip and google earth pro can inform us on the uncertainty of detecting water areas in pekel et al 2016 one of the examples is the comparison between fig s2f and s2i fig s2i shows the black color pixels around the wetland which are not detected by pekel et al 2016 during the agricultural growing season naip obtains aerial imagery and produces orthophotography of the continental us the aerial imagery has a 1 m spatial resolution in a default spectral resolution in the natural colors of red green and blue rgb as of 2007 naip includes a near infrared band along with rgb and can be accessed directly https gis apfo usda gov arcgis rest services however naip images were not available in selected years during 2002 2018 so we utilized the google earth pro for accuracy assessment for these years we selected the accuracy assessment locations both manually on screen digitization and automatically using computer generated random locations from uniform spatial distribution of coordinates we believe that computer generated random locations are useful as they reduce the possibility of bias in the selection process we manually digitized 100 polygons and used matlab to generate 79 random polygons over the study area both manual and automated polygons were characterized as water or non water based on naip imagery and compared to water and non water pixels from monthly water maps during growing season from pekel et al 2016 for several years table 2 2004 2005 2009 2010 2012 2014 2018 likewise for other years 2002 2003 2006 2007 2008 2011 2013 both manual and automated polygons were characterized as water or non water based on google earth pro imagery and evaluated against water and non water pixels from monthly water maps of pekel et al 2016 we quantified the error of omission underestimation and commission overestimation in percentage and overall accuracy of the monthly water maps we also compared the devils lake area from the monthly dataset with lake elevation area volume tables from the united states geologic survey usgs united states geological survey 2022a and used the monthly lake area data from pekel et al 2016 and mean monthly lake level observations for these comparisons the variation of lake level within a month was less than 15 cm thus the use of mean lake level was adequate for these comparisons 2 2 3 hydrologic trend analyses 2 2 3 1 annual and seasonal surface water area the accuracy of the water pixel maps from pekel et al 2016 for 17 years 2002 2018 was evaluated by comparing the waterbody areas detected from the high resolution naip imagery and high resolution imagery in google earth pro we selected accuracy assessment locations manually using on screen digitization and automatically using computer generated random locations from the uniform spatial distribution of coordinates we manually digitized 100 polygons covering a total of 8 37 km2 in fig 3a and used matlab to generate 79 random polygons covering a total of 6 00 km2 in fig 3b the confirmation of water occurrence in these polygons is based on the on screen visual inspection of high resolution naip imagery the yearly gswd provides information on the occurrence of pwa and swa over earth s continental land area pekel et al 2016 while the monthly dataset documents the occurrence of total water area twa on a monthly basis the european commission joint research centre jrc funded and developed this dataset and maintains a current archive we drafted algorithms to download yearly and monthly water data for the dlb during 1990 2018 in the https code earthengine google com since our objectives are to examine variations in surface water area during climatic episodes embedded within the longer term drought to deluge cycle we inspect twa pwa and swa from the yearly gswd dataset we visually inspected and determined different phases of water area fluctuations and utilized the mann kendall test e g molnár ramírez 2001 to statistically evaluate specific trends while annual water data is available for all years without availability limitations due to substantial cloud cover the monthly dataset did experience issues of cloud cover cloud cover during the cold season oct feb often made it difficult to visualize water pixels during the winter season we visually inspected all monthly water maps from 1990 to 2018 and developed a database of maps with very little cloud the monthly water maps data used are shown in table 1 we determined that the april water maps best represented the spring season water area if the april water map was not available we used the may water map as a proxy for the spring season water area similarly the august water map was considered to represent the summer water area since summer evaporation peaks during august the july water map was used as a proxy for summer water area if the august water map was not available the timing of maximum and minimum intra seasonal water levels varies between seasonal and permanent water bodies todhunter and knish 2014 found a median date of 24 may for maximum water level and a median date of 7 november for minimum water level during 1965 2010 for devils lake a permanent lake seasonal water bodies would have a similar spring maximum water level date as permanent water bodies since water level maximums for both systems are due to the spring snowmelt freshet seasonal water bodies experience a much greater range of seasonal minimum water levels than do permanent water bodies our selection of july august is a mid point between the median minimum water levels of seasonal and permanent water bodies spring or summer water maps were not available for years 1991 1997 2001 2002 2007 2008 and 2012 so surface water area differences between the spring and summer seasons were not available for these years 2 2 3 2 precipitation and evaporation data we used precipitation data 1990 2018 to interpret and explain the surface water area changes hourly rainfall was measured at the north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn station shown in fig 1e rainfall is measured at the station using tipping bucket at a height of 0 914 m however snowfall estimates were not available through ndawn thus parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism at a daily time step was used for snowfall values daly et al 2008 prism data has been used in many recent studies sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 small et al 2006 todhunter 2016 todhunter fietzek devries 2016 and to gain confidence on the winter precipitation data we compared and evaluated it to a station at brandon manitoba the station at brandon manitoba was selected due to its proximity to the study site and having a nearly complete and highly reliable data for the study period overall the prism snowfall data is in good agreement with the annual snowfall data at brandon manitoba we also utilized simulated evapotranspiration et and open water evaporation flux e using the cold region hydrologic model crhm set up built by van hoy et al 2020 the crhm is an object oriented multi physics modular modeling system that allows an investigator to set up hydrological models that represent key cold regions hydrological processes pomeroy et al 2007 crhm has a flexible modular design and is spatially distributed based on hydrologic response units hrus allowing for fine scale resolution and parameterization in van hoy et al 2020 we utilized modules representing governing cold region hydrological processes such as frozen partially frozen and unfrozen soil infiltration blowing snow transport energy balance in the snowpack governing melt processes evapotranspiration fill and spill hydrology in wetland and wetland processes in depression areas for the mauvais coulee basin the largest headwater basin draining to devils lake open water evaporation flux was obtained from the crhm platform hourly open water evaporation flux estimates obtained using the priestley taylor equation sumner jacobs 2005 that incorporates air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming solar radiation and simulated snow status using snow water equivalent swe these input variables were taken from the ndawn stations fig 1e et simulations in crhm were obtained using the penman monteith combination method monteith 1965 3 results 3 1 accuracy assessment of annual and monthly water pixel classification overall the performance of the monthly water maps using the error of omission error of commission and overall accuracy percentage on detecting water pixels and non water pixels is satisfactory table 2 we also compared the annual water data total water area of pekel et al 2016 with the water class of the national land cover dataset nlcd since the nlcd data are only available for selected years our comparison is limited to years 2001 2004 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 table 3 the overall accuracy for manually digitized and randomly selected polygons is over 90 demonstrating strong performance to further evaluate the pekel et al 2016 gswd data we compared the devils lake area with lake level measurements from the usgs gauge near devils lake united states geological survey 2022b fig 4 shows a fitted line with r 2 of 0 98 between lake area and lake level indicating the strong performance of the pekal et al 2016 classification scheme 3 2 annual spatiotemporal variability of surface water area the water pixel maps of annual pwa exhibit a large spatiotemporal variation over the study period figs 5 and 6 in particular the number of permanent waterbodies increased in the northern part of the dlb while the large lakes in the southern dlb expanded and merged into a larger waterbody figs 5 and 6 overall the twa increased during the study period from 363 to 1146 km2 fig 7a pwa increased from 301 to 867 km2 accounting for between 83 and 76 of twa fig 7b most of the permanent water pixels represent large lakes such as lake alice devils lake and stump lake most of the seasonal water pixels are generally considered as wetlands in the dlb and they show an increase from 62 to 279 km2 over the study period ranging from 17 to 24 of twa fig 7c table 4 shows an upward trend for twa and pwa for 1990 2018 based upon the mann kendall trend test that is significant at p 0 05 which is consistent with other studies in the dlb e g sethre et al 2005 todhunter 2021 and ngp vanderhoof et al 2018 however swa shows a weak downward trend that was only significant at p 0 581 table 4 the temporal dynamics of the pwa lake areas are more in phase with that of twa than for swa fig 7 we identified four periods based on visual inspection and trend analyses using the mann kendall trend test table 4 1990 1999 wetting 2000 2003 stable wet conditions due to the ngp drought fang and pomeroy 2007 van hoy et al 2020 todhunter 2021 2004 2013 recent wetting van hoy et al 2020 and 2014 2018 recent drying van hoy et al 2020 3 3 seasonal variation of total water area in this section we use monthly data to examine the seasonal variation of twa in the dlb fig 8 the long term monthly twa temporal pattern is consistent with that of annual pwa fig 7b showing a steady progressive increase from 1990 through 2013 and a small decrease after that year a consistent seasonal pattern is observed in which the spring season april or may twa is substantially higher than the summer season july or august twa fig 8 in fig s3 we assume april or may water areas represent the spring season while july or august water areas represent the summer season we simplify the monthly twa representation in fig 8 into spring and summer seasons in fig s3 to more clearly represent the seasonal variability fig s3 shows that swa experiences a larger seasonal fluctuation than does pwa fig s2 shows the seasonal change of a small wetland during the 2009 warm season fig s2a f the wetland water area decreased by more than 50 between may 1 2 km2 and august 0 45 km2 shallower areas are more susceptible to summer evaporation than deeper areas as shown in the bathymetry map in fig s2g the wetland water area recovered somewhat to 0 76 km2 during the fall season sep and oct due to lower evaporation and higher rainfall fig s2e f 4 discussion in the following we discuss the spatiotemporal variability of the annual and seasonal water area fluctuations and provide a summary of the study results 4 1 spatiotemporal variability of annual water area table 4 and fig 7 identify four periods based on visual inspection and trend analyses using the mann kendall trend test 1990 1999 wetting 2000 2003 stable conditions due to the ngp drought 2004 2013 recent wetting and 2013 2018 recent drying the 1990 1999 period shows wetting in which the dlb consistently received substantial snowfall with subsequent snow accumulation and melt and rainfall resulting in the expansion of existing lakes and the creation of new lakes and smaller water bodies figs 5 6 7b and 7c pwa lakes showed a steady large increase with time while swa wetlands showed a more dynamic temporal pattern with larger inter annual fluctuations the hydrological processes controlling the water budget of devils lake are summarized in todhunter 2018 2021 and these processes are similar for all permanent water areas in the ngp devils lake is an amplifier terminal lake whose water budget exhibits positive feedback relationships during prolonged dry or wet periods during sustained dry periods permanent water areas have a precipitation dominated water budget in which direct precipitation onto the open water surface is the major input to lake volume with streamflow providing a much smaller contribution as the transition from the drought to the deluge period began a set of positive feedback mechanisms gradually became established in which a long term increase in precipitation led to higher basin antecedent soil moisture content increased generation of surface runoff higher runoff ratios runoff depth precipitation depth and increased surface runoff for devils lake a sustained increase in precipitation of 24 led to an average runoff ratio increase from 0 3 to 6 4 the contribution of surface streamflow to the input of water to the lake increased from an average of 12 3 48 1 as the lake transitioned to a streamflow dominated water budget todhunter 2018 2021 because lake net evaporation lake evaporation minus direct precipitation onto the lake is almost always negative streamflow must be maintained at a high level to compensate for large negative lake net evaporation so short dry spells or even pauses in higher precipitation inputs can lead to a reduction in lake volume with a resulting decrease in lake level and lake area the hydrologic processes that control pwa are more responsive to long term low frequency climatic fluctuations while the hydrological processes controlling swa are more sensitive to short term high frequency climatic variations the years 1992 1994 and 1996 experienced a pronounced increase in swa particularly in the southern devils lake area and eastern edmore coulee area dlb fig 7c there was also a moderate expansion of wetlands and an increase in wetland numbers in the northern mauvais coulee and starkweather coulee region and western parts near leeds of the dlb a statistically significant upward trend p 0 05 was obtained for twa and pwa table 4 while the trend obtained for the swa just missed this statistical threshold table 4 visual inspection of fig 7c shows two distinct periods of increasing and decreasing swa during 1990 1999 swa increased during the first six years 1990 1996 while it experienced a large decline during 1997 1999 due to reduced rainfall and higher evaporation the 1990 1999 period is hydrologically characterized by increased streamflow due to greater spilling and filling of wetland complexes and increased contributing area due to greater surface water connectivity dumanski et al 2015 the process of connectivity between surface water bodies was accelerated at the end of this period e g 1997 and 1999 resulting in massive flooding in the dlb we believe the higher precipitation an average of 91 mm snowfall water equivalent and 450 mm rainfall reduced open water evaporation 671 mm and higher snowmelt streamflow resulted in the twa increase table 5 fig s4 the contribution of pwa to twa decreased from 83 to 70 and the swa contribution increased from 17 to 30 during 1990 1999 period the 2000 2003 period experienced sustained high twa and pwa due to memory effects from the previous wet period 1990 1999 the short dry period from 2000 to 2003 was insufficiently long to have a large impact on streamflow input to lakes so pwa remained stable fig 7b due to the 2000 2003 period drought condition both twa and swa experienced minor fluctuations with no significant trend in the mann kendall test statistic table 4 swa started to decline in the summer of 1997 and depletion continued through 2003 due to persistent dry summer conditions we believe the lower mean annual precipitation 510 mm and higher open surface water evaporation 773 mm are responsible for producing the weak twa and swa fluctuations during this period table 5 fig s4 note that the contribution of pwa to twa decreased from 75 to 73 while the swa contribution increased from 25 to 27 during this period the ngp drought had almost no impact on pwa since that increase was driven by streamflow inputs that respond to lower frequency climatic variations and exhibit greater memory effects and a longer hydrologic lag the drought had a larger influence on swa showing that smaller water bodies are more vulnerable to drought conditions and become depleted more quickly a finding consistent with zheng et al 2009 during 2000 2003 the annual fluctuations in twa are almost entirely due to changes in swa this shows that changes in lake and wetland surface water area respond to climatic drivers occurring at different climatic durations and with different hydrologic lags and memory effects after this short duration prairie drought 2000 2003 the dlb experienced noticeable wetting during the 2004 2013 period fig 7a the wet condition did not become fully established until 2009 although precipitation started to increase in the fall of 2004 prior to 2009 the dlb experienced mild wetting due to wet winter and dry summer conditions mahmood et al 2017 table 4 shows an upward trend for twa and pwa with 95 confidence pwa remained stable until the wet spell and positive feedback effects became more fully established in 2009 leading to a sustained increase in pwa fig 7b although the upward trend for swa did not reach the adopted level of statistical significance a positive z score supports an upward trend since 2008 twa pwa and swa have increased across the dlb large increases were observed in 2009 2011 and 2013 due to very wet winters and large snowmelt and rain on snow runoff van hoy et al 2020 these years coincided with years of regional flooding in the ngp amid this wet period 2012 was observed as a very dry year for both winter and summer periods the pwa contribution to twa increased from 66 to 72 while the swa contribution decreased from 34 to 28 during 2004 2013 period during this recent wetting period fill spill processes and variable contributing area exerted strong control on streamflow generation across the dlb although the effect upon swa was much stronger than upon pwa e g van hoy et al 2020 the depressional storage located at the outlet of the subbasin plays a key role on the connectivity and resultant contributing area in the dlb depressional storage often reached its full capacity in the headwater basin mauvais coulee basin in the 2004 2013 period the contributing area also exceeded 95 of total basin area during the spring snowmelt period van hoy et al 2020 the years of high depressional storage and greater contributing area in 2009 and 2011 are consistent with our findings across the dlb although our results show the highest pwa in 2013 van hoy et al 2020 suggest that depressional storage and contributing area failed to reach their full capacity in the mauvais coulee basin due to high evaporation in the summer of 2012 we believe the higher precipitation average of 125 mm snowfall water equivalent and 500 mm rainfall longer winter and larger snow cover area reduced open water evaporation mean of 790 mm and higher snowmelt streamflow mean of 54 mm led to the increase in the twa table 5 fig s4 the 2014 2018 period shows a decrease in twa pwa and swa indicating a drying period in the dlb fig 7 a b c table 4 shows downward trends for twa pwa and swa at the 95 confidence level however the contribution of pwa 75 and 76 in 2014 and 2018 respectively and swa 25 and 24 in 2014 and 2018 respectively to twa show little variation in this period van hoy et al 2020 reported a higher evaporative fraction ratio of total evaporation to total precipitation during this period indicating that atmospheric evaporative demand was higher than the vertical input precipitation and lateral input inflow to water bodies fluxes the average open water evaporation was 853 mm during the 2014 2018 recent drying period while it was 773 mm during the 2000 2003 stable dry period van hoy et al 2020 table 5 fig s4 as a result decreases in twa pwa and swa were observed during 2014 2018 whereas they showed only minor changes during 2000 2003 swa responded more quickly to the reduced precipitation in the recent drying period while pwa exhibited a longer hydrologic lag and did not show a significant decrease until 2017 2018 when annual precipitation was especially low amplifier terminal lakes also exhibit positive feedback mechanisms that accelerate decreases in pwa during sustained dry periods a decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in basin antecedent moisture content that reduces the runoff ratio reduced streamflow input to open water bodies combined with increased open water evaporation led to a decrease in lake volume and subsequent decrease in pwa todhunter 2018 2021 we explored the impact of newly built outlets to drain water from devils lake to the sheyenne river as an explanation for the dlb wetland loss for this period the volume of water pumped from devils lake to the sheyenne river by outlets was insignificant through water year 2010 todhunter 2018 after 2010 the outlet discharge volume approximated the annual lake net evaporation of 240 mm yr 1 todhunter 2016 and is now a significant factor in reducing the volume of the merged devils lake and stump lake system current outlet discharge is not significant enough however to have a noticeable impact in reducing swa of dlb wetlands shabani et al 2017 seasonal and inter annual patterns of surface water area fluctuations have been investigated previously in the ngp poff et al 1997 beeri and phillips 2007 leibowitz et al 2016 vanderhoof et al 2018 these studies have focused upon the larger scale drought to deluge cycle experienced in the ngp over the last four decades e g vanderhoof et al 2018 the impacts of wetting on surface water extent and watershed storage influence the hydrologic response of a watershed by triggering a fill spill phenomenon and expanding the contributing area and wetland connectivity evenson et al 2016 golden et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 surface water area responses during shorter wet or dry episodes embedded within this longer term drought to deluge cycle have not been critically examined particularly during the 2000 2003 prairie drought and the recent 2014 2018 streamflow drought in the ngp van hoy et al 2020 there is no doubt the ngp experienced a significant p 0 001 increase in total surface water area and number of surface water bodies from the late 1980 s drought condition vanderhoof et al 2018 however the wetting phenomenon was not continuous in time but was slowed and interrupted by drier shorter term climatic conditions while other studies reported one period of continuous surface water area increment vanderhoof et al 2018 we detected two distinct wet periods of increasing surface water area 1990 1999 2004 2013 amid this novel long term wet continuum we add new knowledge by reporting on two periods of surface water area expansion separated by the 2000 2003 drought period and followed by another downward trend in twa during the 2014 2018 drought period twa increased in two different phases 1990 1999 and 2004 2013 but was invariant during the 2000 2003 drought period and decreased during the 2014 2018 drought period the response of pwa and swa to the long term drought to deluge transition as well as the four phases identified in fig 7 and table 4 show important differences analyzing changes in twa by itself mixes two hydrologic systems that respond differently to hydroclimatic drivers and are controlled by different hydrologic processes 4 2 seasonal water area fluctuations the spring season twa strongly responded during the 1990 1999 wetting period showing a significant increase across the dlb but then weakened during 1999 2003 fig 8 since 2005 spring season twa increased substantially and peaked in 2013 1350 km2 we believe the large snowmelt events of 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 triggered the large increase in twa from 1015 2005 spring to 1350 km2 2013 spring after 2013 the spring season twa declined due to a lack of snow accumulation dry winter and low snowfall and reduced snowmelt runoff to wetlands and lakes van hoy et al 2020 the summer season twa also responded to wetting during 1990 1999 since 1999 summer season twa remained almost unchanged until 2009 partly due to the consumption of summer rainfall by evapotranspiration however during 2009 2010 summer twa increased substantially due to the dominance of summer rainfall over evaporation and the lingering effect of the spring twa increase during 2014 2018 the summer twa also decreased although at a more gradual rate than spring twa showing the different hydrologic lags associated with wetlands and lakes the difference between the spring and summer season twa shows a transition from a streamflow dominated to an evaporation dominated hydrologic system after 2009 fig 9 during this period snowmelt induced streamflow became the dominant driver of twa todhunter 2021 and its dominance peaked in 2009 we identify the 2000 2013 period as a streamflow dominated system with gaining streamflow while the 2014 2018 period is an evaporation dominated system with decreasing streamflow van hoy et al 2020 these evaporation dominated hydrologic system characteristics apply to both permanent lake and seasonal wetland water areas the combination of reduced streamflow input decreased direct precipitation onto the lake and increased lake evaporation led to a large increase in lake net evaporation that reduced the lake water volume lowered lake level and reduced lake area similarly a large increase in open water evaporation with reduced precipitation and runoff caused a large reduction in swa overall the temporal dynamics of monthly total water area are controlled by cold region vertical and lateral fluxes such as snowmelt inflow runoff open water evaporation and rainfall spring swa is dominated by snowmelt inflow runoff and in site ice melt while summer and fall swa is dominated by evaporation and rainfall during winter wetland complexes are completely frozen and covered by a thick ice layer our selection of months representing spring april or may and summer august or july raises some uncertainty on the difference in twa between the spring and summer seasons however the twa difference between april and may is small 35 km2 in 1992 and april is only used for 2004 2005 and 2016 similarly the twa difference between august and july is small 20 km2 in 2000 and 5 km2 in 2015 and the july twa was only used for 2009 2014 and 2018 we believe such small differences would not change our scientific findings 4 3 summary we show the spatial distribution of the transitions between permanent water seasonal water and bare land in fig 10 and summarize the net land cover changes during the study period in table 6 the dlb wide transition from bare land to permanent 424 7 km2 and seasonal 310 6 km2 water area are observed during 1990 99 period in contrast during the following stable period 2000 2003 changes were minimal in the recent wetting period 2004 2013 a net gain of 182 0 km2 in permanent water from seasonal and bare land was observed while 96 4 km2 changed from bare land to seasonal water area these changes are heavily concentrated around devils lake itself finally during the recent drying period 2014 2018 a significant loss 180 3 km2 of seasonal water area to bare land occurred 5 conclusions over the 29 year study period an analysis of surface water extent during a long term drought to deluge cycle showed an overall net increase of twa pwa and swa but with important variations during shorter climatic phases four phases of surface water area fluctuations were identified during 1990 2018 1990 1999 wetting 2000 2003 stable 2004 2013 recent wetting and 2014 2018 recent drying in both wetting periods 1990 1999 2004 2013 a substantial gain of twa and pwa was observed however during the 2004 2013 period the increase of twa started in 2009 despite a wet condition that began in 2004 annual twa and pwa decreased during the recent drying period while they barely fluctuated during the earlier dry period 2000 2003 the time series of intra annual water area changes showed patterns similar to that of annual twa twa peaked in the spring season and gradually recessed during the summer season due to high evaporation before a slight recovery in the fall season our findings show that the difference between spring and summer twa is very high amid a deluge period e g 2009 2011 2013 while it is much lower as the system approaches a drought condition the surface water area mapping from landsat imagery has a few limitations which can be sources of uncertainty the 30 m spatial resolution limits the ability of the pekel et al 2016 algorithm to map water in smaller 900 m2 wetlands our annual surface water is based on imagery from the spring and summer seasons as the landsat imagery is not available to interpret during the winter season due to substantial cloud cover the availability of landsat imagery during the spring and summer seasons was limited during the 1990 2000 period due to cloud cover and other reasons future studies are recommended to use imageries from the optical sensors with a higher spatial resolution to detect smaller water bodies in the dlb such potential sensors include ikonos quickbird and recently launched sentinel 2 active sensors synthetic aperture radar imaging are also recommended to map water bodies during cloudy day and night conditions the use of synthetic aperture radar e g sentinel 1 and radarsat can be helpful in mapping water areas during the winter and spring season when the ngp has substantial cloud cover in addition to using advanced remote sensing technology we also recommend conducting a future study comparing the inter annual stage variability with wet to dry variability in stage our findings on the recent drought and its influence on surface water extent provide specific scientific and socioeconomic insights as the dry condition is continuing to the present day and ngp streams and lakes experienced their lowest water level in the 2021 summer the decreasing trend of wetland area also influences the water table of the shallow glacial till aquifer our findings are relevant to water resource management in the dlb as recent climate change studies e g bonsal et al 2017 masud et al 2017 have predicted that the future ngp climate will continue to experience alternating periods of drought and deluge conditions our findings on the lake area change pwa have implications for assessing flood damage as vast areas of fertile lands are still underwater due to the expansion of the lake area that began in the early 1990s declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

sustained wetting and drying phases in cold continental semiarid regions that experience seasonally frozen soil conditions exert a strong influence on surface water area water storage and wetland connectivity e g labaugh et al 1998 liu schwartz 2012 kolmakova 2012 hayashi et al 2016 mckenna et al 2017 recent studies show that global climate change in cold region plains e g northern great plains ngp plains of russia has resulted in a substantial increase in precipitation with a cascading effect on cold region hydrologic processes and surface water area e g mitsch and hernandez 2013 robarts et al 2013 these cold region plains are expected to experience continued wetting in the future however the impacts of recent wet periods on surface water area and the relationship positive and negative feedbacks between surface water area and cold region hydrologic processes are not well understood paleoclimatology studies based upon multiple proxy records show the regional climate has oscillated between multi decadal wet and dry periods over the past 4500 years with relatively rapid transitions between the two modes grimm et al 2011 hobbs et al 2011 the absence of a stable long term regional climate is a defining regional climatic feature laird et al 2003 the historical record of lake level variations at devils lake north dakota show three temporal scales of variation fig s1 first are century scale variations of long duration low frequency and high amplitude second are decadal scale variations of shorter duration higher frequency and lower amplitude third are inter annual variations of very short duration high frequency and low amplitude these three temporal scales are evident in fig s1 the climate of the ngp transitioned from a century long drought cycle to a long term wet cycle beginning in the mid 1900s mckenna et al 2017 todhunter 2016 within this longer term transition to wetter conditions were three decadal scale wet spells beginning near 1950 1970 and 1993 and two decadal scale dry spells beginning near 1955 and 1988 inter annual variation characterizes the entire lake level time series hydroclimatic conditions over the last three decades in the ngp are marked by an overall trend toward deluge conditions todhunter 2016 van hoy et al 2020 but which include brief dry spells and significant inter annual fluctuations in the precipitation regime this general trend toward increased wetness has resulted in the expansion of existing wetlands and lakes and the generation of new wetlands in many watersheds dumanski et al 2015 since 1991 the ngp experienced a prolonged period of elevated precipitation that has resulted in devastating flooding 1993 99 todhunter 2016 and 2006 2013 rodell et al 2018 van hoy et al 2020 embedded within this longer term deluge period was one drought period 2000 2003 e g dumanski et al 2015 mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 and a second drought period 2014 present following the most recent wet period prairie wetland complexes adjust to these variable precipitation regime shifts by experiencing dynamic changes in the abundance mean size permanence and water quality of prairie wetlands winter and rosenberry 1998 many studies have used remotely sensed imagery e g vanderhoof et al 2016 2018 to report a substantial increase in the number size and permanence of surface water bodies during this drought to deluge transition most studies attributed these changes to an increase in precipitation since 1993 e g niemuth et al 2010 and have treated it as a single transition from long term drier to wetter conditions however there were two hydrological drought periods 2000 2003 and 2014 present in this novel ngp wet continuum the timing duration and spatial pattern of the drought periods vary in the ngp our analysis only pertains to northeastern north dakota we know of no studies that have provided a detailed analyses of the surface water response during this deluge to drought transition in ngp that included an assessment of changes during the 2000 2003 mahmood et al 2017 and 2014 present van hoy et al 2020 drought periods studies have also focused upon inter annual variations of surface water area with no examination of intra annual changes recent studies in the prairie pothole region ppr of the ngp were conducted in a large area where different cold region hydroclimatic systems exist and were often limited to an examination of either large lakes or regional wetland complexes vanderhoof and alexander 2016 vanderhoof et al 2016 for example the northern ppr experiences higher snow accumulation strongly influenced by snow processes in winter and spring season frozen land and surface water conditions and a longer winter compared to the southern ppr region e g coles and mcdonnell 2018 van hoy et al 2020 as a result surface water area response to specific hydroclimatic inputs is subdued and has been missed in previous studies in addition the temporal resolution of these recent studies was limited to one image per year and in some cases spring and summer imagery for only a limited number of years thus a comprehensive analysis of intra annual variability has not been undertaken previous studies indicate that remote sensing technology and image classification techniques can reliably quantify the extent of surface water area fluctuations e g vanderhoof et al 2018 in addition to remote sensing another way to determine water area is to use a stage area relation that has been developed for specific lakes within the area to determine changes in area that would give much better temporal resolution of changes in area however stage area relationships for smaller lakes and wetlands are normally not available sethre et al 2005 used a traditional density slicing technique of the short wave infrared swir band band 5 from landsat thematic mapper tm images to delineate water bodies and examine wetland and lake area fluctuations in the devils lake basin dlb todhunter and rundquist 2004 utilized landsat imagery to classify density slicing and mixed pixel analyses waterbodies and identified a three fold increase in total open water in nelson county southeastern area of the dlb from 1992 to 2001 vanderhoof and alexander 2016 used landsat images to classify waterbodies and found that wetland connectivity increased as the area of devils lake expanded however all these studies used cloud free imagery of specific dates since it is challenging to obtain cloud free imagery for the same season every year none of these studies could develop a comprehensive time series of surface water areas for example vanderhoof et al 2018 used only 15 landsat images 2 spring 6 summer and 7 fall for the 1990 2011 study period in the dlb so inter annual and intra annual surface water area variability were not sufficiently captured we believe there is greater variability of surface water area than that shown by treating the 1990 2018 period as a single drought to deluge cycle most studies e g vanderhoof et al 2018 report on surface water area increases over the entire drought to deluge transition a more critical study of surface water area variability is needed to identify surface water area response to hydroclimatic drivers at more detailed temporal and spatial scales and with greater attention to inter annual and intra annual climatic variability within the broader drought to deluge transition to address this knowledge gap we utilize the global surface water dataset gswd developed by pekel et al 2016 which consists of an annual water dataset of permanent and seasonal water area from all available landsat imageries based upon a big data algorithm in addition to the annual time series pekel et al 2016 developed a monthly surface water area time series using unsupervised classification based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and hue saturation value hsv of multi spectral landsat series imageries the pekel et al 2016 method provides an excellent dataset to investigate inter annual and intra annual surface water area change in the dlb the impact of climatic variability on surface water area is a vital research topic because even though lake and wetland areas are always changing the potential for changes over an increased range in areas is greater and unknown during a time of climate change feyisa et al 2014 our research questions are what is the impact of the recent drought to deluge period on annual surface water area permanent and seasonal water area in the dlb during 1990 2018 is this period adequately represented as a single wet period with increasing surface water area or are multiple periods of wetter or drier phases embedded within this longer drought to deluge period each with distinct hydrologic responses to climatic variability how does surface water area vary on an intra annual spring to summer time scale during this study period and how is this seasonality connected with the hydrologic change in the dlb in the ngp water levels peak during the spring season and recede to the lowest point during the summer or fall season our primary means to address these research questions is to analyze yearly and monthly water pixels from remotely sensed imagery for 1990 2018 we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water area to investigate how surface water area responds to variations in the precipitation regime and other critical hydroclimatic drivers such as streamflow and evaporation we hypothesize that two embedded dry periods within the longer term climatic wetting transition will have a pronounced impact on streamflow and open water evaporation which will influence the surface water area of lakes and wetlands our study is of special scientific interest as the region is expected to experience wetter climatic conditions over the next few decades vecchia 2008 which will result in even larger lake and wetland areas that result in substantial human impact in addition depletion of terrestrial water storage in mid century and slight gains in late century from gcm results under rcp 6 0 scenario are anticipated by pokhrel et al 2021 2 study area methodology 2 1 study area the dlb is in north central north dakota usa fig 1 and extends from the southern slopes of the turtle mountains to stump lake swenson and colby 1955 the basin topography is of glacial origin and has a great number of shallow depressions of small lakes ponds and wetlands moraines outwash plains and drumlins swenson and colby 1955 zhang et al 2009 shook et al 2013 the millions of pothole depressions in the ppr have great ecological significance for waterfowl although federal programs have marginalized rangeland from agricultural purposes to enhance waterfowl breeding zhang et al 2009 the ppr is a vital north american agricultural production area vanderhoof and alexander 2016 and the dlb is dominated by herbaceous vegetation hay pasture and cultivated crops fig 1g vanderhoof and alexander 2016 the fine textured soils are a result of glacial outwash and have a low vertical permeability van der kamp and hayashi 1998 basin relief is about 206 m with the highest point of elevation in the northwestern basin tip at 673 m and the lowest point of elevation at the center of the southern part of the basin at 413 m fig 1f regional precipitation and evaporation have been affected by global climate change zhang et al 2009 ludden et al 1983 in recent decades the dlb has experienced a century scale shift from a dry to a wet cycle that commenced in about 1940 and accelerated sharply in 1993 fig s1 ballard et al 2014 sethre et al 2005 rodell et al 2018 under these sustained wet conditions the low basin relief led to extreme flooding due to spring runoff events and increased precipitation with evaporation being the only major loss of water from the basin vanderhoof and alexander 2016 ludden et al 1983 swenson and colby 1955 the shift to wetter conditions produced large water level fluctuations in both wetlands and permanent lakes and showed that wetlands and lakes should be examined concurrently to assess the impact of increasing regional wetness on total surface water extent sethre et al 2005 the open water areas in the ngp are a mix of permanent lakes semi permanent wetlands and seasonal wetlands the wetlands expand in number size permanence and connectivity by both fill and spill shook et al 2013 and fill and merge processes leibowitz et al 2016 the distinction between lakes more permanent wetlands and seasonal wetlands is not always clear as wetlands can merge with other wetlands merge with expanding lakes and transition from seasonal wetlands to semi permanent lakes vanderhoof and alexander 2016 vanderhoof et al 2016 wetland complex hydrology in the dlb follows similar principles to those in the canadian prairie pothole region with the dominant source of runoff being snowmelt the most important hydrological event on the prairie spence et al 2019 todhunter 2018 mcdonnell et al 2021 much of the runoff drains internally to smaller prairie pothole wetlands and only slowly infiltrates to groundwater due to low soil permeability when wetland storage capacity is exceeded outflow occurs creating spillage into lower relief potholes shook et al 2013 because of long periods without spilling large portions of the region are non contributing to local streams when potholes fill however wetland connectivity allows water to travel to a stream and increase the overall contributing area making it difficult to quantify depressional storage of wetlands shook et al 2013 water input to prairie wetlands by blowing snow wind transport melting of snow and direct precipitation onto open water surfaces are primary runoff generators shook et al 2013 fig 2b shows recent fluctuations of streamflow at the outlet gauge of the mauvais coulee basin and gauge height at the lake alice irvine channel near churchs ferry nd the gauge at the lake alice irvine channel near churchs ferry nd was moved to near hwy 2 fig 2 a because of high flooding conditions in fig 2b the gauge height can be considered a proxy for lake level as both gauges are located at the bank of the lake the lake level rise is strongly associated with peak streamflow at mauvais coulee basin during 1998 2011 because of climatic wetting the peak flow substantially increased from 60 m3 sec to 100 m3 sec which was responsible for a 2 0 m lake level rise however during the post 2011 period the recession of lake level to streamflow at the mauvais coulee gauge was inconclusive as peak flows were not strongly correlated with lake level table s1 2 2 methodology we used remotely sensed yearly permanent and seasonal and monthly water area pixels to accomplish the research goals since our objective was to report annual changes in surface water area we utilized a global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 that reported both annual permanent water area pwa and seasonal water area swa we also use the gswd s monthly total water area to examine the intra annual or seasonal variation to determine surface water extent we downloaded data from the yearly and monthly water dataset gswd for 1990 2018 since our objectives included assessing the accuracy of the methods we used aerial imagery from the national agriculture imagery program naip and google earth engine after compiling the surface water extent time series we investigated the relationship of remotely sensed surface water extent with hydroclimatic variables such as streamflow precipitation and open water evaporation these relationships helped identify the key hydroclimatic drivers and their relative impact upon surface water extent dynamics 2 2 1 remotely sensed data processing the global surface water dataset gswd yearly and monthly water pixels pekel et al 2016 were used to create time series of annual and monthly surface water area this dataset is free and contains 30 m resolution class images for 35 years 1984 2018 using unsupervised classification based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and hue saturation value hsv of multi spectral landsat series imageries including landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli the annual https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog jrc gsw1 3 yearlyhistory and monthly https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog jrc gsw1 3 monthlyhistory gswd water histories are available via google earth search engine since the data processing uses multiple imagery 16 days overpass and oblique angle for a month it can classify a pixel as water or non water in case of obstruction by cloud cover for one or two scenes however in some months we are not able to extract water data due to substantial cloud cover during all landsat overpasses we believe such an approach of using composite imagery at monthly and annual scale over regional scale can give us much better temporal resolution than using landsat scenes of selected dates the gswd dataset has been cited by more than 1800 research articles over the last five years and used in many surface water body change studies e g zhang et al 2017 tan et al 2019 open water is a highly variable land surface feature and a confusing spectral target due to the sensitivity of its spectral properties at the wavelengths measured by the tm etm and oli sensors to chlorophyll concentration total suspended solids colored dissolved organic matter load depths and bed load material for shallow waters as well as variations in observation conditions sun target sensor geometry and optical thickness pekel et al 2016 addressed these challenges by using the big data technology systems named as expert systems lu and weng 2007 kartikeyan et al 1995 shoshany 2008 visual analytics keim et al 2008 and evidential reasoning yang and xu 2002 expert systems allow the user to deal with the range of conditions encountered that discriminate water pixels from other pixels while visual analytics tie human cognitive and perceptual abilities to the storage and processing capabilities of the cloud computing platforms finally evidential reasoning was used to solve the problems of emergent data uncertainties and quality issues detailed equations describing the likely water cluster hull and cluster overlaps in the multidimensional feature space are given in the supplementary information of pekel et al 2016 2 2 2 accuracy assessment although the high resolution water maps from pekel et al 2016 were evaluated globally we believe the accuracy of this dataset needs to be reevaluated in the context of the dlb as its accuracy assessment lacked sufficient number of locations where accuracy could be assessed in the ngp ideally we would like to assess pekel et al 2016 data against field observations however field observations on water non water occurrence over a large area like devils lake basin are rare thus we utilized the imagery from naip and google earth pro as a proxy for field data for water area evaluation we did not use naip and google earth pro to achieve our research goals due to their limited availability their availability only extends back to 2002 whereas our study begins in 1990 in contrast the pekel et al 2016 dataset starts from 1984 and provides a long time series of water areas in the dlb region the use of the imagery from naip and google earth pro can inform us on the uncertainty of detecting water areas in pekel et al 2016 one of the examples is the comparison between fig s2f and s2i fig s2i shows the black color pixels around the wetland which are not detected by pekel et al 2016 during the agricultural growing season naip obtains aerial imagery and produces orthophotography of the continental us the aerial imagery has a 1 m spatial resolution in a default spectral resolution in the natural colors of red green and blue rgb as of 2007 naip includes a near infrared band along with rgb and can be accessed directly https gis apfo usda gov arcgis rest services however naip images were not available in selected years during 2002 2018 so we utilized the google earth pro for accuracy assessment for these years we selected the accuracy assessment locations both manually on screen digitization and automatically using computer generated random locations from uniform spatial distribution of coordinates we believe that computer generated random locations are useful as they reduce the possibility of bias in the selection process we manually digitized 100 polygons and used matlab to generate 79 random polygons over the study area both manual and automated polygons were characterized as water or non water based on naip imagery and compared to water and non water pixels from monthly water maps during growing season from pekel et al 2016 for several years table 2 2004 2005 2009 2010 2012 2014 2018 likewise for other years 2002 2003 2006 2007 2008 2011 2013 both manual and automated polygons were characterized as water or non water based on google earth pro imagery and evaluated against water and non water pixels from monthly water maps of pekel et al 2016 we quantified the error of omission underestimation and commission overestimation in percentage and overall accuracy of the monthly water maps we also compared the devils lake area from the monthly dataset with lake elevation area volume tables from the united states geologic survey usgs united states geological survey 2022a and used the monthly lake area data from pekel et al 2016 and mean monthly lake level observations for these comparisons the variation of lake level within a month was less than 15 cm thus the use of mean lake level was adequate for these comparisons 2 2 3 hydrologic trend analyses 2 2 3 1 annual and seasonal surface water area the accuracy of the water pixel maps from pekel et al 2016 for 17 years 2002 2018 was evaluated by comparing the waterbody areas detected from the high resolution naip imagery and high resolution imagery in google earth pro we selected accuracy assessment locations manually using on screen digitization and automatically using computer generated random locations from the uniform spatial distribution of coordinates we manually digitized 100 polygons covering a total of 8 37 km2 in fig 3a and used matlab to generate 79 random polygons covering a total of 6 00 km2 in fig 3b the confirmation of water occurrence in these polygons is based on the on screen visual inspection of high resolution naip imagery the yearly gswd provides information on the occurrence of pwa and swa over earth s continental land area pekel et al 2016 while the monthly dataset documents the occurrence of total water area twa on a monthly basis the european commission joint research centre jrc funded and developed this dataset and maintains a current archive we drafted algorithms to download yearly and monthly water data for the dlb during 1990 2018 in the https code earthengine google com since our objectives are to examine variations in surface water area during climatic episodes embedded within the longer term drought to deluge cycle we inspect twa pwa and swa from the yearly gswd dataset we visually inspected and determined different phases of water area fluctuations and utilized the mann kendall test e g molnár ramírez 2001 to statistically evaluate specific trends while annual water data is available for all years without availability limitations due to substantial cloud cover the monthly dataset did experience issues of cloud cover cloud cover during the cold season oct feb often made it difficult to visualize water pixels during the winter season we visually inspected all monthly water maps from 1990 to 2018 and developed a database of maps with very little cloud the monthly water maps data used are shown in table 1 we determined that the april water maps best represented the spring season water area if the april water map was not available we used the may water map as a proxy for the spring season water area similarly the august water map was considered to represent the summer water area since summer evaporation peaks during august the july water map was used as a proxy for summer water area if the august water map was not available the timing of maximum and minimum intra seasonal water levels varies between seasonal and permanent water bodies todhunter and knish 2014 found a median date of 24 may for maximum water level and a median date of 7 november for minimum water level during 1965 2010 for devils lake a permanent lake seasonal water bodies would have a similar spring maximum water level date as permanent water bodies since water level maximums for both systems are due to the spring snowmelt freshet seasonal water bodies experience a much greater range of seasonal minimum water levels than do permanent water bodies our selection of july august is a mid point between the median minimum water levels of seasonal and permanent water bodies spring or summer water maps were not available for years 1991 1997 2001 2002 2007 2008 and 2012 so surface water area differences between the spring and summer seasons were not available for these years 2 2 3 2 precipitation and evaporation data we used precipitation data 1990 2018 to interpret and explain the surface water area changes hourly rainfall was measured at the north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn station shown in fig 1e rainfall is measured at the station using tipping bucket at a height of 0 914 m however snowfall estimates were not available through ndawn thus parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism at a daily time step was used for snowfall values daly et al 2008 prism data has been used in many recent studies sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 small et al 2006 todhunter 2016 todhunter fietzek devries 2016 and to gain confidence on the winter precipitation data we compared and evaluated it to a station at brandon manitoba the station at brandon manitoba was selected due to its proximity to the study site and having a nearly complete and highly reliable data for the study period overall the prism snowfall data is in good agreement with the annual snowfall data at brandon manitoba we also utilized simulated evapotranspiration et and open water evaporation flux e using the cold region hydrologic model crhm set up built by van hoy et al 2020 the crhm is an object oriented multi physics modular modeling system that allows an investigator to set up hydrological models that represent key cold regions hydrological processes pomeroy et al 2007 crhm has a flexible modular design and is spatially distributed based on hydrologic response units hrus allowing for fine scale resolution and parameterization in van hoy et al 2020 we utilized modules representing governing cold region hydrological processes such as frozen partially frozen and unfrozen soil infiltration blowing snow transport energy balance in the snowpack governing melt processes evapotranspiration fill and spill hydrology in wetland and wetland processes in depression areas for the mauvais coulee basin the largest headwater basin draining to devils lake open water evaporation flux was obtained from the crhm platform hourly open water evaporation flux estimates obtained using the priestley taylor equation sumner jacobs 2005 that incorporates air temperature relative humidity wind speed incoming solar radiation and simulated snow status using snow water equivalent swe these input variables were taken from the ndawn stations fig 1e et simulations in crhm were obtained using the penman monteith combination method monteith 1965 3 results 3 1 accuracy assessment of annual and monthly water pixel classification overall the performance of the monthly water maps using the error of omission error of commission and overall accuracy percentage on detecting water pixels and non water pixels is satisfactory table 2 we also compared the annual water data total water area of pekel et al 2016 with the water class of the national land cover dataset nlcd since the nlcd data are only available for selected years our comparison is limited to years 2001 2004 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 table 3 the overall accuracy for manually digitized and randomly selected polygons is over 90 demonstrating strong performance to further evaluate the pekel et al 2016 gswd data we compared the devils lake area with lake level measurements from the usgs gauge near devils lake united states geological survey 2022b fig 4 shows a fitted line with r 2 of 0 98 between lake area and lake level indicating the strong performance of the pekal et al 2016 classification scheme 3 2 annual spatiotemporal variability of surface water area the water pixel maps of annual pwa exhibit a large spatiotemporal variation over the study period figs 5 and 6 in particular the number of permanent waterbodies increased in the northern part of the dlb while the large lakes in the southern dlb expanded and merged into a larger waterbody figs 5 and 6 overall the twa increased during the study period from 363 to 1146 km2 fig 7a pwa increased from 301 to 867 km2 accounting for between 83 and 76 of twa fig 7b most of the permanent water pixels represent large lakes such as lake alice devils lake and stump lake most of the seasonal water pixels are generally considered as wetlands in the dlb and they show an increase from 62 to 279 km2 over the study period ranging from 17 to 24 of twa fig 7c table 4 shows an upward trend for twa and pwa for 1990 2018 based upon the mann kendall trend test that is significant at p 0 05 which is consistent with other studies in the dlb e g sethre et al 2005 todhunter 2021 and ngp vanderhoof et al 2018 however swa shows a weak downward trend that was only significant at p 0 581 table 4 the temporal dynamics of the pwa lake areas are more in phase with that of twa than for swa fig 7 we identified four periods based on visual inspection and trend analyses using the mann kendall trend test table 4 1990 1999 wetting 2000 2003 stable wet conditions due to the ngp drought fang and pomeroy 2007 van hoy et al 2020 todhunter 2021 2004 2013 recent wetting van hoy et al 2020 and 2014 2018 recent drying van hoy et al 2020 3 3 seasonal variation of total water area in this section we use monthly data to examine the seasonal variation of twa in the dlb fig 8 the long term monthly twa temporal pattern is consistent with that of annual pwa fig 7b showing a steady progressive increase from 1990 through 2013 and a small decrease after that year a consistent seasonal pattern is observed in which the spring season april or may twa is substantially higher than the summer season july or august twa fig 8 in fig s3 we assume april or may water areas represent the spring season while july or august water areas represent the summer season we simplify the monthly twa representation in fig 8 into spring and summer seasons in fig s3 to more clearly represent the seasonal variability fig s3 shows that swa experiences a larger seasonal fluctuation than does pwa fig s2 shows the seasonal change of a small wetland during the 2009 warm season fig s2a f the wetland water area decreased by more than 50 between may 1 2 km2 and august 0 45 km2 shallower areas are more susceptible to summer evaporation than deeper areas as shown in the bathymetry map in fig s2g the wetland water area recovered somewhat to 0 76 km2 during the fall season sep and oct due to lower evaporation and higher rainfall fig s2e f 4 discussion in the following we discuss the spatiotemporal variability of the annual and seasonal water area fluctuations and provide a summary of the study results 4 1 spatiotemporal variability of annual water area table 4 and fig 7 identify four periods based on visual inspection and trend analyses using the mann kendall trend test 1990 1999 wetting 2000 2003 stable conditions due to the ngp drought 2004 2013 recent wetting and 2013 2018 recent drying the 1990 1999 period shows wetting in which the dlb consistently received substantial snowfall with subsequent snow accumulation and melt and rainfall resulting in the expansion of existing lakes and the creation of new lakes and smaller water bodies figs 5 6 7b and 7c pwa lakes showed a steady large increase with time while swa wetlands showed a more dynamic temporal pattern with larger inter annual fluctuations the hydrological processes controlling the water budget of devils lake are summarized in todhunter 2018 2021 and these processes are similar for all permanent water areas in the ngp devils lake is an amplifier terminal lake whose water budget exhibits positive feedback relationships during prolonged dry or wet periods during sustained dry periods permanent water areas have a precipitation dominated water budget in which direct precipitation onto the open water surface is the major input to lake volume with streamflow providing a much smaller contribution as the transition from the drought to the deluge period began a set of positive feedback mechanisms gradually became established in which a long term increase in precipitation led to higher basin antecedent soil moisture content increased generation of surface runoff higher runoff ratios runoff depth precipitation depth and increased surface runoff for devils lake a sustained increase in precipitation of 24 led to an average runoff ratio increase from 0 3 to 6 4 the contribution of surface streamflow to the input of water to the lake increased from an average of 12 3 48 1 as the lake transitioned to a streamflow dominated water budget todhunter 2018 2021 because lake net evaporation lake evaporation minus direct precipitation onto the lake is almost always negative streamflow must be maintained at a high level to compensate for large negative lake net evaporation so short dry spells or even pauses in higher precipitation inputs can lead to a reduction in lake volume with a resulting decrease in lake level and lake area the hydrologic processes that control pwa are more responsive to long term low frequency climatic fluctuations while the hydrological processes controlling swa are more sensitive to short term high frequency climatic variations the years 1992 1994 and 1996 experienced a pronounced increase in swa particularly in the southern devils lake area and eastern edmore coulee area dlb fig 7c there was also a moderate expansion of wetlands and an increase in wetland numbers in the northern mauvais coulee and starkweather coulee region and western parts near leeds of the dlb a statistically significant upward trend p 0 05 was obtained for twa and pwa table 4 while the trend obtained for the swa just missed this statistical threshold table 4 visual inspection of fig 7c shows two distinct periods of increasing and decreasing swa during 1990 1999 swa increased during the first six years 1990 1996 while it experienced a large decline during 1997 1999 due to reduced rainfall and higher evaporation the 1990 1999 period is hydrologically characterized by increased streamflow due to greater spilling and filling of wetland complexes and increased contributing area due to greater surface water connectivity dumanski et al 2015 the process of connectivity between surface water bodies was accelerated at the end of this period e g 1997 and 1999 resulting in massive flooding in the dlb we believe the higher precipitation an average of 91 mm snowfall water equivalent and 450 mm rainfall reduced open water evaporation 671 mm and higher snowmelt streamflow resulted in the twa increase table 5 fig s4 the contribution of pwa to twa decreased from 83 to 70 and the swa contribution increased from 17 to 30 during 1990 1999 period the 2000 2003 period experienced sustained high twa and pwa due to memory effects from the previous wet period 1990 1999 the short dry period from 2000 to 2003 was insufficiently long to have a large impact on streamflow input to lakes so pwa remained stable fig 7b due to the 2000 2003 period drought condition both twa and swa experienced minor fluctuations with no significant trend in the mann kendall test statistic table 4 swa started to decline in the summer of 1997 and depletion continued through 2003 due to persistent dry summer conditions we believe the lower mean annual precipitation 510 mm and higher open surface water evaporation 773 mm are responsible for producing the weak twa and swa fluctuations during this period table 5 fig s4 note that the contribution of pwa to twa decreased from 75 to 73 while the swa contribution increased from 25 to 27 during this period the ngp drought had almost no impact on pwa since that increase was driven by streamflow inputs that respond to lower frequency climatic variations and exhibit greater memory effects and a longer hydrologic lag the drought had a larger influence on swa showing that smaller water bodies are more vulnerable to drought conditions and become depleted more quickly a finding consistent with zheng et al 2009 during 2000 2003 the annual fluctuations in twa are almost entirely due to changes in swa this shows that changes in lake and wetland surface water area respond to climatic drivers occurring at different climatic durations and with different hydrologic lags and memory effects after this short duration prairie drought 2000 2003 the dlb experienced noticeable wetting during the 2004 2013 period fig 7a the wet condition did not become fully established until 2009 although precipitation started to increase in the fall of 2004 prior to 2009 the dlb experienced mild wetting due to wet winter and dry summer conditions mahmood et al 2017 table 4 shows an upward trend for twa and pwa with 95 confidence pwa remained stable until the wet spell and positive feedback effects became more fully established in 2009 leading to a sustained increase in pwa fig 7b although the upward trend for swa did not reach the adopted level of statistical significance a positive z score supports an upward trend since 2008 twa pwa and swa have increased across the dlb large increases were observed in 2009 2011 and 2013 due to very wet winters and large snowmelt and rain on snow runoff van hoy et al 2020 these years coincided with years of regional flooding in the ngp amid this wet period 2012 was observed as a very dry year for both winter and summer periods the pwa contribution to twa increased from 66 to 72 while the swa contribution decreased from 34 to 28 during 2004 2013 period during this recent wetting period fill spill processes and variable contributing area exerted strong control on streamflow generation across the dlb although the effect upon swa was much stronger than upon pwa e g van hoy et al 2020 the depressional storage located at the outlet of the subbasin plays a key role on the connectivity and resultant contributing area in the dlb depressional storage often reached its full capacity in the headwater basin mauvais coulee basin in the 2004 2013 period the contributing area also exceeded 95 of total basin area during the spring snowmelt period van hoy et al 2020 the years of high depressional storage and greater contributing area in 2009 and 2011 are consistent with our findings across the dlb although our results show the highest pwa in 2013 van hoy et al 2020 suggest that depressional storage and contributing area failed to reach their full capacity in the mauvais coulee basin due to high evaporation in the summer of 2012 we believe the higher precipitation average of 125 mm snowfall water equivalent and 500 mm rainfall longer winter and larger snow cover area reduced open water evaporation mean of 790 mm and higher snowmelt streamflow mean of 54 mm led to the increase in the twa table 5 fig s4 the 2014 2018 period shows a decrease in twa pwa and swa indicating a drying period in the dlb fig 7 a b c table 4 shows downward trends for twa pwa and swa at the 95 confidence level however the contribution of pwa 75 and 76 in 2014 and 2018 respectively and swa 25 and 24 in 2014 and 2018 respectively to twa show little variation in this period van hoy et al 2020 reported a higher evaporative fraction ratio of total evaporation to total precipitation during this period indicating that atmospheric evaporative demand was higher than the vertical input precipitation and lateral input inflow to water bodies fluxes the average open water evaporation was 853 mm during the 2014 2018 recent drying period while it was 773 mm during the 2000 2003 stable dry period van hoy et al 2020 table 5 fig s4 as a result decreases in twa pwa and swa were observed during 2014 2018 whereas they showed only minor changes during 2000 2003 swa responded more quickly to the reduced precipitation in the recent drying period while pwa exhibited a longer hydrologic lag and did not show a significant decrease until 2017 2018 when annual precipitation was especially low amplifier terminal lakes also exhibit positive feedback mechanisms that accelerate decreases in pwa during sustained dry periods a decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in basin antecedent moisture content that reduces the runoff ratio reduced streamflow input to open water bodies combined with increased open water evaporation led to a decrease in lake volume and subsequent decrease in pwa todhunter 2018 2021 we explored the impact of newly built outlets to drain water from devils lake to the sheyenne river as an explanation for the dlb wetland loss for this period the volume of water pumped from devils lake to the sheyenne river by outlets was insignificant through water year 2010 todhunter 2018 after 2010 the outlet discharge volume approximated the annual lake net evaporation of 240 mm yr 1 todhunter 2016 and is now a significant factor in reducing the volume of the merged devils lake and stump lake system current outlet discharge is not significant enough however to have a noticeable impact in reducing swa of dlb wetlands shabani et al 2017 seasonal and inter annual patterns of surface water area fluctuations have been investigated previously in the ngp poff et al 1997 beeri and phillips 2007 leibowitz et al 2016 vanderhoof et al 2018 these studies have focused upon the larger scale drought to deluge cycle experienced in the ngp over the last four decades e g vanderhoof et al 2018 the impacts of wetting on surface water extent and watershed storage influence the hydrologic response of a watershed by triggering a fill spill phenomenon and expanding the contributing area and wetland connectivity evenson et al 2016 golden et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 surface water area responses during shorter wet or dry episodes embedded within this longer term drought to deluge cycle have not been critically examined particularly during the 2000 2003 prairie drought and the recent 2014 2018 streamflow drought in the ngp van hoy et al 2020 there is no doubt the ngp experienced a significant p 0 001 increase in total surface water area and number of surface water bodies from the late 1980 s drought condition vanderhoof et al 2018 however the wetting phenomenon was not continuous in time but was slowed and interrupted by drier shorter term climatic conditions while other studies reported one period of continuous surface water area increment vanderhoof et al 2018 we detected two distinct wet periods of increasing surface water area 1990 1999 2004 2013 amid this novel long term wet continuum we add new knowledge by reporting on two periods of surface water area expansion separated by the 2000 2003 drought period and followed by another downward trend in twa during the 2014 2018 drought period twa increased in two different phases 1990 1999 and 2004 2013 but was invariant during the 2000 2003 drought period and decreased during the 2014 2018 drought period the response of pwa and swa to the long term drought to deluge transition as well as the four phases identified in fig 7 and table 4 show important differences analyzing changes in twa by itself mixes two hydrologic systems that respond differently to hydroclimatic drivers and are controlled by different hydrologic processes 4 2 seasonal water area fluctuations the spring season twa strongly responded during the 1990 1999 wetting period showing a significant increase across the dlb but then weakened during 1999 2003 fig 8 since 2005 spring season twa increased substantially and peaked in 2013 1350 km2 we believe the large snowmelt events of 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 triggered the large increase in twa from 1015 2005 spring to 1350 km2 2013 spring after 2013 the spring season twa declined due to a lack of snow accumulation dry winter and low snowfall and reduced snowmelt runoff to wetlands and lakes van hoy et al 2020 the summer season twa also responded to wetting during 1990 1999 since 1999 summer season twa remained almost unchanged until 2009 partly due to the consumption of summer rainfall by evapotranspiration however during 2009 2010 summer twa increased substantially due to the dominance of summer rainfall over evaporation and the lingering effect of the spring twa increase during 2014 2018 the summer twa also decreased although at a more gradual rate than spring twa showing the different hydrologic lags associated with wetlands and lakes the difference between the spring and summer season twa shows a transition from a streamflow dominated to an evaporation dominated hydrologic system after 2009 fig 9 during this period snowmelt induced streamflow became the dominant driver of twa todhunter 2021 and its dominance peaked in 2009 we identify the 2000 2013 period as a streamflow dominated system with gaining streamflow while the 2014 2018 period is an evaporation dominated system with decreasing streamflow van hoy et al 2020 these evaporation dominated hydrologic system characteristics apply to both permanent lake and seasonal wetland water areas the combination of reduced streamflow input decreased direct precipitation onto the lake and increased lake evaporation led to a large increase in lake net evaporation that reduced the lake water volume lowered lake level and reduced lake area similarly a large increase in open water evaporation with reduced precipitation and runoff caused a large reduction in swa overall the temporal dynamics of monthly total water area are controlled by cold region vertical and lateral fluxes such as snowmelt inflow runoff open water evaporation and rainfall spring swa is dominated by snowmelt inflow runoff and in site ice melt while summer and fall swa is dominated by evaporation and rainfall during winter wetland complexes are completely frozen and covered by a thick ice layer our selection of months representing spring april or may and summer august or july raises some uncertainty on the difference in twa between the spring and summer seasons however the twa difference between april and may is small 35 km2 in 1992 and april is only used for 2004 2005 and 2016 similarly the twa difference between august and july is small 20 km2 in 2000 and 5 km2 in 2015 and the july twa was only used for 2009 2014 and 2018 we believe such small differences would not change our scientific findings 4 3 summary we show the spatial distribution of the transitions between permanent water seasonal water and bare land in fig 10 and summarize the net land cover changes during the study period in table 6 the dlb wide transition from bare land to permanent 424 7 km2 and seasonal 310 6 km2 water area are observed during 1990 99 period in contrast during the following stable period 2000 2003 changes were minimal in the recent wetting period 2004 2013 a net gain of 182 0 km2 in permanent water from seasonal and bare land was observed while 96 4 km2 changed from bare land to seasonal water area these changes are heavily concentrated around devils lake itself finally during the recent drying period 2014 2018 a significant loss 180 3 km2 of seasonal water area to bare land occurred 5 conclusions over the 29 year study period an analysis of surface water extent during a long term drought to deluge cycle showed an overall net increase of twa pwa and swa but with important variations during shorter climatic phases four phases of surface water area fluctuations were identified during 1990 2018 1990 1999 wetting 2000 2003 stable 2004 2013 recent wetting and 2014 2018 recent drying in both wetting periods 1990 1999 2004 2013 a substantial gain of twa and pwa was observed however during the 2004 2013 period the increase of twa started in 2009 despite a wet condition that began in 2004 annual twa and pwa decreased during the recent drying period while they barely fluctuated during the earlier dry period 2000 2003 the time series of intra annual water area changes showed patterns similar to that of annual twa twa peaked in the spring season and gradually recessed during the summer season due to high evaporation before a slight recovery in the fall season our findings show that the difference between spring and summer twa is very high amid a deluge period e g 2009 2011 2013 while it is much lower as the system approaches a drought condition the surface water area mapping from landsat imagery has a few limitations which can be sources of uncertainty the 30 m spatial resolution limits the ability of the pekel et al 2016 algorithm to map water in smaller 900 m2 wetlands our annual surface water is based on imagery from the spring and summer seasons as the landsat imagery is not available to interpret during the winter season due to substantial cloud cover the availability of landsat imagery during the spring and summer seasons was limited during the 1990 2000 period due to cloud cover and other reasons future studies are recommended to use imageries from the optical sensors with a higher spatial resolution to detect smaller water bodies in the dlb such potential sensors include ikonos quickbird and recently launched sentinel 2 active sensors synthetic aperture radar imaging are also recommended to map water bodies during cloudy day and night conditions the use of synthetic aperture radar e g sentinel 1 and radarsat can be helpful in mapping water areas during the winter and spring season when the ngp has substantial cloud cover in addition to using advanced remote sensing technology we also recommend conducting a future study comparing the inter annual stage variability with wet to dry variability in stage our findings on the recent drought and its influence on surface water extent provide specific scientific and socioeconomic insights as the dry condition is continuing to the present day and ngp streams and lakes experienced their lowest water level in the 2021 summer the decreasing trend of wetland area also influences the water table of the shallow glacial till aquifer our findings are relevant to water resource management in the dlb as recent climate change studies e g bonsal et al 2017 masud et al 2017 have predicted that the future ngp climate will continue to experience alternating periods of drought and deluge conditions our findings on the lake area change pwa have implications for assessing flood damage as vast areas of fertile

7654,study region the oases of the lower reaches of inland river basin in south xinjiang northwest china study focus the increase of man made water demands has led to water shortage and water pollution issues worldwide it is important to determine the contributions of oasis change to socio hydrological system resilience for oasis sustainability in arid regions this study proposes an integrative socio hydrological resilience assessment framework to examine the relationships between oasis evolution and system resilience at spatial temporal scales hooke s law and parallelogram law are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the resilience of drought water resource utilization and water pollution and comprehensive resilience of socio hydrological system meanwhile the impact of oasis expansion on socio hydrological system resilience is quantified new hydrological insights for the region the research and application of oases in hotan prefecture of northwest china have proved that the proposed framework is very promising for assessing the relationships between oasis evolution and socio hydrological system resilience in arid regions during the study period from 2009 to 2018 the oases show expansion contraction expansion trends there is significant negative correlation between oasis change and system resilience the population size socioeconomic development level and structure of cultivated land are the main factors affecting the oasis area and system resilience the expanded agricultural irrigation reduces the resilience of socio hydrological system the water pollution has gradually affected oasis sustainability and system resilience this study also provides a management implication concerning the impact of water pollution on the oasis sustainability in the future work graphical abstract ga1 keywords socio hydrological system resilience assessment spatio temporal variation oasis expansion northwest china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human society and natural ecology constitute a coupled social and natural ecosystem water as the core element of natural ecosystem has a close mutual relationship with human society constituting a coupled socio hydrological system with the increasing global population and demands for water resources the current consumption pattern of freshwater no longer meets the level that can be maintained by the future supply wang et al 2009 pörtner et al 2021 in face of the expansion of the scope of human activities and the deepening of the degree of influence human activities have directly or indirectly contributed to a variety of water issues such as water shortage and the deterioration of water quality liu et al 2012 sustainable water resources management requires a comprehensive approach to understanding the water use mechanisms and their response to internal and external disturbances muhtar et al 2021 to ensure the sustainable development of water resources the resilience as a key indicator is proposed to incorporate into the complex and dynamic interactions between human and water systems hjorth et al 2013 carpenter et al 2005 wang et al 2009 xu et al 2018 only by better understanding the nature of human interactions with water systems can water resources be managed effectively and sustainably elshafei et al 2014 therefore the socio hydrological system resilience has become an indispensable index for water resource management bakarji et al 2017 hough et al 2018 dewulf et al 2019 pang et al 2022 the investigation on the resilience of socio hydrological system is the key to formulate measures to deal with water resource shortage caused by the rapid development of human society worldwide especially in the arid regions oasis is a unique landscape suitable for plant growth and human habitation within the desert under stable water source supplies in the arid regions xue et al 2022a bie et al 2020 xue et al 2019 the oasis is a typical and ideal area for assessing the socio hydrological system resilience chehbouni et al 2022 for instance the oases account for about 5 of the arid and semi arid regions in china but 90 of the population and 95 of the socio economy are concentrated in the oasis areas abulizi et al 2017 bie et al 2020 xue et al 2022b oases have become an important place for human to engage in various social activities china israel and other middle eastern countries are expanding artificial oases for agricultural production muhtar et al 2021 li et al 2022 due to the continuous expansion of irrigation based agriculture which has resulted in surface water scarcity and overexploitation of groundwater many scholars have paid much attention to the integrated management of oasis water resources and the relationship between water resources and oasis sustainability amarasinghe et al 2016 meng et al 2013 salgot et al 2014 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2021 in recent years the most scholars have focused on the driving forces of oasis change and water shortage assessment in the oasis regions zhou et al 2017 bie et al 2020 li et al 2022 however there are few studies on examining relationships between the oasis expansion and the resilience of socio hydrological system in the arid regions the concept of resilience was first proposed by hooling in the 1970 s holling et al 1974 the resilience is presented to describe the ability of a dynamic system to maintain the same basic structure under pressure having widely applied in various fields such as ecology and psychology hosseini et al 2016 fan et al 2021 resilience as an intersectional concept can link insights from different disciplinary approaches so many scholars have conducted researches on resilience but their understandings and measures of the concept of resilience are different hashimoto et al 1982 fiering 1982a b c moy et al 1986 qi et al 2016 many qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods have been proposed to measure the resilience of the system the qualitative evaluation includes the establishment of the elastic evaluation framework cutter et al 2008 kahan et al 2009 falkenmark 2017 falkenmark et al 2021 and the evaluation based on case analysis rudberg et al 2022 in the water resource resilience conceptual description qualitative and quantitative assessments are main methods boithias et al 2014 falkenmark et al 2017 jaramillo et al 2018 hall et al 2019 among them the standardization and precision of quantitative evaluation are higher making the theory more generality in the field of socio hydrological system a large number of studies have used qualitative assessment methods to assess water resource resilience dewulf et al 2019 ciullo et al 2017 falkenmark et al 2021 rudberg et al 2022 a large number of scholars have evaluated the resilience of water resources by using the elastic assessment framework method yao et al 2019 herrera franco et al 2020 behboudian et al 2021 providing a theoretical basis for the sustainable use of water resources for example hall et al 2019 explored three aspects of the resilience of water supply systems in the united kingdom persistence adaptability and transformability lerback et al 2022 constructed a graphical framework for resilience evaluation to demonstrate the spatial temporal responses of human and natural systems to system changes herrera franco et al 2020 used a socio hydrological framework and four development axes political social environmental and cultural to assess the resilience of the ecuadorian coastal region zhao et al 2022 evaluate the resilience of agricultural water resources by dpsir framework in heilongjiang province the resilience studies of water resources in arid regions such as vietnam s kun dao ecuador sweden and california were evaluated to provide a theoretical basis for sustainable use of water resources nguyen et al 2021 herrera franco et al 2020 rudberg et al 2022 lerback et al 2022 however most research on water issues focuses on the assessment of groundwater flood water pollution and the sustainable management of water resources allocation hashemi et al 2014 moridi et al 2018 moridi et al 2019 benhangi et al 2020 zolfagharipoor and ahmadi 2021 hatamkhani et al 2021 in the absence of sustainable management that considers multiple water issues studies on the resilience of social hydrological systems can simultaneously assess multiple water problems in social hydrological systems and the most frameworks of the socio hydrological system resilience focus on and suitable for the inland humid regions amarasinghe et al 2016 gay et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2012 yao et al 2019 the literatures defined by the resilience index and standard may not apply to the arid regions the framework of socio hydrological system resilience from the perspectives between oasis carrying capacity and water resources utilization is scarce in arid oasis regions in this study a socio hydrological system resilience framework is established by three dimensions of drought resilience water resource utilization resilience and water pollution resilience this paper examines the relationships between oasis change and socio hydrological system resilience at temporal and space scales in arid region of northwest china and provides implications for the management of sustainable development of oasis water resources the objectives of this study are to examine 1 the spatio temporal variation of oases and socio hydrological system resilience in hotan region during 2009 2018 2 the correlation between oasis evolution and socio hydrological system resilience and 3 quantifying the influence of oasis change on the socio hydrological system resilience the relationships between oasis expansion and socio hydrological system resilience will be helpful to provide direction for future water resource decision making 2 study area and data collection the various oases in the hotan refecture are located at the southernmost part of xinjiang uygur autonomous region northwest china 77 30 84 30 e 34 00 38 00 n straddling the kunlun mountains to the northern part of qinghai tibet plateau in the south and adjacenting to the tarim basin in the north it covers an area of 248 100 square kilometers the region mainly includes pishan oasis he luo mo oasis cele oasis yutian oasis and minfeng oasis in the hotan refecture the mountain area accounts for 33 3 the desert area for 63 and the oasis area for 3 7 xiong et al 2016 ding et al 2020 huang et al 2022 the kunlun mountains and pamir plateau block the warm and humid air flow of the indian ocean making it difficult for the warm and humid air flow to reach the tarim basin sun et al 2008 the various oases in the hotan refecture are a typical temperate continental arid climate with extreme drought scarce precipitation and high evaporation the annual average temperature is 13 8 while the annual sunshine duration is 2661 7 h the annual average precipitation is 39 6 mm and the annual average evaporation reaches 2648 7 mm li et al 2010 moreover the sandstorms frequently occur with the highest frequency of dust weather events in the regions for 200 days every year guo et al 2016 the agriculture is main major economic sources accounting for 82 71 of the income dividing into three main industries planting animal husbandry commercial forestry and fruit xiong et al 2016 you et al 2019 the water resources in the oasis areas mainly come from seasonal snowfall and other precipitation in the high altitude areas of mountainous areas accompanied by perennial snow and meltwater from glaciers luo et al 2017 the recoverable amount of groundwater is 11 71 108 m3 and the total available amount of water resources in the whole region is 58 95 108 m3 the seasonal distribution is extremely uneven it has typical characteristics of spring drought summer flood autumn deficiency and winter drought chen et al 2014 this paper selected landsat satellite data modisi3q1 from 2009 to 2018 erdas9 2 arcgis10 8 were used to splicing maximize synthesis trans projection to albers conical equal area projection and cropping of modisi3q1 data in the arcgis10 8 the standard false color synthesis scheme was selected and interpretation markers were established for visual interpretation and oasis type data were obtained the total population gdp reservoir capacity and other data were obtained from the hotan statistical yearbook and the hotan water resources bulletin from 2009 to 2018 due to the missing record in the data collection the data in 2013 were unavailable despite the data in 2013 was not selected for analysis in this study the absence of 2013 data did not affect the analysis results fig 1 3 methodology the socio hydrological system resilience framework established in this study views resilience as a combination of internal resistance and external pressure because the research area selected in this paper is located in the arid region of northwest china which is a typical temperate continental arid climate with extreme drought rare precipitation and strong evaporation the oasis water resources mainly come from seasonal snowfall and other precipitation in the mountainous high altitude area and the seasonal distribution is extremely uneven in the context of the rapid increase of population and rapid economic development the oasis agriculture continues to expand but the arid area in northwest china still adopts the reckless irrigation mode which leads to the waste of a large amount of water resources and the low utilization rate of water resources as a result the oasis lacking water resources are facing an even more water shortage environment the excessive consumption of water resources has caused the deterioration of water quality water pollution and other problems therefore drought water resource utilization and water pollution are regarded as the external pressure of human society on oasis in this paper and 17 resilience indexes are selected according to scientific principles and previous research results liu et al 2012 this paper adopts a socio hydrological system resilience framework with three dimensions drought resilience water resources utilization resilience water pollution resilience the framework has 17 resilience indicators total population gdp reservoir capacity total water supply annual precipitation water area duration of sunshine land for water conservancy facilities effective irrigation area length of impervious channel water saving irrigation area water penetration rate land area sewage discharge sewage treatment capacity sewage pipeline length application amount of chemical fertilizer fig 2 3 1 construction of resilience evaluation system the resilience of drought includes seven indicators which are total population gdp reservoir capacity total water supply annual precipitation water area duration of sunshine the resilience of water resources utilization includes six indicators which are land use for water conservancy facilities effective irrigation area length of impervious channel reservoir capacity water saving irrigation area water penetration rate the resilience of water pollution includes six indicators which are land area sewage discharge sewage treatment capacity sewage pipeline length application amount of chemical fertilizer 3 2 resilience evaluation model the resilience is regarded as the combination of internal resistance and external pressure the specific formula of the quantified resilience model is given liu et al 2012 1 f r f 0 λ s where f r is the resilience of the socio hydrological system f 0 represents the constant background resilience the coefficient λ is a measure of sensitivity which is an inherent characteristic of the socio hydrological system reflecting the adaptive capacity of the socio hydrological system s represents the external natural and anthropogenic pressures to which the socio hydrological system has to respond let each factor be represented by w and the number of evaluation factors be represented by n the relationship between coefficient λ and evaluation factors can be expressed by liu et al 2012 2 λ 1 1 e i 1 n θ i w i where θ is the given weight of the evaluation factor the given weight is explained in detail table 1 wi represents the ith dimensionless variable of variable w reflecting the adaptive capacity of the system at a certain moment the magnitude of external pressure s and internal factors jointly determine the resilience of the socio hydrological system in arid oasis regions the external pressures of human and natural systems on the socio hydrological systems are mainly drought water use utilization and water pollution 3 2 1 assessment of stress in socio hydrological systems drought is a climate phenomenon in which the total amount of freshwater is small and insufficient to meet people s survival and economic development falkenmark et al 1989 proposed water resources per capita as an indicator to measure whether the relationship between water resources supply and demand in a country or region is tense to provide a measure of the sensitivity of a given situation to drought the water stress index f was used to calculate the available water with a minimum threshold the response of drought stress to the socio hydrological system s d could be calculated as liu et al 2012 3 s d exp f min f f f min 0 else water resource utilization rate refers to the ratio of water consumption in a basin or region to total water resources therefore the ratio of total regional water use to total water resources can be characterized as the impact degree of water resource utilization rate on the socio hydrological system the formula is written as 4 s e exp w thetotalwaterconsumption w thetotalwatersupply water pollution is the reduction or loss of the use value of water caused by harmful chemicals the regional sewage treatment rate can be characterized as the impact of water pollution on the socio hydrological system the formula is expressed as 5 s p exp q totalsewagetreatment q totalsewagedischarge 3 2 2 assessing the resilience of socio hydrological systems the resilience is the result of the interaction between the sensitivity coefficient λ and the pressure of various water problems s therefore the resilience index of drought water resources utilization and water pollution can be calculated as 6 f d f 0 λ d s d 7 f e f 0 λ e s e 8 f p f 0 λ p s p according to the resilience of the socio hydrological system to drought water use utilization and water pollution in different dimensions the formula of integrated resilience of the socio hydrological system using the physical parallelogram rule is expressed as liu et al 2012 9 f r f d 2 f e 2 f p 2 since the system has the ability of self regulation the internal resistance λ coefficient of the system is greater than 0 when the external natural and man made pressure of the system is greater than the maximum pressure that the system can bear the value of the system to deal with the external pressure s is 0 therefore the boundary range of the resilience of the social hydrological system is 0 fr fd fe fp 3 3 establishment and classification of index weight in this paper the entropy weight method ewm is used to determine the weight of resilience index the ewm is an objective weight assignment method liu et al 2010 compared with various subjective weight assignment models the biggest advantage of ewm is that it avoids the subjective interference on the weight of indicators thus enhancing the objectivity of comprehensive evaluation results and reflecting the impact degree of indicators zhu et al 2020 when the difference of the evaluation objects on the same index is large the entropy is small this indicates that the index provides more useful information the weight of the index should be set to be large on the other hand if the difference is small the entropy is large the corresponding weight should be small zou et al 2006 the weight calculation results of the 17 indicators selected in this study are shown in table 1 furthermore there is no clear classification of the resilience in the socio hydrological system in arid oasis regions according to the previous research results this paper uses the natural discontinuity point classification method to divide the resilience dimensions into four grades little to no resilience moderate resilience significate high resilience extreme high resilience table 2 3 4 grey correlation analysis grey correlation analysis gra can be effectively applied to deal with multiple criteria and complex relationships among criteria patil et al 2019 firstly the analysis sequence should be determined data sequences that reflect the behavior characteristics of a system are called reference sequences a data series composed of factors that affect the behavior of a system is called a comparative series set reference number series y and the comparison series x 10 y y k k 1 2 n 11 x i x i k k 1 2 n i 1 2 n to avoid errors caused by different dimensions in the data of each factor column in the system during calculation the dimensionless processing should be carried out before grey relational analysis 12 x i k x i k x i l k 1 2 n i 0 1 2 m and then the correlation coefficient should be calculated 13 ζ i k min i min k δ i k ρ max i max k δ i k δ i k ρ max i max i δ i k 14 δ i k y k x i k the validation of grey correlation analysis depends on the resolution coefficient ρ the general value of ρ interval is 0 1 the specific value depends on the situation when ρ 0 5463 resolution is the best usually take ρ 0 5 finally the correlation degree can be calculated by 15 γ i 1 n k 1 n ξ i k k 1 2 n the correlation degree of indicators calculated by grey correlation analysis is higher than 0 7 as an important factor between 0 5 and 0 7 as a relatively important factor and below 0 5 as an insignificant factor sun et al 2012 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial variations of oases during 2009 2018 fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of artificial oases and natural oases in the hotan prefecture during 2009 2018 tables 3 and 4 show the area increment and annual expansion rate of artificial oases and natural oases during 2009 2018 the results showed that the areas of artificial oasis and natural oasis changed with time but there were different stages in the change process in 2009 the area of artificial oasis and natural oasis in hotan area was 2474 01 km2 and 18 329 99 km2 respectively in 2018 the area of artificial oasis and natural oasis was 4826 01 km2 and 17 349 01 km2 the area of artificial oasis showed an expanding trend while that of natural oasis showed a shrinking trend the total expansion of artificial oasis was 2352 km2 the total area of artificial oasis in 2018 was 1 95 times that of 2009 and the total shrinkage of natural oasis was 980 98 km2 the total area of natural oases in 2018 was 0 94 times that of 2009 however there were stage differences in the change process the artificial oases in various areas showed an expanding trend during 2009 2011 and 2015 2018 and a shrinking trend during 2011 2015 the expansion rate during 2015 2018 was the largest with an annual growth rate of 20 36 compared to the original artificial oasis area the total increment is 1830 02 km2 the total increment during this period was 1494 99 km2 at an annual growth rate of 20 14 during 2009 2011 during the period from 2011 to 2015 the rate of annual shrinkage was 6 13 the total shrinkage was 973 01 km2 except for minfeng oasis with a shrinking trend during 2009 2011 the natural oases in other oasis regions showed an expanding trend during 2009 2011 and 2015 2018 but a shrinking trend during 2011 2015 the expansion rate during 2015 2018 is the largest with an annual increase of 9 77 compared to the original natural oasis area the total increment is 3931 01 km2 the total increment during this period is 4444 01 km2 at an annual increase of 8 08 during 2009 2011 during the period from 2011 to 2015 the rate of annual shrinkage was 10 27 with a total shrinkage of 9356 km2 in terms of space time scale the changes of artificial and natural oases showed a trend of expansion contraction expansion 4 2 temporal and spatial variations of the socio hydrological system resilience the radar map in fig 4 shows the graphical representation of the resilience index of each oasis from 2009 to 2018 each parameter is on the axis and all axes originate from the center of the figure table 2 summarizes the grading and value range of the resilience evaluation the results show that the oasis resilience index is different in time and space and the variation of its resilience level is also different in temporal and space the higher the level of resilience index the smaller the water pressure faced by the socio hydrological system the lower the level of resilience index the greater the water pressure faced by the socio hydrological system as can be seen from fig 4a during the period from 2009 to 2018 there were great differences among oases during 2009 2015 among which 2009 and 2015 had the greatest differences in 2009 the comprehensive resilience index of yutian oasis was the highest 2 82 while that of cele oasis was the lowest 1 56 in 2015 pishan oasis had the highest comprehensive resilience index 2 91 while minfeng oasis had the lowest comprehensive resilience index 1 56 from 2016 2018 there was a small difference in the comprehensive resilience index and the difference was the smallest in 2017 when the comprehensive resilience index was between 2 05 and 2 23 in general the comprehensive resilience index of the socio hydrological system in pishan and yutian oasis is relatively high while the comprehensive resilience index of the socio hydrological system in minfeng oasis is relatively low as can be seen from fig 4b the drought resistance of pishan and cele oases is relatively low and they are faced with the pressure of water shortage the drought resilience index of pishan oasis was 0 during 2010 2012 and 2017 2018 while that of cele oasis was 0 in 2009 and 2017 and the drought resistance of the other oases was relatively high the drought resilience index is greater than 1 as can be seen from fig 4c except for minfeng oasis the resilience index of water resources utilization showed a decreasing trend in 2015 while the resilience index of water resources utilization in other oases showed an increasing trend in 2009 and 2015 the resilience index of water resources utilization of oases in other years had little difference as can be seen from fig 4d during the period from 2017 to 2018 the water pollution resilience index of yutian oasis showed a decreasing trend in 2017 while the water pollution resilience index of other oases showed an increasing trend as shown in table 2 the resilience index is divided into four levels the oases showed different trends in different periods of time the comprehensive resilience index grade of pishan oasis was extreme high resilience in 2009 and then showed a trend of fluctuation and decline by 2018 the comprehensive resilience index grade of pishan oasis was moderate resilience the comprehensive resilience index of he luo mo oasis yutian oasis and minfeng oasis showed a stable trend and the comprehensive resilience index of he luo mo oasis mainly showed significant high resilience and only showed moderate resilience in 2010 2016 and 2018 the comprehensive resilience index of yutian oasis was significant and extreme high resilience and only showed moderate resilience in 2017 the comprehensive resilience index level of minfeng oasis showed little to no resilience from 2009 to 2016 and increased to moderate resilience from 2017 to 2018 the comprehensive resilience index of cele oasis showed little to no resilience in 2009 and extreme resilience in 2018 showing a rising trend of the comprehensive resilience index the drought resilience index grades of pishan oasis mainly showed extreme high resilience and little to no resilience the drought resilience index grades of he luo mo oasis showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend and the drought resilience index grades of cele oasis showed an increasing trend the drought resilience index of cele oasis changed from little to no resilience in 2009 to extreme high resilience in 2018 and the drought resilience index levels of yutian and minfeng oases tended to be stable mainly showing extreme high resilience in 2014 2017 2018 and significant high resilience in other years the drought resilience index level of minfeng oasis mainly shows moderate resilience and significant high resilience the resilience index level of water resource utilization of each oasis in hotan was only cele oasis which showed an increasing trend showing little to no resilience significant high resilience moderate resilience the resilience index level of water resource utilization of other oases showed a downward trend the resilience index level of water resource utilization of pishan oasis was extreme high resilience significant high resilience moderate resilience he luo mo oasis was significant high resilience moderate resilience yutian oasis was extreme high resilience moderate resilience little to no resilience minfeng oasis was moderate resilience only in 2009 from 2010 to 2018 it showed little to no resilience oases in hotan began to pay attention to the harm of water pollution to water resources in 2017 and in 2018 the water pollution resilience index of oases in hotan showed extreme high resilience among them pishan oasis shows little to no resilience significant high extreme high resilience he luo mo oasis was moderate resilience significant resilience extreme high resilience cele oasis and minfeng oasis was little to no resilience extreme high resilience yutian oasis was significant resilience extreme high resilience figs 5 8 4 3 relationship between oasis and resilience of the socio hydrological system fig 9 shows the

expansion of under the human activities quantitative assessment of the socio hydrological system resilience can provide a better understanding the current state of system and predict the external stresses of the system response carpenter et al 2001 liu et al 2012 pang et al 2022 in previous studies the more qualitative assessment methods were used to assess socio hydrological system resilience while plausible alternative quantitative methods are still lacking despite the resilience of the socio hydrological system was calculated from the three dimensions of drought flood and water pollution liu et al 2012 jaramillo et al 2018 however those methods aren t appropriate for the arid regions this paper has modified and supplemented it the flood resilience is adjusted to the resilience of water resources utilization and the indicators of drought resilience and water pollution resilience are improved therefore this study takes the resilience as the combination indictor of internal resistance and external pressure in the socio hydrological system and considers that the external pressure of human society on oasis mainly consists of drought water resources utilization and water pollution the framework of socio hydrological system resilience is constructed by the three dimensions of drought water resources utilization and water pollution hooke s law and parallelogram law are used to quantitatively evaluate the socio hydrological system resilience of oasis in arid region the effectiveness of this framework has been verified in arid oasis regions as well the previous studies have found that oasis expansion has obvious stages at temporal and spatial scale the oasis expansion speed was the fastest from 2000 to 2010 while the expansion speed slowed down from 2010 to 2018 cai et al 2021 which is basically similar to the research results of this paper with the rapid development of social economy and population growth the domestic and agricultural water use has increased sharply liu et al 2013 the previous studies have pointed out that population size economic development level and other factors will affect the sustainable development of water resources in arid regions liu et al 2012 boithias et al 2014 salgot et al 2014 hadidi et al 2016 jaramillo et al 2018 in addition the progress of cultivated land structure and science and technology will also affect the oasis change and the allocation of water resources thus affecting the sustainable development of oasis water resources amuti et al 2014 this is consistent with the research results of this paper fig 11 because the system has self regulation ability the value of the λ coefficient must be greater than 0 based on the calculation results the λ coefficient is greater than 0 in this study so the results are feasible in general the internal resistance λ of oasis social hydrological system changes little and the resilience of oasis is mainly affected by external pressure fig 12 according to the correlation between the comprehensive resilience and the three dimensions of resilience as well as the correlation between oases expansion and the socio hydrological system resilience the main external pressures affecting the socio hydrological system resilience and the impact of oasis changes on the socio hydrological system resilience are obtained fig 13 the correlation coefficient between fr and fd ranges from 0 38 to 0 767 that between fr and fe ranges from 0 797 to 0 937 and that between fr and fp ranges from 0 597 to 0 772 the correlation coefficient between oasis expansion and fr fd fe and fp ranges from 0 666 to 0 781 0 425 0 681 0 667 0 833 and 0 605 0 687 therefore the main external pressure affecting the resilience of the social hydrological system of oases is water resource utilization the oasis changes have a great impact on the resilience of water resource utilization the oasis changes are inversely proportional to water resource utilization resilience in the socio hydrological system fig 14 it is mainly because the utilization rate of water more than 90 of the water is used for agricultural activities in arid oasis regions in fact the 55 of water resources has been wasted in the process of farmland irrigation liu et al 2013 li et al 2022 the oasis expansion has resulted in the pressure increase of water resources utilization in the socio hydrological system correspondingly moreover for pishan oasis he luo mo oasis and cele oasis the problem of water pollution is greater than that of drought while the problem of drought is greater than that of water pollution in yutian and minfeng oases it may be due to the neglect of pollution treatment in the rapid economic development of pishan he luo mo and cele oases therefore the industrial wastewater and the use of agricultural fertilizers by oasis cultivated expansion not only affects the allocation of water resources but also leads to the water quality issues in arid oasis regions yang et al 2016 5 2 management implications and further prospect for oasis sustainability in arid regions the agricultural water consumption accounts for a large proportion in the total water consumption in arid oasis regions xue et al 2015 for example faced with the shortage of water resources the three red lines policy is the strictest water resources management system it plays an important role in reducing water resources waste changing water quality improving water use efficiency and enhancing the anti risk capability of socio hydrological system liu et al 2013 guo et al 2020 j wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 xue et al 2022b in the current oasis irrigation expansion the construction of water conservancy facilities is not perfect resulting in the drought resilience and water resource utilization resilience aggravation the extensive irrigation has caused water pollution in oasis regions damaging the regional water resources and affecting the resilience of water pollution when carrying out the agricultural activities the farmers should pay attention to improving the utilization efficiency of water resources and the pollution of chemical fertilizer to water quality thus strengthening the resilience of water utilization pedro monzonis et al 2020 this study also provides a management implication concerning the impact of water pollution on the oasis sustainability in the future work this study highlights the impact of oasis expansion on the resilience of socio hydrological system the expansion of irrigated agricultural acreage should be controlled to increase the resilience of the socio hydrological system and relevant land policies should also be developed to guide the limits of oasis expansion the socio hydrological system resilience constructed in this paper not only considers the characteristics of the water system itself but also the influence of human activities on the water system however the assessment of socio hydrological system resilience still lacks objectivity in the selection of indicators the resilience indexes of the socio hydrological system in this paper are mostly selected by socio economic and anthropogenic factors there are less various natural factors such as soil and vegetation properties etc in addition the boundary conditions and index validation of socio hydrological system resilience need to be further conducted in the future research 6 conclusion in this paper an integrative socio hydrological resilience assessment framework is proposed to examine the relationships between oasis change and socio hydrological system resilience at temporal and space scales the oases in the hotan prefecture in xinjiang northwest china are selected to verify the proposed framework due to the typical similarity the results show that the results show that the oases areas expansion rates as well as the socio hydrological system resilience change at spatial temporal scale the socio hydrological system resilience index shows synchronicity from 2009 to 2018 the abrupt change in that of most oases is detected in 2015 the population size socioeconomic development level and hydraulic engineering facilities are the main factors affecting the oasis area and system resilience the main external pressure on the resilience of socio hydrological system of oases is water resource utilization the expanded agricultural irrigation reduces the resilience of socio hydrological system the water pollution has gradually affected oasis sustainability and system resilience these findings provide useful insights into regional sustainability and water resource management in face of the rapid socioeconomic development and water resource shortage due to the lack of consideration of regional soil vegetation groundwater farmers income and planting structure differences a more detailed assessment of the socio hydrological system resilience in the arid regions is very necessary in the further research although there are great limitations in the selection of evaluation indicators our results highlight the impact of oasis expansion on the resilience of socio hydrological system in arid regions the relevant policies should be formulated to increase the socio hydrological system resilience by the limits of oasis irrigated agricultural expansion meanwhile it is necessary to consider that the impact of water pollution on the oasis sustainability in arid regions therefore this study provides a reference for assessing influence of oasis expansion on socio hydrological system resilience in arid regions and beyond with similar conditions this framework can be used as a case to generate an effective tool of socio hydrological system resilience applied to other arid regions credit authorship contribution statement lei liu jie xue conceptualization methodology jingjing chang shunke wang xinxin li data analysis lei liu writing original draft preparation jie xue

7654,study region the oases of the lower reaches of inland river basin in south xinjiang northwest china study focus the increase of man made water demands has led to water shortage and water pollution issues worldwide it is important to determine the contributions of oasis change to socio hydrological system resilience for oasis sustainability in arid regions this study proposes an integrative socio hydrological resilience assessment framework to examine the relationships between oasis evolution and system resilience at spatial temporal scales hooke s law and parallelogram law are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the resilience of drought water resource utilization and water pollution and comprehensive resilience of socio hydrological system meanwhile the impact of oasis expansion on socio hydrological system resilience is quantified new hydrological insights for the region the research and application of oases in hotan prefecture of northwest china have proved that the proposed framework is very promising for assessing the relationships between oasis evolution and socio hydrological system resilience in arid regions during the study period from 2009 to 2018 the

introduction human society and natural ecology constitute a coupled social and natural ecosystem water as the core element of natural ecosystem has a close mutual relationship with human society constituting a coupled socio hydrological system with the increasing global population and demands for water resources the current consumption pattern of freshwater no longer meets the level that can be maintained by the future supply wang et al 2009 pörtner et al 2021 in face of the expansion of the scope of human activities and the deepening of the degree of influence human activities have directly or indirectly contributed to a variety of water issues such as water shortage and the deterioration of water quality liu et al 2012 sustainable water resources management requires a comprehensive approach to understanding the water use mechanisms and their response to internal and external disturbances muhtar et al 2021 to ensure the sustainable development of water resources the resilience as a key indicator is proposed to incorporate into the complex and dynamic interactions between human and water systems hjorth et al 2013 carpenter et al 2005 wang et al 2009 xu et al 2018 only by better understanding the nature of human interactions with water systems can water resources be managed effectively and sustainably elshafei et al 2014 therefore the socio hydrological system resilience has become an indispensable index for water resource management bakarji et al 2017 hough et al 2018 dewulf et al 2019 pang et al 2022 the investigation on the resilience of socio hydrological system is the key to formulate measures to deal with water resource shortage caused by the rapid development of human society worldwide especially in the arid regions oasis is a unique landscape suitable for plant growth and human habitation within the desert under stable water source supplies in the arid regions xue et al 2022a bie et al 2020 xue et al 2019 the oasis is a typical and ideal area for assessing the socio hydrological system resilience chehbouni et al 2022 for instance the oases account for about 5 of the arid and semi arid regions in china but 90 of the population and 95 of the socio economy are concentrated in the oasis areas abulizi et al 2017 bie et al 2020 xue et al 2022b oases have become an important place for human to engage in various social activities china israel and other middle eastern countries are expanding artificial oases for agricultural production muhtar et al 2021 li et al 2022 due to the continuous expansion of irrigation based agriculture which has resulted in surface water scarcity and overexploitation of groundwater many scholars have paid much attention to the integrated management of oasis water resources and the relationship between water resources and oasis sustainability amarasinghe et al 2016 meng et al 2013 salgot et al 2014 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2021 in recent years the most scholars have focused on the driving forces of oasis change and water shortage assessment in the oasis regions zhou et al 2017 bie et al 2020 li et al 2022 however there are few studies on examining relationships between the oasis expansion and the resilience of socio hydrological system in the arid regions the concept of resilience was first proposed by hooling in the 1970 s holling et al 1974 the resilience is presented to describe the ability of a dynamic system to maintain the same basic structure under pressure having widely applied in various fields such as ecology and psychology hosseini et al 2016 fan et al 2021 resilience as an intersectional concept can link insights from different disciplinary approaches so many scholars have conducted researches on resilience but their understandings and measures of the concept of resilience are different hashimoto et al 1982 fiering 1982a b c moy et al 1986 qi et al 2016 many qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods have been proposed to measure the resilience of the system the qualitative evaluation includes the establishment of the elastic evaluation framework cutter et al 2008 kahan et al 2009 falkenmark 2017 falkenmark et al 2021 and the evaluation based on case analysis rudberg et al 2022 in the water resource resilience conceptual description qualitative and quantitative assessments are main methods boithias et al 2014 falkenmark et al 2017 jaramillo et al 2018 hall et al 2019 among them the standardization and precision of quantitative evaluation are higher making the theory more generality in the field of socio hydrological system a large number of studies have used qualitative assessment methods to assess water resource resilience dewulf et al 2019 ciullo et al 2017 falkenmark et al 2021 rudberg et al 2022 a large number of scholars have evaluated the resilience of water resources by using the elastic assessment framework method yao et al 2019 herrera franco et al 2020 behboudian et al 2021 providing a theoretical basis for the sustainable use of water resources for example hall et al 2019 explored three aspects of the resilience of water supply systems in the united kingdom persistence adaptability and transformability lerback et al 2022 constructed a graphical framework for resilience evaluation to demonstrate the spatial temporal responses of human and natural systems to system changes herrera franco et al 2020 used a socio hydrological framework and four development axes political social environmental and cultural to assess the resilience of the ecuadorian coastal region zhao et al 2022 evaluate the resilience of agricultural water resources by dpsir framework in heilongjiang province the resilience studies of water resources in arid regions such as vietnam s kun dao ecuador sweden and california were evaluated to provide a theoretical basis for sustainable use of water resources nguyen et al 2021 herrera franco et al 2020 rudberg et al 2022 lerback et al 2022 however most research on water issues focuses on the assessment of groundwater flood water pollution and the sustainable management of water resources allocation hashemi et al 2014 moridi et al 2018 moridi et al 2019 benhangi et al 2020 zolfagharipoor and ahmadi 2021 hatamkhani et al 2021 in the absence of sustainable management that considers multiple water issues studies on the resilience of social hydrological systems can simultaneously assess multiple water problems in social hydrological systems and the most frameworks of the socio hydrological system resilience focus on and suitable for the inland humid regions amarasinghe et al 2016 gay et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2012 yao et al 2019 the literatures defined by the resilience index and standard may not apply to the arid regions the framework of socio hydrological system resilience from the perspectives between oasis carrying capacity and water resources utilization is scarce in arid oasis regions in this study a socio hydrological system resilience framework is established by three dimensions of drought resilience water resource utilization resilience and water pollution resilience this paper examines the relationships between oasis change and socio hydrological system resilience at temporal and space scales in arid region of northwest china and provides implications for the management of sustainable development of oasis water resources the objectives of this study are to examine 1 the spatio temporal variation of oases and socio hydrological system resilience in hotan region during 2009 2018 2 the correlation between oasis evolution and socio hydrological system resilience and 3 quantifying the influence of oasis change on the socio hydrological system resilience the relationships between oasis expansion and socio hydrological system resilience will be helpful to provide direction for future water resource decision making 2 study area and data collection the various oases in the hotan refecture are located at the southernmost part of xinjiang uygur autonomous region northwest china 77 30 84 30 e 34 00 38 00 n straddling the kunlun mountains to the northern part of qinghai tibet plateau in the south and adjacenting to the tarim basin in the north it covers an area of 248 100 square kilometers the region mainly includes pishan oasis he luo mo oasis cele oasis yutian oasis and minfeng oasis in the hotan refecture the mountain area accounts for 33 3 the desert area for 63 and the oasis area for 3 7 xiong et al 2016 ding et al 2020 huang et al 2022 the kunlun mountains and pamir plateau block the warm and humid air flow of the indian ocean making it difficult for the warm and humid air flow to reach the tarim basin sun et al 2008 the various oases in the hotan refecture are a typical temperate continental arid climate with extreme drought scarce precipitation and high evaporation the annual average temperature is 13 8 while the annual sunshine duration is 2661 7 h the annual average precipitation is 39 6 mm and the annual average evaporation reaches 2648 7 mm li et al 2010 moreover the sandstorms frequently occur with the highest frequency of dust weather events in the regions for 200 days every year guo et al 2016 the agriculture is main major economic sources accounting for 82 71 of the income dividing into three main industries planting animal husbandry commercial forestry and fruit xiong et al 2016 you et al 2019 the water resources in the oasis areas mainly come from seasonal snowfall and other precipitation in the high altitude areas of mountainous areas accompanied by perennial snow and meltwater from glaciers luo et al 2017 the recoverable amount of groundwater is 11 71 108 m3 and the total available amount of water resources in the whole region is 58 95 108 m3 the seasonal distribution is extremely uneven it has typical characteristics of spring drought summer flood autumn deficiency and winter drought chen et al 2014 this paper selected landsat satellite data modisi3q1 from 2009 to 2018 erdas9 2 arcgis10 8 were used to splicing maximize synthesis trans projection to albers conical equal area projection and cropping of modisi3q1 data in the arcgis10 8 the standard false color synthesis scheme was selected and interpretation markers were established for visual interpretation and oasis type data were obtained the total population gdp reservoir capacity and other data were obtained from the hotan statistical yearbook and the hotan water resources bulletin from 2009 to 2018 due to the missing record in the data collection the data in 2013 were unavailable despite the data in 2013 was not selected for analysis in this study the absence of 2013 data did not affect the analysis results fig 1 3 methodology the socio hydrological system resilience framework established in this study views resilience as a combination of internal resistance and external pressure because the research area selected in this paper is located in the arid region of northwest china which is a typical temperate continental arid climate with extreme drought rare precipitation and strong evaporation the oasis water resources mainly come from seasonal snowfall and other precipitation in the mountainous high altitude area and the seasonal distribution is extremely uneven in the context of the rapid increase of population and rapid economic development the oasis agriculture continues to expand but the arid area in northwest china still adopts the reckless irrigation mode which leads to the waste of a large amount of water resources and the low utilization rate of water resources as a result the oasis lacking water resources are facing an even more water shortage environment the excessive consumption of water resources has caused the deterioration of water quality water pollution and other problems therefore drought water resource utilization and water pollution are regarded as the external pressure of human society on oasis in this paper and 17 resilience indexes are selected according to scientific principles and previous research results liu et al 2012 this paper adopts a socio hydrological system resilience framework with three dimensions drought resilience water resources utilization resilience water pollution resilience the framework has 17 resilience indicators total population gdp reservoir capacity total water supply annual precipitation water area duration of sunshine land for water conservancy facilities effective irrigation area length of impervious channel water saving irrigation area water penetration rate land area sewage discharge sewage treatment capacity sewage pipeline length application amount of chemical fertilizer fig 2 3 1 construction of resilience evaluation system the resilience of drought includes seven indicators which are total population gdp reservoir capacity total water supply annual precipitation water area duration of sunshine the resilience of water resources utilization includes six indicators which are land use for water conservancy facilities effective irrigation area length of impervious channel reservoir capacity water saving irrigation area water penetration rate the resilience of water pollution includes six indicators which are land area sewage discharge sewage treatment capacity sewage pipeline length application amount of chemical fertilizer 3 2 resilience evaluation model the resilience is regarded as the combination of internal resistance and external pressure the specific formula of the quantified resilience model is given

inherent characteristic of the socio hydrological system reflecting the adaptive capacity of the socio hydrological system s represents the external natural and anthropogenic pressures to which the socio hydrological system has to respond let each factor be represented by w and the number of evaluation factors be represented by n the relationship between coefficient λ and evaluation factors can be expressed by liu et al 2012 2 λ 1 1 e i 1 n θ i w i where θ is the given weight of the evaluation factor the given weight is explained in detail table 1 wi represents the ith dimensionless variable of variable w reflecting the adaptive capacity of the system at a certain moment the magnitude of external pressure s and internal factors jointly determine the resilience of the socio hydrological system in arid oasis regions the external pressures of human and natural systems on the socio hydrological systems are mainly drought water use utilization and water pollution 3 2 1 assessment of stress in socio hydrological systems drought is a climate phenomenon in which the total amount of freshwater is small and insufficient to meet people s survival and economic development falkenmark et al 1989 proposed water resources per capita as an indicator to measure whether the relationship between water resources supply and demand in a country or region is tense to provide a measure of the sensitivity of a given situation to drought the water stress index f was used to calculate the available water with a minimum threshold the response of drought stress to the socio hydrological system s d could be calculated as liu et al 2012 3 s d exp f min f f f min 0 else water resource utilization rate refers to the ratio of water consumption in a basin or region to total water resources therefore the ratio of total regional water use to total water resources can be characterized as the impact degree of water resource utilization rate on the socio hydrological system the formula is written as 4 s e exp w thetotalwaterconsumption w thetotalwatersupply water pollution is the reduction or loss of the use value of water caused by harmful chemicals the regional sewage treatment rate can be characterized as the impact of water pollution on the socio hydrological system the formula is expressed as 5 s p exp q totalsewagetreatment q totalsewagedischarge 3 2 2 assessing the resilience of socio hydrological systems the resilience is the result of the interaction between the sensitivity coefficient λ and the pressure of various water problems s therefore the resilience index of drought water resources utilization and water pollution can be calculated as 6 f d f 0 λ d s d 7 f e f 0 λ e s e 8 f p f 0 λ p s p according to the resilience of the socio hydrological system to drought water use utilization and water pollution in different dimensions the formula of integrated resilience of the socio hydrological system using the physical parallelogram rule is expressed as liu et al 2012 9 f r f d 2 f e 2 f p 2 since the system has the ability of self regulation the internal resistance λ coefficient of the system is greater than 0 when the external natural and man made pressure of the system is greater than the maximum pressure that the system can bear the value of the system to deal with the external pressure s is 0 therefore the boundary range of the resilience of the social hydrological system is 0 fr fd fe fp 3 3 establishment and classification of index weight in this paper the entropy weight method ewm is used to determine the weight of resilience index the ewm is an objective weight assignment method liu et al 2010 compared with various subjective weight assignment models the biggest advantage of ewm is that it avoids the subjective interference on the weight of indicators thus enhancing the objectivity of comprehensive evaluation results and reflecting the impact degree of indicators zhu et al 2020 when the difference of the evaluation objects on the same index is large the entropy is small this indicates that the index provides more useful information the weight of the index should be set to be large on the other hand if the difference is small the entropy is large the corresponding weight should be small zou et al 2006 the weight calculation results of the 17 indicators selected in this study are shown in table 1 furthermore there is no clear classification of the resilience in the socio hydrological system in arid oasis regions according to the previous research results this paper uses the natural discontinuity point classification method to divide the resilience dimensions into four grades little to no resilience moderate resilience significate high resilience extreme high resilience table 2 3 4 grey correlation analysis grey correlation analysis gra can be effectively applied to deal with multiple criteria and complex relationships among criteria patil et al 2019 firstly the analysis sequence should be

comparative series set reference number series y and the comparison series x 10 y y k k 1 2 n 11 x i x i k k 1 2 n i 1 2 n to avoid errors caused by different dimensions in the data of each factor

artificial oasis and natural oasis changed with time but there were different stages in the change process in 2009 the area of artificial oasis and natural oasis in hotan area was 2474 01 km2 and 18 329 99 km2 respectively in 2018 the area of artificial oasis and natural oasis was 4826 01 km2 and 17 349 01 km2 the area of artificial oasis showed an expanding trend while that of natural oasis showed a shrinking trend the total expansion of artificial oasis was 2352 km2 the total area of artificial oasis in 2018 was 1 95 times that of 2009 and the total shrinkage of natural oasis was 980 98 km2 the total area of natural oases in 2018 was 0 94 times that of 2009 however there were stage differences in the change process the artificial oases in various areas showed an expanding trend during 2009 2011 and 2015 2018 and a shrinking trend during 2011 2015 the expansion rate during 2015 2018 was the largest with an annual growth rate of 20 36 compared to the original artificial oasis area the total increment is 1830 02 km2 the total increment during this period was 1494 99 km2 at an annual growth rate of 20 14 during 2009 2011 during the period from 2011 to 2015 the rate of annual shrinkage was 6 13 the total shrinkage was 973 01 km2 except for minfeng oasis with a shrinking trend during 2009 2011 the natural oases in other oasis regions showed an expanding trend during 2009 2011 and 2015 2018 but a shrinking trend during 2011 2015 the expansion rate during 2015 2018 is the largest with an annual increase of 9 77 compared to the original natural oasis area the total

with a total shrinkage of 9356 km2 in terms of space time scale the changes of artificial and natural oases showed a trend of expansion contraction expansion 4 2 temporal and spatial variations of the socio hydrological system resilience the radar map in fig 4 shows the graphical representation of the resilience index of each oasis from 2009 to 2018 each parameter is on the axis and all axes originate from the center of the figure table 2 summarizes the grading and value range of the resilience evaluation the results show that the oasis resilience index is different in time and space and the variation of its resilience level is also different in temporal and space the higher the level of resilience index the smaller the water pressure faced by the socio hydrological system the lower the level of resilience index the greater the water pressure faced by the socio hydrological system as can be seen from fig 4a during the period from 2009 to 2018 there were great differences among oases during 2009 2015 among which 2009 and 2015 had the greatest differences in 2009 the comprehensive resilience index of yutian oasis was the highest 2 82 while that of cele oasis was the lowest 1 56 in 2015 pishan oasis had the highest comprehensive resilience index 2 91 while minfeng oasis had the lowest comprehensive resilience index 1 56 from 2016 2018 there was a small difference in the comprehensive resilience index and the difference was the smallest in 2017 when the comprehensive resilience index was between 2 05 and 2 23 in general the comprehensive resilience index of the socio hydrological system in pishan and yutian oasis is relatively high while the comprehensive resilience index of the socio hydrological system in minfeng oasis is relatively low as can be seen from fig 4b the drought resistance of pishan and cele oases is relatively low and they are faced with the pressure of water shortage the drought resilience index of pishan oasis was 0 during 2010 2012 and 2017 2018 while that of cele oasis was 0 in 2009 and 2017 and the drought resistance of the other oases was relatively high the drought resilience index is greater than 1 as can be seen from fig 4c except for minfeng oasis the resilience index of water resources utilization showed a decreasing trend in 2015 while the resilience index of water resources utilization in other oases showed an increasing trend in 2009 and 2015 the resilience index of water resources utilization of oases in other years had little difference as can be seen from fig 4d during the period from 2017 to 2018 the water pollution resilience index of yutian oasis showed a decreasing trend in 2017 while the water pollution resilience index of other oases showed an increasing trend as shown in table 2 the resilience index is divided into four levels the oases showed different trends in different periods of time the comprehensive resilience index grade of pishan oasis was extreme high resilience in 2009 and then showed a trend of fluctuation and decline by 2018 the comprehensive resilience index grade of pishan oasis was moderate resilience the comprehensive resilience index of he luo mo oasis yutian oasis and minfeng oasis showed a stable trend and the comprehensive resilience index of he luo mo oasis mainly showed significant high resilience and only showed moderate resilience in 2010 2016 and 2018 the comprehensive resilience index of yutian oasis was significant and extreme high resilience and only showed moderate resilience in 2017 the comprehensive resilience index level of minfeng oasis showed little to no resilience from 2009 to 2016 and increased to moderate resilience from 2017 to 2018 the comprehensive resilience index of cele oasis showed little to no resilience in 2009 and extreme resilience in 2018 showing a rising trend of the comprehensive resilience index the drought resilience index grades of pishan oasis mainly showed extreme high resilience and little to no resilience the drought resilience index grades of he luo mo oasis showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend and the drought resilience index grades of cele oasis showed an increasing trend the drought resilience index of cele oasis changed from little to no resilience in 2009 to extreme high resilience in 2018 and the drought resilience index levels of yutian and minfeng oases tended to be stable mainly showing extreme high resilience in 2014 2017 2018 and significant high resilience in other years the drought resilience index level of minfeng oasis mainly shows moderate resilience and significant high resilience the resilience index level of water resource utilization of each oasis in hotan was only cele oasis which showed an increasing trend showing little to no resilience significant high resilience moderate resilience the resilience index level of water resource utilization of other oases showed a downward trend the resilience index level of water resource utilization of pishan oasis was extreme high resilience significant high resilience moderate resilience he luo mo oasis was significant high resilience moderate resilience yutian oasis was extreme high resilience moderate resilience little to no resilience minfeng oasis was moderate resilience only in 2009 from 2010 to 2018 it showed little to no resilience oases in hotan began to pay attention to the harm of water pollution to water resources in 2017 and in 2018 the water pollution resilience index of oases in hotan showed extreme high resilience among them pishan oasis shows little to no resilience significant high extreme high resilience he luo mo oasis was moderate resilience significant resilience extreme high resilience cele oasis and minfeng oasis was little to no resilience extreme high resilience yutian oasis was significant resilience extreme high resilience figs 5 8 4 3 relationship between oasis and resilience of the socio hydrological system fig 9 shows the correlation analysis between artificial oasis and natural oasis and composite resilience index fr drought resilience index fd resilience index of water resource utilization fe and water pollution resilience index fp the results showed that the correlation coefficients of fr fd fe and fp were the same in both the artificial and natural oases of pishan and minfeng the area of artificial oases in

expansion of under the human activities quantitative assessment of the socio hydrological system resilience can provide a better understanding the current state of system and predict the external stresses of the system response carpenter et al 2001 liu et al 2012 pang et al 2022 in previous studies the more qualitative assessment methods were used to assess socio hydrological system resilience while plausible alternative quantitative methods are still lacking despite the resilience of the socio hydrological system was calculated from the three dimensions of drought flood and water pollution liu et al 2012 jaramillo et al 2018 however those methods aren t appropriate for the arid regions this paper has modified and supplemented it the flood resilience is adjusted to the resilience of water resources utilization and the indicators of drought resilience and water pollution resilience are improved therefore this study takes the resilience as the combination indictor of internal resistance and external pressure in the socio hydrological system and considers that the external pressure of human society on oasis mainly consists of drought water resources utilization and water pollution the framework of socio hydrological system resilience is constructed by the three dimensions of drought water resources utilization and water pollution hooke s law and parallelogram law are used to quantitatively evaluate the socio hydrological system resilience of oasis in arid region the effectiveness of this framework has been verified in arid oasis regions as well the previous studies have found that oasis expansion has obvious stages at temporal and spatial scale the oasis expansion speed was the fastest from 2000 to 2010 while the expansion speed slowed down from 2010 to 2018 cai et al 2021 which is basically similar to the research results of this paper with the rapid development of social economy and population growth the domestic and agricultural water use has increased sharply liu et al 2013 the previous studies have pointed out that population size economic development level and other factors will affect the sustainable development of water resources in arid regions liu et al 2012 boithias et al 2014 salgot et al 2014 hadidi et al 2016 jaramillo et al 2018 in addition the progress of cultivated land structure and science and technology will also affect the oasis change and the allocation of water resources thus affecting the sustainable development of oasis water resources amuti et al 2014 this is consistent with the research results of this paper fig 11 because the system has self regulation ability the value of the λ coefficient must be greater than 0 based on the calculation results the λ coefficient is greater than 0 in this study so the results are feasible in general the internal resistance λ of oasis social hydrological system changes little and the resilience of oasis is mainly affected by external pressure fig 12 according to the correlation between the comprehensive resilience and the three dimensions of resilience as well as the correlation between oases expansion and the socio hydrological system resilience the main external pressures affecting the socio hydrological system resilience and the impact of oasis changes on the socio hydrological system resilience are obtained fig 13 the correlation coefficient between fr and fd ranges from 0 38 to 0 767 that between fr and fe ranges from 0 797 to 0 937 and that between fr and fp ranges from 0 597 to 0 772 the correlation coefficient between oasis expansion and fr fd fe and fp ranges from 0 666 to 0 781 0 425 0 681 0 667 0 833 and 0 605 0 687 therefore the main external pressure affecting the resilience of the social hydrological system of oases is water resource utilization the oasis changes have a great impact on the resilience of water resource utilization the oasis changes are inversely proportional to water resource utilization resilience in the socio hydrological system fig 14 it is mainly because the utilization rate of water more than 90 of the water is used for agricultural activities in arid oasis regions in fact the 55 of water resources has been wasted in the process of farmland irrigation liu et al 2013 li et al 2022 the oasis expansion has resulted in the pressure increase of water resources utilization in the socio hydrological system correspondingly moreover for pishan oasis he luo mo oasis and cele oasis the problem of water pollution is greater than that of drought while the problem of drought is greater than that of water pollution in yutian and minfeng oases it may be due to the neglect of pollution treatment in the rapid economic development of pishan he luo mo and cele oases therefore the industrial wastewater and the use of agricultural fertilizers by oasis cultivated expansion not only affects the allocation of water resources but also leads to the water quality issues in arid oasis regions yang et al 2016 5 2 management implications and further prospect for oasis sustainability in arid regions the agricultural water consumption accounts for a large proportion in the total water consumption in arid oasis regions xue et al 2015 for example faced with the shortage of water resources the three red lines policy is the strictest water resources management system it plays an important role in reducing water resources waste changing water quality improving water use efficiency and enhancing the anti risk capability of socio hydrological system liu et al 2013 guo et al 2020 j wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 xue et al 2022b in the current oasis irrigation expansion the construction of water conservancy facilities is not perfect resulting in the drought resilience and water resource utilization resilience aggravation the extensive irrigation has caused water pollution in oasis regions damaging the regional water resources and affecting the resilience of water pollution when carrying out the agricultural activities the farmers should pay attention to improving the utilization efficiency of water resources and the pollution of chemical fertilizer to water quality thus strengthening the resilience of water utilization pedro monzonis et al 2020 this study also provides a management implication concerning the impact of water pollution on the oasis sustainability in the future work this study highlights the impact of oasis expansion on the resilience of socio hydrological system the expansion of irrigated agricultural acreage should be controlled to increase the resilience of the socio hydrological system and relevant land policies should also be developed to guide the limits of oasis expansion the socio hydrological system resilience constructed in this paper not only considers the characteristics of the water system itself but also the influence of human activities on the water system however the assessment of socio hydrological system resilience still lacks objectivity in the selection of indicators the resilience indexes of the socio hydrological system in this paper are mostly selected by socio economic and anthropogenic factors there are less various natural factors such as soil and vegetation properties etc in addition the boundary conditions and index validation of socio hydrological system resilience need to be further conducted in the future research 6 conclusion in this paper an integrative socio hydrological resilience assessment framework is proposed to examine the relationships between oasis change and socio hydrological system resilience at temporal and space scales the oases in the hotan prefecture in xinjiang northwest china are selected to verify the proposed framework due to the typical similarity the results show that the results show that the oases areas expansion rates as well as the socio hydrological system resilience change at spatial temporal scale the socio hydrological system resilience index shows synchronicity from 2009 to 2018 the abrupt change in that of most oases is detected in 2015 the population size socioeconomic development level and hydraulic engineering facilities are the main factors affecting the oasis area and system resilience the main external pressure on the resilience of socio hydrological system of oases is water resource utilization the expanded agricultural irrigation reduces the resilience of socio hydrological system the water pollution has gradually affected oasis sustainability and system resilience these findings provide useful insights into regional sustainability and water resource management in face of the rapid socioeconomic development and water resource shortage due to the lack of consideration of regional soil vegetation groundwater farmers income and planting structure differences a more detailed assessment of the socio hydrological system resilience in the arid regions is very necessary in the further research although there are great limitations in the selection of evaluation indicators our results highlight the impact of oasis expansion on the resilience of socio hydrological system in arid regions the relevant policies should be formulated to increase the socio hydrological system resilience by the limits of oasis irrigated agricultural expansion meanwhile it is necessary to consider that the impact of water pollution on the oasis sustainability in arid regions therefore this study provides a reference for assessing influence of oasis expansion on socio hydrological system resilience in arid regions and beyond with similar conditions this framework can be used as a case to generate an effective tool of socio hydrological system resilience applied to other arid regions credit authorship contribution statement lei liu jie xue conceptualization methodology jingjing chang shunke wang xinxin li data analysis lei liu writing original draft preparation jie xue
