24770,relationships between the functional traits of phytoplankton and environmental factors remain insufficiently explored however these dependencies could be very useful for trait based ecological modelling of phytoplankton communities the purpose of this study is to estimate possible connections between nutrient utilization traits of marine phytoplankton cell volume temperature of the experiment irradiance and taxonomic category of the species collected in ecological archives e096 202 edwards et al 2015 the search for patterns was made using the author s technique of polynomial multilayered neural network nn building the optimal set of neurons connections with the preceding layer of the network was obtained by means of a genetic algorithm run for each neuron this approach gave good results given the sparse data sets and small samples categorical predictor taxonomic group was parameterized by an integer we found approximations for maximal uptake and growth rates half saturation constants maximum and minimum nutrients quotas as nonlinear functions of cell volume taxon number temperature and irradiance mean square errors were lower than the errors in respective relationships to the cell volume only these functions were used to fill in the gaps in the ecological archive verification of the obtained relationships was performed using an energy balance model and new data on nutrient utilization traits not used for their estimation keywords uptake rate half saturation constant intracellular content maximum growth rate nitrogen phosphorus energy balance model 1 introduction in recent years a lot of attention was focused on the implementation of the functional trait based approaches in the phytoplankton ecology reay et al 1999 litchman et al 2007 edwards et al 2012 fiksen et al 2013 barton et al 2013 phytoplankton functional traits are characteristics that determine nutrients uptake photosynthesis intensity biomass growth and reproduction in other words they determine fitness of species in different environmental conditions these characteristics can be estimated in culture experiments and then used in the parameterizations of physiological processes of marine and freshwater phytoplankton a comprehensive review of essential components of trait based approaches and their application to phytoplankton community ecology were made by litchman and klausmeier 2008 following their summary points phytoplankton traits can be classified by ecological function reproduction resource acquisition and predator avoidance and trait type morphological physiological behavioural and life history in this study we deal with the resource acquisition physiological traits which include cell size maximum nutrient uptake rates specific growth rates half saturation constants maximum and minimum intracellular quotas of the main biologically active substances any supposed system of differential equations describing the functionality of the phytoplankton community dynamics must include these parameters however the relationships between nutrient utilization traits and environmental factors remain insufficiently explored cell size is an important functional trait of phytoplankton it affects the main physiological rates including growth photosynthesis respiration light absorption requirements of nutrients and their uptake e g finkel 2001 litchman and klausmeier 2008 edwards et al 2012 variability of these eco physiological properties is mostly determined by log log allometric relationships these functions are often used to predict the physiological and ecological traits of phytoplankton and evolution of model community finkel et al 2010 wirtz 2011 ward et al 2012 terseleer et al 2014 the trait biogeographical approach was considered in barton et al 2013 where the authors analysed the distribution of plankton communities in the ocean as well as possible influences of climate change on their current structures they also emphasized the necessity to develop a global database of the plankton functional traits similar to the try plant traits database http www try db org since community trait composition determines the rates of significant processes including global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other elements a similar database was proposed in edwards et al 2015 the authors compiled an archive of measurements obtained in culture experiments using nitrate ammonium or phosphate as the limiting nutrient although the resulting data set included 1319 measurements on 129 species it is highly sparse which constrains its use in phytoplankton ecology lindemann et al 2016 used this dataset to obtain allometric relationships for uptake affinity they found that nutrient uptake affinity scales are in proportion to the quantity that is closer to the cell surface area but not the volume in the recent review published by taherzadeh et al 2017 the authors analysed high uncertainties regarding the quantitative and qualitative form of the allometric relationships for the nutrient utilization traits they concluded that despite the fact that physiological size constraints alone cannot provide realistic simulations of phytoplankton community allometric relationships remain the most important for at least nutrient affinity maximum growth rate and subsistence quota of intracellular nutrients experimental data in the dataset edwards et al 2015 contain the following nutrient utilization traits of marine and freshwater phytoplankton the maximum growth rate minimum subsistence quota at which growth ceases and the maximum nutrient quota under unlimited nutrient supply the maximum uptake rate and nutrient concentration at which uptake is half saturated they were obtained under different external conditions irradiance day length and temperature of the experiment we tried to find complex empirical dependencies for these nutrient utilization traits from four independent variables cell volume taxonomic group irradiance and temperature for this purpose we used our own approach based on the nn technique vasechkina and yarin 2001 thus we managed to estimate approximations for maximum growth rates maximum rates and half saturation constants for nitrate ammonium and phosphate uptake maximum and minimum quotas of nitrogen and phosphorus for six taxonomic groups of marine phytoplankton these approximations allowed to fill in the gaps in the initial data set verification of the found approximations was carried out using the energy balance model of phytoplankton community dynamics proposed in vasechkina and filippova 2019 and laboratory experiments data in the sections below we present a description of the data set the nn technique used for estimation of the relationships and the energy balance model analyse the obtained results with graphical and analytical representations and discuss verification performed using the energy balance model and experimental data not used in the simulations before 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the dataset edwards et al 2015 contains nutrient utilization traits on 129 species including marine and freshwater species from 13 major taxonomic groups we selected only 6 taxonomic groups of marine phytoplankton cyanobacteria diatomeae dinophyta chlorophyta haptophyta and raphidophyta this choice was determined by lack of data on other taxonomic groups that could be used to identify possible dependencies of the physiological traits on environmental factors the resulted data set contains 174 records with the measurements of phytoplankton physiological traits listed above this data set was quite sparse containing 82 of gaps the variability range of the selected variables is presented in table a 1 we chose four independent factors as possible predictors cell volume μm3 taxonomic group parameterized by an integer number temperature c and light intensity μmol photon m 2 s 1 used in the experiment the last two were the only variables that indicated the external conditions of the experiments collected in the archive the variability range of these factors is shown in table a 2 due to large variability range of the main morphological trait of marine phytoplankton cell volume 8 orders of magnitude observed variability of the physiological traits is also very large we cannot expect good approximations for the traits of different species using such scattered data especially considering the large number of gaps in the data set however we can try to obtain some average approximations for taxonomic groups without further detalization 2 2 algorithm for this purpose we applied the technique developed by vasechkina and yarin 2001 which showed good results in dealing with similar tasks this is an algorithm for evolving a feed forward nn with simultaneous identification of weights using quadratic polynomials for constructing the output function nonlinear multivariable dependence fig 1 shows the conceptual scheme of the algorithm in accordance with the algorithm the sought for dependencies had the form of a quadratic polynomial 1 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j i n a i j x i x j where y is the output variable some estimate of a physiological trait x i are the predictors as shown in table 1 and n is the sample size the applied technique belongs to a group of methods called group methods of data handling gmdh first proposed in ivakhnenko 1970 ivakhnenko et al 1994 this is a family of algorithms for computer based mathematical modelling of multi parametric datasets the core of the technique is the selection procedure which implements consequent testing of the so called models candidates in accordance with the given criterion using a supervised learning procedure this method allows finding the functional dependence of the output on the most significant inputs of the system structural and parametric optimization of the output models is fully automatic we proposed to organize the selection procedure by means of the genetic algorithm and this enhancement allowed us to increase the accuracy of the estimation of nonlinear connections between the input and output variables on small samples vasechkina and yarin 2001 ga runs for each neuron searching for its optimal set of connections with the preceding layer while learning neurons are able to estimate which inputs are necessary to minimize the fitness function thus the neurons can organize the network structure by themselves and may be called active neurons overfitting of the models candidates was excluded by using different parts of the whole sample for coefficients estimation fitness calculation and the final choice of the best model coefficients of the polynomials were calculated on the learning subsample while the fitness function was estimated on the control subsample several data points should remain on reserve only for the final choice of the best model at the last layer of the nn we simplified this algorithm in accordance with the peculiarities of the considered simulations only four predictors and short available data samples impossibility to pick out a number of data that will not be used in estimation of the model candidates the data samples were divided into learning and control subsamples with the ratio 2 1 and the final choice was made by comparing the relative error of the models on the whole data sample another simplification was setting the number of degrees of freedom equal to one this reduced the complexity of the resulted approximations opposed overfitting and enabled to present the models in an algebraic form the table for the nn learning was prepared in the following way for each functional trait corresponding rows with the experimental data were selected from the data archive an example of the training table is shown in table 1 we used logarithmic representation for all the variables except temperature and light to parameterize the categorical predictor taxonomic group we tried to use several variants of contrast encoding method due to insufficient data for estimation of any distinctive indicators for a number of taxonomic groups we simplified the scheme and used the first six integers for encoding the order of taxons in each simulation was mainly adjusted by comparing the trait mean values and variated to obtain smaller relative error of the resulted approximation we carried out a lot of numeric experiments changing the sequence of taxa and comparing the results under visual analysis of the obtained approximations mean square error was not the only criterion for the final choice of the model we analysed the behaviour of the traits approximations within the allowed range of factors variability the function could not go beyond the scope known from the observations therefore we could use it for interpolation of the traits data set within the given boundaries of the input variables 2 3 energy balance model for verification we applied the model that describes the phytoplankton growth as a balance between the incoming energy and structure maintenance costs this model is a modified approach previously developed in klausmeier and litchman 2004 zhao et al 2008 its detailed description and justification are provided in vasechkina and filippova 2019 here we provide the equations of this model without any discussion 2 d z d t μ m z 3 μ μ max min f q n f q p 4 f q n q n q n min q n max q n min 5 f q p q p q p min q p max q p min 6 d q n d t v n o 3 n o 3 k no 3 n o 3 v n h 4 n h 4 k nh

by the nn technique table 2 we can run eqs 2 10 within the intervals of the factors variability indicated above table a 2 we applied this model to reproduce numerically the culture experiments on measuring the uptake rates of phytoplankton these simulated data were then compared with the actual data of the laboratory observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 obtained relationships reliability of the approximations was estimated using fisher criterion which shows how much the factor dispersion exceeds the residual one the calculated value was compared with the tabular value of the f criterion the difference indicated the degree of reliability of the obtained approximation due to this indicator all the obtained approximations are representative at the probability level α 0 01 for all considered traits f criterion was much higher than the tabular value we could not apply the nn algorithm to estimate the maximum quota of the intracellular nitrogen maximum rate and half saturation constant for ammonium uptake due to insufficient data on these traits therefore we calculated ammonium uptake properties as linear relationships with the nitrate uptake properties and applied the redfield ratio to estimate the maximum quota of nitrogen q n max q n min 16 q p max q p min allometric scaling law for carbon content was calculated using the data from mullin et al 1966 verity et al 1992 menden deuer and lessard 2000 quality of the models was also estimated by calculating the mean square error relative to the standard deviation of the data sample this criterion was between 0 14 and 0 52 for different traits the results of our calculations are shown in fig 2 fig a 1 and table 2 diagrams in fig 2 visualize the obtained nonlinear functions for two traits as examples charts in fig a 1 illustrate the accuracy of the found approximations of the nutrient utilization traits actual data are on x axis and simulated data on y axis table 2 contains approximations in an algebraic form 3 2 comparison with allometric relationships analyzing nonlinear relationships in table 2 we can conclude that cell volume is a really important factor for every physiological trait however addition of other factors into the formulas decreases the resulting approximation error for example fig 3 shows linear allometric relationships for several nutrient utilization traits in comparison with the proposed nonlinear approximations mean square errors for these two approaches are in table 3 nutrient uptake rates much stronger depend on cell volume than half saturation constants of uptake but even for these traits nonlinear approximations gave better results despite the large variability range of physiological traits compiled in the archive and corresponding large absolute errors of the approximations the functions in table 2 could be applied to fill in the gaps in the archive edwards et al 2015 and compare general features of different taxonomic groups 3 3 verification to perform verification of the obtained nonlinear dependencies we selected several papers with detailed descriptions of the laboratory experiments on measuring the uptake kinetics of phytoplankton hu et al 2014 jauzein et al 2017 collos et al 2004 that were not included in the archive edwards et al 2015 and therefore were not used in our calculations consider them in order in hu et al 2014 uptake kinetics was measured in nitrate deplete and replete batch cultures of prorocentrum donghaiense which belong to a group of harmful dinoflagellates the conditions of the experiments were the following irradiance was equal to 60 μmol photon m 2 s 1 temperature was 23 c concentration of nitrates and ammonium considered as a single source of nitrogen varied from 0 1 μm to 50 μm incubation time was 1 h in nitrate replete experiments concentration of nitrates was 50 μm and ammonium concentration was the same as indicated above in fig 4 we present the measured data from the cited paper fig 2 a b fig 3 b in hu et al 2014 in comparison with the model data obtained by reproduction of these experiments using eqs 2 10 the authors estimated the specific uptake rate h 1 so we calculated a similar variable as 1 24 v n o 3 q n 1 24 v n h 4 q n h 1 we averaged these variables during the first modeling hour to explicitly reproduce the conditions of the laboratory experiments cell volume of p donghaiense was not indicated in the paper so we estimated its average value as 2700 μm3 according to the description in lu and goebel 2001 in this comparison there is some uncertainty connected with the lack of information in the cited paper about the initial values of nutrients intracellular content which are important for calculating the model uptake rates we defined these initial values for nitrogen and phosphorus as 0 9 of the maximum quota since the culture samples were taken at the exponentially growing culture actually the initial value of q n is a fitting parameter for simulation as nutrients quotas affect the uptake rates there was no information about the external concentration of phosphorus during the experiments either so we defined its factor according to the redfield ratio graphs for ammonium uptake fig 4 b c correlate worse because the half saturation constant for ammonium uptake was expectedly estimated with a bigger error specific growth rate does not depend much on the initial intracellular content and external nutrient concentrations if they are sufficient for growth in hu et al 2014 specific growth rates were 0 72 d 1 for nitrate as a single source of nitrogen and 0 8 d 1 for ammonium our model gave almost equal estimates for nitrate 0 59 d 1 and ammonium 0 61 d 1 the next comparison was performed with the observed data published in jauzein et al 2017 this paper is devoted to the study of nitrogen uptake kinetics of the toxic dinoflagellate ostreopsis cf ovata the experiments were performed at 23 c and irradiance 250 μmol photon m 2 s 1 with two strains of ostreopsis cf ovata mccv 054 and mccv 055 which were obtained from the mediterranean culture collection of villefranche the average biovolume was calculated for these strains in pavaux et al 2019 as 17360 μm3 incubations started with addition of nitrates or ammonium as a single source under eight final concentrations 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 5 and 10 µm the samples were incubated for 1 h under these conditions the results of our simulation together with the observed data from jauzein et al 2017 are shown in fig 5 the special growth rate in an exponential phase was 0 47 d 1 in the model and in the range 0 39 0 51 d 1 during the cited experiments the third paper collos et al 2004 was devoted to the study of toxic dinoflagellates alexandrium catenella with the cell volume 17 724 μm3 according to edwards et al 2015 the experiments on uptake kinetics were carried out under the following conditions temperature 20 c irradiance 150 μmol photon m 2 s 1 culture samples resuspended in n free medium were then incubated for 1 h at given nitrogen concentration from 1 to 50 μm in the form of nitrates or ammonium the model specific growth rate was estimated as 0 45 d 1 while the observed growth rate was 0 33 d 1 in the laboratory experiments and varied from 0 1 to 0 59 d 1 in the field observations during october november 2001 bloom collos et al 2004 we simulated the uptake kinetics experiments in the same manner as the previous ones the results are shown in fig 6 the intracellular nitrogen content of a catenella in the cultures ranged from 5 to 25 pmol n cell 1 the model gave the corresponding range 5 2 29 pmol cell 1 due to the abovementioned uncertainties connected with the unknown initial quotas of nitrogen and phosphorus and phosphates external concentration precise meanings of the calculated uptake rates are not so important as the fact that our model reproduces well the michaelis menten curve of the uptake kinetics however biphasic uptake is not reproduced by our model because it has no information about such behavior of phytoplankton besides this the model does not reproduce the inhibition of nitrate uptake by ammonium that was observed in the batch cultures experiments 4 conclusions applications of the proposed model can include investigations of the cellular elemental stoichiometry of marine phytoplankton affected by light and temperature similar studies were conducted in vasechkina 2019 where we used the approximations from table 2 to study the reaction of several phytoplankton groups to the sharp step wise changes in the main environmental factors after change a new stable state was established during a short time interval from 4 h to 2 days in different taxonomic groups due to large alterations of the uptake rates this model can be also embedded in a spatial physical biochemical model in this case it can be used for investigations of interactions between the phytoplankton communities and changing environment marine phytoplankton is an active subject and at the same time the object of global biogeochemical cycles primary production fixation of carbon dioxide carbon and nutrients transfer into the deeper layers of the ocean inorganic nutrients uptake and organic matter release into the surrounding waters can alter the stoichiometry of the upper layers of the ocean environmental conditions in turn affect biomass growth and species diversity of marine phytoplankton the identified relationships between nutrient utilization traits and environmental factors can be applied in plankton biogeography for example using the functions in table 2 we can estimate spatial distribution of the nutrient uptake affinity for common phytoplankton groups as a function of zonal and seasonal variability of temperature and light for a variety of cell volumes constraints of our model are defined by constraints of the data set used to construct the approximations for the nutrient utilization traits and errors of these approximations connected with the integration of plankton species to large groups small sample sizes for the nn learning and natural variability of these traits even within the same species data in the archive edwards et al 2015 were obtained in the batch culture experiments it is likely that in nature phytoplankton can manifest eco physiological traits that differ from those estimated in laboratory conditions approximation errors are indexed above and can be diminished by enlarging the data samples for network learning it will become realistic when the results of the new experiments on estimating the eco physiological traits of marine phytoplankton are obtained funding this work was supported partially by marine hydrophysical

considered in barton et al 2013 where the authors analysed the distribution of plankton communities in the ocean as well as possible influences of climate change on their current structures they also emphasized the necessity to develop a global database of the plankton functional traits similar to the try plant traits database http www try db org since community trait composition determines the

data not used in the simulations before 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the dataset edwards et al 2015 contains nutrient utilization traits on 129 species including marine and freshwater species from 13 major taxonomic groups we selected only 6 taxonomic groups of marine phytoplankton cyanobacteria diatomeae dinophyta chlorophyta haptophyta and raphidophyta this choice was determined by lack of data on other taxonomic groups that could be used to identify possible dependencies of the physiological traits on environmental factors the resulted data set contains 174 records with the measurements of phytoplankton physiological traits listed above this data set was quite sparse containing 82 of gaps the variability range of the selected variables is presented in table a 1 we chose four independent factors as possible predictors cell volume μm3 taxonomic group parameterized by an integer number temperature c and light intensity μmol photon m 2 s 1 used in the experiment the last two were the only variables that indicated the external conditions of the experiments collected in the archive the variability range of these factors is shown in table a 2 due to large variability range of the main morphological trait of marine phytoplankton cell volume 8 orders of magnitude observed variability of the physiological traits is also very large we cannot expect good approximations for the traits of different species using such scattered data especially considering the large number of gaps in the data set however we can try to obtain some average approximations for taxonomic groups without further detalization 2 2 algorithm for this purpose we applied the technique developed by vasechkina and yarin 2001 which showed good results in dealing with similar tasks this is an algorithm for evolving a feed forward nn with simultaneous identification of weights using quadratic polynomials for constructing the output function nonlinear multivariable dependence fig 1 shows the conceptual scheme of the algorithm in accordance with the algorithm the sought for dependencies had the form of a quadratic polynomial 1 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j i n a i j x i x j where y is the

verity et al 1992 menden deuer and lessard 2000 quality of the models was also estimated by calculating the mean square error relative to the standard deviation of the data sample this criterion was between 0 14 and 0 52 for different traits the results of our calculations are shown in fig 2 fig a 1 and table 2 diagrams in fig 2 visualize the obtained nonlinear functions for two traits as examples charts in fig a 1 illustrate the accuracy of the found approximations of the nutrient utilization traits actual data are on x axis and simulated data on y axis table 2 contains approximations in an algebraic form 3 2 comparison with allometric relationships analyzing nonlinear relationships in table 2 we can conclude that cell volume is a really important factor for every physiological trait however addition of other factors into the formulas decreases the resulting approximation error for example fig 3 shows linear allometric relationships for several nutrient utilization traits in comparison with the proposed nonlinear approximations mean square errors for these two approaches are in table 3 nutrient uptake rates much stronger depend on cell volume than half saturation constants of uptake but even for these traits nonlinear approximations gave better results despite the large variability range of physiological traits compiled in the archive and corresponding large absolute errors of the approximations the functions in table 2 could be applied to fill in the gaps in the archive edwards et al 2015 and compare general features of different taxonomic groups 3 3 verification to perform verification of the obtained nonlinear dependencies we selected several papers with detailed descriptions of the laboratory experiments on measuring the uptake kinetics of phytoplankton hu et al 2014 jauzein et al 2017 collos et al 2004 that were not included in the archive edwards et al 2015 and therefore were not used in our calculations consider them in order in hu et al 2014 uptake kinetics was measured in nitrate deplete and replete batch cultures of prorocentrum donghaiense which belong to a group of harmful dinoflagellates the conditions of the experiments were the following irradiance was equal to 60 μmol photon m 2 s 1 temperature was 23 c concentration of nitrates and ammonium considered as a single source of nitrogen varied from 0 1 μm to 50 μm incubation time was 1 h in nitrate replete experiments concentration of nitrates was 50 μm and ammonium concentration was the same as indicated above in fig 4 we present the measured data from the cited paper fig 2 a b fig 3 b in hu et al 2014 in comparison with the model data obtained by reproduction of these experiments using eqs 2 10 the authors estimated the specific uptake rate h 1 so we calculated a similar variable as 1 24 v n o 3 q n 1 24 v n h 4 q n h 1 we averaged these variables during the first modeling hour to explicitly reproduce the conditions of the laboratory experiments cell volume of p donghaiense was not indicated in the paper so we estimated its average value as 2700 μm3 according to the description in lu and goebel 2001 in this comparison there is some uncertainty connected with the lack of information in the cited paper about the initial values of nutrients intracellular content which are important for calculating the model uptake rates we defined these initial values for nitrogen and phosphorus as 0 9 of the maximum quota since the culture samples were taken at the exponentially growing culture actually the initial value of q n is a fitting parameter for simulation as nutrients quotas affect the uptake rates there was no information about the external concentration of phosphorus during the experiments either so we defined its factor according to the redfield ratio graphs for ammonium uptake fig 4 b c correlate worse because the half saturation constant for ammonium uptake was expectedly estimated with a bigger error specific growth rate does not depend much on the initial intracellular content and external nutrient concentrations if they are sufficient for growth in hu et al 2014 specific growth rates were 0 72 d 1 for nitrate as a single source of nitrogen and 0 8 d 1 for ammonium our model gave almost equal estimates for nitrate 0 59 d 1 and ammonium 0 61 d 1 the next comparison was performed with the observed data published in jauzein et al 2017 this paper is devoted to the study of nitrogen uptake kinetics of the toxic dinoflagellate ostreopsis cf ovata the experiments were performed at 23 c and irradiance 250 μmol photon m 2 s 1 with two strains of ostreopsis cf ovata mccv 054 and mccv 055 which were obtained from the mediterranean culture collection of villefranche the average biovolume was calculated for these strains in pavaux et al 2019 as 17360 μm3 incubations started with addition of nitrates or ammonium as a single source under eight final concentrations 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 5 and 10 µm the samples were incubated for 1 h under these conditions the results of our simulation together with the observed data from jauzein et al 2017 are shown in fig 5 the special growth rate in an exponential phase was 0 47 d 1 in the model and in the range 0 39 0 51 d 1 during the cited experiments the third paper collos et al 2004 was devoted to the study of toxic dinoflagellates alexandrium catenella with the cell volume 17 724 μm3 according to edwards et al 2015 the experiments on uptake kinetics were carried out under the following conditions temperature 20 c irradiance 150 μmol photon m 2 s 1 culture samples resuspended in n free medium were then incubated for 1 h at given nitrogen concentration from 1 to 50 μm in the form of nitrates or ammonium the model specific growth rate was estimated as 0 45 d 1 while the observed growth rate was 0 33 d 1 in the laboratory experiments and varied from 0 1 to 0 59 d 1 in the field observations during october november 2001 bloom collos et al 2004 we simulated the uptake kinetics experiments in the same manner as the previous ones the results are shown in fig 6 the intracellular nitrogen content of a catenella in the cultures ranged from 5 to 25 pmol n cell 1 the model gave the corresponding range 5 2 29 pmol cell 1 due to the abovementioned uncertainties connected with the unknown initial quotas of nitrogen and phosphorus and phosphates external concentration precise meanings of the calculated uptake rates are not so important as the fact that our model reproduces well the michaelis menten curve of the uptake kinetics however biphasic uptake is not reproduced by our model because it has no information about such behavior of phytoplankton besides this the model does not reproduce the inhibition of nitrate uptake by ammonium that was observed in the batch cultures experiments 4 conclusions applications of the proposed model can include investigations of the cellular elemental stoichiometry of marine phytoplankton affected by light and temperature similar studies were conducted in vasechkina 2019 where we used the approximations from table 2 to study the reaction of several phytoplankton groups to the sharp step wise changes in the main environmental factors after change a new stable state was established during a short time interval from 4 h to 2 days in different taxonomic groups due to large alterations of the uptake rates this model can be also embedded in a spatial physical biochemical model in this case it can be used for investigations of interactions between the phytoplankton communities and changing environment marine phytoplankton is an active subject and at the same time the object of global biogeochemical cycles primary production fixation of carbon dioxide carbon and nutrients transfer into the deeper layers of the ocean inorganic nutrients uptake and organic matter release into the surrounding waters can alter the stoichiometry of the upper layers of the ocean environmental conditions in turn affect biomass growth and species diversity of marine phytoplankton the identified relationships between nutrient utilization traits and environmental factors can be applied in plankton biogeography for example using the functions in table 2 we can estimate spatial distribution of the nutrient uptake affinity for common phytoplankton groups as a function of zonal and seasonal variability of temperature and light for a variety of cell volumes constraints of our model are defined by constraints of the data set used to construct the approximations for the nutrient utilization traits and errors of these approximations connected with the integration of plankton species to large groups small sample sizes for the nn learning and natural variability of these traits even within the same species data in the archive edwards et al 2015 were obtained in the batch culture experiments it is likely that in nature phytoplankton can manifest eco physiological traits that differ from those estimated in laboratory conditions approximation errors are indexed above and can be diminished by enlarging the data samples for network learning it will become realistic when the results of the new experiments on estimating the eco physiological traits of marine phytoplankton are obtained funding this work was supported partially by marine hydrophysical

environmental influences dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a rigorous and generic conceptual framework for tackling these questions in a relevant mechanistic way in the present study parameterisation and calibration of previous deb models for solea solea were revisited in order to accurately represent the full life cycle with an original emphasis on larval stage metamorphosis reproduction rules and sexual differences we first improved calibration thanks to the use of the estimation procedure developed by the deb network coupled with a broad compilation of data from literature then we validated this set of parameter estimates on independent datasets of i individual monitoring of larval growth in controlled food conditions from a novel experiment and ii juvenile and adult growth and female fecundity from a natural population finally we combined the deb model developed in the present paper with we used a simple toxicokinetic tk model from literature this tk model was also combined to a previous deb model and was used to reproduce the mean trajectories of a growth and contamination dataset we applied the same tk model with our deb model considering inter individual variability in food availability this application highlighted the need to accurately consider inter individual variability in ingestion to correctly estimate growth and contamination

work was the first attempt to implement a mechanistic approach to model juvenile sole dietary contamination using data from a six month experiment consisting in contamination decontamination regimes in their toxicokinetic model the uptake flux depends on biological traits dynamics notably food ingestion and growth themselves predicted by a mechanistic bioenergetic model based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 in the present study we developed a deb model for solea solea that aims to mechanistically describe the processes of food consumption and growth involved in dietary contamination experiments and in the natural environment combining detailed experimental data and field data can be challenging thus the methodology used aimed at ensuring that the model was relevant for both experimental and estuarine environmental studies and for several life stages also a special attention was given to investigate sources of inter individual variability we focused on the variability of experimental or natural conditions especially regarding food quality and availability in the first part of the present work we focused on improving the latest deb models for common sole teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 eichinger et al 2010 we did so by combining i an update of the theory on which the model is based e g maturity compartment sex specific parameters ii an upgrade of the parameterization so it would better represent some particular life stages i e larval stage and metamorphosis and differences between male and female i e reproduction rules and iii an upgrade of the calibration especially to predict food ingestion more accurately we improved the deb parameter calibration by using the estimation procedure developed by the deb network coupled with a broad compilation of data from the literature finally we validated this set of parameters using independent datasets of individual larvae growth in controlled conditions with monitored feeding published in this work and juvenile and adult growth and reproduction from a natural population teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 in the second part we combined the deb model developed in the present paper with the tk model from eichinger et al 2010 and applied it to the growth and contamination datasets from the same work in addition we simulated multiple virtual fish with several levels of alimentation to investigate if heterogeneity of feeding accessibility between individuals could lead to both observed growth and cb153 contamination variability a companion paper mounier et

edition of deb theory kooijman 2010 2 1 1 1 metabolic acceleration for this study we used the typified deb model named abj recommended for species including a metamorphosis in their early life cycle

extended standard std deb model considers a type m metabolic acceleration of assimilation and mobilization between birth b and metamorphosis j stages kooijman 2014 lika et al 2014 induced changes in deb parameters are described in appendix a3 2 1 1 2 life stages to account for the whole life cycle of common sole five life stages were considered in our model they were triggered when eh exceeded fixed threshold values corresponding to four parameters hatching parameter e h h end of egg stage birth parameter e h b start of feeding and metabolic acceleration metamorphosis parameter e h j end of metabolic acceleration and metamorphosis and puberty parameter e h p end of maturation and start of allocation to reproduction buffer 2 1 1 3 temperature correction in the present study we considered the extended version of the temperature correction factor kooijman 2010 to allow considering conditions outside of the optimal temperature range of atlantic population of the common sole the five parameters ta tal tah tl and th are described in table 1 and equations are described in appendix a4 2 1 2 sexual dimorphism sex differences in growth and puberty were observed for common sole deniel 1981 to model these differences as in the model for the atlantic halibut from amp collection wiedmann et al 2017 amp hippoglossus hippoglossus version 2017 03 06 we considered different values between male and female for two parameters 1 the maximum specific assimilation p a m value to reproduce growth dimorphism and 2 the level of maturity at puberty e h p sex difference on p a m was applied throughout the life cycle these assumptions are discussed in section 4 1 some additional differences between sexes were added to predict realistic weights of reproduction buffer and thus realistic total weights for adults the auxiliary parameter of reproduction buffer energy density ϱ r was differentiated as eggs have a greater lipid content than semen in fish vassallo agius et al 2001 leading to a higher energy density we assumed that sexes also differ from their reproduction overheads κr as suggested by freitas et al 2010 2 1 3 reproduction rules reproduction rules permit to model how and when mature fish are emitting their gametes which is an important process to consider for future work on population dynamics and decontamination through gametes emission bodiguel et al 2009 daouk et al 2011 munschy et al 2017 but outside the scope of the present study for mature fish e h e h p energy allocated to reproduction p r is instantly used to gamete production stored in the reproduction buffer er after deduction of the reproduction overheads 1 κ r p r gametes are stored until spawning season according to the histological sections of gonads made by deniel 1981 the common sole oocyte maturation cycle lasts 1 year thus in the model females reaching puberty e h e h p less than 1 year before the following spawning season were not allowed to emit gametes during this first season indeed ramsay and witthames 1996 observed that in the recruiting year class of sole for a large number of fish ovaries development started but was aborted before complete maturation probably leading to the atretic resorption of the vitellogenic oocytes we thus assumed that this energy allocated to reproduction was entirely lost through the energetic processes of atresia consequently er is emptied for each sex at the end of spawning period whether by atresia or gametes emission gametes emission was triggered at given dates in the model for female spawning was divided into two batches of eggs to reproduce the two groups of oocytes maturing sequentially as described by deniel 1981 gametes emission was triggered at dates matching with the observations by this author on spawning peaks in the bay of biscay on february 1st half of the er content was emitted and on march 1st er was emptied indeed in fully matured females atresia only concerns a small number of oocytes deniel 1981 to our knowledge there is no information about the frequency of male gametes emission in the natural environment nonetheless we can assume that males are mating with several females during the spawning season moreover unlike females their gonado somatic index remains low and constant during the reproduction period deniel 1981 indicating that gametes can be regularly emitted to stagger the emptying of male reproduction buffer we supposed that males emit batches of similar size regularly during all the spawning season we arbitrarily chose to model 10 batches i e approximately one every 10 days each one was supposed to contain 10 of the initial er content i e before the emission of the first batch apart from the last batch that also contained the energy allocated to reproduction during the spawning period to empty the buffer at the end of this season 2 1 4 from state variables to observations as deb state variables refer to abstract quantities auxiliary theory is needed to link these predicted variables to measurements for model calibration and application kooijman 2010 in deb theory physical length lw is calculated using the structural volume v and the shape coefficient δm following l w v 1 3 δ m in our study for juvenile and adult stages the shape coefficient is constant and noted δ m a for larval stage this coefficient evolved from δ m l at hatching e h e h h to δ m a at metamorphosis e h e h j along with the maturity buffer eh following this equation δ δ m l e h e h h e h j e h h δ m a δ m l total dry weight of the fish w is the sum of model compartments dry weights w w v w e w r dry weight of structure wv is calculated as w v v d v where dv is the density of dry structure dry weights of reserve we and reproduction buffer wr are calculated from the energy stored in the corresponding compartments e and r using their respective energy densities ϱ e and ϱ r w e e ϱ e and w r r ϱ r the common way to convert dry mass to wet mass is to assume constant water content to approximate these relationships for our species we used the relationship described by fonds et al 1989 between fulton s condition index and fish water content first we calculated a fulton s index on dry weight k 100 w l w 3 to estimate the dry content d in thanks to relationship from fonds et al 1989 d 40 68 k 0 364 then total wet weight ww was calculated from total dry weight and dry content following the formula w w w d 100 annual fecundity is the sum of the eggs emitted for each batch which are computed by dividing the energy emitted from the reproduction buffer for this batch by the energy content of one egg e 0 however for sake of simplicity as no data on batch were available for model calibration and validation we used the debtool function to predict daily fecundity by computing the daily energy allocated to reproduction for a given length minus the cost of egg production divided by the energy content of one egg then we obtained the annual fecundity by multiplying the daily fecundity by 365 2 2 model calibration and validation 2 2 1 model calibration most of the deb parameters were calibrated simultaneously from empirical datasets from literature using the debtool estimation procedure presented in marques et al 2018 for parameter estimation information on the common sole was taken from published literature and raw data from deniel s phd work 1981 provided by ifremer the zero variate data i e comprising a single data point are given in table s2 along with their respective sources day et al 1996 deniel 1981 devauchelle et al 1987 dorel 1986 fonds 1979 galois et al 1990 the data includes information on egg weight and energy content age length and weight at hatch birth metamorphosis and puberty for each sex for the last stage ultimate length and weight for each sex life span for each sex and maximum reproduction rate per day for female the univariate data comprising two dimensions observations are given in table s3 along with their respective sources day et al 1996 deniel 1981 fonds and saksena 1977 lund et al 2008 and consisted in time series of growth in length and weight for larvae in controlled conditions in situ time series of growth in length and length weight relationship for each sex brittany france in situ annual egg production at different lengths brittany france and juvenile ingestion rate at different lengths and temperatures in controlled conditions thus the data used came from multiple sources that considered different living environments aquaculture experimentation in situ life stages and populations therefore they were considered differently in the estimation procedure according to the purpose of our model application our choices about data weights used in the mydata matlab file see electronic supplementary and the relative importance in model adjustment to the different datasets are further discussed in the supplementary material sm file section 1 1 3 due to the lack of detailed information in the literature some parameters from table 1 could not be estimated first some of them e g digestion efficiency of food maturity maintenance rate coefficient reserve and structure energy densities see table 1 were set to typical values established for a wide variety of animals i e the generalized animal values introduced by lika et al 2011 for the energy densities of reproduction buffer ϱ r for males and females we assumed that egg and semen compositions were similar to reserve and structure compartments compositions respectively for female κr a generalized animal value exists but not for male thus after the estimation of all other parameters we chose to calibrate κ r for males to reproduce the observed difference in weight loss during the reproduction period between females and males see sm section 1 2 for detailed method most temperature correction parameters were fixed to literature values for our species references used are indicated in table 1 and assumptions made can be found in sm section 1 3 the remaining parameters were calibrated using the estimation procedure presented in marques et al 2018b it consists of estimating all deb parameters simultaneously from several empirical datasets by minimizing the weighted sum of squares deviation between model predictions and observations we used the codes for parameter estimation developed in the debtool package freely downloadable at http www bio vu nl thb deb deblab with matlab program version r2016b for this estimation we retrieved a large set of natural and experimental data from the literature to compare with model predictions matlab files provided in supplementary materials contain all codes and data used in combination with the debtool package these files allow repeatability of the computations the relative error re of each dataset was computed and used to quantify the overall goodness of fit of the model with the mean relative error mre in 0 and symmetric mean squared error smse in 0 1 marques et al 2018 values of mre and smse close to 0 mean that the model predictions are globally close to the data the estimated parameter set was then compared with those from previous deb models for s solea teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 eichinger et al 2010 freitas et al 2010 van der veer et al 2001 following the deb model classification from freitas et al 2010 deb type of model were labelled deb2 for the second version of deb theory kooijman 2000 and deb3 for the third one kooijman 2010 classically deb2 models estimated mechanistic parameters independently directly from observations of each mechanism however parameters that are not directly observable e g energy conductance v couldn t be estimated properly to estimate these parameters deb3 models benefitted from the covariation method lika et al 2011 marques et al 2018a and deb parameters are estimated conjointly from all datasets together the overall goodness of fit i e mre and smse was also compared with the one from amp collection as it was calibrated using the same procedure 2 2 2 model validation larval phase we confronted the present deb model to independent datasets on larval growth from birth to metamorphosis in controlled conditions of temperature and salinity and with individually monitored feeding this recent experiment was carried out by a e sardi as part of her post doctorate project detailed experimental design and monitoring protocols can be found in sm section 2 s solea larvae were reared in microplates with constant temperature 16 1 c for 33 days post hatching from 5 dph onwards i e mouth opening larvae were fed with artemia salina the number of artemias ate per larva was monitored daily the objective was to provide food ad libitum without compromising the quality of the water the length of 12 larvae was monitored every week starting at 7 dph until the end of the experiment at 33 dph at the end of the experiment dry weight was measured for all larvae a score of metamorphosis completion ranging from 0 unstarted metamorphosis to 9 complete metamorphosis was also defined for each larva depending on morphologic observations see the methods in sm section 2 2 raw datasets of individual daily food consumption daily portion of food distributed having been ingested growth monitoring and final dry weight can be found in sm in tables s7 s8 s9 and s10 respectively we used information on the number of prey artemias ingested daily by each fish in order to use the deb ingestion flux p x as a model input directly this flux being in energy per day we had to transform the number of artemias ingested per day into joules ingested per day the weight and energy density of artemias from this experiment were not measured and the literature reported a large variability for both of them indeed individual dry weight of an artemia nauplius instar i ranged from 1 63 to 3 33 µg and dry energy density from 21760 to 22480 j g 1 vanhaecke et al 1983 to cope with this variability we performed two simulations for each larva using either the minimum or maximum individual energy content for a nauplius these values were estimated respectively multiplying either the minimum values of weight and energy density low food condition or their maximums high food condition the validation of the model for the larval phase was performed by comparing the data on individual growth trajectories and final dry weight to the predictions of the model for each larvae using their respective food intakes in number of artemias per day and either a low or high food condition also two virtual fish were modelled for an ad libitum scenario using f 1 and either the minimum or maximum energy density of nauplii from vanhaecke et al 1983 the initiation of the simulations corresponds to larvae of 4 dph and the day just before the first feeding in the experiment i e birth stage in deb model to estimate the initial values for deb state variables we computed the deb model at 16 c and f 1 ad libitum and took their values for the day just before birth stage was reached simulations of growth trajectories in length and weight for each food condition were graphically compared to measurements predicted age at metamorphosis for each simulation and differences between individuals were compared to the observed scores of metamorphosis completion juvenile and adult phases we compared the present deb model to independent datasets on juvenile and adult growth and female fecundity from a natural population that was different from the one used for calibration data on age length and length fecundity relationships were obtained from the univariate data used to calibrate the model for solea solea from the amp collection teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 the original source of the age length relationship was estimated from an imares institute for marine resources ecosystem studies database called frisbe containing otolith back calculation data for females teal 2015 explored this database in 2011 and estimated an age length relationship the original source of the length fecundity relationship is witthames et al 1995 they estimated potential annual fecundity from histological method applied to the ovaries of females sampled in the ices division ivb east in 1991 to compare model predictions to these datasets teal assumed that the mean annual temperature was 10 c for the north sea and estimated a different value of scaled functional response f for each dataset for the purpose of model validation predictions were obtained using the deb estimates set calibrated in this work apart from the environmental parameter characterizing food availability f this parameter was estimated for each one of the two datasets using the debtool package the temperature used was the same one used in the 2015 amp model for these data we also compared model predictions with an additional fecundity dataset from an adjacent area ivb west from the same source witthames et al 1995 2 3 model application for model application on juvenile phase we used data from eichinger et al 2010 on growth performance and internal concentration in cb153 and cb105 during a dietary exposure experiment of common sole juveniles to a mixture of pcbs a summary of the material and methods information necessary for model application from this contamination decontamination experiment is presented in sm section 3 we investigated if heterogeneity of feeding accessibility between individuals could lead to both observed growth and contamination variability for that purpose we applied the present deb model for several virtual fish characterized by different food levels and different initial weights we compared growth predictions with the observed variability in weight between individuals monitored from the onset to the end of eichinger et al 2010 experiment to investigate the influence that these two types of variability sources exert on bioaccumulation we applied the bioaccumulation model from eichinger et al 2010 using the present deb model pcb concentration in fish c b f i s h was computed for each cb following these formulas d c b f i s h d t c b f o o d μ f o o d p a and c b f i s h c b f i s h w w with c b f i s h the fish body burden ng c b f o o d the concentration in food ng gfood 1 ww μfood the food

of the ingestion and 2 not eliminated but can only be diluted by growth the range of weight at the onset of the experiment was defined using the 95 confidence interval of the population of dosed fish at the onset thus we assumed that this sample was representative of a normally distributed population of fish whose median weight is equal to 16 0 g and standard deviation equal to 4 6 g we computed simulations for two initial weights corresponding to the mean weight of this population 1 96 times the standard deviation the range of variations of food availability for the different fish in tank was simulated by the use of extremum f values i e the smallest value not leading to growth costs that would be larger than the somatic part of the catabolization flux and the ad libitum value assumed to be equal to 1 for each virtual fish this value was kept constant during the experiment model predictions for the six combinations of initial weights and food conditions were graphically confronted to individual measurements of total wet weight and to pooled individuals measurements of cb153 and cb105 contamination levels 2 4 implementation model calibration and validation on juvenile and adult phases were performed using software package debtool in matlab simulations for model validation on larval phase and model application were implemented using r language r core team 2017 version 3 6 1 and the integrated development environment ide r studio version 1 2 5019 3 results 3 1 model calibration the parameter estimates of the present deb model are presented along with those from previous deb models for s solea in table 2 compared to previous estimation sets our estimation procedure led to an intermediate set between deb2 and deb3 models indeed deb2 sets were characterized by higher p a m v p m and eg values than those from deb3 models despite those differences κ estimates from all models were close from 0 70 to 0 77 apart from the estimate of van der veer et al 2001 n b this value was approximated but not estimated for s solea by the authors newly estimated parameter of male fraction of energy allocated to gametes κ r was more than twice lower than female one the parameter estimation resulted in an overall good fit between predictions and observations used for calibration mre 0 187 smse 0 173 model fits to all datasets used for the calibration the relative errors re associated and the environmental forcings used are presented in sm section 1 1 2 the model predicted particularly well the larval growth patterns fig 1 a b with the relative errors being 0 12 and 0 08 for length and weight respectively the model captured well juvenile and adult growth fig 1c with the predicted growth curves accurately matching the mean growth patterns of females and males re 0 07 for both a slightly higher deviation was observed for female reproductive output fig 1d with a relative error of 0 20 indeed annual egg production was overestimated for the females from 34 to 38 cm approximately early developmental aspects were less well captured by the model see table s2 marked deviations were especially recorded for age and weight at hatching re 0 55 and 0 46 respectively age at birth re 0 41 and regarding temperature response for these life stages re 0 53 for tah and re 0 43 for tab see univariate data from table s3 compared to age length at birth and hatching were better estimated re 0 26 and 0 21 metamorphosis stage was the early life stage with the better fit for age length weight and temperature response with relative errors of 0 24 0 10 0 02 and 0 19 respectively puberty stage was better predicted for male re 0 08 0 10 than female re 0 17 0 38 for female it was the wet weight that had the worst fit re 0 38 also the maximum reproduction rate was less well predicted re 0 4 overall the model performed particularly well at predicting juvenile food consumption at several temperatures re between 0 03 and 0 17 for temperatures between 10 and 22 c see table s3 however at 26 c the model overestimated food ingestion with increasing length see table s3 indicating that toward the upper edge of the temperature tolerance range the model predictive capacity is probably reduced 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 larval phase in fig 2 we compared the length observations on larval growth trajectories linked black points to our model simulations for each larva using either the low or high food condition blue and orange curves respectively the observations were also compared to the ad libitum predictions with low and high nauplii energy density the simulations with low and high food condition delineate the area of possible predictions with this food condition range fig 3 shows similar comparisons but using the final dry weight of larvae the low and high food conditions computed were equal to 3 5 10 2 and 7 5 10 2 j artemia 1 respectively for all simulations initial values for deb state variables were e 1 1 j v 1 6 10 4 cm3 eh 0 258 j and er 0 j simulations suggested that larvae were not fed ad libitum which was in accordance with the observed portions of food distributed that had been ingested during the day that were equal to 100 for more than 50 of the observations see table s8 the model performed well at predicting final weight inter individual variability as the different simulations with the two extreme food conditions wrapped around observations pretty well fig 3 contrary to weight predictions length predictions were less well adjusted to observed growth trajectories first observations were underestimated for both food conditions whereas last observations were well predicted by the low food condition and overestimated by high food condition fig 2 for a given food condition predicted inter individual variability at 33 dph was much more underestimated for weight fig 3 than for length fig 2 i e standard deviations were underestimated by a factor 4 4 and 2 for weight and length respectively table 3 summarizes the predicted age at metamorphosis for each fish at each food scenario together with the stage of metamorphosis achieved by day 33 post hatching none of the larvae simulated with low food condition reached metamorphosis whereas all simulations with high food condition reached it none of the larvae observed reached the maximum completion score i e 9 thus observations were comprised between low and high food condition predictions of metamorphosis the relationship between predicted age at metamorphosis and observed completion score was not clear the individual with the highest metamorphosis completion score 2 c1 matched with its simulation that led to one of the youngest age at metamorphosis on the contrary the oldest predicted ages at metamorphosis 3 a1 and 2 a1 did not correspond to all the least visually developed larvae i e 2 b1 was the one with the lowest score 3 2 2 juvenile and adult phases we validated the present amp model for the juvenile and adult phases with the datasets used for the 2015 amp calibration amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 we compared the present amp and the 2015 amp model adjustments the estimation procedure of f value needed to confront model predictions to datasets resulted in a value of 0 529 for the age length dataset fig 4 and a value of 0 774 for the length fecundity dataset fig 5 the present model better predicted the shape of the growth trajectory compared to the 2015 amp model fig 4 with the relative errors being 0 03 and 0 12 respectively on the contrary model adjustment to fecundity was better for the 2015 amp model fig 5 with a relative error of 0 17 the relative error being 0 46 for the present model the present model underestimated fecundity with increasing length however the 2015 amp model did not predict that puberty could be reached for the smallest fish whereas the present model did i e puberty length of 26 3 cm and 23 5 cm respectively with the f values considered reserve energy in one eggs e 0 was equal to 2 54 j for present amp and 0 34 j for 2015 amp model underestimation was reduced when comparing predictions with fecundity data from the adjacent division of the north sea fig 5 3 3 model application we compared our model growth predictions using different food levels and initial weights to the inter individual variability observed during the experiment of dietary exposure to pcbs from eichinger et al 2010 the minimum value of f not leading to growth costs that would be larger than the somatic part of the mobilization flux was equal to 0 2 the eight model simulations corresponding to the combination of the two initial weights and the two food conditions for each sex are plotted along with individual measurements of weight in fig 6 the envelope formed by the different combinations of conditions covered a large majority of the observations 96 n 442 the higher the food condition the more initial inter individual variability was amplified over time however when considering only one food condition even with the highest one predicted variability at the end of the experiment was underestimated we combined the food ingestion kinetics associated to the growth simulations presented above with the tk model from eichinger et al 2010 we compared the resulting predictions of accumulation and depuration kinetics with measured chemical data from pooled individuals from the same experiment fig 7 and fig 8 show respectively the predicted cb153 and cb105 contamination levels of fish during the experiment the predicted envelopes for male and female were similar they covered 57 of observations for cb153 and 46 for cb105 n 37 for both model adjustment was similar for the two contaminants for both of them considering the whole envelope predicted inter individual variability increased during the contamination period to reach a 2 8 fold difference whereas this variability decreased to a 1 3 fold difference during the decontamination period the same trend was observed for measurements but the variability was approximately twice the one predicted i e 5 7 and 2 3 fold differences at 84 and 168 days respectively also initial inter individual variability for a given f value induces an increasing difference of contamination level during the contamination period approximately in the same way for the two food conditions the smaller the fish is at the onset of contamination the more contaminated it gets by day 84 on the contrary during the decontamination period the difference between simulations decreases over time the decontamination is quicker for high food condition and smaller fish at the end of the decontamination period these trends lead to 1 lower contamination levels of the smallest fish compared to the bigger ones for the high food condition and to 2 lower contamination for all the fish from high food condition compared to the bigger fish from low food condition 4 discussion 4 1 improvements of the solea solea life cycle model 4 1 1 overall adjustment this study allowed us improving the parameterisation and calibration of a sole deb model compared to the latest deb model for s solea in the amp collection teal 2015 indeed 1 we used the newest methods for deb parameters calibration based on the covariation method implemented into the debtool package 2 we gathered the most widely available data from the literature for male and female ever used for this species calibration including ingestion datasets that have never been considered and 3 the overall adjustment mre 0 187 smse 0 173 was slightly better that the one from the previous model using the same kind of estimation procedure mre 0 192 and smse 0 267 from amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 the overall goodness of fit of the present model was even more satisfying given the large diversity of datasets used which highlighted the robustness of this new model indeed deb theory assumes that the parameter set is individual specific thus the estimated parameter set corresponded to that of a mean individual however distributions of individual parameter values may depend on the population considered i e different genotypes consequently the mean individual can be different from one dataset to another whereas only one parameter set was estimated to deal with that constraint inflated by the large number of datasets used we made choices about model adjustment to each dataset according to our modelling applications objectives see sm 1 1 3 where they are discussed this calibration strategy led to a set of estimates that permitted to better predict growth inflection compared to the 2015 amp model 4 1 2 modelling sexual growth dimorphism as ingestion and growth are two major processes involved in pops bioaccumulation and spawning on decontamination it is important to specify the influence of sex on these different processes bodiguel et al 2009 thus the present model explicitly considered sexual dimorphism in modelling sole energy allocation dynamics we considered both sex as did eichinger et al 2010 but we considered a difference in ingestion instead of in the portion of mobilised energy allocated to growth κ with this assumption the model permitted to accurately reproduce growth dimorphism observed for female and male in the dataset used for calibration that was common with the work from eichinger et al 2010 kooijman 2014 assumed that elephant seal mirounga leonina growth dimorphism observed after puberty was induced by sex differentiation of maximum food assimilation rate p a m only after puberty here as in the atlantic halibut model we applied this difference on p a m throughout the life cycle it implied that females and males feed and grow differently even before maturity this assumption was supported by a study on solea senegalensis a closely related species conducted by viñas et al 2013 who concluded that this species shows an early gonadal and growth dimorphism i e observable from 3 to 6 months old histological observations of spermatogonia or oogonia moreover in the present model application on juvenile growth this assumption led to growth differences between sexes that were included in the observed variability thus we could not reject this assumption using this dataset also in model validation during larval growth predicted for ad libitum condition sex differences in length led to a difference of 2 at 35 dph i e 0 4 mm which is also included in the observed variability at 35 dph i e 0 7 mm thus 8 difference between min and max observations 4 1 3 puberty stage maturity level at puberty e h p was also a sex specific parameters we were able to obtain parameter estimates that had in the validation step on a north sea population a more accurate prediction of the length at which females are able to produce maturing oocytes compared to the 2015 amp model the error on female age at puberty prediction in the calibration step of the current model re 0 24 see sm section 1 1 2 is probably due the uncertainty on the data used as it was inferred from observations of gonadal activity during spawning period see sm section 1 1 3 indeed puberty does not imply immediate gonadal activity for female thus age at puberty data used is often too high as a consequence as data on length and weight at puberty were inferred from this age at puberty coupled with age length or length weight relationship respectively an underestimation of this age induced an underestimation of length and an even higher effect on weight fit i e due to the strong slope of length weight relationship 4 1 4 delayed female first reproduction the accuracy of the predicted first reproduction depends on e h p value and on the reproduction rules for female the latter have been improved to gain realism and to lay the foundations for further research on adults decontamination through gametes emission contaminant transfer to next generations and thus impact of contamination on population dynamics it is noteworthy that their full validation is beyond the scope of the present study as they require further analysis and confrontation to measurements however our assumption about the delayed first reproduction due to egg maturation duration was congruent with several previous observations in addition to those of ramsay and witthames 1996 indeed le bec 1983 also observed that oocyte maturation of the youngest mature soles 25 30 cm probably in their first year of maturity was stopped in vitellogenesis by the end of the spawning period bromley 2003 also observed this lack of full maturation in these individuals referred as non spawning adolescents they also observed that after the spawning season for this year class the ovaries were fully emptied with evidence of atresia consequently a portion of the first year matured females seems to develop eggs justifying considering a cost of transformation into gametes but abort development and reabsorbed these oocytes justifying considering no spawning for these females however some additional research is necessary to support the assumption of fully lost energy through atretic resorption this delayed first reproduction highlights the need to study the variability in the birth date within the spawning period and in the nursery quality experienced in the context of global changes as these factors are probably the source of the portion of females from this year class that would not be able to spawn 4 1 5 female fecundity for the larger females the present model adjustment to the fecundity dataset from a north sea population was poorer than that of the 2015 amp model however first the value of the energy content of one egg e 0 used for this population was much lower in the 2015 amp model than in the present amp model i e e 0 0 34 j and 2 54 j respectively considering their respective f values moreover the 2015 amp value for e 0 was probably unrealistic indeed contrary to the 2015 amp model we used information from two different sources of measurements for e 0 in our calibration they both indicated an estimate of approximately 2 j see sm 1 1 3 female egg production thus 2015 amp model was probably able to predict a greater fecundity because the e 0 value was too low in addition the authors who produced the fecundity dataset used in the 2015 amp model highlighted that this zone i e ivb east have the highest fecundity observed indicating either phenotypic plasticity or genotypic evolution witthames et al 1995 as the latter assumption would probably lead to the differentiation of deb parameters estimates for this population it could explain the lack of model fit using parameters estimated for another population however the complementary dataset from the same publication but for an adjacent zone from north sea i e ivb west was in better agreement with present amp model predictions consequently the present deb estimates set for s solea could be applied to different populations even from the north sea however knowledge of the growth rate and the length fecundity relationship of the population would reduce the uncertainty in the predictions of the present amp model 4 1 6 male reproduction unfortunately for males no validation on growth and no quantitative observations of reproduction were found to confront our assumptions about male first reproduction gametes emission i e multiple batches and parameters involved only in reproduction ϱ r and κ r however we considered that the estimation of a 2 to 3 fold lower proportion of energy allocated to reproduction fixed in emitted gametes κ r in male compared to female was plausible indeed semen composition is supposed to be much different from reserve composition as its composition differs from egg composition which is assumed to be close the reserve composition indeed contrary to egg semen contains a poor overall lipid content with a larger portion of polar lipids which are structural lipids compared to non polar lipids which are reserve lipids vassallo agius et al 2001 thus it would require more energy for male than for female to transform reserve into gametes moreover spermatogenesis may also require more energy due to the proteins required during meiosis that may lose its function which leads to apoptosis for 30 of the germ cells for the nile tilapia and 45 for the guppy schulz et al 2010 4 1 7 early life stages the present model permitted also to predict accurately the metamorphosis stage which is crucial to better predict larvae settlement in nurseries yet in the calibration step earlier stages are less well predicted than the metamorphosis stage i e regarding ages at stage and their relationship to temperature however in both calibration and validation steps thus in different experimental conditions the model led to satisfactory predictions of larval growth from birth to metamorphosis indeed considering the range of possible artemia s quality the only assumption needed for forcings given that the number of artemias ingested was known both growth in weight and metamorphosis stage observations were comprised between the predictions for model fit to growth in length the same trend was observed in calibration and validation steps length was underestimated at the beginning of larval development and overestimated at the end this can be due to the modelling of shape evolution during larval development and metamorphosis the refinement of this auxiliary theory to obtain total length from predicted structure may be necessary however as growth monitoring may be necessary to study bioaccumulation and toxicity during the larval stage we recommend the use of weight measurements which was particularly well predicted by the model 4 2 added value of model application on contamination decontamination experiment the inter individual variability of contamination in dietary contamination experiments is often large eichinger et al 2010 consequently it adds uncertainty on the estimates of toxicokinetic parameters in the experiment used in this paper authors also highlighted a large variability in growth here the use of deb model with different initial weights and levels of food availability allowed to show that feeding variability could lead to both growth and contamination variability variability in feeding conditions was already underlined in a deb framework by stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 on european sea bass reared from aquaculture they reported high temporal variations on the scaled functional response f parameter from 0 4 to 1 estimated to reproduce mean population growth dynamics the authors supposed that it was due to irregularities in the feeding scheme in the present application we wanted to reproduce inter individual variability of f probably due to competition for food accessibility i e belt feeder located only in one part of the tank the modelled variability i e f between 0 2 and 1 led to extreme growth curves corresponding to the curves described either by the smallest or the largest fish at each time step thus inter individual variability seems to be larger in our model application than mean population variability through time for sea bass also considering that cb153 is poorly eliminated by fish kannan et al 1995 it could be used as a feeding tracer thus the good reproduction by the model of growth and contamination variabilities supports our assumptions on f variability and cb153 toxicokinetic properties i e no elimination and a full assimilation from the assimilated part of food as a consequence individual monitoring of growth and the knowledge of initial biometry for each fish may be crucial to better estimate individual feeding thanks to the deb model in this type of experiment and thereafter to better estimate toxicokinetic parameters moreover our results seems to highlight that taking into account this feeding variability is as important as taking into account metabolisation to better understand fish contamination indeed when considering f variability with full assimilation of contaminant from food and no elimination the model fit for both cb105 as well as for cb153 yet contrary to cb153 cb105 can be metabolized by fish kannan et al 1995 therefore the feeding variability was probably so large that we were not able to detect that this contaminant is metabolizable 5 conclusion our study allowed improving the common sole deb model parameterisation and calibration for each sex and several types of environment these improvements lay solid foundations for future use of this tool in bioaccumulation studies on the juvenile phase both in contaminated nurseries and in experimental conditions indeed the modelling framework developed here is the first step in the development of a mechanistic tk model that would permit to consider ingestion growth and contamination variability in different environments and for different life stages to be used in a wide range of applications first we showed in the present work that taking feeding variability into account is a necessary prerequisite to evaluate toxicokinetic parameters in experimental conditions on juvenile stage then in a second paper from mounier et al 2020 we show that this framework was useful for the study of juvenile growth and contamination sensitivity to warming nursery quality and prey contamination in highly fluctuating estuarine environments finally in a long term perspective this modelling framework allows to include contaminant transfer to the next generations and adverse effects from internal concentration e g deb tox on demographic characters i e growth reproduction survival of the different life stages ultimately predicted consequences of warming diet modifications and contamination on these individual characters will allow studying their consequences on population dynamics alunno bruscia et al 2009 horri et al 2018 declaration of competing interests the authors

24771,studying adverse effects of chemical pressure on aquatic ecosystems needs a comprehensive knowledge of bioaccumulation mechanisms of pollutants in biota to predict internal concentrations especially for persistent organic pollutants pops however the large variability of responses in measured pop concentrations requires explicit consideration of both individual variability and environmental influences dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a rigorous and generic conceptual framework for tackling these questions in a relevant mechanistic way in the present study parameterisation and calibration of previous deb models for solea solea were revisited in order to accurately represent the full life cycle with an original emphasis on larval stage metamorphosis reproduction rules and sexual differences we first improved calibration thanks to the use of the estimation procedure developed by the deb network coupled with a broad compilation of data from literature then we validated this set of parameter estimates on independent datasets of i individual monitoring of larval growth in controlled food conditions from a novel experiment and ii juvenile and adult growth and female fecundity from a natural population finally we combined the deb model developed in the present paper with we used a simple toxicokinetic tk model from literature this tk model was also combined to a previous deb model and was used to reproduce the mean trajectories of a growth and contamination dataset we applied the same tk model with our deb model considering inter individual variability in food availability this application highlighted the need to accurately consider inter individual variability in ingestion to correctly estimate growth and contamination

aquatic ecosystems and among them coastal and estuarine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to global changes especially to climate change hoegh guldberg and bruno 2010 and contamination e g

work was the first attempt to implement a mechanistic approach to model juvenile sole dietary contamination using data from a six month experiment consisting in contamination decontamination regimes in their toxicokinetic model the uptake flux depends on biological traits dynamics notably food ingestion and growth themselves predicted by a mechanistic bioenergetic model based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 in the present study we developed a deb model for solea solea that aims to mechanistically describe the processes of food consumption and growth involved in dietary contamination experiments and in the natural environment combining detailed experimental data and field data can be challenging thus the methodology used aimed at ensuring that the model was relevant for both experimental and estuarine environmental studies and for several life stages also a special attention was given to investigate sources of inter individual variability we focused on the variability of experimental or natural conditions especially regarding food quality and availability in the first part of the present work we focused on improving the latest deb models for common sole teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 eichinger et al 2010 we did so by combining i an update of the theory on which the model is based e g maturity compartment sex specific parameters ii an upgrade of the parameterization so it would better represent some particular life stages i e larval stage and metamorphosis and differences between male and female i e reproduction rules and iii an upgrade of the calibration especially to predict food ingestion more accurately we improved the deb parameter calibration by using the estimation procedure developed by the deb network coupled with a broad compilation of data from the literature finally we validated this set of parameters using independent datasets of individual larvae growth in controlled conditions with monitored feeding published in this work and juvenile and adult growth and reproduction from a natural population teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 in the second part we combined the deb model developed in the present paper with the tk model from eichinger et al 2010 and applied it to the growth and contamination datasets from the same work in addition we simulated multiple virtual fish with several levels of alimentation to investigate if heterogeneity of feeding accessibility between individuals could lead to both observed growth and cb153 contamination variability a companion paper mounier et

fixed threshold values corresponding to four parameters hatching parameter e h h end of egg stage birth parameter e h b start of feeding and metabolic acceleration metamorphosis parameter e h j end of metabolic acceleration and metamorphosis and puberty parameter e h p end of maturation and start of allocation to reproduction buffer 2 1 1 3 temperature correction in the present study we considered the extended version of the temperature correction factor kooijman 2010 to allow considering conditions outside of the optimal temperature range of atlantic population of the common sole the five parameters ta tal tah tl and th are described in table 1 and equations are described in appendix a4 2 1 2 sexual dimorphism sex differences in growth and puberty were observed for common sole deniel 1981 to model these differences as in the model for the atlantic halibut from amp collection wiedmann et al 2017 amp hippoglossus hippoglossus version 2017 03 06 we considered different values between male and female for two parameters 1 the maximum specific assimilation p a m value to reproduce growth dimorphism and 2 the level of maturity at puberty e h p sex difference on p a m was applied throughout the life cycle these assumptions are discussed in section 4 1 some additional differences between sexes were added to predict realistic weights of reproduction buffer and thus realistic total weights for adults the auxiliary parameter of reproduction buffer energy density ϱ r was differentiated as eggs have a greater lipid content than semen in fish vassallo agius et al 2001 leading to a higher energy density we assumed that sexes also differ from their reproduction overheads κr as suggested by freitas et al 2010 2 1 3 reproduction rules reproduction rules permit to model how and when mature fish are emitting their gametes which is an important process to consider for future work on population dynamics and decontamination through gametes emission bodiguel et al 2009 daouk et al 2011 munschy et al 2017 but outside the scope of the present study for mature fish e h e h p energy allocated to reproduction p r is instantly used to gamete production stored in the reproduction buffer er after deduction of the reproduction overheads 1 κ r p r gametes are stored until spawning season according to the histological sections of gonads made by deniel 1981 the common sole oocyte maturation cycle lasts 1 year thus in the model females reaching puberty e h e h p less than 1 year before the following spawning season were not allowed to emit gametes during this first season indeed ramsay and witthames 1996 observed that in the recruiting year class of sole for a large number of fish ovaries development started but was aborted before complete maturation probably leading to the atretic resorption of the vitellogenic oocytes we thus assumed that this energy allocated to reproduction was entirely lost through the energetic processes of atresia consequently er is emptied for each sex at the end of spawning period whether by atresia or gametes emission gametes emission was triggered at given dates in the model for female spawning was divided into two batches of eggs to reproduce the two groups of oocytes maturing sequentially as described by deniel 1981 gametes emission was triggered at dates matching with the observations by this author on spawning peaks in the bay of biscay on february 1st half of the er content was emitted and on march 1st er was emptied indeed in fully matured females atresia only concerns a small number of oocytes deniel 1981 to our knowledge there is no information about the frequency of male gametes emission in the natural environment nonetheless we can assume that males are mating with several females during the spawning season moreover unlike females their gonado somatic index remains low and constant during the reproduction period deniel 1981 indicating that gametes can be regularly emitted to stagger the emptying of male reproduction buffer we supposed that males emit batches of similar size regularly during all the spawning season we arbitrarily chose to model 10 batches i e approximately one every 10 days each one was supposed to contain 10 of the initial er content i e before the emission of the first batch apart from the last batch that also contained the energy allocated to reproduction during the spawning period to empty the buffer at the end of this season 2 1 4 from state variables to observations as deb state variables refer to abstract quantities auxiliary theory is needed to link these predicted variables to measurements for model calibration and application kooijman 2010 in deb theory physical length lw is calculated using the structural volume v and the shape coefficient δm following l w v 1 3 δ m in our study for juvenile and adult stages the shape coefficient is constant and noted δ m a for larval stage this coefficient evolved from δ m l at hatching e h e h h to δ m a at metamorphosis e h e h j along with the maturity buffer eh following this equation δ δ m l e h e h h e h j e h h δ m a δ m l total dry weight of the fish w is the sum of model compartments dry weights w w v w e w r dry weight of structure wv is calculated as w v v d v where dv is the density of dry structure dry weights of reserve we and reproduction buffer wr are calculated from the energy stored in the corresponding compartments e and r using their respective energy densities ϱ e and ϱ r w e e ϱ e and w r r ϱ r the common way to convert dry mass to wet mass is to assume constant water content to approximate these relationships for our species we used the relationship described by fonds et al 1989 between fulton s condition index and fish water content first we calculated a fulton s index on dry weight k 100 w l w 3 to estimate the dry content d in thanks to relationship from fonds et al 1989 d 40 68 k 0 364 then total wet weight ww was calculated from total dry weight and dry content following the formula w w w d 100 annual fecundity is the sum of the eggs emitted for each batch which are computed by dividing the energy emitted from the reproduction buffer for this batch by the energy content of one egg e 0 however for sake of simplicity as no data on batch were available for model calibration and validation we used the debtool function to predict daily fecundity by computing the daily energy allocated to reproduction for a given length minus the cost of egg production divided by the energy content of one egg then we obtained the annual fecundity by multiplying the daily fecundity by 365 2 2 model calibration and validation 2 2 1 model calibration most of the deb parameters were calibrated simultaneously from empirical datasets from literature using the debtool estimation procedure presented in marques et al 2018 for parameter estimation information on the common sole was taken from published literature and raw data from deniel s phd work 1981 provided by ifremer the zero variate data i e comprising a single data point are given in table s2 along with their respective sources day et al 1996 deniel 1981 devauchelle et al 1987 dorel 1986 fonds 1979 galois et al 1990 the data includes information on egg weight and energy content age length and weight at hatch birth metamorphosis and puberty for each sex for the last stage ultimate length and weight for each sex life span for each sex and maximum reproduction rate per day for female the univariate data comprising two dimensions observations are given in table s3 along with their respective sources day et al 1996 deniel 1981 fonds and saksena 1977 lund et al 2008 and consisted in time series of growth in length and weight for larvae in controlled conditions in situ time series of growth in length and length weight relationship for each sex brittany france in situ annual egg production at different lengths brittany france and juvenile ingestion rate at different lengths and temperatures in controlled conditions thus the data used came from multiple sources that considered different living environments aquaculture experimentation in situ life stages and populations therefore they were considered differently in the estimation procedure according to the purpose of our model application our choices about data weights used in the mydata matlab file see electronic supplementary and the relative importance in model adjustment to the different datasets are further discussed in the supplementary material sm file section 1 1 3 due to the lack of detailed information in the literature some parameters from table 1 could not be estimated first some of them e g digestion efficiency of food maturity maintenance rate coefficient reserve and structure energy densities see table 1 were set to typical values established for a wide variety of animals i e the generalized animal values introduced by lika et al 2011 for the energy densities of reproduction buffer ϱ r for males and females we assumed that egg and semen compositions were similar to reserve and structure compartments compositions respectively for female κr a generalized animal value exists but not for male thus after the estimation of all other parameters we chose to calibrate κ r for males to reproduce the observed difference in weight loss during the reproduction period between females and males see sm section 1 2 for detailed method most temperature correction parameters were fixed to literature values for our species references used are indicated in table 1 and assumptions made can be found in sm section 1 3 the remaining parameters were calibrated using the estimation procedure presented in marques et al 2018b it consists of estimating all deb parameters simultaneously from several empirical datasets by minimizing the weighted sum of squares deviation between model predictions and observations we used the codes for parameter estimation developed in the debtool package freely downloadable at http www bio vu nl thb deb deblab with matlab program version r2016b for this estimation we retrieved a large set of natural and experimental data from the literature to compare with model predictions matlab files provided in supplementary materials contain all codes and data used in combination with the debtool package these files allow repeatability of the computations the relative error re of each dataset was computed and used to quantify the overall goodness of fit of the model with the mean relative error mre in 0 and symmetric mean squared error smse in 0 1 marques et al 2018 values of mre and smse close to 0 mean that the model predictions are globally close to the data the estimated parameter set was then compared with those from previous deb models for s solea teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 eichinger et al 2010 freitas et al 2010 van der veer et al 2001 following the deb model classification from freitas et al 2010 deb type of model were labelled deb2 for the second version of deb theory kooijman 2000 and deb3 for the third one kooijman 2010 classically deb2 models estimated mechanistic parameters independently directly from observations of each mechanism however parameters that are not directly observable e g energy conductance v couldn t be estimated properly to estimate these parameters deb3 models benefitted from the covariation method lika et al 2011 marques et al 2018a and deb parameters are estimated conjointly from all datasets together the overall goodness of fit i e mre and smse was also compared with the one from amp collection as it was calibrated using the same procedure 2 2 2 model validation larval phase we confronted the present deb model to independent datasets on larval growth from birth to metamorphosis in controlled conditions of temperature and salinity and with individually monitored feeding this recent experiment was carried out by a e sardi as part of her post doctorate project detailed experimental design and monitoring protocols can be found in sm section 2 s solea larvae were reared in microplates with constant temperature 16 1 c for 33 days post hatching from 5 dph onwards i e mouth opening larvae were fed with artemia salina the number of artemias ate per larva was monitored daily the objective was to provide food ad libitum without compromising the quality of the water the length of 12 larvae was monitored every week starting at 7 dph until the end of the experiment at 33 dph at the end of the experiment dry weight was measured for all larvae a score of metamorphosis completion ranging from 0 unstarted metamorphosis to 9 complete metamorphosis was also defined for each larva depending on morphologic observations see the methods in sm section 2 2 raw datasets of individual daily food consumption daily portion of food distributed having been ingested growth monitoring and final dry weight can be found in sm in tables s7 s8 s9 and s10 respectively we used information on the number of prey artemias ingested daily by each fish in order to use the deb ingestion flux p x as a model input directly this flux being in energy per day we had to transform the number of artemias ingested per day into joules ingested per day the weight and energy density of artemias from this experiment were not measured and the literature reported a large variability for both of them indeed individual dry weight of an artemia nauplius instar i ranged from 1 63 to 3 33 µg and dry energy density from 21760 to 22480 j g 1 vanhaecke et al 1983 to cope with this variability we performed two simulations for each larva using either the minimum or maximum individual energy content for a nauplius these values were estimated respectively multiplying either the minimum values of weight and energy density low food condition or their maximums high food condition the validation of the model for the larval phase was performed by comparing the data on individual growth trajectories and final dry weight to the predictions of the model for each larvae using their respective food intakes in number of artemias per day and either a low or high food condition also two virtual fish were modelled for an ad libitum scenario using f 1 and either the minimum or maximum energy density of nauplii from vanhaecke et al 1983 the initiation of the simulations corresponds to larvae of 4 dph and the day just before the first feeding in the experiment i e birth stage in deb model to estimate the initial values for deb state variables we computed the deb model at 16 c and f 1 ad libitum and took their values for the day just before birth stage was reached simulations of growth trajectories in length and weight for each food condition were graphically compared to measurements predicted age at metamorphosis for each simulation and differences between individuals were compared to the observed scores of metamorphosis completion juvenile and adult phases we compared the present deb model to independent datasets on juvenile and adult growth and female fecundity from a natural population that was different from the one used for calibration data on age length and length fecundity relationships were obtained from the univariate data used to calibrate the model for solea solea from the amp collection teal 2015 amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 the original source of the age length relationship was estimated from an imares institute for marine resources ecosystem studies database called frisbe containing otolith back calculation data for females teal 2015 explored this database in 2011 and estimated an age length relationship the original source of the length fecundity relationship is witthames et al 1995 they estimated potential annual fecundity from histological method applied to the ovaries of females sampled in the ices division ivb east in 1991 to compare model predictions to these datasets teal assumed that the mean annual temperature was 10 c for the north sea and estimated a different value of scaled functional response f for each dataset for the purpose of model validation predictions were obtained using the deb estimates set calibrated in this work apart from the environmental parameter characterizing food availability f this parameter was estimated for each one of the two datasets using the debtool package the temperature used was the same one used in the 2015 amp model for these data we also compared model predictions with an additional fecundity dataset from an adjacent area ivb west from the same source witthames et al 1995 2 3 model application for model application on juvenile phase we used data from eichinger et al 2010 on growth performance and internal concentration in cb153 and cb105 during a dietary exposure experiment of common sole juveniles to a mixture of pcbs a summary of the material and methods information necessary for model application from this contamination decontamination experiment is presented in sm section 3 we investigated if heterogeneity of feeding accessibility between individuals could lead to both observed growth and contamination variability for that purpose we applied the present deb model for several virtual fish characterized by different food levels and different initial weights we compared growth predictions with the observed variability in weight between individuals monitored from the onset to the end of eichinger et al 2010 experiment to investigate the influence that these two types of variability sources exert on bioaccumulation we applied the bioaccumulation model from eichinger et al 2010 using the present deb model pcb concentration in fish c b f i s h was computed for each cb following these formulas d c b f i s h d t c b f o o d μ f o o d p a and c b f i s h c b f i s h w w with c b f i s h the fish body burden ng c b f o o d the concentration in food ng gfood 1 ww μfood the food energy density j gfood 1 ww p a the assimilation flux of food deb model prediction and ww the fish total wet weight gww this toxicokinetic model implies that pcbs are 1 as assimilated as food i e 80 of the ingestion and 2 not eliminated but can only be diluted by growth the range of weight at the onset of the experiment was defined using the 95 confidence interval of the population of dosed fish at the onset thus we assumed that this sample was representative of a normally distributed population of fish whose median weight is equal to 16 0 g and standard deviation equal to 4 6 g we computed simulations for two initial weights corresponding to the mean weight of this population 1 96 times the standard deviation the range of variations of food availability for the different fish in tank was simulated by the use of extremum f values i e the smallest value not leading to growth costs that would be larger than the somatic part of the catabolization flux and the ad libitum value assumed to be equal to 1 for each virtual fish this value was kept constant during the experiment model predictions for the six combinations of initial weights and food conditions were graphically confronted to individual measurements of total wet weight and to pooled individuals measurements of cb153 and cb105 contamination levels 2 4 implementation model calibration and validation on juvenile and adult phases were performed using software package debtool in matlab simulations for model validation on larval phase and model application were implemented using r language r core team 2017 version 3 6 1 and the integrated development environment ide r studio version 1 2 5019 3 results 3 1 model calibration the parameter estimates of the present deb model are presented along with those from previous deb models for s solea in table 2 compared to previous estimation sets our estimation procedure led to an intermediate set between deb2 and deb3 models indeed deb2 sets were characterized by higher p a m v p m and eg values than those from deb3 models despite those differences κ estimates from all models were close from 0 70 to 0 77 apart from the estimate of van der veer et al 2001 n b this value was approximated but not estimated for s solea by the authors newly estimated parameter of male fraction of energy allocated to gametes κ r was more than twice lower than female one the parameter estimation resulted in an overall good fit between predictions and observations used for calibration mre 0 187 smse 0 173 model fits to all datasets used for the calibration the relative errors re associated and the environmental forcings used are presented in sm section 1 1 2 the model predicted particularly well the larval growth patterns fig 1 a b with the relative errors being 0 12 and 0 08 for length and weight respectively the model captured well juvenile and adult growth fig 1c with the predicted growth curves accurately matching the mean growth patterns of females and males re 0 07 for both a slightly higher deviation was observed for female reproductive output fig 1d with a relative error of 0 20 indeed annual egg production was overestimated for the females from 34 to 38 cm approximately early developmental aspects were less well captured by the model see table s2 marked deviations were especially recorded for age and weight at hatching re 0 55 and 0 46 respectively age at birth re 0 41 and regarding temperature response for these life stages re 0 53 for tah and re 0 43 for tab see univariate data from table s3 compared to age length at birth and hatching were better estimated re 0 26 and 0 21 metamorphosis stage was the early life stage with the better fit for age length weight and temperature response with relative errors of 0 24 0 10 0 02 and 0 19 respectively puberty stage was better predicted for male re 0 08 0 10 than female re 0 17 0 38 for female it was the wet weight that had the worst fit re 0 38 also the maximum reproduction rate was less well predicted re 0 4 overall the model performed particularly well at predicting juvenile food consumption at several temperatures re between 0 03 and 0 17 for temperatures between 10 and 22 c see table s3 however at 26 c the model overestimated food ingestion with increasing length see table s3 indicating that toward the upper edge of the temperature tolerance range the model predictive capacity is probably reduced 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 larval phase in fig 2 we compared the length observations on larval growth trajectories linked black points to our model simulations for each larva using either the low or high food condition blue and orange curves respectively the observations were also compared to the ad libitum predictions with low and high nauplii energy density the simulations with low and high food condition delineate the area of possible predictions with this food condition range fig 3 shows similar comparisons but using the final dry weight of larvae the low and high food conditions computed were equal to 3 5 10 2 and 7 5 10 2 j artemia 1 respectively for all simulations initial values for deb state variables were e 1 1 j v 1 6 10 4 cm3 eh 0 258 j and er 0 j simulations suggested that larvae were not fed ad libitum which was in accordance with the observed portions of food distributed that had been ingested during the day that were equal to 100 for more than 50 of the observations see table s8 the model performed well at predicting final weight inter individual variability as the different simulations with the two extreme food conditions wrapped around observations pretty well fig 3 contrary to weight predictions length predictions were less well adjusted to observed growth trajectories first observations were underestimated for both food conditions whereas last observations were well predicted by the low food condition and overestimated by high food condition fig 2 for a given food condition predicted inter individual variability at 33 dph was much more underestimated for weight fig 3 than for length fig 2 i e standard deviations were underestimated by a factor 4 4 and 2 for weight and length respectively table 3 summarizes the predicted age at metamorphosis for each fish at each food scenario together with the stage of metamorphosis achieved by day 33 post hatching none of the larvae simulated with low food condition reached metamorphosis whereas all simulations with high food condition reached it none of the larvae observed reached the maximum completion score i e 9 thus observations were comprised between low and high food condition predictions of metamorphosis the relationship between predicted age at metamorphosis and observed completion score was not clear the individual with the highest metamorphosis completion score 2 c1 matched with its simulation that led to one of the youngest age at metamorphosis on the contrary the oldest predicted ages at metamorphosis 3 a1 and 2 a1 did not correspond to all the least visually developed larvae i e 2 b1 was the one with the lowest score 3 2 2 juvenile and adult phases we validated the present amp model for the juvenile and adult phases with the datasets used for the 2015 amp calibration amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 we compared the present amp and the 2015 amp model adjustments the estimation procedure of f value needed to confront model predictions to datasets resulted in a value of 0 529 for the age length dataset fig 4 and a value of 0 774 for the length fecundity dataset fig 5 the present model better predicted the shape of the growth trajectory compared to the 2015 amp model fig 4 with the relative errors being 0 03 and 0 12 respectively on the contrary model adjustment to fecundity was better for the 2015 amp model fig 5 with a relative error of 0 17 the relative error being 0 46 for the present model the present model underestimated fecundity with increasing length however the 2015 amp model did not predict that puberty could be reached for the smallest fish whereas the present model did i e puberty length of 26 3 cm and 23 5 cm respectively with the f values considered reserve energy in one eggs e 0 was equal to 2 54 j for present amp and 0 34 j for 2015 amp model underestimation was reduced when comparing predictions with fecundity data from the adjacent division of the north sea fig 5 3 3 model application we compared our model growth predictions using different food levels and initial weights to the inter individual variability observed during the experiment of dietary exposure to pcbs from eichinger et al 2010 the minimum value of f not leading to growth costs that would be larger than the somatic part of the mobilization flux was equal to 0 2 the eight model simulations corresponding to the combination of the two initial weights and the two food conditions for each sex are plotted along with individual measurements of weight in fig 6 the envelope formed by the different combinations of conditions covered a large majority of the observations 96 n 442 the higher the food condition the more initial inter individual variability was amplified over time however when considering only one food condition even with the highest one predicted variability at the end of the experiment was underestimated we combined the food ingestion kinetics associated to the growth simulations presented above with the tk model from eichinger et al 2010 we compared the resulting predictions of accumulation and depuration kinetics with measured chemical data from pooled individuals from the same experiment fig 7 and fig 8 show respectively the predicted cb153 and cb105 contamination levels of fish during the experiment the predicted envelopes for male and female were similar they covered 57 of observations for cb153 and 46 for cb105 n 37 for both model adjustment was similar for the two contaminants for both of them considering the whole envelope predicted inter individual variability increased during the contamination period to reach a 2 8 fold difference whereas this variability decreased to a 1 3 fold difference during the decontamination period the same trend was observed for measurements but the variability was approximately twice the one predicted i e 5 7 and 2 3 fold differences at 84 and 168 days respectively also initial inter individual variability for a given f value induces an increasing difference of contamination level during the contamination period approximately in the same way for the two food conditions the smaller the fish is at the onset of contamination the more contaminated it gets by day 84 on the contrary during the decontamination period the difference between simulations decreases over time the decontamination is quicker for high food condition and smaller fish at the end of the decontamination period these trends lead to 1 lower contamination levels of the smallest fish compared to the bigger ones for the high food condition and to 2 lower contamination for all the fish from high food condition compared to the bigger fish from low food condition 4 discussion 4 1 improvements of the solea solea life cycle model 4 1 1 overall adjustment this study allowed us improving the parameterisation and calibration of a sole deb model compared to the latest deb model for s solea in the amp collection teal 2015 indeed 1 we used the newest methods for deb parameters calibration based on the covariation method implemented into the debtool package 2 we gathered the most widely available data from the literature for male and female ever used for this species calibration including ingestion datasets that have never been considered and 3 the overall adjustment mre 0 187 smse 0 173 was slightly better that the one from the previous model using the same kind of estimation procedure mre 0 192 and smse 0 267 from amp solea solea version 2015 08 28 the overall goodness of fit of the present model was even more satisfying given the large diversity of datasets used which highlighted the robustness of this new model indeed deb theory assumes that the parameter set is individual specific thus the estimated parameter set corresponded to that of a mean individual however distributions of individual parameter values may depend on the population considered i e different genotypes consequently the mean individual can be different from one dataset to another whereas only one parameter set was estimated to deal with that constraint inflated by the large number of datasets used we made choices about model adjustment to each dataset according to our modelling applications objectives see sm 1 1 3 where they are discussed this calibration strategy led to a set of estimates that permitted to better predict growth inflection compared to the 2015 amp model 4 1 2 modelling sexual growth dimorphism as ingestion and growth are two major processes involved in pops bioaccumulation and spawning on decontamination it is important to specify the influence of sex on these different processes bodiguel et al 2009 thus the present model explicitly considered sexual dimorphism in modelling sole energy allocation dynamics we considered both sex as did eichinger et al 2010 but we considered a difference in ingestion instead of in the portion of mobilised energy allocated to growth κ with this assumption the model permitted to accurately reproduce growth dimorphism observed for female and male in the dataset used for calibration that was common with the work from eichinger et al 2010 kooijman 2014 assumed that elephant seal mirounga leonina growth dimorphism observed after puberty was induced by sex differentiation of maximum food assimilation rate p a m only after puberty here as in the atlantic halibut model we applied this difference on p a m throughout the life cycle it implied that females and males feed and grow differently even before maturity this assumption was supported by a study on solea senegalensis a closely related species conducted by viñas et al 2013 who concluded that this species shows an early gonadal and growth dimorphism i e observable from 3 to 6 months old histological observations of spermatogonia or oogonia moreover in the present model application on juvenile growth this assumption led to growth differences between sexes that were included in the observed variability thus we could not reject this assumption using this dataset also in model validation during larval growth predicted for ad libitum condition sex differences in length led to a difference of 2 at 35 dph i e 0 4 mm which is also included in the observed variability at 35 dph i e 0 7 mm thus 8 difference between min and max observations 4 1 3 puberty stage maturity level at puberty e h p was also a sex specific parameters we were able to obtain parameter estimates that had in the validation step on a north sea population a more accurate prediction of the length at which females are able to produce maturing oocytes compared to the 2015 amp model the error on female age at puberty prediction in the calibration step of the current model re 0 24 see sm section 1 1 2 is probably due the uncertainty on the data used as it was inferred from observations of gonadal activity during spawning period see sm section 1 1 3 indeed puberty does not imply immediate gonadal activity for female thus age at puberty data used is often too high as a consequence as data on length and weight at puberty were inferred from this age at puberty coupled with age length or length weight relationship respectively an underestimation of this age induced an underestimation of length and an even higher effect on weight fit i e due to the strong slope of length weight relationship 4 1 4 delayed female first reproduction the accuracy of the predicted first reproduction depends on e h p value and on the reproduction rules for female the latter have been improved to gain realism and to lay the foundations for further research on adults decontamination through gametes emission contaminant transfer to next generations and thus impact of contamination on population dynamics it is noteworthy that their full validation is beyond the scope of the present study as they require further analysis and confrontation to measurements however our assumption about the delayed first reproduction due to egg maturation duration was congruent with several previous observations in addition to those of ramsay and witthames 1996 indeed le bec 1983 also observed that oocyte maturation of the youngest mature soles 25 30 cm probably in their first year of maturity was stopped in vitellogenesis by the end of the spawning period bromley 2003 also observed this lack of full maturation in these individuals referred as non spawning adolescents they also observed that after the spawning season for this year class the ovaries were fully emptied with evidence of atresia consequently a portion of the first year matured females seems to develop eggs justifying considering a cost of transformation into gametes but abort development and reabsorbed these oocytes justifying considering no spawning for these females however some additional research is necessary to support the assumption of fully lost energy through atretic resorption this delayed first reproduction highlights the need to study the variability in the birth date within the spawning period and in the nursery quality experienced in the context of global changes as these factors are probably the source of the portion of females from this year class that would not be able to spawn 4 1 5 female fecundity for the larger females the present model adjustment to the fecundity dataset from a north sea population was poorer than that of the 2015 amp model however first the value of the energy content of one egg e 0 used for this population was much lower in the 2015 amp model than in the present amp model i e e 0 0 34 j and 2 54 j respectively considering their respective f values moreover the 2015 amp value for e 0 was probably unrealistic indeed contrary to the 2015 amp model we used information from two different sources of measurements for e 0 in our calibration they both indicated an estimate of approximately 2 j see sm 1 1 3 female egg production thus 2015 amp model was probably able to predict a greater fecundity because the e 0 value was too low in addition the authors who produced the fecundity dataset used in the 2015 amp model highlighted that this zone i e ivb east have the highest fecundity observed indicating either phenotypic plasticity or genotypic evolution witthames et al 1995 as the latter assumption would probably lead to the differentiation of deb parameters estimates for this population it could explain the lack of model fit using parameters estimated for another population however the complementary dataset from the same publication but for an adjacent zone from north sea i e ivb west was in better agreement with present amp model predictions consequently the present deb estimates set for s solea could be applied to different populations even from the north sea however knowledge of the growth rate and the length fecundity relationship of the population would reduce the uncertainty in the predictions of the present amp model 4 1 6 male reproduction unfortunately for males no validation on growth and no quantitative observations of reproduction were found to confront our assumptions about male first reproduction gametes emission i e multiple batches and parameters involved only in reproduction ϱ r and κ r however we considered that the estimation of a 2 to 3 fold lower proportion of energy allocated to reproduction fixed in emitted gametes κ r in male compared to female was plausible indeed semen composition is supposed to be much different from reserve composition as its composition differs from egg composition which is assumed to be close the reserve composition indeed contrary to egg semen contains a poor overall lipid content with a larger portion of polar lipids which are structural lipids compared to non polar lipids which are reserve lipids vassallo agius et al 2001 thus it would require more energy for male than for female to transform reserve into gametes moreover spermatogenesis may also require more energy due to the proteins required during meiosis that may lose its function which leads to apoptosis for 30 of the germ cells for the nile tilapia and 45 for the guppy schulz et al 2010 4 1 7 early life stages the present model permitted also to predict accurately the metamorphosis stage which is crucial to better predict larvae settlement in nurseries yet in the calibration step earlier stages are less well predicted than the metamorphosis stage i e regarding ages at stage and their relationship to temperature however in both calibration and validation steps thus in different experimental conditions the model led to satisfactory predictions of larval growth from birth to metamorphosis indeed considering the range of possible artemia s quality the only assumption needed for forcings given that the number of artemias ingested was known both growth in weight and metamorphosis stage observations were comprised between the predictions for model fit to growth in length the same trend was observed in calibration and validation steps length was underestimated at the beginning of larval development and overestimated at the end this can be due to the modelling of shape evolution during larval development and metamorphosis the refinement of this auxiliary theory to obtain total length from predicted structure may be necessary however as growth monitoring may be necessary to study bioaccumulation and toxicity during the larval stage we recommend the use of weight measurements which was particularly well predicted by the model 4 2 added value of model application on contamination decontamination experiment the inter individual variability of contamination in dietary contamination experiments is often large eichinger et al 2010 consequently it adds uncertainty on the estimates of toxicokinetic parameters in the experiment used in this paper authors also highlighted a large variability in growth here the use of deb model with different initial weights and levels of food availability allowed to show that feeding variability could lead to both growth and contamination variability variability in feeding conditions was already underlined in a deb framework by stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 on european sea bass reared from aquaculture they reported high temporal variations on the scaled functional response f parameter from 0 4 to 1 estimated to reproduce mean population growth dynamics the authors supposed that it was due to irregularities in the feeding scheme in the present application we wanted to reproduce inter individual variability of f probably due to competition for food accessibility i e belt feeder located only in one part of the tank the modelled variability i e f between 0 2 and 1 led to extreme growth curves corresponding to the curves described either by the smallest or the largest fish at each time step thus inter individual variability seems to be larger in our model application than mean population variability through time for sea bass also considering that cb153 is poorly eliminated by fish kannan et al 1995 it could be used as a feeding tracer thus the good reproduction by the model of growth and contamination variabilities supports our assumptions on f variability and cb153 toxicokinetic properties i e no elimination and a full assimilation from the assimilated part of food as a consequence individual monitoring of growth and the knowledge of initial biometry for each fish may be crucial to better estimate individual feeding thanks to the deb model in this type of experiment and thereafter to better estimate toxicokinetic parameters moreover our results seems to highlight that taking into account this feeding variability is as important as taking into account metabolisation to better understand fish contamination indeed when considering f variability with full assimilation of contaminant from food and no elimination the model fit for both cb105 as well as for cb153 yet contrary to cb153 cb105 can be metabolized by fish kannan et al 1995 therefore the feeding variability was probably so large that we were not able to detect that this contaminant is metabolizable 5 conclusion our study allowed improving the common sole deb model parameterisation and calibration for each sex and several types of environment these improvements lay solid foundations for future use of this tool in bioaccumulation studies on the juvenile phase both in contaminated nurseries and in experimental conditions indeed the modelling framework developed here is the first step in the development of a mechanistic tk model that would permit to consider ingestion growth and contamination variability in different environments and for different life stages to be used in a wide range of applications first we showed in the present work that taking feeding variability into account is a necessary prerequisite to evaluate toxicokinetic parameters in experimental conditions on juvenile stage then in a second paper from mounier et al 2020 we show that this framework was useful for the study of juvenile growth and contamination sensitivity to warming nursery quality and prey contamination in highly fluctuating estuarine environments finally in a long term perspective this modelling framework allows to include contaminant transfer to the next generations and adverse effects from internal concentration e g deb tox on demographic characters i e growth reproduction survival of the different life stages ultimately predicted consequences of warming diet modifications and contamination on these individual characters will allow studying their consequences on population dynamics alunno bruscia et al 2009 horri et al 2018 declaration of competing interests the authors

24772,the occurrence of wolf populations in human dominated landscapes is challenging worldwide because of conflicts with human activities modeling is an important tool to project wolf dynamics and expansion and help in decision making concerning management and conservation however some individual behaviors and pack dynamics of the wolf life cycle are still unclear to ecologists here we present an individual based model ibm to project wolf populations while exploring the lesser known processes of the wolf life cycle ibms are bottom up models that simulate the fate of individuals interacting with each other with population level properties emerging from the individual level simulations ibms are particularly adapted to represent social species such as the wolf that exhibits complex individual interactions our ibm projects wolf demography including fine scale individual behavior and pack dynamics based on up to date scientific literature we explore four processes of the wolf life cycle whose consequences on population dynamics are still poorly understood the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption of young dispersers by packs the establishment of new packs through budding and the different breeder replacement strategies while running different versions of the ibm to explore these processes we also illustrate the modularity and flexibility of our model an asset to model wolf populations experiencing different ecological and demographic conditions the different parameterization of pack dissolution territory establishment by budding and breeder replacement processes influence the projections of wolf populations as such these processes require further field investigation to be better understood the adoption process has a lesser impact on model projections being coded in r to facilitate its understanding we expect that our model will be used and further adapted by ecologists for their own specific applications keywords gray wolf individual based model pack dynamics population projection r language abbreviations ibms individual based models id identity fig figure odd overview design concepts and details popdensstd wolf density per 1000 km2 standardized with mean and standard deviation from cubaynes et al 2014 sd standard deviation 1 introduction the gray wolf canis lupus has been extirpated from most of the globe during the last century due to its competition with humans for wild prey depredations on livestock and general persecution ripple et al 2014 most of the remaining populations were considered endangered in the early 20th century mech and boitani 2003 however numerous wolf populations are now under protection regimes and management actions favor species persistence or comeback chapron et al 2014 even though the presence of this large carnivore may play an important role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem and increase biodiversity its recolonization is challenging for example the impact wolves exert on human activities such as livestock farming kaczensky 1999 lute et al 2018 or the increasing threat of hybridization with dogs in human dominated landscapes pilot et al 2018 randi 2011 randi et al 2014 require informed and effective management of the populations hindrikson et al 2017 management interventions may involve control of wolf populations through legal killings bradley et al 2015 harper et al 2008 santiago avila et al 2018 or non lethal management options mcmanus et al 2015 treves et al 2016 such as sterilization of breeders donfrancesco et al 2019 haight and mech 1997 in order to inform and help managers in making the best decisions models are needed to forecast the impact of alternative management regimes on the population dynamics and viability of the species bull 2006 marescot et al 2013 not only can models help select the best management strategy among several but they can also define the most effective application of any particular strategy e g its intensity or frequency haight and mech 1997 however before projecting the impact of external factors on wolf populations a good understanding of the species life cycle as well as a reliable model simulating it is required different types of models have been used to project the dynamics of highly social species such as the gray wolf stage structured models including age breeding or dispersing specific individual categories have been developed to project population growth rate and hence are relevant to make projections at the population level haight and mech 1997 marescot et al 2012 individual based models ibms have also been used to model population dynamics and have proven to be more flexible to represent species with complex social structure like wolves or coyotes chapron et al 2016 marucco and mcintire 2010 pitt et al 2003 ibms are bottom up models that simulate the fate of individuals interacting with each other and or their environment ibms can include many individual level mechanisms i e behavioral rules and therefore can represent complex individual interactions as exhibited by these social species chapron et al 2016 haight et al 2002 marucco and mcintire 2010 pitt et al 2003 population level results emerge from the individual level simulations railsback and grimm 2012 ibms are modular models in that they are built as series of sub models sub models represent either processes of the species life cycle e g reproduction mortality or external factors that modify the population structure e g immigration management in this respect ibms can be very flexible as sub models can be independently parameterized reorganized or removed or new ones can be added this flexibility allows researchers to mimic the species life cycle very closely to test different versions of the model by modifying only some sub models as well as testing the impact of external processes such as different management actions on simulated populations bull et al 2009 hradsky et al 2019 researchers have used ibms to simulate the impact of wolf removal strategies on depredation and population viability haight et al 2002 to test the robustness of abundance indices chapron et al 2016 or to project the recolonization of the species and the associated risk of depredation marucco and mcintire 2010 the models were all based on the fundamental processes of mortality reproduction and dispersal they also enabled individuals to access to the breeder status by various means such as pack creation or the replacement of a missing breeder in a pack additionally haight et al 2002 and chapron et al 2016 included supplementary mortality processes mimicking different wolf removal strategies however other individual behaviors and social dynamics not included in these ibms are known to occur in the wild for example brainerd et al 2008 found that the loss of breeders in a pack might disrupt its stability depending on the pack size and number of remaining breeders and may induce a pack dissolution specifically small packs with only one breeder left had a high probability of breaking apart and even higher when no breeder remained brainerd et al 2008 in addition several studies observed that when breeders died in packs vacant male breeding positions were primarily filled by unrelated individuals whereas vacant female breeding positions were mostly filled by subordinate females of the same packs which were most likely the daughters of the former breeding females caniglia et al 2014 jedrzejewski et al 2005 vonholdt et al 2008 these processes surely play a role in inbreeding avoidance another social process affecting wolf population dynamics is the adoption of unrelated individuals within packs young lone wolves not holding a territory sometimes join and are adopted as subordinates by packs mech and boitani 2003 most adoptees are males of 1 to 3 years old meier et al 1995 messier 1985 adoptees seem to represent a non negligible part of the populations roughly estimated between 10 and 20 mech and boitani 2003 however adoptees are generally not identified in wolf populations as it necessitates genetic sampling and relatedness analyses the reasons behind this behaviour are still poorly known mech and boitani 2003 finally less common strategies of formation of new reproductive pairs through budding or splitting may influence the wolf establishment and reproduction dynamics budding is when a dispersing wolf pairs with a mature subordinate from an existing pack and they establish a new pack of their own brainerd et al 2008 mech and boitani 2003 pack splitting has been reported for large packs mainly in north american wolf populations hayes and harestad 2000 jedrzejewski et al 2004 meier et al 1995 vonholdt et al 2008 a sub group of individuals permanently splits off from their original pack to form a new one nearby often due to the presence of two breeding pairs in the pack jedrzejewski et al 2004 mech and boitani 2003 it differs from budding in that no dispersing individual is involved in the process studies on wolf genetics inbreeding caniglia et al 2014 vonholdt et al 2008 hybridization fredrickson and hedrick 2006 or assessment of management alternatives haight et al 2002 haight and mech 1997 that fail to account for important processes of wolf social dynamics may provide limited or erroneous conclusions leading to potential inappropriate management decisions unfortunately the processes mentioned above are not often reported from field studies they are rarely quantified and their details are poorly documented here we present an ibm that we developed to simulate the wolf life cycle while exploring four lesser known processes of its social dynamics specifically the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption by existing packs of young dispersers the establishment of new packs through budding and the different types of breeder replacement our model explicitly includes interactions between individual wolves accounting for changes in wolf status i e breeder vs subordinate resident vs disperser dispersal and establishment processes while taking into account density dependence and individuals relatedness while we use literature to parametrize well known individual behaviors and pack dynamics we model multiple scenarios based on different parameters similar to a sensitivity analysis to explore the lesser known processes the variability among model projections reveals processes that most affected wolf population dynamics therefore indicating life cycle traits that require further investigation to enhance reliability of population projections we develop our model using the r language to facilitate its clarity accessibility and uptake by ecologists given the flexibility and modularity of the model structure our ibm can be easily parameterized according to different values updated with improved knowledge on wolf dynamics or modified to be adapted to other specific research or management questions on wolves 2 methods 2 1 wolf ibm 2 1 1 background information we calibrate the model for central european wolf populations i e alps apennines these populations are recolonizing the territory locally generating conflicts with human activities chapron et al 2014 they have also been well monitored and we have good estimates for their demographic parameters marucco et al 2009 caniglia et al 2014 a pack is usually composed of one breeding pair potentially augmented by several non breeding subordinates mortality causes e g starvation disease vehicle collisions culling poaching intraspecific strife differ among individuals inducing different mortality rates usually depending on their age marucco and mcintire 2010 or their residence status blanco and cortés 2007 moreover higher population densities cause competition for food space and mates and may also induce a higher adult mortality due to intraspecific aggressions cubaynes et al 2014 following the death of one or both breeders a pack can persist and breeders can be replaced wolves routinely disperse in response to competition and aggression related to food availability and breeding opportunity within their pack mech and boitani 2003 non breeding wolves are forced to leave the pack because of social drivers regulating group size within the territory ballard et al 1987 fritts and mech 1981 fuller 1989 gese and mech 1991 mech 1987 in areas of high prey availability dispersal is postponed ballard et al 1987 blanco and cortés 2007 jimenez et al 2017 and is rather triggered by the onset of sexual maturity of young wolves gese and mech 1991 messier 1985 packard and mech 1980 so that most wolves have dispersed from their natal pack by the age of 3 gese and mech 1991 jimenez et al 2017 given wolves dispersal abilities individuals may move from one population to another through long distance dispersal blanco and cortés 2007 ciucci et al 2009 in immigration and emigration processes one of the main processes for dispersing wolves to reproduce is to form a new pack with a dispersing mate of the opposite sex mech and boitani 2003 dispersing individuals can also establish a new territory by themselves waiting for a mate to later join them wabakken et al 2001 2 1 2 main model structure the model simulates the life cycle of the gray wolf using an individual based structure including fine scale individual processes and pack dynamics through a non spatially explicit approach the complete description of the ibm following the overview design concepts and details protocol odd protocol grimm et al 2010 2006 is provided in appendix a simulated individuals represent wolves that are organized in packs each wolf holds a unique id a sex male or female an age if it is a resident i e member of a pack or a disperser if it attained breeder status or not and a pack id to which it belongs if resident the model also tracks each wolf s genealogy and each individual has a mother id and father id and a cohort id i e the year it was born wolves are individually aged as pups 1 year old yearlings 2 years old or adults 3 years old we assume all wolves reach sexual maturity at 2 years old we consider a pack when one or several individuals establish and become residents in our model dispersers or dispersing individuals include all non resident individuals comprising those that are actually dispersing i e that left their natal pack and are dispersing through the landscape searching for an opportunity to establish a new territory and mate as well as floaters i e nomadic individuals without a territory and available either to replace missing breeders within packs or to establish a new pack mancinelli et al 2018 we also consider in our model that a solitary resident wolf holding a territory alone constitutes a pack although our ibm is not spatially explicit we indirectly consider the relative spatial arrangement of wolves through their pack affiliation and the equilibrium density parameter table 1 the time step of the model is one year as the wolf life cycle is organized around reproduction that happens once a year at each time step all simulated individuals go through the same series of different sub models representing different processes of the wolf life cycle and each individual behaves differently according to its own characteristics the first sub models are in order reproduction aging and mortality they are followed by several sub models related to changes in breeder subordinate and resident disperser status fig 1 most of the sub models included in our ibm represent well studied and well quantified processes table 1 however four processes of the wolf dynamics that we include are lesser known the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption of young dispersing individuals by packs the establishment of new packs using the budding strategy and the different types of breeder replacement fig 1 if the timing of pack dissolution adoption and establishment by budding is fairly well understood the intensity at which these processes occur in wolf populations has rarely been estimated on the contrary the timing of the different breeder replacement strategies is not well understood and still debated we explore different parameter values for the sub models pack dissolution adoption and new pack establishment by budding table 2 modifying the importance of the process in the wolf dynamics and different timing i e orders for the sub models concerning the breeder replacements fig 1 changing the relative order for the breeder replacement strategies induces a change in their relative importance as fewer packs are impacted by the final strategies as fewer packs are still missing a breeder 2 1 3 initial population a wolf initial population is needed to launch the ibm simulations the user specifies the composition of its initial population and its attributes namely the equilibrium density and immigration and emigration rates to best represent the population he she wants to model here is a simple example of the population we use in the following analyses we build a fictive initial population of 10 packs and 5 dispersers in an environment that can hold 30 packs in total i e equilibrium density table 1 specifically the population comprises 5 packs of 2 breeders 5 years old each with 2 pups one male and one female 3 packs of 2 breeders 5 years old each with 1 yearling male and 1 pup female 2 packs of 2 breeders 5 years old each with 1 adult female 3 years old and 5 dispersers 3 females 2 males 2 years old each we estimate the size of the area where the population is simulated as the number of packs at equilibrium density multiplied by the average territory size for wolf populations in the apennines 104 km2 mancinelli et al 2018 this area is used to calculate wolf density in density dependent processes we allow connections of the simulated population with other non simulated wolf populations via an immigration of 0 1 or 2 external wolves per year inside the simulated population and an emigration of 10 of the dispersing wolves from the simulated population outside of the study area the parameters equilibrium density number of immigrants arriving per year and proportion of dispersing wolves emigrating are randomly chosen a modification of their values surely will change the projections of the population but the impact of these parameters on wolf populations are well understood and are therefore not explored further in this study 2 1 4 well known processes of the wolf life cycle we define as well known processes wolf dynamics that are well documented and well understood these processes are usually included in wolf ibms chapron et al 2016 haight et al 2002 marucco and mcintire 2010 when coding the sub models to reproduce these processes we have reliable estimates to parameterize and time them in our model 2 1 4 1 reproduction we simulate that all packs with a breeding pair reproduce each year marucco and mcintire 2010 we define the number of pups breeding pairs produce by sampling values in a poisson distribution table 1 chapron et al 2016 the sex of each pup is randomly defined as male or female with a 1 1 ratio marucco and mcintire 2010 sidorovich et al 2007 newborn pups are of age 0 pups are residents with the pack id of their parents bear their mother and father ids and are assigned a cohort id equal to the year of the simulation during which they are born 2 1 4 2 aging all individuals age one additional year in this sub model pups of the year are now 1 year old yearlings are 2 years old and individuals of 3 years old enter the adult age class 2 1 4 3 mortality we simulate seven different mortality rates table 1 according to various combination of age and residence status of the individuals and total number of packs related to the number at equilibrium density mortality is applied individually using a bernoulli distribution at each time step the mortality probability is sampled from a normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation parameters table 1 associated to the different categories of individuals 2 1 4 3 1 mortality for non dispersing individuals we apply a different probability of mortality for non dispersing individuals regarding their age category i e pups yearlings or adults table 1 to mimic density dependence in adult mortality cubaynes et al 2014 we apply two mortality rates for this age category depending on the number of packs established in the population during any given year of the simulation if the number of packs is below the equilibrium density mortality is fixed table 1 if the number of packs reaches equilibrium density we linked wolf mortality with wolf density following cubaynes et al 2014 2 1 4 3 2 mortality for dispersing individuals dispersing yearlings in this sub model are individuals whose pack dissolved in the previous year when they were pups and that were not adopted by any pack during that year their likelihood of survival alone is low without food or care from adults or yearlings brainerd et al 2008 mech and boitani 2003 so we set their mortality probability to 1 otherwise we set the same fixed mortality to all dispersing adults table 1 2 1 4 3 3 mortality for old individuals we do not model senescence or any increase in mortality rate with age however to represent a realistic age distribution in the population we allow wolves to live up to their 15th year of age marucco and mcintire 2010 and all individuals of this age die entering the successive year of simulation 2 1 4 4 dispersal for each pack and at each time step we simulate the maximum number of individuals packs can support using a normal distribution table 1 if a pack exceeds its simulated threshold a certain number of individuals disperse until the number of wolves in the pack levels off at the threshold while breeding individuals do not disperse all other wolves can among these the choice of dispersing individuals is based on relative probabilities related to their age category table 1 2 1 4 5 immigration emigration according to the immigration portion of the sub model at each time step a determined number of immigrants enters the population table 1 immigrants are simulated as dispersers generated from another wolf population their sex is randomly assigned i e male or female with a 1 1 ratio and their age is simulated using a truncated poisson distribution bounded between 1 and 15 with mean equal to 2 as dispersers are most commonly yearlings mech and boitani 2003 immigrants do not belong to any pack of the simulated populations yet and consequently are not breeders as they were born outside the simulated population they do not hold information about their mother id and father id i e they are unrelated to any other individuals however once immigrating they behave the same way i e follow the same sub model rules as the native wolves for the emigration portion of the sub model a proportion of the current dispersing individuals table 1 randomly chosen leaves the simulated population these individuals do not come back and their disappearance is similar to simulating their death 2 1 4 6 pack establishment by breeding pairs we define that reproductively mature male and female dispersers that are not closely related can pair bond establish together as breeders and form a new pack the relatedness threshold chosen is that of the first cousins table 1 in wolves breeding pairs are rarely more related than cousins except when they have no other option i e mating between siblings or parents and pups are generally avoided caniglia et al 2014 this relatedness threshold is the same for all sub models establishment by breeding pairs is possible only if the number of existing packs has not yet reached equilibrium density the density dependent probability for dispersers to pair bond is defined by a bernoulli distribution with probability equal to the number of packs that can be established until reaching equilibrium density divided by equilibrium density i e the more packs there are the less chance for dispersers to pair bond and establish new packs once a pair bond is established both wolves become breeders and residents sharing the same new and unique pack id 2 1 4 7 pack establishment by single wolves if the area is not at equilibrium density our model allows mature dispersers that did not pair bond to establish a territory by themselves similar to establishing in pair the probability to establish a territory alone is density dependent single wolves holding the new territory become breeders even if no reproduction is possible yet and residents of a new pack i e they are assigned a new and unique pack id then at the next time step a mature disperser of opposite sex will be able to take the vacant breeding position and finally reproduce 2 1 5 lesser known processes of the wolf life cycle we define as lesser known processes wolf dynamics that are known to occur in the wild but that are not extensively documented these processes have not been included in previous ibms for wolves chapron et al 2016 haight et al 2002 marucco and mcintire 2010 when coding the sub models to reproduce these processes we do not have reliable estimates to parameterize or streamline them inside the life cycle available from the literature 2 1 5 1 pack dissolution we simulate that small packs whose social structure is impacted by the loss of one or both breeders may dissolve with different probabilities regarding how many breeders remain table 1 in the specific case where both breeders die and only pups remain in a pack we consider that the pack always dissolves as pups are unlikely to maintain a territory by themselves if these pups are not adopted during the current year they die in the mortality sub model during the next time step when a pack dissolves all former members of the pack become dispersers and do not belong to a pack anymore former breeding individuals also lose their breeder status brainerd et al 2008 differentiate small packs in which dissolution can occur following the loss of one or two breeders from large packs in which dissolution never occurs they do not define a threshold between small and large packs but estimate that small packs have on average 2 36 individuals and large packs 5 75 we explore the importance of the pack dissolution process on the wolf population dynamics by varying this pack size threshold differentiating small packs from large ones table 2 a small threshold induces that only very small packs can dissolve therefore minimizing the influence of pack dissolution on wolf dynamics a large threshold allow more packs to be concerned hence maximizing the influence of pack dissolution on wolf dynamics 2 1 5 2 adoption we define in our model that packs whose size is below their maximum threshold estimated in the dispersal sub model can adopt as many individuals between 1 and 3 years old inclusive as allowed by their maximum pack size among potential adoptees dispersing males are selected first if there are no more males available to adopt and packs are still small enough then females are chosen next as adoptees once adopted individuals become non breeding i e subordinate residents and acquire their pack id adoption has been observed mech and boitani 2003 but the rate at which this process occurs is unknown to explore how relevant this process is to affect wolf population dynamics we defined different probability values for a pack to adopt table 2 2 1 5 3 pack establishment by budding similar to the other strategies of establishment budding is possible only if the number of packs in the population has not reached the equilibrium density we define a density dependent probability for a disperser to bud similar to the one of pack establishment through pair bonding only mature dispersers can bud and only with a non breeding mature resident of the opposite sex that is not closely related table 1 once budding occurs both wolves that pair become breeders and residents and obtain the same new and unique pack id there are no detailed studies indicating how common budding is compared to alternative ways of pack establishment we explore the influence this process might have on wolf population dynamics by testing different probabilities of budding table 2 that we multiply to the density dependence probability of pack establishment 2 1 5 4 replacement of missing breeders 2 1 5 4 1 replacement of breeding females by subordinates we select the subordinates to replace the missing breeding females by randomly choosing one of the subordinate mature females in the concerned packs to mimic inbreeding avoidance in wolf packs we then look at the relatedness between the chosen females and the current breeding males if there is any in case a breeding male is closely related to the female table 1 he may be replaced by a less related subordinate or a disperser in sub models 2 1 5 4 2 replacement of breeding males by subordinates or 2 1 5 4 3 replacement of breeders by dispersers we explore how the alternative sequence of the breeder replacement sub models i e breeders replaced by subordinates followed by breeders replaced by dispersers or vice versa independently for each sex fig 1 affect projections of wolf population dynamics 2 1 5 4 2 replacement of breeding males by subordinates if there are several mature male subordinates in the pack where the male breeding position is vacant the least related to the current breeding female if there is any is chosen to become breeder if there are several unrelated subordinate males or if there is no breeding female one is selected randomly in the case where the breeding female is related to the newly chosen breeding male but there is a mature female subordinate less related the latter usurp the breeding female and the former breeding female is dismissed i e becomes subordinate if there are several unrelated mature female subordinates one is selected randomly we add that in the particular case where a pack was not missing a breeding male but the breeding female obtained her breeding status during the time step in 2 1 5 4 1 replacement of breeding females by subordinates and she was too related to the current breeding male one of the less related male subordinates can take over the male breeding position in this sub model all of these rules mimic inbreeding avoidance in wolves except when there is no other choice to reproduce mech and boitani 2003 once new breeding individuals are chosen they will be able to mate the next year 2 1 5 4 3 replacement of breeders by dispersers here we simulate the replacement of all missing breeders both females and males by mature dispersers first missing breeding females are replaced by mature dispersing females unrelated to the current breeding males in the packs if there is any then missing breeding males are replaced similarly selected dispersers thus become breeders of packs resident and acquire the id of the pack they joined 2 2 model scenarios tested we explore the impact of the four lesser known processes on wolf population projections by varying and combining their different parameters values table 2 or timing fig 1 resulting in 81 model scenarios appendix b we run 200 replicates of each scenario for a 25 year simulation period starting with the same initial population and same parameters for the well known processes table 1 2 2 1 model outputs for each simulation the complete population with the individual s characteristics is available for each simulated year the change in pack numbers is also recorded after each event potentially modifying their number individual mortality i e if all members of a pack die pack dissolution and the three types of new pack establishments we derive from the model outputs six metrics that we consider crucial to evaluate wolf conservation and management specifically we calculate for each simulated year and for each replicate of each model scenario the number of packs with a breeding pair then we extract 1 at which year populations reach equilibrium density this output represents the speed of the population expansion and is a key element in areas that are being recolonized by the wolf all the other metrics are defined using model outputs extracted after the last year of simulation once all populations are at equilibrium density we calculate for each replicate of each model scenario 2 the number of packs with a breeding pair as this corresponds to the reproductive potential of the population and is of importance for management issues related to population growth 3 the number of packs newly established during the final year this represents the pack turnover and the stability of the population that may affect mortality compensation species expansion or wolf human conflicts e g new packs may be more or less prone to attack livestock compared to old established packs which know the associated risks and benefits 4 the abundance of the population i e total number of individuals and 5 the proportion of residents and dispersers in the population population size is often required in management and knowing the relative proportions of residents vs dispersers may help in understanding the demographic and social performance of the population and its potential to further expand its range finally we compute 6 the relatedness between the two breeders in each pack inbreeding avoidance plays a big part in the wolf life cycle affecting the replacement of the missing breeders and the creation of a new pack 2 3 sensitivity analysis we run a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the well known processes table 1 to identify if some may influence the conclusions on the lesser known processes we use the model version m1 as a plausible model version and the parameter values 4 1 0 5 and 0 5 i e all intermediate values for the parameters of the sub models pack dissolution adoption and establishment by budding respectively we run this model modifying the parameters of the well known processes table 1 one parameter at a time by either increasing or decreasing its value by 5 ovenden et al 2019 we run 200 replicates of the model over 25 years to test each parameter the model is considered sensitive to a parameter if a model output i e mean value over the 200 replicates with a modified parameter varies more than 20 from the original results kramer schadt et al 2005 ovenden et al 2019 we examine the six model outputs described above in the 2 2 1 model outputs section we do not test the sensitivity of the model to standard deviation parameters standard deviation of mortality and of pack size table 1 regarding the density dependent mortality function we only test the sensitivity of the slope parameter and do not test the sensitivity to the intercept and to the parameters standardizing the population density table 1 2 4 model implementation the ibm is coded in r 3 5 2 r core team 2014 we use the r package netlogor bauduin et al 2019 to facilitate the implementation of the individual based model structure in r language and the package pedantics morrissey 2018 to calculate relatedness between individuals using their mother and father ids we use the packages sciviews grosjean 2018 for the logarithms functions and testthat wickham et al 2019 to implement tests in our model and verify the outcomes of the sub models the r files to run the model are available in the github repository https github com sarahbauduin appendix wolfibm under the gnu general public license v3 0 3 results 3 1 general results for the wolf ibm figures showing all model outputs for the 81 model scenarios are presented in appendix c all scenarios project a growth of the wolf population starting from 10 packs and 43 wolves after 25 years of simulation populations reach a mean of 29 4 packs sd 1 0 with a breeding pair for an overall mean population size of 186 2 wolves sd 12 4 in all model scenarios populations stabilize and reach equilibrium density after about 10 years of simulation mean 9 8 years sd 2 8 3 2 effect of lesser known social processes on wolf dynamics we only present model outputs that show an impact from the parameterization or timing of the explored sub models values reported are means and standard deviations calculated from all replicate simulations from each set of 27 model scenarios with the same parameter value or model version for the explored sub model i e 3 parameters or model versions 27 model scenarios 81 total 3 2 1 pack dissolution the different parameter values for the pack dissolution threshold influence the number of packs with a breeding pair and the total number of individuals in the population after the last year of simulation as well as the number of new packs formed during the last year of simulation model scenarios where only small packs i e with 3 individuals or less may dissolve after breeders loss project wolf populations with on average 29 6 packs with a breeding pair sd 0 8 scenarios where larger packs may dissolve i e packs up to 4 and up to 5 individuals project on average 29 4 packs sd 1 0 and 29 2 packs sd 1 1 respectively fig 2 a the most impacted model output by this sub model parameterization is the number of new packs formed during the last year of simulation more new packs are formed as larger packs are allowed to dissolve with the threshold values 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 the mean number of new packs created are equal to 1 3 sd 1 1 2 2 sd 1 5 and 3 2 sd 1 7 respectively fig 2 b regarding the number of individuals in the populations the averages are equal to 189 4 sd 11 9 186 3 sd 12 1 and 182 8 sd 12 3 respectively fig 2 c 3 2 2 adoption the different parameters for the adoption sub model seem to only mildly influence the proportion of resident individuals in the populations with an adoption probability set to 0 1 model scenarios project on average 68 1 of the population being resident sd 5 9 with an adoption probability equal to 0 5 the result is of 69 7 sd 5 4 and with an adoption probability equal to 0 9 the result if of 71 2 sd 5 8 fig 3 the impact of varying the adoption probability from 0 1 i e almost no adoption occurring to 0 9 i e adoption happening very often when possible is very low on this model output and non existent on the other ones appendix c 3 2 3 pack establishment by budding the model outputs the most impacted by the different parameter values for the probability of establishment by budding are the time at which populations reach equilibrium density and the number of packs with a breeding pair at the end of the simulation the lowest probability of budding i e equal to 0 1 project wolf populations reaching the equilibrium density the latest on average after 11 8 years of simulation sd 3 0 fig 4 with the budding probability equal to 0 5 populations reached that point on average after 9 6 years sd 2 2 fig 4 with the highest probability of budding i e equal to 0 9 populations reach the equilibrium density the fastest on average after 8 2 years of simulation sd 1 7 fig 4 the observed differences in numbers of packs after the last year of simulation follow the same patterns the highest budding probability produced the highest mean values model scenarios with a budding probability equal to 0 1 project wolf populations with on average 29 0 packs sd 1 2 with a probability of 0 5 there are on average 29 4 packs sd 1 0 and with the budding probability equal to 0 9 there are on average 29 7 packs sd 0 6 3 2 4 replacement of missing breeders the model versions testing the different timing of sub models concerning breeder replacement influence mildly the proportion of resident individuals in the population after the last year of simulation but it greatly impacts the relatedness value between male and female in breeding pairs model versions m1 and m3 have similar results and they both differ compared to those obtained using m2 m1 fig 1 with the replacement of missing breeding females by subordinates first and the replacement of missing breeding males by dispersers first project populations with a mean proportion of resident equal to 70 3 sd 5 3 fig 5 a it is similar to m3 fig 1 where the replacement of missing breeders was done primarily by dispersers for both sexes projected populations have on average 71 2 of resident individuals sd 5 5 fig 5 a in m2 fig 1 where the replacement of missing breeders was done primarily by subordinates projected populations have on average 67 5 of resident individuals sd 5 1 fig 5 a the influence of the different model versions is greater on the relatedness between breeders for m1 the mean relatedness is equal to 0 06 sd 0 03 similarly as for m3 mean 0 06 sd 0 04 for m2 it is equal to 0 26 sd 0 31 fig 5 b m1 and m3 favor the replacement of at least one missing breeder by a disperser and keep relatedness between breeders very low in m2 missing breeders are primarily replaced by subordinates and mating between related individuals frequently occur 3 3 sensitivity analysis as expected the parameter affecting the most model outputs apart from the ones tested for the lesser known processes is the equilibrium density the number of new packs created is sensitive to this parameter all the other model outputs are slightly sensitive to the equilibrium density parameter but not in the range of 20 20 pup mortality is the second parameter affecting the most model outputs but none vary more than the range of 20 20 overall the six model outputs we look at are not sensitive to the parameters of the well known processes table 1 the complete table with the value tested for the parameters and the results for the model outputs is available in appendix d 4 discussion we developed an ibm to represent wolf demography and pack dynamics while exploring lesser known processes of the species social dynamics we explored different parameterization and timing for the processes of pack dissolution adoption establishment by budding and replacement of missing breeders although the effects on the model outputs were relatively small the projections from the different model scenarios pointed out the importance of the pack dissolution establishment by budding and replacement of missing breeders processes in wolf population projections further research is needed to better understand these processes and the mechanisms behind to be able to correctly incorporate them in the ibm with reliable parameter values and timing among the different sub models among these three processes the different orders of the breeder replacement strategies produced the largest effect on the breeder relatedness this process should be the first focus of attention for more investigation the fourth studied process i e adoption did not modify much the model outputs possibly indicating a lesser influence of this process on wolf dynamics our model also innovatively accounted for relatedness between individuals and density dependence adding a genetic component to our model is especially important to investigate hybridization and inbreeding depression that can be of great concern for wolf management and conservation bohling and waits 2015 our analyses also highlighted the modularity and flexibility of our ibm that can be adapted and used by ecologists to explore various questions and test different hypotheses on wolf ecology management and conservation to explore the process of pack dissolution we tested different values for the pack dissolution threshold to allow more or less packs to dissolve given different importance to this process in the wolf dynamics diminishing the importance of pack dissolution produced populations often being at equilibrium density with few new packs created mimicking a very stable population the other way a pack can disappear except than by dissolution is by the death of all its members at once which rarely happened in the simulations on the contrary allowing more packs to dissolve reduced the number of packs freed space and partners to create new packs and therefore favored the pack turnover still the creation of new packs did not seem to reach the same intensity as the one of pack loss as the final number of packs and individuals were slightly lower when pack dissolution was important however pack dissolution influenced more the composition of the packs at the individual level i e pack turnover impacted than the projections at the population level e g total number of packs and individuals this is in agreement with a study by borg et al 2015 showing that with or without pack breaking down following breeder losses the overall dynamics of the population was quite similar e g number of packs highlighting a compensation mechanism on the other hand population stability is a key element in social species where individual personalities and group compositions matter such as regarding hybridization bohling and waits 2015 and depredation allen 2014 as well as their associated management actions this process requires more field investigations to better understand the conditions leading to pack dissolution its understanding and inclusion in model would be rather relevant when individual identity is important e g hybridization budding is a strategy to establish and create new packs with a low probability to bud less packs are created and as expected simulations with the smallest probability of budding projected populations which were the slowest to reach equilibrium density inversely maximizing the importance of budding projected populations reaching equilibrium density the fastest at the end of the simulation when the populations were at equilibrium density the same pattern occurred with the more the budding strategy was used the more packs were present in the populations however the different budding probability only slightly influenced the number of packs when the population was at equilibrium density a better understanding of this process seems relevant to understand its relative importance regarding the other strategies of establishment to produce reliable projections especially during the growing phase of the population therefore this strategy of establishment is important to be understood and considered when the studied populations are in their colonizing phase having the replacement of the missing breeding female by a subordinate first m1 has been documented in some study sites caniglia et al 2014 jedrzejewski et al 2005 vonholdt et al 2008 but the regularity of this behavior is debated the modified model version where the replacement of the missing female breeder was done by a disperser before m3 produced very similar model outputs however the model version where both missing breeders were replaced by subordinates first m2 produced very different projections for the relatedness between breeders and to a lesser extent on the proportion of resident individuals in the population if we consider a breeding pair related when their relatedness coefficient is larger than 0 125 caniglia et al 2014 only 0 8 of the breeding pairs were related in populations projected with model versions m1 and m3 in contrast 38 1 of the breeding pairs were related in populations projected by m2 vonholdt et al 2008 evaluated that 7 of the breeding pairs in the yellowstone grey wolf population were related the difference in our projections and the value found by vonholdt et al can be due to spatiality in our model versions m1 and m3 all dispersers are available to replace missing breeders hence reducing the risk of inbreeding in the wild dispersers can be too far away and therefore not available to the packs missing breeders hence inducing a replacement of the missing breeders by subordinates and inbreeding understanding the functioning of the different types of breeder replacement and their timing is crucial seeing their impact on model projections studies on wolf genetics e g inbreeding hybridization could conclude completely differently if using one or another model version potentially inducing detrimental management recommendations for small isolated populations if projections were not reliable the modular and flexible construction of our ibm model can allow future users to organize the replacement of the missing breeders in the order best representing their population of interest or the latest findings in literature reducing the relative importance of the adoption process projected a higher proportion of dispersers as young wolves cannot be adopted by packs and therefore they remained floaters in the population i e considered as dispersers in the model the projected populations had more resident individuals when the adoption process was more important this process seems the one influencing the least our model outputs however we selected general model outputs to best represent the conservation state of the wolf populations and this process may influence other elements of the wolf population that we missed e g sex ratio of subordinates in packs projecting population with a reliable number of resident and dispersing individuals can be of high importance when modeling demographic processes where dispersers and floaters have a main role such as the colonization of new areas e g boyd et al 1999 pletscher et al 1997 one of the limitations of our ibm approach is that it is non spatial this greatly simplifies the use and the adaptation of the model to other populations as no animal environment interactions are modeled and therefore no data regarding these interactions which are sometimes hard to acquire are needed parameters like equilibrium density territory size number of migrants and proportion of emigration that need to be defined by the user give one way to account for spatial constraints given by a particular environment and these parameters can be changed to best represent the study area of interest that said we acknowledge that an explicit spatial mechanism would be very interesting to implement as wolf pack occupancy is mainly driven by exclusive territoriality cassidy et al 2016 but the population division and affiliation into packs approximated spatiality in our model to add more spatial constraints without changing the model structure a new individual characteristic could be defined to represent distances between individuals based on their pack affiliation individuals from the same pack would be closer to each other than to other individuals allowing a researcher to define short distance dispersers vs long distance dispersers louvrier et al 2018 separate from the immigration emigration process of our model with a bit more work the model could be turned into a spatially explicit ibm by including an explicit dispersal sub model like that in marucco and mcintire 2010 in place of the current dispersal sub model model outputs were sensitive to only a few parameters apart from those linked to the explored processes equilibrium density naturally affected the model projections as this parameter represents as stated above one of the main spatial constraints influencing the simulated populations this parameter triggered density dependent events that occurred only when the landscape was fully occupied having more variability to trigger these events could likely reduce the influence of the equilibrium density parameter on model outputs and reduce the subjectivity of this trigger building this ibm we aimed to include all biological processes documented in the literature to best represent the wolf life cycle overall we hope that our reproducible implementation of a modular and flexible ibm will contribute to the understanding management and conservation of wolf populations by providing a scenario testing and decision making tool for ecologists and stakeholders as well as a base model that can be adapted to simulate other canids and social species the r language we used to code our ibm is largely used by ecologists and this should likely ease the model understanding and adaptation for example without much modification our model could easily reproduce the life cycle of north american wolf populations with a few changes to the parameter values and the addition of a sub model representing pack splitting jedrzejewski et al 2004 mech and boitani 2003 users could also test hypotheses regarding assortative and disassortative mate choice for particular traits relevant in hybridization studies fredrickson and hedrick 2006 management actions e g culling sterilization can as well be included in the model to test their effectiveness haight and mech 1997 the modular structure of our ibm allows the addition removal or modification of only specific components of the model while keeping the other sub models and the main structure the same this model could be useful to other ecologists who could adapt it for their own specific research and management applications credit author statement sarah bauduin conceptualization

benson nolwenn drouet hoguet and three anonymous reviewers for their comments on the manuscript appendix a complete description of the wolf individual based model ibm following the overview design concepts and details protocol odd protocol developed by grimm et al 2006 2010 overview purpose the wolf ibm aims to represent all non spatial dynamics that happen in a wolf population with a focus to detail pack dynamics the change of status between disperser and residents and the replacement of breeding individuals the model also explores lesser known processes of the wolf dynamics namely the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption of young dispersing individuals by packs the establishment of new packs using the budding strategy and the breeder replacement these processes are known to happen in wolf populations but were rarely included in models marucco and mcintire 2010 chapron et al 2016 pitt et al 2003 due to the difficulty to parameterize or time them as little details are known on these processes other processes better understood but also often over looked in models were also included avoidance of inbreeding in packs where mating between wolves more related than two cousins is prevented as much as possible density dependent mortality for resident adults when the population is at equilibrium density and movement of wolves in and out of the simulated population with possible immigrations and emigrations entities state variables and scales entities in the model are wolf individuals each wolf has a unique id a sex male or female an age a residence status i e resident belonging to a pack or disperser a pack id if it belongs to a pack a breeding status i e breeding individual or not a mother id a father id and a cohort id i e the year individuals are born in id sex mother id father id and cohort id never change during simulations age is updated each year residence status and pack id change when an individual leaves or joins a pack breeding status changes when an individual becomes a breeder either by replacing a missing one or by forming its own pack or when an individual loses its breeder status after being replaced or after its pack broke apart packs are not considered entities in the model as most of the processes do not act on the whole pack at once except pack dissolution packs are just a characteristic via their id of the wolves the model is non spatial so the environment is not represented and wolves do not have a location temporal scale is a one year time step process overview and scheduling in one year all individuals go through the same series of sub models fig a1 and their state is modified according to the behavioral rules of each sub model and their own characteristics in order these sub models are reproduction aging mortality and change of resident disperser and breeder non breeder status fig a1 the change of the wolves residence and breeding status is represented with several sub models that are pack dissolution replacement of breeding females by subordinates dispersal immigration emigration adoption replacement of breeders by dispersers establishment in pairs establishment by budding establishment alone and replacement of breeding males by subordinates fig a1 the order of the sub models simulating breeder replacement is debated and therefore is explored through different model versions m1 m2 and m3 fig a1 for simplicity the order used to present the model in the odd is the one of m1 fig a1 but we do not state that this model version is more reliable than the other ones in reproduction new individuals pups are produced in aging the age of all individuals is updated in mortality different mortality probabilities affect different individuals based on their age their residence status and the number of existing packs relative to the equilibrium density in pack dissolution some packs dissolve based on the age composition in the pack their number of individuals and of breeders if some packs dissolve the residence status of the individuals is updated to dispersers and they lose their pack id in replacement of breeding females by subordinates female subordinates may replace the missing breeder in a pack and their breeding status is updated in dispersal packs with too many individuals force some individuals to leave the pack with different relative probabilities based on their age these individuals have their residence status updated to dispersers and they lose their pack id in immigration wolves from outside integrate into the population in emigration wolves from the simulated population leave the study area similar to death they are removed from the population in adoption young dispersing individuals may be adopted by small packs these adoptees have their residence status updated to resident and they obtain the pack id of their adopting pack in replacement of breeders by dispersers dispersing individuals may replace missing breeders in packs these individuals have their residence status updated to resident they obtain the pack id they integrate and their breeding status is updated in establishment in pairs two dispersing individuals of the opposite sex establish themselves together to form a new pack these individuals have their residence status updated to resident they obtain a new and unique pack id and their breeding status is updated in establishment by budding a dispersing individual and a subordinate from a pack establish a new pack the former disperser has it residence status updated to resident it obtains a new and unique pack id and its breeding status is updated the former subordinate obtains the same pack id as its new partner and has its breeding status updated in establishment alone dispersers can establish themselves and form a pack alone these individuals have their residence status updated to resident they obtain a new and unique pack id and their breeding status is updated in replacement of breeding males by subordinates male subordinates may replace the missing breeder in the pack so their breeding status is updated at the end of the sub model series the information about the current population i e the current characteristics of each individual is saved and individuals go through the same loop of sub models for as many years as simulated design concepts basic principles the life cycle of the wolf is represented through the reproduction mortality dispersal and establishment of the individuals already defined in published wolf ibms marucco and mcintire 2010 chapron et al 2016 however extensive research in the literature has been done to understand and then include in the ibm all processes known to happen in wolf dynamics additionally to the fundamental processes we included those related to the change of status between residents and dispersers the access to the breeding status the pairing between male and female breeders based on their relatedness and the residence and breeding status the movement of wolves in and out of the population and density dependent processes the model provides new details on the pack dynamics to mimic the gray wolf life cycle as best as possible the model is non spatial but the spatial distribution of individuals is represented through their pack affiliation the life cycle represented in the ibm as well as the parameter values used are more adapted to wolf populations in central europe i e alps than for large north american populations i e canada alaska usa emergence through reproduction and immigration new individuals are added in the population individuals die and are removed from the population through different mortality and emigration processes these changes in the population affect the total number of individuals processes affect wolves depending on their individual characteristics i e age sex residence status breeding status etc and affect the distribution of the individuals in different classes e g number of residents and dispersers number of packs with two breeders in it adaptation wolves live in packs and most of the processes coded in the model depend on the pack structure and the status of the individuals in the pack the presence of zero one of two breeders constrains the potential reproduction pack dissolution and replacement of breeding members the total number of individuals in a pack constrains the pack dissolution dispersal and adoption the total number of established packs in the population also constrains some of the processes like the different probabilities of establishment i e in pairs by budding and alone and one mortality process that have density dependent parameters objectives wolves do not have an ultimate goal they need to fulfill over time individuals follow the behavioral rules of the different sub models and respond to them according to their current characteristics and the current state of the packs learning there is no learning per se in the wolf ibm such as a learning of new skills e g hunting prey taught by parents but as individuals age and status change the possibilities for the individual change for example wolves of age 1 2 and 3 years old can be adopted but not at an older age only mature wolves of age 2 and older can become breeders and establish a new territory pups of 1 year old cannot only mature breeding wolves can reproduce mature subordinates cannot prediction individuals know the current state of the population and individuals current characteristics but they cannot predict any future population or individual state nor any individuals actions sensing wolves in packs have knowledge of all individual characteristics for the other members in their pack packs that can adopt young wolves can sense the presence of young dispersers dispersing individuals have access to the packs and their structure as replacement of missing breeders by dispersers and pairing with a subordinate from a pack is possible for these individuals there is no sensing of the environment as there is no interaction with it interaction wolves are social animals and therefore multiple interactions shape the life cycle of this species reproduction requires two breeding individuals from the same pack to produce pups pack dissolution and dispersal represent a loss of interactions between individuals that were members of a pack and become dispersers due to various factors in the replacement of missing breeders there is a choice among the mature subordinates of the pack or among mature dispersers that may be constrained by the presence of the other breeding wolf during establishment in pairs or by budding a disperser interacts with another disperser or a subordinate in a pack to create a new territory stochasticity stochasticity is included in almost all components of the model the number of pups produced per breeding pair the number of individual dying the maximum number of individual allowed in a pack the number of immigrants arriving in the population and the number of emigrants leaving are generated using probabilities the following processes also occur probabilistically pack dissolution based on the number of breeding members remaining in the pack adoption dispersal according to the individuals age and establishment by budding also a density dependent probability constrains the different types of establishment i e in pairs by budding and alone as well as adult mortality when the population is at equilibrium density the sex of the pups the choice between unrelated individuals to replace missing breeders the choice between young dispersers to be adopted the choice between unrelated individuals to partner with a disperser to establish and the choice of dispersing individuals that emigrate are done randomly in the immigration process as nothing is known about immigrating individuals their sex and age between a minimum and a maximum is randomly assigned collectives wolves belong to packs and their status of resident i e inside a pack or disperser i e not belonging to a pack affects almost all behavioral processes they follow however except for the pack dissolution there is no process affecting the entire pack as all individuals in the pack have different characteristics i e age sex breeding status they usually do not all respond in the same way observation the population is simulated for several years simulation outputs are available after each sub model if needed or at the end of the whole series of sub models at the end of the time step i e at the end of the simulated year the number of alive individuals with all their characteristics is available and many results can be extracted and derived from this population structure e g the number of packs the total abundance the number of residents and dispersers the number of breeders the age distribution etc we focused on outputs relevant for wolf conservation and management and defined six metrics 1 at which year the population reached equilibrium density i e in number of packs with a breeding pair this output represents the speed of the population expansion and is a key element in areas that are being recolonized by the wolf 2 the number of packs with two breeders this metric is linked to the reproductive potential of the population and is of importance for management issues related to population growth 3 the number of new packs formed in one year this represents the pack turnover and the stability of the population that may affect hybridization and wolf human conflicts 4 the total number of individuals 5 the proportion of residents and dispersers in the population population size is often required in management control and knowing the distribution of the resident dispersing status of the individuals may help in understanding the population behavior finally we looked at 6 the relatedness between the two breeders in each pack inbreeding avoidance plays a big part in the wolf life cycle affecting the replacement of missing breeders and the creation of new packs often over looked because it is hard to simulate in non individual based models this factor may indicate missing pieces in the models when not well represented details initialization to launch the ibm an initial wolf population is needed we built a fictive population of 10 packs and 5 dispersing wolves in a fictive environment that can hold 30 packs total i e equilibrium density table a1 we created 5 packs with 2 breeders one male and one female 5 years old each and 2 pups one male and one female 1 year old each 3 packs with 2 breeders one male and one female 5 years old each 1 yearling one male 2 years old and 1 pup one female 1 year old 2 packs with 2 breeders one male and one female 5 years old each and 1 adult one female 3 years old and 5 dispersers 3 females 2 males 2 years old each this simple population was created for convenience but other initial populations can be easily defined by users table a1 lists all parameters and their values used in the model these parameters can also be easily modified by the user however they represent the best data currently available in the literature for gray wolves in europe or elsewhere if not available for europe for lesser known processes which parameters are explored i e pack dissolution adoption establishment by budding all tested values are listed table a1 input data there is no input data in the model the environment is not represented and the initial population is not built using data sub models reproduction every pack with both a breeding male and a breeding female reproduce marucco and mcintire 2010 the number of pups each pair has is drawn from a poisson distribution chapron et al 2016 with a mean of 6 1 sidorovich et al 2007 representing the number of pups that emerge from the female den each pup receives a unique id the sex of each pup is randomly defined as male or female with a 1 1 ratio sidorovich et al 2007 marucco and mcintire 2010 their age is set to 0 as all individuals including these newborn pups will go through the aging sub model next pups are considered residents with the pack id of their parents they are not breeders their mother and father ids are recorded and they obtain a cohort id equal to the current simulated year i e all pups born the same year have the same cohort id aging all individuals age 1 year pups of the year are now 1 year old yearlings are 2 and 3 year olds and older are adults individuals are considered mature at 2 years old i e yearlings and adults mortality there are 7 different mortality rates that take into account age residence status and the total number of packs relative to equilibrium density mortality is applied individually to each wolf using a bernoulli distribution which probability is sampled from a normal distribution at each time step pups have a probability of 0 602 of dying smith et al 2010 the mortality probability for non dispersing yearlings is equal to 0 18 sd 0 04 marucco et al 2009 there are two types of mortality for non dispersing adults that depend on the number of established packs in the population if the number of established packs is below the number of packs at equilibrium density of the area mortality is fixed and equal to that of the yearlings i e 0 18 with sd 0 04 marucco et al 2009 however if the number of established packs is equal to the equilibrium density of the area mortality is density dependent we used the equation linking wolf survival φ with wolf density from cubaynes et al 2014 to estimate the density dependent mortality for non dispersing adults logit φ 1 196 0 505 popdensstd where popdensstd is the wolf density per 1000 km2 standardized with cubaynes mean and standard deviation values mean 53 833 sd 17 984 wolf density is calculated as the total number of wolves without considering the pups divided by the area where the population is estimated as the equilibrium density defined by the user multiplied by the wolf average territory size 104 km2 mancinelli et al 2018 two mortality rates concern dispersing individuals no pups can be dispersers and dispersing yearlings are individuals that dispersed the previous year when they were pups due to a dissolution of their pack but could not find a pack to adopt them during that year otherwise they would be residents we assumed these individuals are too young to survive by themselves and we defined a mortality probability equal to 1 to dispersing yearlings all other dispersing wolves i e adults have a mortality probability equal to 0 31 blanco and cortes 2007 we did not model senescence or any increase of the mortality probability with age to represent a realistic age distribution in the population the limit for wolves was the end of their 15th year of simulation marucco and mcintire 2010 and all individuals reaching 16 years old die packdissolution following the mortality event packs whose social structure has been impacted by the loss of breeders may dissolve brainerd et al 2008 small packs with 1 breeding individual remaining will dissolve with a probability of 0 258 brainerd et al 2008 and small packs with no breeder left dissolve with a probability of 0 846 brainerd et al 2008 the pack size threshold to differentiate small and large packs was explored using the values 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 in the specific case where both breeders died and only pups remain the pack always dissolves as we assumed pups alone are unlikely to maintain a territory and so they disperse when a pack dissolves all former members of the pack become dispersers they do not belong to a pack anymore and former breeding individuals lose their status replacebreedingfembysub when a breeding female dies she is most likely replaced by one of the female subordinates in her pack most likely one of her daughters caniglia et al 2014 jedrzejewski et al 2005 when a pack is missing its breeding female one of the mature females from the pack is randomly chosen to become breeder once the new breeding female is chosen we look at the relatedness between her and the current breeding male if there is any if there is a breeding male in the pack and he is closely related to the chosen female he may be replaced in sub models replacebreederbydisp and replacebreedingmalbysub by a disperser or a less related subordinate from the pack who will usurp the established breeding position mech and boitani 2003 the relatedness threshold chosen is the one of the first cousin r 0 125 a mating pair of breeding wolves can be no more closely related than cousins e g no mating between siblings or parents and children caniglia et al 2014 this relatedness threshold is the same for all sub models dispersal when a pack has too many wolves some are chased away and become dispersers a maximum number of individuals is generated for each pack at each time step using a normal distribution with a mean of 4 405 sd 1 251 marucco and mcintire 2010 if the pack has more wolves than its maximum threshold some individuals will leave the pack until the number of wolves in the pack is equal to its threshold breeding individuals cannot disperse all the other wolves can disperse but with different relative probabilities based on their age pups may disperse with a relative probability of 0 25 yearlings may disperse with a relative probability of 0 5 and adults may disperse with a relative probability of 0 9 haight and mech 1997 wolves leaving the pack become dispersers and do not belong to the pack anymore immigration some wolves outside of the simulated population can arrive and interact with the other wolves a user determined number of immigrants will integrate with the population the sex of the immigrants is randomly assigned i e male or female with a 1 1 ratio their age is simulated using a truncated poisson distribution of mean equal to 2 with boundaries between 1 and 15 as yearlings are the most likely to disperse immigrants are dispersers they do not belong to any pack yet and they are not breeders as they were born outside the simulated population they do not hold information about their mother father or cohort ids immigrant wolves will react the same way i e follow the same sub model rules as the native wolves emigration a proportion of the currently dispersing individuals randomly chosen leaves the simulated population via long distance dispersal these individuals will not come back and their disappearance is similar to simulating their death adoption packs which are not full i e their number of individuals is below their maximum threshold can adopt individuals the probability with which these packs will adopt was explored using the values 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 these packs can adopt individuals until they reach their maximum number of pack members only dispersers of 1 2 and 3 years of age can be adopted by these packs the order in which packs adopt dispersing individuals is random among potential adoptees males are selected first then if there are no more males and packs are still able to adopt females are chosen the choice among the males or among the females is random once young dispersers have been adopted they become residents and belong to the pack that adopted them replacebreederbydisp missing breeders in packs can be replaced by dispersers first we look at the packs missing breeding females mature female dispersers can become breeding females if there is already a breeding male in the pack we exclude the dispersing females that are closely related to the breeding male from the potential successors then a female is randomly chosen among the unrelated ones to integrate into the pack all selected females become residents and breeders of their assigned pack and belong to the pack they joined the order in which packs fill breeding female positions is random next the same process is used to replace missing male breeders with mature male dispersers if there are packs where the missing breeding female was replaced by a subordinate in replacebreedingfembysub during the time step and the current breeding male was too related to her an unrelated mature male disperser may usurp the established male breeder mech and boitani 2003 the breeding males replaced by dispersers are dismissed from their position and become subordinates in their own pack establishpairs a male disperser and a female disperser can establish a new pack together if they are mature and not closely related in addition this is only possible if the number of existing packs is not already equal to equilibrium density if the area is not already full there is a density dependent probability for dispersers to establish in pairs defined by a bernoulli distribution with a probability equal to the number of packs that can be created until reaching equilibrium density divided by the equilibrium density the more packs there are the less likely it is that two dispersers establish themselves in pairs once a male and a female disperser have established a new pack they both become breeders and residents and obtain the same new and unique pack id the order for the choice of males and females among the available mature dispersers is random establishbudding budding is when a disperser and a mature subordinate wolf from an existing pack establish a new pack together like establishment in pairs budding is possible only if the number of packs has not reached equilibrium density the probability for a disperser to bud is the density dependent probability for establishment in pairs multiplied by a probability of budding we explored this last probability and tested values equal to 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 only mature dispersers can bud and only with a non breeding mature resident of the opposite sex that is not closely related once a disperser and a subordinate wolf bud they both become breeders and residents and obtain the same new and unique pack id the order for the choice of males and females among the available mature dispersers and subordinates in packs is random establishalone if the area is not at equilibrium density remaining mature dispersers that could not establish themselves in pairs or by budding can establish themselves alone the probability of this is also density dependent and is the same as the probability of the establishment in pairs once they create their own pack wolves become breeders and residents and obtain a new and unique pack id replacebreedingmalbysub when a breeding male is missing one of the mature male subordinates in the pack can take over if there are several subordinates that are eligible to become successors the male least related to the current breeding female is chosen if there are several subordinate males that are the least related or if there is no breeding female one is selected randomly if the breeding female is too related to the newly chosen breeding male the mature female subordinate who is least related to the new breeding male can usurp the current breeding female and the current breeding female is dismissed i e becomes subordinate if there are several mature female subordinates that are the least related one is selected randomly in the particular case where there was a missing breeding female who was replaced by a subordinate in replacebreedingfembysub during the time step and she was too related to the current breeding male one of the less related male subordinates can take over the male breeding position all of these rules mimic the fact that wolves change partners to avoid inbreeding except when there is no other choice mech and boitani 2003 once new breeding individuals are chosen they will be able to mate the next

24772,the occurrence of wolf populations in human dominated landscapes is challenging worldwide because of conflicts with human activities modeling is an important tool to project wolf dynamics and expansion and help in decision making concerning management and conservation however some individual behaviors and pack dynamics of the wolf life cycle are still unclear to ecologists here we present an individual based model ibm to project wolf populations while exploring the lesser known processes of the wolf life cycle ibms are bottom up models that simulate the fate of individuals interacting with each other with population level properties emerging from the individual level simulations ibms are particularly adapted to represent social species such as the wolf that exhibits complex individual interactions our ibm projects wolf demography including fine scale individual behavior and pack dynamics based on up to date scientific literature we explore four processes of the wolf life cycle whose consequences on population dynamics are still poorly understood the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption of young dispersers by packs the establishment of new packs through budding and the different breeder replacement strategies while running different versions of the ibm to explore these processes we also illustrate the modularity and flexibility of our model an asset to model wolf populations experiencing different ecological and demographic conditions the different parameterization of pack dissolution territory establishment by budding and breeder replacement processes influence the projections of wolf populations as such these processes require further field investigation to be better understood the adoption process has a lesser impact on model projections being coded in r to facilitate its understanding we expect that our model will be used and further adapted by ecologists for their own specific applications keywords gray wolf individual based model pack dynamics population projection r language abbreviations ibms individual based models id identity fig figure odd overview design concepts and details popdensstd wolf density per 1000 km2 standardized with mean and standard deviation from cubaynes et al 2014 sd standard deviation 1 introduction the gray wolf canis lupus has been extirpated from most of the globe during the last century due to its competition with humans for wild prey depredations on livestock and general persecution ripple et al 2014 most of the remaining populations were considered endangered in the early 20th century mech and boitani 2003 however numerous wolf populations are now under protection regimes and management actions favor species persistence or comeback chapron et al 2014 even though the presence of this large carnivore may play an important role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem and increase biodiversity its recolonization is challenging for example the impact wolves exert on human activities such as livestock farming kaczensky 1999 lute et al 2018 or the increasing threat of hybridization with dogs in human dominated landscapes pilot et al 2018 randi 2011 randi et al 2014 require informed and effective management of the populations hindrikson et al 2017 management interventions may involve control of wolf populations through legal killings bradley et al 2015 harper et al 2008 santiago avila et al 2018 or non lethal management options mcmanus et al 2015 treves et al 2016 such as sterilization of breeders donfrancesco et al 2019 haight and mech 1997 in order to inform and help managers in making the best decisions models are needed to forecast the impact of alternative management regimes on the population dynamics and viability of the species bull 2006 marescot et al 2013 not only can models help select the best management strategy among several but they can also define the most effective application of any particular strategy e g its intensity or frequency haight and mech 1997 however before projecting the impact of external factors on wolf populations a good understanding of the species life cycle as well as a reliable model simulating it is required different types of models have been used to project the dynamics of highly social species such as the gray wolf stage structured models including age breeding or dispersing specific individual categories have been developed to project population growth rate and hence are relevant to make projections at the population level haight and mech 1997 marescot et al 2012 individual based models ibms have also been used to model population dynamics and have proven to be more flexible to represent species with complex social structure like wolves or coyotes chapron et al 2016 marucco and mcintire 2010 pitt et al 2003 ibms are bottom up models that simulate the fate of individuals interacting with each other and or their environment ibms can include many individual level mechanisms i e behavioral rules and therefore can represent complex individual interactions as exhibited by these social species chapron et al 2016 haight et al 2002 marucco and mcintire 2010 pitt et al 2003 population level results emerge from the individual level simulations railsback and grimm 2012 ibms are modular models in that they are built as series of sub models sub models represent either processes of the species life cycle e g reproduction mortality or external factors that modify the population structure e g immigration management in this respect ibms can be very flexible as sub models can be independently parameterized reorganized or removed or new ones can be added this flexibility allows researchers to mimic the species life cycle very closely to test different versions of the model by modifying only some sub models as well as testing the impact of external processes such as different management actions on simulated populations bull et al 2009 hradsky et al 2019 researchers have used ibms to simulate the impact of wolf removal strategies on depredation and population viability haight et al 2002 to test the robustness of abundance indices chapron et al 2016 or to project the recolonization of the species and the associated risk of depredation marucco and mcintire 2010 the models were all based on the fundamental processes of mortality reproduction and dispersal they also enabled individuals to access to the breeder status by various means such as pack creation or the replacement of a missing breeder in a pack additionally haight et al 2002 and chapron et al 2016 included supplementary mortality processes mimicking different wolf removal strategies however other individual behaviors and social dynamics not included in these ibms are known to occur in the wild for example brainerd et al 2008 found that the loss of breeders in a pack might disrupt its stability depending on the pack size and number of remaining breeders and may induce a pack dissolution specifically small packs with only one breeder left had a high probability of breaking apart and even higher when no breeder remained brainerd et al 2008 in addition several studies observed that when breeders died in packs vacant male breeding positions were primarily filled by unrelated individuals whereas vacant female breeding positions were mostly filled by subordinate females of the same packs which were most likely the daughters of the former breeding females caniglia et al 2014 jedrzejewski et al 2005 vonholdt et al 2008 these processes surely play a role in inbreeding avoidance another social process affecting wolf population dynamics is the adoption of unrelated individuals within packs young lone wolves not holding a territory sometimes join and are adopted as subordinates by packs mech and boitani 2003 most adoptees are males of 1 to 3 years old meier et al 1995 messier 1985 adoptees seem to represent a non negligible part of the populations roughly estimated between 10 and 20 mech and boitani 2003 however adoptees are generally not identified in wolf populations as it necessitates genetic sampling and relatedness analyses the reasons behind this behaviour are still poorly known mech and boitani 2003 finally less common strategies of formation of new reproductive pairs through budding or splitting may influence the wolf establishment and reproduction dynamics budding is when a dispersing wolf pairs with a mature subordinate from an existing pack and they establish a new pack of their own brainerd et al 2008 mech and boitani 2003 pack splitting has been reported for large packs mainly in north american wolf populations hayes and harestad 2000 jedrzejewski et al 2004 meier et al 1995 vonholdt et al 2008 a sub group of individuals permanently splits off from their original pack to form a new one nearby often due to the presence of two breeding pairs in the pack jedrzejewski et al 2004 mech and boitani 2003 it differs from budding in that no dispersing individual is involved in the process studies on wolf genetics inbreeding caniglia et al 2014 vonholdt et al 2008 hybridization fredrickson and hedrick 2006 or assessment of management alternatives haight et al 2002 haight and mech 1997 that fail to account for important processes of wolf social dynamics may provide limited or erroneous conclusions leading to potential inappropriate management decisions unfortunately the processes mentioned above are not often reported from field studies they are rarely quantified and their details are poorly documented here we present an ibm that we developed to simulate the wolf life cycle while exploring four lesser known processes of its social dynamics specifically the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption by existing packs of young dispersers the establishment of new packs through budding and the different types of breeder replacement our model explicitly includes interactions between individual wolves accounting for changes in wolf status i e breeder vs subordinate resident vs disperser dispersal and establishment processes while taking into account density dependence and individuals relatedness while we use literature to parametrize well known individual behaviors and pack dynamics we model multiple scenarios based on different parameters similar to a sensitivity analysis to explore the lesser known processes the variability among model projections reveals processes that most affected wolf population dynamics therefore indicating life cycle traits that require further investigation to enhance reliability of population projections we develop our model using the r language to facilitate its clarity accessibility and uptake by ecologists given the flexibility and modularity of the model structure our ibm can be easily parameterized according to different values updated with improved knowledge on wolf dynamics or modified to be adapted to other specific research or management questions on wolves 2 methods 2 1 wolf ibm 2 1 1 background information we calibrate the model for central european wolf populations i e alps apennines these populations are recolonizing the territory locally generating conflicts with human activities chapron et al 2014 they have also been well monitored and we have good estimates for their demographic parameters marucco et al 2009 caniglia et al 2014 a pack is usually composed of one breeding pair potentially augmented by several non breeding subordinates mortality causes e g starvation disease vehicle collisions culling poaching intraspecific strife differ among individuals inducing different mortality rates usually depending on their age marucco and mcintire 2010 or their residence status blanco and cortés 2007 moreover higher population densities cause competition for food space and mates and may also induce a higher adult mortality due to intraspecific aggressions cubaynes et al 2014 following the death of one or both breeders a pack can persist and breeders can be replaced wolves routinely disperse in response to competition and aggression related to food availability and breeding opportunity within their pack mech and boitani 2003 non breeding wolves are forced to leave the pack because of social drivers regulating group size within the territory ballard et al 1987 fritts and mech 1981 fuller 1989 gese and mech 1991 mech 1987 in areas of high prey availability dispersal is postponed ballard et al 1987 blanco and cortés 2007 jimenez et al 2017 and is rather triggered by the onset of sexual maturity of young wolves gese and mech 1991 messier 1985 packard and mech 1980 so that most wolves have dispersed from their natal pack by the age of 3 gese and mech 1991 jimenez et al 2017 given wolves dispersal abilities individuals may move from one population to another through long distance dispersal blanco and cortés 2007 ciucci et al 2009 in immigration and emigration processes one of the main processes for dispersing wolves to reproduce is to form a new pack with a dispersing mate of the opposite sex mech and boitani 2003 dispersing individuals can also establish a new territory by themselves waiting for a mate to later join them wabakken et al 2001 2 1 2 main model structure the model simulates the life cycle of the gray wolf using an individual based structure including fine scale individual processes and pack dynamics through a non spatially explicit approach the complete description of the ibm following the overview design concepts and details protocol odd protocol grimm et al 2010 2006 is provided in appendix a simulated individuals represent wolves that are organized in packs each wolf holds a unique id a sex male or female an age if it is a resident i e member of a pack or a disperser if it attained breeder status or not and a pack id to which it belongs if resident the model also tracks each wolf s genealogy and each individual has a mother id and father id and a cohort id i e the year it was born wolves are individually aged as pups 1 year old yearlings 2 years old or adults 3 years old we assume all wolves reach sexual maturity at 2 years old we consider a pack when one or several individuals establish and become residents in our model dispersers or dispersing individuals include all non resident individuals comprising those that are actually dispersing i e that left their natal pack and are dispersing through the landscape searching for an opportunity to establish a new territory and mate as well as floaters i e nomadic individuals without a territory and available either to replace missing breeders within packs or to establish a new pack mancinelli et al 2018 we also consider in our model that a solitary resident wolf holding a territory alone constitutes a pack although our ibm is not spatially explicit we indirectly consider the relative spatial arrangement of wolves through their pack affiliation and the equilibrium density parameter table 1 the time step of the model is one year as the wolf life cycle is organized around reproduction that happens once a year at each time step all simulated individuals go through the same series of different sub models representing different processes of the wolf life cycle and each individual behaves differently according to its own characteristics the first sub models are in order reproduction aging and mortality they are followed by several sub models related to changes in breeder subordinate and resident disperser status fig 1 most of the sub models included in our ibm represent well studied and well quantified processes table 1 however four processes of the wolf dynamics that we include are lesser known the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption of young dispersing individuals by packs the establishment of new packs using the budding strategy and the different types of breeder replacement fig 1 if the timing of pack dissolution adoption and establishment by budding is fairly well understood the intensity at which these processes occur in wolf populations has rarely been estimated on the contrary the timing of the different breeder replacement strategies is not well understood and still debated we explore different parameter values for the sub models pack dissolution adoption and new pack establishment by budding table 2 modifying the importance of the process in the wolf dynamics and different timing i e orders for the sub models concerning the breeder replacements fig 1 changing the relative order for the breeder replacement strategies induces a change in their relative importance as fewer packs are impacted by the final strategies as fewer packs are still missing a breeder 2 1 3 initial population a wolf initial population is needed to launch the ibm simulations the user specifies the composition of its initial population and its attributes namely the equilibrium density and immigration and emigration rates to best represent the population he she wants to model here is a simple example of the population we use in the following analyses we build a fictive initial population of 10 packs and 5 dispersers in an environment that can hold 30 packs in total i e equilibrium density table 1 specifically the population comprises 5 packs of 2 breeders 5 years old each with 2 pups one male and one female 3 packs of 2 breeders 5 years old each with 1 yearling male and 1 pup female 2 packs of 2 breeders 5 years old each with 1 adult female 3 years old and 5 dispersers 3 females 2 males 2 years old each we estimate the size of the area where the population is simulated as the number of packs at equilibrium density multiplied by the average territory size for wolf populations in the apennines 104 km2 mancinelli et al 2018 this area is used to calculate wolf density in density dependent processes we allow connections of the simulated population with other non simulated wolf populations via an immigration of 0 1 or 2 external wolves per year inside the simulated population and an emigration of 10 of the dispersing wolves from the simulated population outside of the study area the parameters equilibrium density number of immigrants arriving per year and proportion of dispersing wolves emigrating are randomly chosen a modification of their values surely will change the projections of the population but the impact of these parameters on wolf populations are well understood and are therefore not explored further in this study 2 1 4 well known processes of the wolf life cycle we define as well known processes wolf dynamics that are well documented and well understood these processes are usually included in wolf ibms chapron et al 2016 haight et al 2002 marucco and mcintire 2010 when coding the sub models to reproduce these processes we have reliable estimates to parameterize and time them in our model 2 1 4 1 reproduction we simulate that all packs with a breeding pair reproduce each year marucco and mcintire 2010 we define the number of pups breeding pairs produce by sampling values in a poisson distribution table 1 chapron et al 2016 the sex of each pup is randomly defined as male or female with a 1 1 ratio marucco and mcintire 2010 sidorovich et al 2007 newborn pups are of age 0 pups are residents with the pack id of their parents bear their mother and father ids and are assigned a cohort id equal to the year of the simulation during which they are born 2 1 4 2 aging all individuals age one additional year in this sub model pups of the year are now 1 year old yearlings are 2 years old and individuals of 3 years old enter the adult age class 2 1 4 3 mortality we simulate seven different mortality rates table 1 according to various combination of age and residence status of the individuals and total number of packs related to the number at equilibrium density mortality is applied individually using a bernoulli distribution at each time step the mortality probability is sampled from a normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation parameters table 1 associated to the different categories of individuals 2 1 4 3 1 mortality for non dispersing individuals we apply a different probability of mortality for non dispersing individuals regarding their age category i e pups yearlings or adults table 1 to mimic density dependence in adult mortality cubaynes et al 2014 we apply two mortality rates for this age category depending on the number of packs established in the population during any given year of the simulation if the number of packs is below the equilibrium density mortality is fixed table 1 if the number of packs reaches equilibrium density we linked wolf mortality with wolf density following cubaynes et al 2014 2 1 4 3 2 mortality for dispersing individuals dispersing yearlings in this sub model are individuals whose pack dissolved in the previous year when they were pups and that were not adopted by any pack during that year their likelihood of survival alone is low without food or care from adults or yearlings brainerd et al 2008 mech and boitani 2003 so we set their mortality probability to 1 otherwise we set the same fixed mortality to all dispersing adults table 1 2 1 4 3 3 mortality for old individuals we do not model senescence or any increase in mortality rate with age however to represent a realistic age distribution in the population we allow wolves to live up to their 15th year of age marucco and mcintire 2010 and all individuals of this age die entering the successive year of simulation 2 1 4 4 dispersal for each pack and at each time step we simulate the maximum number of individuals packs can support using a normal distribution table 1 if a pack exceeds its simulated threshold a certain number of individuals disperse until the number of wolves in the pack levels off at the threshold while breeding individuals do not disperse all other wolves can among these the choice of dispersing individuals is based on relative probabilities related to their age category table 1 2 1 4 5 immigration emigration according to the immigration portion of the sub model at each time step a determined number of immigrants enters the population table 1 immigrants are simulated as dispersers generated from another wolf population their sex is randomly assigned i e male or female with a 1 1 ratio and their age is simulated using a truncated poisson distribution bounded between 1 and 15 with mean equal to 2 as dispersers are most commonly yearlings mech and boitani 2003 immigrants do not belong to any pack of the simulated populations yet and consequently are not breeders as they were born outside the simulated population they do not hold information about their mother id and father id i e they are unrelated to any other individuals however once immigrating they behave the same way i e follow the same sub model rules as the native wolves for the emigration portion of the sub model a proportion of the current dispersing individuals table 1 randomly chosen leaves the simulated population these individuals do not come back and their disappearance is similar to simulating their death 2 1 4 6 pack establishment by breeding pairs we define that reproductively mature male and female dispersers that are not closely related can pair bond establish together as breeders and form a new pack the relatedness threshold chosen is that of the first cousins table 1 in wolves breeding pairs are rarely more related than cousins except when they have no other option i e mating between siblings or parents and pups are generally avoided caniglia et al 2014 this relatedness threshold is the same for all sub models establishment by breeding pairs is possible only if the number of existing packs has not yet reached equilibrium density the density dependent probability for dispersers to pair bond is defined by a bernoulli distribution with probability equal to the number of packs that can be established until reaching equilibrium density divided by equilibrium density i e the more packs there are the less chance for dispersers to pair bond and establish new packs once a pair bond is established both wolves become breeders and residents sharing the same new and unique pack id 2 1 4 7 pack establishment by single wolves if the area is not at equilibrium density our model allows mature dispersers that did not pair bond to establish a territory by themselves similar to establishing in pair the probability to establish a territory alone is density dependent single wolves holding the new territory become breeders even if no reproduction is possible yet and residents of a new pack i e they are assigned a new and unique pack id then at the next time step a mature disperser of opposite sex will be able to take the vacant breeding position and finally reproduce 2 1 5 lesser known processes of the wolf life cycle we define as lesser known processes wolf dynamics that are known to occur in the wild but that are not extensively documented these processes have not been included in previous ibms for wolves chapron et al 2016 haight et al 2002 marucco and mcintire 2010 when coding the sub models to reproduce these processes we do not have reliable estimates to parameterize or streamline them inside the life cycle available from the literature 2 1 5 1 pack dissolution we simulate that small packs whose social structure is impacted by the loss of one or both breeders may dissolve with different probabilities regarding how many breeders remain table 1 in the specific case where both breeders die and only pups remain in a pack we consider that the pack always dissolves as pups are unlikely to maintain a territory by themselves if these pups are not adopted during the current year they die in the mortality sub model during the next time step when a pack dissolves all former members of the pack become dispersers and do not belong to a pack anymore former breeding individuals also lose their breeder status brainerd et al 2008 differentiate small packs in which dissolution can occur following the loss of one or two breeders from large packs in which dissolution never occurs they do not define a threshold between small and large packs but estimate that small packs have on average 2 36 individuals and large packs 5 75 we explore the importance of the pack dissolution process on the wolf population dynamics by varying this pack size threshold differentiating small packs from large ones table 2 a small threshold induces that only very small packs can dissolve therefore minimizing the influence of pack dissolution on wolf dynamics a large threshold allow more packs to be concerned hence maximizing the influence of pack dissolution on wolf dynamics 2 1 5 2 adoption we define in our model that packs whose size is below their maximum threshold estimated in the dispersal sub model can adopt as many individuals between 1 and 3 years old inclusive as allowed by their maximum pack size among potential adoptees dispersing males are selected first if there are no more males available to adopt and packs are still small enough then females are chosen next as adoptees once adopted individuals become non breeding i e subordinate residents and acquire their pack id adoption has been observed mech and boitani 2003 but the rate at which this process occurs is unknown to explore how relevant this process is to affect wolf population dynamics we defined different probability values for a pack to adopt table 2 2 1 5 3 pack establishment by budding similar to the other strategies of establishment budding is possible only if the number of packs in the population has not reached the equilibrium density we define a density dependent probability for a disperser to bud similar to the one of pack establishment through pair bonding only mature dispersers can bud and only with a non breeding mature resident of the opposite sex that is not closely related table 1 once budding occurs both wolves that pair become breeders and residents and obtain the same new and unique pack id there are no detailed studies indicating how common budding is compared to alternative ways of pack establishment we explore the influence this process might have on wolf population dynamics by testing different probabilities of budding table 2 that we multiply to the density dependence probability of pack establishment 2 1 5 4 replacement of missing breeders 2 1 5 4 1 replacement of breeding females by subordinates we select the subordinates to replace the missing breeding females by randomly choosing one of the subordinate mature females in the concerned packs to mimic inbreeding avoidance in wolf packs we then look at the relatedness between the chosen females and the current breeding males if there is any in case a breeding male is closely related to the female table 1 he may be replaced by a less related subordinate or a disperser in sub models 2 1 5 4 2 replacement of breeding males by subordinates or 2 1 5 4 3 replacement of breeders by dispersers we explore how the alternative sequence of the breeder replacement sub models i e breeders replaced by subordinates followed by breeders replaced by dispersers or vice versa independently for each sex fig 1 affect projections of wolf population dynamics 2 1 5 4 2 replacement of breeding males by subordinates if there are several mature male subordinates in the pack where the male breeding position is vacant the least related to the current breeding female if there is any is chosen to become breeder if there are several unrelated subordinate males or if there is no breeding female one is selected randomly in the case where the breeding female is related to the newly chosen breeding male but there is a mature female subordinate less related the latter usurp the breeding female and the former breeding female is dismissed i e becomes subordinate if there are several unrelated mature female subordinates one is selected randomly we add that in the particular case where a pack was not missing a breeding male but the breeding female obtained her breeding status during the time step in 2 1 5 4 1 replacement of breeding females by subordinates and she was too related to the current breeding male one of the less related male subordinates can take over the male breeding position in this sub model all of these rules mimic inbreeding avoidance in wolves except when there is no other choice to reproduce mech and boitani 2003 once new breeding individuals are chosen they will be able to mate the next year 2 1 5 4 3 replacement of breeders by dispersers here we simulate the replacement of all missing breeders both females and males by mature dispersers first missing breeding females are replaced by mature dispersing females unrelated to the current breeding males in the packs if there is any then missing breeding males are replaced similarly selected dispersers thus become breeders of packs resident and acquire the id of the pack they joined 2 2 model scenarios tested we explore the impact of the four lesser known processes on wolf population projections by varying and combining their different parameters values table 2 or timing fig 1 resulting in 81 model scenarios appendix b we run 200 replicates of each scenario for a 25 year simulation period starting with the same initial population and same parameters for the well known processes table 1 2 2 1 model outputs for each simulation the complete population with the individual s characteristics is available for each simulated year the change in pack numbers is also recorded after each event potentially modifying their number individual mortality i e if all members of a pack die pack dissolution and the three types of new pack establishments we derive from the model outputs six metrics that we consider crucial to evaluate wolf conservation and management specifically we calculate for each simulated year and for each replicate of each model scenario the number of packs with a breeding pair then we extract 1 at which year populations reach equilibrium density this output represents the speed of the population expansion and is a key element in areas that are being recolonized by the wolf all the other metrics are defined using model outputs extracted after the last year of simulation once all populations are at equilibrium density we calculate for each replicate of each model scenario 2 the number of packs with a breeding pair as this corresponds to the reproductive potential of the population and is of importance for management issues related to population growth 3 the number of packs newly established during the final year this represents the pack turnover and the stability of the population that may affect mortality compensation species expansion or wolf human conflicts e g new packs may be more or less prone to attack livestock compared to old established packs which know the associated risks and benefits 4 the abundance of the population i e total number of individuals and 5 the proportion of residents and dispersers in the population population size is often required in management and knowing the relative proportions of residents vs dispersers may help in understanding the demographic and social performance of the population and its potential to further expand its range finally we compute 6 the relatedness between the two breeders in each pack inbreeding avoidance plays a big part in the wolf life cycle affecting the replacement of the missing breeders and the creation of a new pack 2 3 sensitivity analysis we run a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the well known processes table 1 to identify if some may influence the conclusions on the lesser known processes we use the model version m1 as a plausible model version and the parameter values 4 1 0 5 and 0 5 i e all intermediate values for the parameters of the sub models pack dissolution adoption and establishment by budding respectively we run this model modifying the parameters of the well known processes table 1 one parameter at a time by either increasing or decreasing its value by 5 ovenden et al 2019 we run 200 replicates of the model over 25 years to test each parameter the model is considered sensitive to a parameter if a model output i e mean value over the 200 replicates with a modified parameter varies more than 20 from the original results kramer schadt et al 2005 ovenden et al 2019 we examine the six model outputs described above in the 2 2 1 model outputs section we do not test the sensitivity of the model to standard deviation parameters standard deviation of mortality and of pack size table 1 regarding the density dependent mortality function we only test the sensitivity of the slope parameter and do not test the sensitivity to the intercept and to the parameters standardizing the population density table 1 2 4 model implementation the ibm is coded in r 3 5 2 r core team 2014 we use the r package netlogor bauduin et al 2019 to facilitate the implementation of the individual based model structure in r language and the package pedantics morrissey 2018 to calculate relatedness between individuals using their mother and father ids we use the packages sciviews grosjean 2018 for the logarithms functions and testthat wickham et al 2019 to implement tests in our model and verify the outcomes of the sub models the r files to run the model are available in the github repository https github com sarahbauduin appendix wolfibm under the gnu general public license v3 0 3 results 3 1 general results for the wolf ibm figures showing all model outputs for the 81 model scenarios are presented in appendix c all scenarios project a growth of the wolf population starting from 10 packs and 43 wolves after 25 years of simulation populations reach a mean of 29 4 packs sd 1 0 with a breeding pair for an overall mean population size of 186 2 wolves sd 12 4 in all model scenarios populations stabilize and reach equilibrium density after about 10 years of simulation mean 9 8 years sd 2 8 3 2 effect of lesser known social processes on wolf dynamics we only present model outputs that show an impact from the parameterization or timing of the explored sub models values reported are means and standard deviations calculated from all replicate simulations from each set of 27 model scenarios with the same parameter value or model version for the explored sub model i e 3 parameters or model versions 27 model scenarios 81 total 3 2 1 pack dissolution the different parameter values for the pack dissolution threshold influence the number of packs with a breeding pair and the total number of individuals in the population after the last year of simulation as well as the number of new packs formed during the last year of simulation model scenarios where only small packs i e with 3 individuals or less may dissolve after breeders loss project wolf populations with on average 29 6 packs with a breeding pair sd 0 8 scenarios where larger packs may dissolve i e packs up to 4 and up to 5 individuals project on average 29 4 packs sd 1 0 and 29 2 packs sd 1 1 respectively fig 2 a the most impacted model output by this sub model parameterization is the number of new packs formed during the last year of simulation more new packs are formed as larger packs are allowed to dissolve with the threshold values 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 the mean number of new packs created are equal to 1 3 sd 1 1 2 2 sd 1 5 and 3 2 sd 1 7 respectively fig 2 b regarding the number of individuals in the populations the averages are equal to 189 4 sd 11 9 186 3 sd 12 1 and 182 8 sd 12 3 respectively fig 2 c 3 2 2 adoption the different parameters for the adoption sub model seem to only mildly influence the proportion of resident individuals in the populations with an adoption probability set to 0 1 model scenarios project on average 68 1 of the population being resident sd 5 9 with an adoption probability equal to 0 5 the result is of 69 7 sd 5 4 and with an adoption probability equal to 0 9 the result if of 71 2 sd 5 8 fig 3 the impact of varying the adoption probability from 0 1 i e almost no adoption occurring to 0 9 i e adoption happening very often when possible is very low on this model output and non existent on the other ones appendix c 3 2 3 pack establishment by budding the model outputs the most impacted by the different parameter values for the probability of establishment by budding are the time at which populations reach equilibrium density and the number of packs with a breeding pair at the end of the simulation the lowest probability of budding i e equal to 0 1 project wolf populations reaching the equilibrium density the latest on average after 11 8 years of simulation sd 3 0 fig 4 with the budding probability equal to 0 5 populations reached that point on average after 9 6 years sd 2 2 fig 4 with the highest probability of budding i e equal to 0 9 populations reach the equilibrium density the fastest on average after 8 2 years of simulation sd 1 7 fig 4 the observed differences in numbers of packs after the last year of simulation follow the same patterns the highest budding probability produced the highest mean values model scenarios with a budding probability equal to 0 1 project wolf populations with on average 29 0 packs sd 1 2 with a probability of 0 5 there are on average 29 4 packs sd 1 0 and with the budding probability equal to 0 9 there are on average 29 7 packs sd 0 6 3 2 4 replacement of missing breeders the model versions testing the different timing of sub models concerning breeder replacement influence mildly the proportion of resident individuals in the population after the last year of simulation but it greatly impacts the relatedness value between male and female in breeding pairs model versions m1 and m3 have similar results and they both differ compared to those obtained using m2 m1 fig 1 with the replacement of missing breeding females by subordinates first and the replacement of missing breeding males by dispersers first project populations with a mean proportion of resident equal to 70 3 sd 5 3 fig 5 a it is similar to m3 fig 1 where the replacement of missing breeders was done primarily by dispersers for both sexes projected populations have on average 71 2 of resident individuals sd 5 5 fig 5 a in m2 fig 1 where the replacement of missing breeders was done primarily by subordinates projected populations have on average 67 5 of resident individuals sd 5 1 fig 5 a the influence of the different model versions is greater on the relatedness between breeders for m1 the mean relatedness is equal to 0 06 sd 0 03 similarly as for m3 mean 0 06 sd 0 04 for m2 it is equal to 0 26 sd 0 31 fig 5 b m1 and m3 favor the replacement of at least one missing breeder by a disperser and keep relatedness between breeders very low in m2 missing breeders are primarily replaced by subordinates and mating between related individuals frequently occur 3 3 sensitivity analysis as expected the parameter affecting the most model outputs apart from the ones tested for the lesser known processes is the equilibrium density the number of new packs created is sensitive to this parameter all the other model outputs are slightly sensitive to the equilibrium density parameter but not in the range of 20 20 pup mortality is the second parameter affecting the most model outputs but none vary more than the range of 20 20 overall the six model outputs we look at are not sensitive to the parameters of the well known processes table 1 the complete table with the value tested for the parameters and the results for the model outputs is available in appendix d 4 discussion we developed an ibm to represent wolf demography and pack dynamics while exploring lesser known processes of the species social dynamics we explored different parameterization and timing for the processes of pack dissolution adoption establishment by budding and replacement of missing breeders although the effects on the model outputs were relatively small the projections from the different model scenarios pointed out the importance of the pack dissolution establishment by budding and replacement of missing breeders processes in wolf population projections further research is needed to better understand these processes and the mechanisms behind to be able to correctly incorporate them in the ibm with reliable parameter values and timing among the different sub models among these three processes the different orders of the breeder replacement strategies produced the largest effect on the breeder relatedness this process should be the first focus of attention for more investigation the fourth studied process i e adoption did not modify much the model outputs possibly indicating a lesser influence of this process on wolf dynamics our model also innovatively accounted for relatedness between individuals and density dependence adding a genetic component to our model is especially important to investigate hybridization and inbreeding depression that can be of great concern for wolf management and conservation bohling and waits 2015 our analyses also highlighted the modularity and flexibility of our ibm that can be adapted and used by ecologists to explore various questions and test different hypotheses on wolf ecology management and conservation to explore the process of pack dissolution we tested different values for the pack dissolution threshold to allow more or less packs to dissolve given different importance to this process in the wolf dynamics diminishing the importance of pack dissolution produced populations often being at equilibrium density with few new packs created mimicking a very stable population the other way a pack can disappear except than by dissolution is by the death of all its members at once which rarely happened in the simulations on the contrary allowing more packs to dissolve reduced the number of packs freed space and partners to create new packs and therefore favored the pack turnover still the creation of new packs did not seem to reach the same intensity as the one of pack loss as the final number of packs and individuals were slightly lower when pack dissolution was important however pack dissolution influenced more the composition of the packs at the individual level i e pack turnover impacted than the projections at the population level e g total number of packs and individuals this is in agreement with a study by borg et al 2015 showing that with or without pack breaking down following breeder losses the overall dynamics of the population was quite similar e g number of packs highlighting a compensation mechanism on the other hand population stability is a key element in social species where individual personalities and group compositions matter such as regarding hybridization bohling and waits 2015 and depredation allen 2014 as well as their associated management actions this process requires more field investigations to better understand the conditions leading to pack dissolution its understanding and inclusion in model would be rather relevant when individual identity is important e g hybridization budding is a strategy to establish and create new packs with a low probability to bud less packs are created and as expected simulations with the smallest probability of budding projected populations which were the slowest to reach equilibrium density inversely maximizing the importance of budding projected populations reaching equilibrium density the fastest at the end of the simulation when the populations were at equilibrium density the same pattern occurred with the more the budding strategy was used the more packs were present in the populations however the different budding probability only slightly influenced the number of packs when the population was at equilibrium density a better understanding of this process seems relevant to understand its relative importance regarding the other strategies of establishment to produce reliable projections especially during the growing phase of the population therefore this strategy of establishment is important to be understood and considered when the studied populations are in their colonizing phase having the replacement of the missing breeding female by a subordinate first m1 has been documented in some study sites caniglia et al 2014 jedrzejewski et al 2005 vonholdt et al 2008 but the regularity of this behavior is debated the modified model version where the replacement of the missing female breeder was done by a disperser before m3 produced very similar model outputs however the model version where both missing breeders were replaced by subordinates first m2 produced very different projections for the relatedness between breeders and to a lesser extent on the proportion of resident individuals in the population if we consider a breeding pair related when their relatedness coefficient is larger than 0 125 caniglia et al 2014 only 0 8 of the breeding pairs were related in populations projected with model versions m1 and m3 in contrast 38 1 of the breeding pairs were related in populations projected by m2 vonholdt et al 2008 evaluated that 7 of the breeding pairs in the yellowstone grey wolf population were related the difference in our projections and the value found by vonholdt et al can be due to spatiality in our model versions m1 and m3 all dispersers are available to replace missing breeders hence reducing the risk of inbreeding in the wild dispersers can be too far away and therefore not available to the packs missing breeders hence inducing a replacement of the missing breeders by subordinates and inbreeding understanding the functioning of the different types of breeder replacement and their timing is crucial seeing their impact on model projections studies on wolf genetics e g inbreeding hybridization could conclude completely differently if using one or another model version potentially inducing detrimental management recommendations for small isolated populations if projections were not reliable the modular and flexible construction of our ibm model can allow future users to organize the replacement of the missing breeders in the order best representing their population of interest or the latest findings in literature reducing the relative importance of the adoption process projected a higher proportion of dispersers as young wolves cannot be adopted by packs and therefore they remained floaters in the population i e considered as dispersers in the model the projected populations had more resident individuals when the adoption process was more important this process seems the one influencing the least our model outputs however we selected general model outputs to best represent the conservation state of the wolf populations and this process may influence other elements of the wolf population that we missed e g sex ratio of subordinates in packs projecting population with a reliable number of resident and dispersing individuals can be of high importance when modeling demographic processes where dispersers and floaters have a main role such as the colonization of new areas e g boyd et al 1999 pletscher et al 1997 one of the limitations of our ibm approach is that it is non spatial this greatly simplifies the use and the adaptation of the model to other populations as no animal environment interactions are modeled and therefore no data regarding these interactions which are sometimes hard to acquire are needed parameters like equilibrium density territory size number of migrants and proportion of emigration that need to be defined by the user give one way to account for spatial constraints given by a particular environment and these parameters can be changed to best represent the study area of interest that said we acknowledge that an explicit spatial mechanism would be very interesting to implement as wolf pack occupancy is mainly driven by exclusive territoriality cassidy et al 2016 but the population division and affiliation into packs approximated spatiality in our model to add more spatial constraints without changing the model structure a new individual characteristic could be defined to represent distances between individuals based on their pack affiliation individuals from the same pack would be closer to each other than to other individuals allowing a researcher to define short distance dispersers vs long distance dispersers louvrier et al 2018 separate from the immigration emigration process of our model with a bit more work the model could be turned into a spatially explicit ibm by including an explicit dispersal sub model like that in marucco and mcintire 2010 in place of the current dispersal sub model model outputs were sensitive to only a few parameters apart from those linked to the explored processes equilibrium density naturally affected the model projections as this parameter represents as stated above one of the main spatial constraints influencing the simulated populations this parameter triggered density dependent events that occurred only when the landscape was fully occupied having more variability to trigger these events could likely reduce the influence of the equilibrium density parameter on model outputs and reduce the subjectivity of this trigger building this ibm we aimed to include all biological processes documented in the literature to best represent the wolf life cycle overall we hope that our reproducible implementation of a modular and flexible ibm will contribute to the understanding management and conservation of wolf populations by providing a scenario testing and decision making tool for ecologists and stakeholders as well as a base model that can be adapted to simulate other canids and social species the r language we used to code our ibm is largely used by ecologists and this should likely ease the model understanding and adaptation for example without much modification our model could easily reproduce the life cycle of north american wolf populations with a few changes to the parameter values and the addition of a sub model representing pack splitting jedrzejewski et al 2004 mech and boitani 2003 users could also test hypotheses regarding assortative and disassortative mate choice for particular traits relevant in hybridization studies fredrickson and hedrick 2006 management actions e g culling sterilization can as well be included in the model to test their effectiveness haight and mech 1997 the modular structure of our ibm allows the addition removal or modification of only specific components of the model while keeping the other sub models and the main structure the same this model could be useful to other ecologists who could adapt it for their own specific research and management applications credit author statement sarah bauduin conceptualization

benson nolwenn drouet hoguet and three anonymous reviewers for their comments on the manuscript appendix a complete description of the wolf individual based model ibm following the overview design concepts and details protocol odd protocol developed by grimm et al 2006 2010 overview purpose the wolf ibm aims to represent all non spatial dynamics that happen in a wolf population with a focus to detail pack dynamics the change of status between disperser and residents and the replacement of breeding individuals the model also explores lesser known processes of the wolf dynamics namely the pack dissolution following the loss of a breeder the adoption of young dispersing individuals by packs the establishment of new packs using the budding strategy and the breeder replacement these processes are known to happen in wolf populations but were rarely included in models marucco and mcintire 2010 chapron et al 2016 pitt et al 2003 due to the difficulty to parameterize or time them as little details are known on these processes other processes better understood but also often over looked in models were also included avoidance of inbreeding in packs where mating between wolves more related than two cousins is prevented as much as possible density dependent mortality for resident adults when the population is at equilibrium density and movement of wolves in and out of the simulated population with possible immigrations and emigrations entities state variables and scales entities in the model are wolf individuals each wolf has a unique id a sex male or female an age a residence status i e resident belonging to a pack or disperser a pack id if it belongs to a pack a breeding status i e breeding individual or not a mother id a father id and a cohort id i e the year individuals are born in id sex mother id father id and cohort id never change during simulations age is updated each year residence status and pack id change when an individual leaves or joins a pack breeding status changes when an individual becomes a breeder either by replacing a missing one or by forming its own pack or when an individual loses its breeder status after being replaced or after its pack broke apart packs are not considered entities in the model as most of the processes do not act on the whole pack at once except pack dissolution packs are just a characteristic via their id of the wolves the model is non spatial so the environment is not represented and wolves do not have a location temporal scale is a one year time step process overview and scheduling in one year all individuals go through the same series of sub models fig a1 and their state is modified according to the behavioral rules of each sub model and their own characteristics in order these sub models are reproduction aging mortality and change of resident disperser and breeder non breeder status fig a1 the change of the wolves residence and breeding status is represented with several sub models that are pack dissolution replacement of breeding females by subordinates dispersal immigration emigration adoption replacement of breeders by dispersers establishment in pairs establishment by budding establishment alone and replacement of breeding males by subordinates fig a1 the order of the sub models simulating breeder replacement is debated and therefore is explored through different model versions m1 m2 and m3 fig a1 for simplicity the order used to present the model in the odd is the one of m1 fig a1 but we do not state that this model version is more reliable than the other ones in reproduction new individuals pups are produced in aging the age of all individuals is updated in mortality different mortality probabilities affect different individuals based on their age their residence status and the number of existing packs relative to the equilibrium density in pack dissolution some packs dissolve based on the age composition in the pack their number of individuals and of breeders if some packs dissolve the residence status of the individuals is updated to dispersers and they lose their pack id in replacement of breeding females by subordinates female subordinates may replace the missing breeder in a pack and their breeding status is updated in dispersal packs with too many individuals force some individuals to leave the pack with different relative probabilities based on their age these individuals have their residence status updated to dispersers and they lose their pack id in immigration wolves from outside integrate into the population in emigration wolves from the simulated population leave the study area similar to death they are removed from the population in adoption young dispersing individuals may be adopted by small packs these adoptees have their residence status updated to resident and they obtain the pack id of their adopting pack in replacement of breeders by dispersers dispersing individuals may replace missing breeders in packs these individuals have their residence status updated to resident they obtain the pack id they integrate and their breeding status is updated in establishment in pairs two dispersing individuals of the opposite sex establish themselves together to form a new pack these individuals have their residence status updated to resident they obtain a new and unique pack id and their breeding status is updated in establishment by budding a dispersing individual and a subordinate from a pack establish a new pack the former disperser has it residence status updated to resident it obtains a new and unique pack id and its breeding status is updated the former subordinate obtains the same pack id as its new partner and has its breeding status updated in establishment alone dispersers can establish themselves and form a pack alone these individuals have their residence status updated to resident they obtain a new and unique pack id and their breeding status is updated in replacement of breeding males by subordinates male subordinates may replace the missing breeder in the pack so their breeding status is updated at the end of the sub model series the information about the current population i e the current characteristics of each individual is saved and individuals go through the same loop of sub models for as many years as simulated design concepts basic principles the life cycle of the wolf is represented through the reproduction mortality dispersal and establishment of the individuals already defined in published wolf ibms marucco and mcintire 2010 chapron et al 2016 however extensive research in the literature has been done to understand and then include in the ibm all processes known to happen in wolf dynamics additionally to the fundamental processes we included those related to the change of status between residents and dispersers the access to the breeding status the pairing between male and female breeders based on their relatedness and the residence and breeding status the movement of wolves in and out of the population and density dependent processes the model provides new details on the pack dynamics to mimic the gray wolf life cycle as best as possible the model is non spatial but the spatial distribution of individuals is represented through their pack affiliation the life cycle represented in the ibm as well as the parameter values used are more adapted to wolf populations in central europe i e alps than for large north american populations i e canada alaska usa emergence through reproduction and immigration new individuals are added in the population individuals die and are removed from the population through different mortality and emigration processes these changes in the population affect the total number of individuals processes affect wolves depending on their individual characteristics i e age sex residence status breeding status etc and affect the distribution of the individuals in different classes e g number of residents and dispersers number of packs with two breeders in it adaptation wolves live in packs and most of the processes coded in the model depend on the pack structure and the status of the individuals in the pack the presence of zero one of two breeders constrains the potential reproduction pack dissolution and replacement of breeding members the total number of individuals in a pack constrains the pack dissolution dispersal and adoption the total number of established packs in the population also constrains some of the processes like the different probabilities of establishment i e in pairs by budding and alone and one mortality process that have density dependent parameters objectives wolves do not have an ultimate goal they need to fulfill over time individuals follow the behavioral rules of the different sub models and respond to them according to their current characteristics and the current state of the packs learning there is no learning per se in the wolf ibm such as a learning of new skills e g hunting prey taught by parents but as individuals age and status change the possibilities for the individual change for example wolves of age 1 2 and 3 years old can be adopted but not at an older age only mature wolves of age 2 and older can become breeders and establish a new territory pups of 1 year old cannot only mature breeding wolves can reproduce mature subordinates cannot prediction individuals know the current state of the population and individuals current characteristics but they cannot predict any future population or individual state nor any individuals actions sensing wolves in packs have knowledge of all individual characteristics for the other members in their pack packs that can adopt young wolves can sense the presence of young dispersers dispersing individuals have access to the packs and their structure as replacement of missing breeders by dispersers and pairing with a subordinate from a pack is possible for these individuals there is no sensing of the environment as there is no interaction with it interaction wolves are social animals and therefore multiple interactions shape the life cycle of this species reproduction requires two breeding individuals from the same pack to produce pups pack dissolution and dispersal represent a loss of interactions between individuals that were members of a pack and become dispersers due to various factors in the replacement of missing breeders there is a choice among the mature subordinates of the pack or among mature dispersers that may be constrained by the presence of the other breeding wolf during establishment in pairs or by budding a disperser interacts with another disperser or a subordinate in a pack to create a new territory stochasticity stochasticity is included in almost all components of the model the number of pups produced per breeding pair the number of individual dying the maximum number of individual allowed in a pack the number of immigrants arriving in the population and the number of emigrants leaving are generated using probabilities the following processes also occur probabilistically pack dissolution based on the number of breeding members remaining in the pack adoption dispersal according to the individuals age and establishment by budding also a density dependent probability constrains the different types of establishment i e in pairs by budding and alone as well as adult mortality when the population is at equilibrium density the sex of the pups the choice between unrelated individuals to replace missing breeders the choice between young dispersers to be adopted the choice between unrelated individuals to partner with a disperser to establish and the choice of dispersing individuals that emigrate are done randomly in the immigration process as nothing is known about immigrating individuals their sex and age between a minimum and a maximum is randomly assigned collectives wolves belong to packs and their status of resident i e inside a pack or disperser i e not belonging to a pack affects almost all behavioral processes they follow however except for the pack dissolution there is no process affecting the entire pack as all individuals in the pack have different characteristics i e age sex breeding status they usually do not all respond in the same way observation the population is simulated for several years simulation outputs are available after each sub model if needed or at the end of the whole series of sub models at the end of the time step i e at the end of the simulated year the number of alive individuals with all their characteristics is available and many results can be extracted and derived from this population structure e g the number of packs the total abundance the number of residents and dispersers the number of breeders the age distribution etc we focused on outputs relevant for wolf conservation and management and defined six metrics 1 at which year the population reached equilibrium density i e in number of packs with a breeding pair this output represents the speed of the population expansion and is a key element in areas that are being recolonized by the wolf 2 the number of packs with two breeders this metric is linked to the reproductive potential of the population and is of importance for management issues related to population growth 3 the number of new packs formed in one year this represents the pack turnover and the stability of the population that may affect hybridization and wolf human conflicts 4 the total number of individuals 5 the proportion of residents and dispersers in the population population size is often required in management control and knowing the distribution of the resident dispersing status of the individuals may help in understanding the population behavior finally we looked at 6 the relatedness between the two breeders in each pack inbreeding avoidance plays a big part in the wolf life cycle affecting the replacement of missing breeders and the creation of new packs often over looked because it is hard to simulate in non individual based models this factor may indicate missing pieces in the models when not well represented details initialization to launch the ibm an initial wolf population is needed we built a fictive population of 10 packs and 5 dispersing wolves in a fictive environment that can hold 30 packs total i e equilibrium density table a1 we created 5 packs with 2 breeders one male and one female 5 years old each and 2 pups one male and one female 1 year old each 3 packs with 2 breeders one male and one female 5 years old each 1 yearling one male 2 years old and 1 pup one female 1 year old 2 packs with 2 breeders one male and one female 5 years old each and 1 adult one female 3 years old and 5 dispersers 3 females 2 males 2 years old each this simple population was created for convenience but other initial populations can be easily defined by users table a1 lists all parameters and their values used in the model these parameters can also be easily modified by the user however they represent the best data currently available in the literature for gray wolves in europe or elsewhere if not available for europe for lesser known processes which parameters are explored i e pack dissolution adoption establishment by budding all tested values are listed table a1 input data there is no input data in the model the environment is not represented and the initial population is not built using data sub models reproduction every pack with both a breeding male and a breeding female reproduce marucco and mcintire 2010 the number of pups each pair has is drawn from a poisson distribution chapron et al 2016 with a mean of 6 1 sidorovich et al 2007 representing the number of pups that emerge from the female den each pup receives a unique id the sex of each pup is randomly defined as male or female with a 1 1 ratio sidorovich et al 2007 marucco and mcintire 2010 their age is set to 0 as all individuals including these newborn pups will go through the aging sub model next pups are considered residents with the pack id of their parents they are not breeders their mother and father ids are recorded and they obtain a cohort id equal to the current simulated year i e all pups born the same year have the same cohort id aging all individuals age 1 year pups of the year are now 1 year old yearlings are 2 and 3 year olds and older are adults individuals are considered mature at 2 years old i e yearlings and adults mortality there are 7 different mortality rates that take into account age residence status and the total number of packs relative to equilibrium density mortality is applied individually to each wolf using a bernoulli distribution which probability is sampled from a normal distribution at each time step pups have a probability of 0 602 of dying smith et al 2010 the mortality probability for non dispersing yearlings is equal to 0 18 sd 0 04 marucco et al 2009 there are two types of mortality for non dispersing adults that depend on the number of established packs in the population if the number of established packs is below the number of packs at equilibrium density of the area mortality is fixed and equal to that of the yearlings i e 0 18 with sd 0 04 marucco et al 2009 however if the number of established packs is equal to the equilibrium density of the area mortality is density dependent we used the equation linking wolf survival φ with wolf density from cubaynes et al 2014 to estimate the density dependent mortality for non dispersing adults logit φ 1 196 0 505 popdensstd where popdensstd is the wolf density per 1000 km2 standardized with cubaynes mean and standard deviation values mean 53 833 sd 17 984 wolf density is calculated as the total number of wolves without considering the pups divided by the area where the population is estimated as the equilibrium density defined by the user multiplied by the wolf average territory size 104 km2 mancinelli et al 2018 two mortality rates concern dispersing individuals no pups can be dispersers and dispersing yearlings are individuals that dispersed the previous year when they were pups due to a dissolution of their pack but could not find a pack to adopt them during that year otherwise they would be residents we assumed these individuals are too young to survive by themselves and we defined a mortality probability equal to 1 to dispersing yearlings all other dispersing wolves i e adults have a mortality probability equal to 0 31 blanco and cortes 2007 we did not model senescence or any increase of the mortality probability with age to represent a realistic age distribution in the population the limit for wolves was the end of their 15th year of simulation marucco and mcintire 2010 and all individuals reaching 16 years old die packdissolution following the mortality event packs whose social structure has been impacted by the loss of breeders may dissolve brainerd et al 2008 small packs with 1 breeding individual remaining will dissolve with a probability of 0 258 brainerd et al 2008 and small packs with no breeder left dissolve with a probability of 0 846 brainerd et al 2008 the pack size threshold to differentiate small and large packs was explored using the values 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 in the specific case where both breeders died and only pups remain the pack always dissolves as we assumed pups alone are unlikely to maintain a territory and so they disperse when a pack dissolves all former members of the pack become dispersers they do not belong to a pack anymore and former breeding individuals lose their status replacebreedingfembysub when a breeding female dies she is most likely replaced by one of the female subordinates in her pack most likely one of her daughters caniglia et al 2014 jedrzejewski et al 2005 when a pack is missing its breeding female one of the mature females from the pack is randomly chosen to become breeder once the new breeding female is chosen we look at the relatedness between her and the current breeding male if there is any if there is a breeding male in the pack and he is closely related to the chosen female he may be replaced in sub models replacebreederbydisp and replacebreedingmalbysub by a disperser or a less related subordinate from the pack who will usurp the established breeding position mech and boitani 2003 the relatedness threshold chosen is the one of the first cousin r 0 125 a mating pair of breeding wolves can be no more closely related than cousins e g no mating between siblings or parents and children caniglia et al 2014 this relatedness threshold is the same for all sub models dispersal when a pack has too many wolves some are chased away and become dispersers a maximum number of individuals is generated for each pack at each time step using a normal distribution with a mean of 4 405 sd 1 251 marucco and mcintire 2010 if the pack has more wolves than its maximum threshold some individuals will leave the pack until the number of wolves in the pack is equal to its threshold breeding individuals cannot disperse all the other wolves can disperse but with different relative probabilities based on their age pups may disperse with a relative probability of 0 25 yearlings may disperse with a relative probability of 0 5 and adults may disperse with a relative probability of 0 9 haight and mech 1997 wolves leaving the pack become dispersers and do not belong to the pack anymore immigration some wolves outside of the simulated population can arrive and interact with the other wolves a user determined number of immigrants will integrate with the population the sex of the immigrants is randomly assigned i e male or female with a 1 1 ratio their age is simulated using a truncated poisson distribution of mean equal to 2 with boundaries between 1 and 15 as yearlings are the most likely to disperse immigrants are dispersers they do not belong to any pack yet and they are not breeders as they were born outside the simulated population they do not hold information about their mother father or cohort ids immigrant wolves will react the same way i e follow the same sub model rules as the native wolves emigration a proportion of the currently dispersing individuals randomly chosen leaves the simulated population via long distance dispersal these individuals will not come back and their disappearance is similar to simulating their death adoption packs which are not full i e their number of individuals is below their maximum threshold can adopt individuals the probability with which these packs will adopt was explored using the values 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 these packs can adopt individuals until they reach their maximum number of pack members only dispersers of 1 2 and 3 years of age can be adopted by these packs the order in which packs adopt dispersing individuals is random among potential adoptees males are selected first then if there are no more males and packs are still able to adopt females are chosen the choice among the males or among the females is random once young dispersers have been adopted they become residents and belong to the pack that adopted them replacebreederbydisp missing breeders in packs can be replaced by dispersers first we look at the packs missing breeding females mature female dispersers can become breeding females if there is already a breeding male in the pack we exclude the dispersing females that are closely related to the breeding male from the potential successors then a female is randomly chosen among the unrelated ones to integrate into the pack all selected females become residents and breeders of their assigned pack and belong to the pack they joined the order in which packs fill breeding female positions is random next the same process is used to replace missing male breeders with mature male dispersers if there are packs where the missing breeding female was replaced by a subordinate in replacebreedingfembysub during the time step and the current breeding male was too related to her an unrelated mature male disperser may usurp the established male breeder mech and boitani 2003 the breeding males replaced by dispersers are dismissed from their position and become subordinates in their own pack establishpairs a male disperser and a female disperser can establish a new pack together if they are mature and not closely related in addition this is only possible if the number of existing packs is not already equal to equilibrium density if the area is not already full there is a density dependent probability for dispersers to establish in pairs defined by a bernoulli distribution with a probability equal to the number of packs that can be created until reaching equilibrium density divided by the equilibrium density the more packs there are the less likely it is that two dispersers establish themselves in pairs once a male and a female disperser have established a new pack they both become breeders and residents and obtain the same new and unique pack id the order for the choice of males and females among the available mature dispersers is random establishbudding budding is when a disperser and a mature subordinate wolf from an existing pack establish a new pack together like establishment in pairs budding is possible only if the number of packs has not reached equilibrium density the probability for a disperser to bud is the density dependent probability for establishment in pairs multiplied by a probability of budding we explored this last probability and tested values equal to 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 only mature dispersers can bud and only with a non breeding mature resident of the opposite sex that is not closely related once a disperser and a subordinate wolf bud they both become breeders and residents and obtain the same new and unique pack id the order for the choice of males and females among the available mature dispersers and subordinates in packs is random establishalone if the area is not at equilibrium density remaining mature dispersers that could not establish themselves in pairs or by budding can establish themselves alone the probability of this is also density dependent and is the same as the probability of the establishment in pairs once they create their own pack wolves become breeders and residents and obtain a new and unique pack id replacebreedingmalbysub when a breeding male is missing one of the mature male subordinates in the pack can take over if there are several subordinates that are eligible to become successors the male least related to the current breeding female is chosen if there are several subordinate males that are the least related or if there is no breeding female one is selected randomly if the breeding female is too related to the newly chosen breeding male the mature female subordinate who is least related to the new breeding male can usurp the current breeding female and the current breeding female is dismissed i e becomes subordinate if there are several mature female subordinates that are the least related one is selected randomly in the particular case where there was a missing breeding female who was replaced by a subordinate in replacebreedingfembysub during the time step and she was too related to the current breeding male one of the less related male subordinates can take over the male breeding position all of these rules mimic the fact that wolves change partners to avoid inbreeding except when there is no other choice mech and boitani 2003 once new breeding individuals are chosen they will be able to mate the next year appendix b all 81 model scenarios tested by combining the 3 parameterizations of the pack dissolution process table 2 main text with the 3 parameterizations of the adoption process table 2 main

24773,the paper discusses phytoplankton distribution on the west kamchatka shelf of the sea of okhotsk by comparing phytoplankton in spring summer autumn seasons of warm 2015 and cold 2016 mathematical models are used to estimate the phytoplankton abundance in the water column a model with an adaptation function is proposed satellite data on a sea surface are used as initial condition for solving a system of equations in a mathematical model satellite measurements contain chlorophyll a concentration temperature and illumination for the surface water layer depth illumination is calculated by differential equation models tested on the basis of in situ data show an adequate display of the dynamics of integrated biomass depending on external conditions the integrated use of satellites and information in situ makes it possible to estimate the phytoplankton abundance over a large area to compare phytoplankton distributions in warm 2015 and cold 2016 a model with an adaptation function is used the shelf of western kamchatka with its warm and cold year alternations shows the dynamics of the species composition vs the year type species composition changes to make the phytoplankton community be better adapted to changing environmental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mathematical model sea area phytoplankton chlorophyll nutrient illumination temperature depth 1 introduction to date much progress has been made in developing and improving methods for remote sensing of the earth s surface these methods are widely used to obtain information on key indicators of the environmental situation in large geographical areas in particular creating and implementing spectroradiometers with which near earth satellites are equipped allows us to visualize and evaluate the distribution of chlorophyll on the surface of the world s oceans some information was obtained while making in situ measurements the use of mathematical models to analyze and supplement experimental information is very instrumental in providing us with new knowledge regarding natural ecological systems we explore the regional marine ecosystem whose phytoplankton is responsible for its functioning our goal is to assess phytoplankton with remote sensing and in situ measurements we would like to restore the distribution of phytoplankton only the upper layer is available for satellite processing which is a significant limitation for the use of remote sensing methods the satellite sees the distribution of chlorophyll temperature and illumination on the water surface in the sea a satellite sensor can receive data in a large geographic area on site measurements provide separate data in time and space we d like to reconstruct the distribution of phytoplankton in the water column using mathematical simulation part of the biomass which is concentrated in the subsurface layer and below can significantly change the spatial distribution of the total biomass the use of remote sensing data was required for the practical application of mathematical methods when making estimates and forecasts for bioresources to date there are quite a few appropriate methods to be comprehensively applied e g satellite information contact data simulation etc uitz et al 2006 sammartino et al 2018 given the contact method of data collection is at hand statistical analysis techniques are very likely to be used to overcome the discontinuity which is inevitable when obtaining expeditionary information in j uitz et al 2006 these methods are used to rank phytoplankton organisms also to size them up for the modern chromatography methods to be applied by combining the latter with satellite data on the color of the ocean it becomes possible to quantify the part of the biomass that is concentrated under the surface layer in addition to the traditionally used statistical methods the application of an artificial neural network see m sammartino et al 2018 has been proposed in this case numerous results of sample analysis are used to train and test the network and remote data are applied as input parameters mathematical modelling of phytoplankton functioning has a long history and quite a few areas of research many studies have shown the vertical distributions of phytoplankton to be largely determined by the dynamics of the seasonal thermocline carter et al 1987 v a luchin and kruz 2016 some researchers used different versions of the advection reaction diffusion model to map these scenarios klausmeier and litchman 2001 ryabov et al 2010 abakumov et al 2015 while the others put together the basic model with a description of metabolic processes kiefer and kremer 1981 or with interspecies competition models silkin et al 2016 traditionally identified among the factors affecting the parameters of phytoplankton functioning are mineral nutrition water temperature and illumination occasionally a model system may consider only a few of these factors an impact of a particular environmental aspect can be described by an equation in a model system or by an external function dynamic models of phytoplankton functioning in a vertical volume of water are based on delineating biomass changes into growth and elimination processes a detailed analysis of the depth distribution of the concentration of the plant microorganisms may additionally include a description of their passive and active movements our research area is located in the western part of the sea of okhotsk and adjoins the kamchatka peninsula this area of 37 thousand km2 is part of the sea from 51 n to 59 n and from 150 e to 160 e fig 1 the problem of phytoplankton distribution in this area is investigated when solving this problem of restoring the integral mass of phytoplankton in the water column a model system of equations is constructed satellite information is used as input data this strategy is considered to be extremely promising by the authors the areas of the water surface observed from the satellite should receive a new focus with a full coverage we applied mathematical simulation to the satellite data available for the west kamchatka shelf in the sea of okhotsk and obtained information on the state of phytoplankton the latter being crucial for understanding the state and functioning of the entire marine ecosystem of the region 2 data and methods 2 1 vertical biomass model our goal is to estimate the amount of phytoplankton by its depth distribution the depth distribution is described by the model without taking into account hydrophysical effects in fast hydrophysical processes slower biological ones are almost lost we simulate the phytoplankton functioning in a vertical motionless water column in fact the aquatic environment changes over time nevertheless this method is justified because environmental changes occur at fast times in contrast to any tangible update of indicators that characterize a biological process per se therefore to describe the phytoplankton functioning and distortions of the vertical water column in one model is extremely difficult and can be ineffective in this case our assumption of a motionless column of water is fully justified we have followed a strategy of aggregating some processes such as mixing and recycling the corresponding coefficients are accounted for in the coefficients of growth removal from the system and passive movement as mentioned above most dynamic models simulating changes in biomass over time klausmeier and litchman 2001 include the growth rate of the specific concentration of plant organisms the elimination coefficient and some movement the basic model for the dynamics of the biomass density of phytoplankton p in a vertical water column has the following forms see ryabov et al 2010 1 p t k 2 p z 2 μ c i t p e p p c t k 2 c z 2 γ μ c i t p β γ e p p i z α p c i the volume density distribution

model consider the change in the biological components of the phytoplankton biogen light system with depth in a stationary mode we can go to the stationary version of model 1 in this case there s no

not enough the system solution requires information on the amount of biogens or chlorophill at the bottom or at the lower boundary of the photic layer z zm moreover the boundary value problem for nonlinear system 3 does not always have a solution on the whole the use of system 3 is cumbersome and inefficient to solve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations will require to form boundary conditions which can be provided by remote sensing data on the values of surface chlorophyll concentration and irradiance adding conditions for no exchange with the atmosphere forms the following two left boundary conditions but the system crosslinking requires information on the amount of biogens or chlorophill at the bottom or at least at the lower boundary of the photic layer these data collection is generally difficult due to the lack of a stable contact monitoring system therefore the practical implementation of system 3 seems problematic besides the solution of a boundary value problem with a nonlinear right hand side per se is fraught with certain theoretical and computational difficulties 2 3 model within the adaptation function an alternative interpretation of system 3 should be based on the concept of the adaptation function poluektov et al 1980 frisman and zhdanova 2009 adaptability issues are explored in models for phytoplankton in the ecosystem beckmann et al 2019 and for communities sekerci 2020 the main assumptions of the model for the reproduction process to occur in a fixed water column are in place the growth process of phytoplankton is interpreted as its desire to occupy the ecological niche most suitable for functioning and reproduction peck and waxman 2018 in this case the community of phytoplankton organisms is considered as a population and the adaptation function of the community coincides with μ c i t then model 3 can be represented as follows 4 d p d z v d μ d z p d c d z w f p c d i d z α p c i where ν is the maximum possible rate of community growth the f p function is based on the hypothesis of the inverse effect of phytoplankton on the density of mineral nutrition sunda 2012 which generally speaking does not always comply with interactions established in the ecosystem verification of model 4 as well as its subsequent implementation largely depends on the data available for research given the in situ measurements of certain components of the system are in place some model equations could be possibly replaced by external functions abakumov et al 2019 their type and degree of compliance with real biological mechanisms depends on the quality and quantity of information that the specified functions display as well as on the chosen approximation method 2 4 data description in situ data we had quite representative in situ material of the okhotsk sea area near the west kamchatka shelf fig 1 the studies included 75 bottom trawls and complimentary hydrological and ichthyoplankton stations comprehensive environmental studies were carried out at 28 of the 75 stations direct sampling at the west kamchatka license area took place from june 21 to july 4 2015 we measured nutrients at 4 levels for each station on the surface at a depth of 20 m 50 m and at the bottom as a result the in situ determination of the amounts of nitrites nitrates and ammonium substances was presented in the newsletter 2015 table 1 shows the total concentrations of inorganic forms in nitrogen compounds that limit the reproduction of marine phytoplankton collos and berges 2002 ovchinnikova et al 2012 moschonas et al 2017 in those places where the data were not available small values of the order of 1 0e 5 g m3 were used in the calculations missing values may indicate that the relevant substances either were not detected or the sample analysis was performed correctly the study also included defining chlorophyll a used by organisms for primary production measurements were made in the surface layer at a horizon of 20 m and in the lower layer the measurement results are shown in fig 2 with isolines in addition to analyzing the biochemical composition of water samples in the area environmental monitoring was also performed it included determining the water temperature at the indicated horizons water temperature distribution on the surface at a depth of 20 m and at the bottom is shown in fig 3 remote data remote sensing data from may to october 2015 2016 are used to estimate the integral biomass of phytoplankton the observation period is limited because in the remaining months the sea of okhotsk is completely or partially under ice cover which significantly reduces the information content of satellite imagery a uniform grid with a kilometer resolution was applied to the designated area denote it by s1 in each node remote data is recorded for three indicators chlorophyll a water temperature and par values in the surface water layer this grid has about 84 000 points remote information for each day includes two or three surveys of a selected area according to the number of overflights of a satellite equipped with a spectroradiometer the monthly average indicators of the integral volume of chlorophyll for two years are calculated sequentially by averaging data at the same points in the geographical grid by days and then by months the distribution of one of the three indicators the monthly average surface temperatures based on remote data is shown in fig 4 then the information is converted into numerical arrays using the computer program glance by m morozov and e fomin 2004 this visualization tool was developed by the center for multifunctional satellite environmental monitoring by the institute of automation and control processes the far eastern branch russian academy of sciences iacp feb ras vladivostok cloudiness is very typical of the atmospheric regime off the coast of kamchatka to get the results of observations cloudless days were allocated in each month data collection and conversion is carried out by the satellite monitoring center before calculations satellite data and in situ observations are statistically checked for validity provided that all data have a lognormal distribution due to non negative values the interval estimate is constructed with a confidence probability of 0 95 only data that falls within this confidence interval is considered a very small amount of invalid data was found about 120 records for the entire data volume 1 32 107 measurements for each of the three indicators to numerically solve the described models it is necessary to compare the geographical depth of each node of the grid plot topographic material was used to prepare the relevant data bitmap of the depth map with a known scale hirt and rexer 2015 was converted into a vector view vectorised by using the vextractor package http www vextrasoft com after that depth isolines were manually selected and marked with simultaneous editing and correction of defects that inevitably occur in the process of automatic vectorization the constructed isolines were saved in a text format suitable for import into the surfer program and then converted into a regular grid by using the surfer 14 program golden software http www goldensoftware com along with a linear interpolation triangulation method the grid nodes were set in such a way as to combine the depth values with the coordinates of the points at which the remote sensing data on the concentration of chlorophyll surface water temperature and illumination of the upper layer were obtained the digitisation and conversion of the topographic information was implemented by the computer graphics laboratory of the iacp feb ras 3 calculations the depth temperature distribution function is compiled in accordance with the results described by v luchin and a cruz v a 2016 the authors provide material demonstrating the dynamics of the thermocline in the sea of okhotsk from june to november i e during the season when the western coast of kamchatka is completely ice free fig 5 shows the average long term profiles of vertical gradients of water temperature in the selected region the upper boundary of the thermocline in the summer months coincides with the sea surface and in the other months ranges from 10 meter to 15 meter depth the lower boundary is more constant in the summer period until september it falls on a 40 meter horizon and in november it deepens to 50 m the surface temperature value at depth and also the temperature jump in the thermocline zone were set by a function of the following form 5 t z t 0 0 z z 1 t ϕ z z 1 z 2 t 0 t b z 1 t z z 2 t t b z 2 t z z m where ϕ z z 1 z 2 t 0 t b t 0 t b t 0 z z 1 z 2 z 1 for each month t 0 is the temperature at the sea surface recorded by the satellite z 1 and z 2 are the upper and lower boundaries of the thermocline and tb is the temperature at the bottom or at the lower boundary of the photic layer if the 200 m mark is exceeded z z m the thickness of the photic layer is defined by the depth at which the intensity of the penetrating light should be at least 1 of the incident par bigg 2003 in this region it reaches 200 m based on preliminary calculations the temperature in these horizons ranges from 2 to 2 c dobrovolsky and zalogin 1982 khen et al 2002 therefore tb is considered to be a random variable that is evenly distributed over a given interval the purpose of numerical calculations based on the use of satellite information is to compare the values of the integrated mass of phytoplankton obtained in warm and cold years in this we follow the conclusions presented by v kolomeytsev 2016 by identifying certain climate criteria such as ice cover winter surface water temperatures and some others these criteria classify annual periods as warm or cold while winter hydrological conditions are analyzed for the entire sea of okhotsk and the coast of western kamchatka the period since 1972 is included in the review we focused on the last 20 years when 2015 was declared abnormally warm throughout the entire observation period it had an absolute minimum of iciness the 2016 that followed was characterized as the coldest fig 6 shows a graphic illustration of the study conducted by the authors 3 1 trial calculations for the stationary model model 1 is the base model and model 3 is based on it the first series of calculations was performed according to model 3 estimating the total volume of chlorophyll mass in the entire photic layer of water is reduced to solving the boundary problem at each node of the grid s1 in which satellite data on chlorophyll concentration temperature and illumination are recorded the calculation was carried out according to the system of equations 3 with the following boundary conditions p 0 p 0 satellite chlorophill concentration value on the water surface c 0 c 0 surface value of biogen concentration table 1 c z l c l biogen concentration at the depth zl table 1 for z l ϵ 0 20 50 z m p z z 0 0 derivative condition indicates no exchange with atmosphere i 0 i 0 satellite irradiance on the water surface for each node the nearest stations with known biogenic samples were identified the values that were used as boundary conditions were defined as the distance weighted average of mineral concentrations at these stations the task was supposed to be solved sequentially for three layers 1 from 0 to 20 m 2 from 20 m to 50 m 3 from 50 m to the bottom below 20 m instead of satellite data the condition of smoothness of the chlorophill distribution at the layer boundary was used as the left boundary condition obviously at points where the depth did not exceed the indicated horizons the decision was reduced to one or two stages of calculation values for trial calculations in model 3 are borrowed from the article abakumov et al 2015 fig 7 shows the areas that were selected to reconstruct vertical profiles to a 20 meter horizon using model 3 fig 8 demonstrates the reconstructed chlorophyll profiles for each zone for 6 months in 2015 and 2016 respectively chlorophyll distributions are illustrated at points within each zone where the solution of the boundary value problem is characterized by rapid convergence in the coastal zone the depth at some points does not reach 20 m the quality of the solution arrived at was checked on the basis of in situ data borrowed from the newsletter 2015 the chlorophyll values at the sea surface and at depth of 20 m obtained by analyzing water samples in june july 2015 were compared with solutions to the boundary value problem as fig 2 demonstrates overestimated values of the surface concentration of chlorophyll are observed for the deep sea zone in june and values at a depth of 20 m are close to measurements in situ and in july on the contrary the surface concentrations recorded from the satellite practically correspond to in situ measurements while the calculated values on the 20 meter horizon are underestimated this indicates a poor accuracy of the estimates obtained using model 3 for the deep sea zone for the coastal zone the values obtained during the solution of the boundary problem are in good agreement with in situ measurements thus the model demonstrates its suitability for estimating the integral mass of chlorophyll at individual coastal points nevertheless solving the problem through model 3 was not quite effective solution for all three layers does not exist at all points to find it requires additional regularization these factors make it difficult to automatically implement the mathematical model 3 in all observation nodes however the model can be used to calculate the vertical profiles of the pigment at local points especially in shallow water 3 2 calculation within the adaptation model turning to the cauchy problem we get rid of the problems associated with poor convergence of the solution at individual points moreover the presence of in situ biogens measurements table 1 allows to replace the second equation of model 4 with an external function four measurements at one spatial point allow the distribution of nutrients to be approximated by using a cubic spline thus the second equation in system 4 is removed we return to the first equation of system 4 according to the proposed hypothesis on the applicability of the concept of the adaption function to model 3 the specific biomass of phytoplankton at the k th horizon depends on its value at the k 1 level in the case when the dynamics of mineral nutrition is modelled by the second ratio of system 4 such a strategy is justified the growth of phytoplankton leads to increased consumption of biogens and reduces their concentration however due to the inverse effect nutritional deficiency inhibits the development of biomass and consequently the complete depletion of the mineral substances when replacing the second equation with an external depth distribution function of nutrients the inverse effect is lost therefore the surface concentration p 0 is the initial concentration abundance of phytoplankton which is affected by the adaption coefficient thus the type of model used to calculate the integral biomass of phytoplankton in the region of western kamchatka is shown as follows 7 d p d z d μ d z e p p d i d z α p c i this model is a system of ordinary differential equations the derivative d μ d z is calculated from formulas 2 d μ d z μ c d c d z μ i d i d z μ t d t d z with help formulas after formula 2 see item 2 1 for this system we can solve the cauchy problem with given initial conditions the satellite data on the surface values of chlorophyll water temperature and par are used as initial data 3 3 estimating the model parameters model 7 has several parameters we should select the main parameters based on experimental data these parameters are μ 0 c 0 i 0 topt t 1 α 0 α 1 and α 2 in this case the values of these parameters should be verified using the chlorophyll concentrations data at three points on the sea surface at the depth of 20 m and at the bottom in june july 2015 fig 2 each image is converted to a regular grid s2 in accordance with the algorithm for digitizing the depth map the grid is constructed to have its nodes as close as possible to those of grid s1 which contains information on satellite data s2 grid does not exactly coincide with s1 grid therefore each grid s1 node has its chlorophyll calculated as the weighted average of chlorophyll concentrations at the closest grid s2 nodes the weight corresponds to the distance between the grid node s1 and the neighbouring grid node s2 the procedure was performed sequentially for each horizon the grid is set with a resolution of about one kilometer taking into account the error corresponding to the curvature of the earth s surface along the meridian the temperature function constructed for 5 was specified for the period june july 2015 in accordance with in situ measurements fig 3 the isolines shown in fig 3 were converted into a similar grid s2 a vertical temperature was plotted at each node s2 with due note of occurring a thermocline satellite temperature and its values at a 20 meter and near bottom horizons at each grid s1 node we calculated the temperature as the weighted average of temperature at the closest grid s2 nodes parameters are selected on the condition of minimizing the following function 8 φ ρ θ j p z j ρ γ p j ρ 2 where p j ρ is the value of the specific concentration of phytoplankton at the point ρ on the horizon zj zj 0 20 zm zm is the bottom or photic layer depth at the current point ρ ai bi runs through the set of all nodes of the grid s1 satellite data in which ai and bi are the geographical coordinates of the current node and θ is the vector of certain parameters μ 0 c 0 i 0 topt τ α 0 α 1 and α 2 the e p is neglected assuming that its influence is accounted for in the μ 0 value to optimise the discrepancy over the entire area under observation we can construct a function with the following form 9 ψ θ ρ s 1 φ ρ θ d ρ the summation is performed over all the nodes of s1 grid in which the data on the state of the surface water layer by remote monitoring methods can be correctly recorded to verify the parameters of model 7 any non gradient method of finding the minimum of the objective function can be used in this case the nelder and mead search method for the deformable polyhedron himmelblau 1972 was chosen the vector of values used in previous studies to construct estimates of the integrated biomass of phytoplankton from satellite data in the sea of japan pak and abakumov 2019 was taken as an initial approximation when minimizing function 9 in all parameters we could not find a global minimum on the set of positive solutions therefore the search is performed using three main parameters namely μ 0 i 0 and topt the remaining parameters are postulated on the basis of preliminary calculations and partially borrowed from the literature tanaka and mano 2012 abakumov et al 2019 the parameter values obtained as a result of verification are shown in table 2 the values representing the minimum of function 9 on the set of parameters μ 0 i 0 and topt are highlighted in bold style and the postulated values selected on the basis of previous studies are indicated in italics the maximum growth rate is very small μ 0 0 32 this was due to the fact that the process of biomass growth takes into account the process of elimination to verify the adequacy of the parameter values obtained during verification we compared the chlorophyll values on known horizons fig 2 with the those obtained during the solution of model 7 data were compared for june july 2015 i e for the period of expeditionary measurements the comparison showed that for the deep sea zone almost 86 of the observed points exceeded the values of satellite data with respect to in situ measurements the satellite aided values range from 0 4 to 1 8 mg m3 while water samples show a chlorophyll concentration of about 0 2 mg m3 sometimes up to 0 5 mg m3 at a depth of 20 m the pattern changes the estimated concentration ranges from 0 02 mg m3 to 2 5 mg m3 and the samples show a spread from 0 mg m3 to 2 mg m3 over a larger area with a local flash of concentration up to 14 mg m3 thus for a 20 meter horizon the order of values is close in the coastal zone remote data are close to water samples from 0 5 mg m3 to 2 5 mg m3 with local satellite data emissions up to 5 7 mg m3 obviously this is due to the lower cloudiness of the coast compared to the open sea at a depth of 20 m predominantly reduced estimates of chlorophyll concentrations are observed from 0 01 mg m3 to 1 9 2 8 mg m3 taken together there are mutually balancing differences between the calculated and observed values of the concentration of chlorophyll 4 results thus by solving system 7 with a given external function 5 and function с defined by the cubic spline the distribution of the biomass of phytoplankton pi at all horizons down to the bottom can be obtained at points where the depth exceeds 200 m the calculations should be limited to the thickness of the photic layer at which phytoplankton reproduces at lower horizons the reproduction process is dying away due to the lack of illumination needed to start photosynthesis as in 2015 2016 the problem is solved for each half year period from may to october on the basis of the monthly average characteristics of the surface layer obtained by remote sensing the difference in the conditions of the numerical experiments applies only to the initial data the variation in monthly average temperatures over the same biennia is obviously related to the severity of winters in the corresponding years in v a luchin and kruz 2016 one of the main characteristics of the sea water structure the so called okhotsk water mass is described in detail its core is a cold subsurface layer knowledge of its characteristics core depth temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen is important for fishing purposes and predicting the state of sea water this water mass is formed as a result of autumn winter cooling of the sea surface and vertical mixing in the active water layer in the warm season an upper slightly warmed up and desalinated water layer forms above it as well as a layer of maximum seasonal gradients of temperature and salinity the formed density stratification at the boundary between the upper quasi homogeneous layer and the subsurface cold layer contributes to the preservation of the okhotsk sea water mass until a new stage of autumn winter convection for surface concentrations of chlorophyll the differences can be due to both a decrease in the rate of reproduction and the motion response of phytoplankton to climate change i e the localisation of its main biomass at depths where the temperature regime is most favourable for many species in this case the recorded chlorophyll concentration can be reduced since the subsurface layers are inaccessible to the satellite signal there are no significant differences in the average par indicators for 2015 2016 fig 9 demonstrates the results of calculating the integral mass of chlorophyll in the entire vertical volume with due account of the bottom topography and the thickness of the photic layer a visual analysis of the solutions obtained for model 7 shows that in the warm 2015 luchin and cruz 2016 the average monthly volumes of the integral mass of chlorophyll are generally small compared to similar indicators recorded in the cold 2016 consequently cold loving psychrophilic species could be assumed to predominate in this area they breed at temperatures below 15 20 c with negative range scherer and neuhaus 2006 moyer et al 2017 the optimal temperature for these species is low from 0 c to 4 c it should be emphasized that this conclusion is formulated only on the basis of calculations performed in accordance with model 7 and satellite information on the state of the surface water layer as initial data similar calculations were made in units of biomass such a transition is considered to be expedient when restoring the vertical profiles of phytoplankton given the fact that the proportion of chlorophyll in phytoplankton is a random variable which is evenly distributed over a limited range of values vörös and padisák 1991 stoń et al 2002 sidelev and babanazarova 2008 descy et al 2009 we can move from the chlorophyll concentration to that of phytoplankton at the corresponding horizons in this study vertical biomass profiles were reconstructed at different points in the region under observation fig 10 the points at which the vertical biomass profiles were analyzed were selected from the total array 84 000 so that the distributions in them were typical of the nearby area green thus a large part of the observed area is included in the analysis three points are located in the deep sea and two points are placed in the coastal zone the graphic vertical profiles of the biomass at the points of the coastal zone are shown in fig 11 the coastal zones are shallow for almost the entire period biomass prevails in 2015 exceptions are observed in zone 5 the differences are apparently due to the fact that zone 5 is located closer to the open part of the sea of okhotsk and zone 3 is located to shelikhov bay with a different hydrological regime described in the pices special publication 2010 the deep water zone is represented by a wide variety of vertical biomass contours an important role in this is played not only by the passage of horizontal currents but also by the topography of the bottom which affects the mixing of water layers and the seasonal thermocline movement the vertical profiles reconstructed at the points of the deep sea zone are presented in fig 12 the peculiar properties of phytoplankton vertical profiles in warm 2015 contra cold 2016 could be connected with species specific phytoplankton distribution in the western kamchatka shelf these themes are discussed in next section 5 discussion 5 1 spatial distribution of integrated specific biomass when analyzing the calculations we assume that the amount of phytoplankton biomass can be judged by the distribution of chlorophyll elizarova 1993 stoń et al 2002 the main result of the calculations presented in fig 9 suggests that in the cold 2016 the reproduction of phytoplankton reaches higher volumes than in 2015 the rate of reproduction is known to depend on nutrition temperature and illumination platt et al 2005 analysis of arrays containing par values revealed the absence of significant differences between 2015 and 2016 biogens as evidenced by the data presented in table 1 differ in low concentrations and relative constancy due to the absence of strong currents off the western coast of the kamchatka peninsula according to sverdrup 1955 the areas with divergence passing near the powerful currents are most saturated with mineral nutrition the temperature impact on the phytoplankton growth is regulatory but it is significant satellite data arrays with surface temperatures showed statistically significant differences between 2015 and 2016 the spatial temperature distribution is shown in fig 4 thus the total biomass growth in the cold year 2016 can be explained by the fact that the phytoplankton community as a whole prefers low temperatures since the structure of model 7 does not include the community species analysis we turned to a qualitative review of phytoplankton species identified during environmental monitoring we examined the biological characteristics of the main species and their type variety in a given area the species structure of the phytoplankton community identified during the work is described in the newsletter 2015 see appendix as noted the main contribution to the formation of phytoplankton abundance was made by diatoms most of which are cold loving mock and junge 2007 the second place belonged to dinophytes the species structure of the phytoplankton community which was identified during the work described in the newsletter shows that the composition of diatom biomass 70 5 mg m3 in total is formed by such species as chaetoceros pseudocrinitus 15 8 mg m3 chaetoceros compressus 13 4 mg m3 chaetoceros mitra 13 4 mg m3 and chaetoceros further this genus will be denoted by c decipiens 6 1 mg m3 the portion of the remaining species about 36 taxa of this group of microalgae is substantially low vs the above ones chaetoceros is thoroughly described in the reference orlova et al 2003 shevchenko and orlova 2003 the literature particularly emphasises the bio indicator role the microalgae play with respect to the water masses of various origin according to flora inventory species accounting of the far eastern seas cited by the authors shevchenko and orlova 2003 three of the four leading species and biomass species of chaetoceros i e chaetoceros pseudocrinitus chaetoceros compressus chaetoceros decipiens are part of this cold water complex chaetoceros compressus is also present in the warm water complex which is explained by its wide range of tolerance the preference for low to negative temperatures by c pseudocrinitus is also confirmed by its description in konovalova et al 1989 who argue the species to be one of the dominant diatoms causing winter subglacial flowering of the phytoplankton at temperatures from 0 2 c to 1 8 c a description of the fourth most abundant species chaetoceros mitra is also presented here in the far eastern seas c mitra is characterised by the subglacial flowering c decipiens in accordance with the description given in the work konovalova et al 1989 actively reproduces at slightly higher temperatures 1 5 c 8 c according to gail 1963 gladyshev et al 2018 c decipiens is assigned to cold water oceanic forms the specific biomass of c decipiens is low in volume vs the other main types of diatoms thus indicating the average water temperature to be close to the lower boundary of the tolerance interval of this species the prevalence of species of the genus chaetoceros in the average long term dynamics of taxonomic composition off the west coast of kamchatka is confirmed by the results presented in lepskaya et al 2009 lepskaya 2015 in particular as was previously noted c furcellatus was dominant in the summer and its high amount was also recorded in the surface temperature jump and bottom layer this species is traditionally assigned to the northern cold loving forms russ 1959 hop et al 2002 whose development occurs as certain observations show at temperatures ranging from 1 35 c to 9 c with a maximal growth rate ranging from 0 5 c to 5 c raymont 1980 huseby et al 2013 among the diatoms not belonging to the genus chaetoceros the species coscinodiscus oculus iridi stands out by its abundance in biomass which is also classified according to gail 1963 as cold water forms the next present species is paralia sulcate which is abundant in terms of biomass and number of cells in the literature hobson and mcquoid 1997 zong 1997 gebühr et al 2009 the optimum temperature for its reproduction is 7 c 1 c regarding cell numbers sceletonema costatum is also predominant whose temperature optimum from 16 c to 26 c was described in werner 1977 with a minimal lower boundary of 6 c an indirect confirmation that the species specific features of sceletonema costatum are not fully adapted to the temperature conditions of the observed area is provided by the fact that the values of the specific biomass of the species based on the data in the information bulletin 2015 are almost zero the second group of species forming the phytoplankton biomass in the observed area is represented by dinoflagellates as the bulletin data presented in 2015 the largest although not much superior to other species contribution to the proportion of dinophytic biomass is made by dinophysidia such as dinophysis acuminata dinophysis acuta dinophysis norvegica and others a detailed description of the genus can be found in the literature konovalova 2004 the results of the study undertaken show that the discovered species of peridinium are characteristic only of the cold seas and estuaries the temperature at which their active reproduction occurs ranges from 10 c to 12 c two more relatively numerous species of protoperidinium pallidum and protoperidinium pellucidum are described as common in cold temperate and warm seas respectively among the rare organisms the optional living in unstable cold conditions psychrophile psychrobacter okhotskensis could be observed as yumoto et al 2003 reported p okhotskensis is isolated from the plant community of the coastal part of the sea of okhotsk the halophilic facultative psychrophilic bacteria psychromonas marina sp nov is also found in kawasaki et al 2002 in 2015 the biological situation showed the diatom species to almost twice exceed the dinophytes one given the analysis of the dominant species the phytoplankton community as a whole can be stated to have low temperature preferences this conclusion fits the calculated seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass fig 9 shows that its largest mass is observed in may june and september october this vegetation regime provides a maximal production in the spring and autumn periods as avramenko et al 2015 described for diatoms in temperate latitudes the largest surge in biomass was observed in june 2016 which had the coldest winter after 2000 v v kolomeitsev 2016 following the may and june upsurges especially in 2016 a significant decrease in biomass was observed in july and august in september and october a slight increase was observed in the total biomass against the two previous months a monthly comparison of biomass volumes in 2015 and 2016 at first glance has revealed various contradictions with the predominance of the cold water diatoms in the taxonomy of the area under observation in particular the volume of biomass in july 2016 is low compared to that in july 2015 this result contradicts the assumption of a cold loving composition of the plant community indeed in the cold year 2016 the volume of reproduction should have increased kolomeitsev 2016 a detailed look at the dynamics of the species structure of phytoplankton has eliminated the apparent discrepancy the study mentioned above avramenko et al 2015 notes that during the cooling period the vegetation period of diatoms goes up considerably which makes the latter move to a leading position in the algological community this result most likely explains the significant increase in biomass in june 2016 and not in may with a certain time lag apparently at this time structural changes in the microalgae composition occur thus after a cold winter diatoms significantly increase their representation in the community as shown by the studies in situ described in the report 2017 the observation period has shown that phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms thereby accounting for more than 99 of the number and biomass of planktonic microalgae in 2015 as mentioned above the proportion of diatoms exceeded the proportion of dinophytes only twice a spatial analysis of the average temperatures in the area of the west kamchatka shelf also illustrates that the high temperature region in 2016 is larger than that in 2015 fig 3 the temperature exceeds the limit that is optimal for leading species the biomass in july 2015 has exceeded that in july 2016 due to structural differences and a more favourable temperature when analysing the distribution of biomass in the following months both the algal flora composition and the variation in average temperatures should be considered in august 2016 a weak predominance of the total biomass volume is observed this result is facilitated by a lower temperature background than that in 2015 this predominance is small in 2015 diatoms do not reproduce very actively due to relatively high temperatures but dinophytes occupy a large ecological niche compared to 2016 for them the temperature in 2015 is favourable they compensate for diatoms activity decline in the warm year a qualitatively similar situation has occurred in september in 2015 the temperature has decreased vs august indicators and the values of biomass have slightly gone up obviously the increase in biomass came at the expense of cold loving diatoms occupying a large though not all proportion in the community the distribution of low temperature regions is not correlated with the regions of increased biomass density this result indicates that in 2015 phytoplankton included both cold loving and heat loving species fig 9 september left in 2016 a correlation between areas of low temperatures and areas of high biomass density is observed the kamchatka coastal zone that is marked by high temperatures is characterized by the total biomass index of less than 100 mg m2 whereas the northern open part of the plot has a region of low temperature which almost coincides with the surge in specific biomass produced by predominantly cold loving species in 2016 this information can be found in report 2017 biomass in october 2015 has a slight advantage over 2016 a close examination of average temperature distribution has confirmed the hypothesis about the effect of cooling on the algological structure of the phytoplankton community fig 9 october demonstrates that in 2015 the highest biomass concentration coincides with the region where the temperature ranges from 4 c to 7 c regions with high background temperature are also characterised by the biomass presence though to a lower extent the region of low temperatures section from 58 50 n to 59 n and from 155 e to 156 e manifests almost zero signs of phytoplankton presence in 2016 more or less significant biomass concentrations are observed in areas where the temperature also ranges from 4 c to 7 c from 55 46 n to 58 46 n and from 154 26 e to 156 26 e the densities close to zero are recorded in areas with a temperature exceeding the threshold of 7 c coastal zone or in areas with almost negative temperatures from 54 51 n to 55 51 n thus the biological explanation of the calculations based on satellite information shows that due to winter cooling in 2016 the structure of the phytoplankton community changes in favour of the diatom group of microalgae the model distribution of phytoplankton is compared with a map of average temperatures recorded by a satellite spectroradiometer the largest burst of integral biomass fits the areas where the temperature fluctuates between 4 c and 7 c on the basis of the calculations preliminary assumptions regarding the species composition of the microalgae community can be made the species most active in breeding have an optimal temperature range from 4 c to 7 c the optimal temperature values obtained coincide with the taxonomic description of several species characteristics in this region in particular c decipiens orlova et al 2003 and c furcellatus lepskaya et al 2009 preferred the indicated temperatures and formed the basis for the dominant complex in 2016 this information can be found in report 2017 5 2 vertical distribution the distribution of species in the area under study can be investigated by restoring the vertical biomass profiles at various points marked in fig 10 it should be noted that when constructing vertical profiles it is the specific biomass of phytoplankton that is taken into account not the chlorophyll mass in contrast to the previous numerical experiment coastal zone first we considered the vertical biomass profiles formed during the numerical solution of the model 7 at points 3 and 5 fig 11 shows that generally speaking biomass is predominant in the coastal zone in 2015 with an exception for point 5 in august and october 2016 for point 3 the situation has remained almost unchanged throughout the growing season from may to october the phytoplankton reproduction volumes in 2016 are consistently low against those in 2015 whereas the absolute values in 2016 are close to invariant with the vertical averaged biomass concentration of 0 035 g m3 according to the newsletter 2015 the overwhelming majority of cold water taxa are concentrated in the jump layer with its active mixing of the water layers the rapid influx of nutrients and high temperature gradients provide a favourable environment for the growth of phytoplankton biomass in the thermocline zone in the coastal zone a thermocline is not formed due to the shallow depth of the bottom for the same reason the heating of the entire water volume occurs relatively quickly therefore heat loving species are localised in the coastal zone and the share of heat loving forms in the algological composition is greater in 2015 than that in 2016 the total volume of biomass at point 3 is larger in 2015 than that in 2016 the changes in the main taxa composition most likely play a decisive role as fig 4 satellite temperature shows the temperatures at the selected point during the observed periods of two years are approximately the same so temperature contributes but indirectly in changing the volume of reproduction from year to year the cold water forms in this zone are also insignificant because the main taxa remain quasi constant at different temperatures in 2016 a more interesting dynamics of specific biomass is observed at point 5 in this case a situation similar to the previous zone is in place but in august and october the average biomass concentration formed in 2016 is higher than that in 2015 situation is explained by comparing monthly average temperatures if at point 3 they were quite close in 2015 and 2016 then at point 5 there is a clear predominance of the average august temperatures in 2016 compared to those in 2015 by contrast the indicators in october 2016 are low as already mentioned the coastal zone is characterized by the prevalence of heat loving species the temperature of august 2016 favoured those heat loving taxa and they were responsible for the main surge of biomass at that period the coastal zone is the habitat of thermophilic species but their share in 2016 went down the partial substitution of thermophilic species by cold water species explains a slight increase in the reproductive activity of phytoplankton in october at point 5 in 2016 a significant cooling was observed it formed favourable conditions for the development of those species that have replaced a certain part of heat loving ones the situation allows for various assumptions to be made regarding the species composition at a given observation point when comparing the monthly vertical biomass profiles with the temperature map we could expect in the composition of the phytoplankton community localized near point 5 certain species whose temperature optimum is close to 12 c 14 c and species that are most tolerant to temperatures ranging from 3 c to 4 c the distribution of specific biomass in the remaining months indicates a predominantly warm water group for which the temperature ranging from 10 c to 11 c is not the optimal one but within the tolerable range while comparing our considerations with the analysis of species found in the region the groups of dinoflagellates and optional psychrophiles can be predicted in the zone of point 5 depth zone consider the distribution of the phytoplankton specific concentration by depth in the zone of point 1 fig 12 there is a superiority of the biomass produced in 2016 during the cold months of may june and october with the main surges of the biomass corresponding to temperatures of about 5 c indeed may phytoplankton concentrations fluctuate around the value of 0 035 g m3 which is greatly lower than those in june 0 09 g m3 and october 0 063 g m3 respectively such dynamics of specific biomass can correspond to the biological situation in which the may volume of phytoplankton is formed by cold loving species whose reproduction occurs at low temperatures their tolerance range seems to cover the average may temperatures about 3 c though the optimal ones lie slightly higher at about 5 c which corresponds to the average indicators in june and october 2016 in 2015 the average monthly temperature in the same months was signally higher than the expected optimum which affects the slowdown in the rate of biomass reproduction in the warm periods from june to september the main contribution to the phytoplankton reproduction is made by more heat loving species this is evidenced by the fact that the average temperatures in the indicated period are almost the same both in 2015 and 2016 accordingly the vertical distributions in these months are close along the visual contour and in absolute values without a clear prevalence in any year but the share of the heat loving fraction in the phytoplankton community localized in the zone of point 1 is small so the maximal concentrations of total biomass in the warm months are lower than those in the cold period the study of vertical distributions in the point 2 zone suggests the presence of three categories of phytoplankton that differ in terms of temperature tolerance in may the biomass produced in 2016 is predominant which indicates the presence of taxonomic groups that can reproduce at low temperatures 2 c 2015 observes a lower specific volume of biomass under the same temperature conditions though june witnesses a slight increase in average temperature indicators this seems to activate another part of the algological composition its optimum is at 6 8 c therefore in 2015 when the temperature in the given zone was higher the total concentration of phytoplankton exceeds the similar indicators of 2016 this also suggests that the established average water temperature was not optimal for any existing species an indirect argument in favour of this assumption is the july vertical biomass profiles this month the concentrations of 2016 again become superior as the temperature indicator reaches its optimum while in 2015 the corresponding optimal temperature is above the optimum in august september a considerable outbreak in specific biomass is observed especially in the temperature jump zone given the average monthly temperatures in this period exceed the indicated optimum it is reasonable to assume the presence of the third group of species gravitating to an optimum temperature of 12 c apparently it is these species that provide a surge in phytoplankton concentration the october graph of the vertical profiles at this point confirms the assumption of an overwhelming proportion of organisms that reproduce at relatively high temperatures the temperature about 9 c in 2015 was generally favourable for the phytoplankton community localised at point 2 in 2016 the conditions were unfavourable with the average temperature values fluctuating at approximately 0 c the distribution of specific concentrations of phytoplankton in zone 4 would seem to indicate the predominance of species that prefer high temperatures in fact for almost the entire growing season available for satellite monitoring the average temperatures in 2015 in this area were higher than in 2016 as a response to the peculiarities of the species composition the total concentration of phytoplankton was higher in 2015 with may as an exception due to its monthly average temperature of about 3 c in both years however taking into account the absolute values of may averaged concentrations of biomass they can be clearly seen to be significantly higher that the values of concentrations in other months apparently the proportion of cold water species in the community is quite large but only in may temperature conditions favourable for their reproduction can be provided under the assumption that the phytoplankton composition changes due to a harsh winter or rather because a part of the heat loving species was replaced by cold loving one then a significant biomass growth in may 2016 looks quite understandable 6 conclusions we have estimated the phytoplankton biomass in the west kamchatka region of the sea of okhotsk the estimation has been performed by mathematical modelling based on remote sensing data of chlorophyll temperature irradiance and measurements of chlorophyll mineral matter and temperature in situ a mathematical model with an adaptive function has been used the vertical distributions of phytoplankton in the water column have been calculated using this model in this study model testing was based on a review of the main groups of phytoplankton aanalyzing is partly phenomenological in nature since the division into species is not provided for by the structure of the model research done by t orlova et al 2003 and e lepskaya 2015 is devoted to the biological description of species typical of the west kamchatka region of the sea of okhotsk the main conclusions contained in the scientific references emphasize the fact that regional species composition is stable in the long term dynamics only ratios change the set of dominant species varies depending on environmental conditions based on the volume of species reproduction under certain temperature conditions the conclusion can be made that the dominant species structure corresponds to the temperature regime this fact accounts for the results of the model in warm vs cold years comparing the results of model calculations with a change in the composition of dominant species shows the species structure of phytoplankton to be adjusted to temperature trends our results may serve as a basis for estimating the ecosystem condition in particular it is possible to estimate the bio productivity of the marine ecosystem the state of the art research is focused on the comprehensive use of mathematical modelling with in situ data and

24773,the paper discusses phytoplankton distribution on the west kamchatka shelf of the sea of okhotsk by comparing phytoplankton in spring summer autumn seasons of warm 2015 and cold 2016 mathematical models are used to estimate the phytoplankton abundance in the water column a model with an adaptation function is proposed satellite data on a sea surface are used as initial condition for solving a system of equations in a mathematical model satellite measurements contain chlorophyll a concentration temperature and illumination for the surface water layer depth illumination is calculated by differential equation models tested on the basis of in situ data show an adequate display of the dynamics of integrated biomass depending on external conditions the integrated use of satellites and information in situ makes it possible to estimate the phytoplankton abundance over a large area to compare phytoplankton distributions in warm 2015 and cold 2016 a model with an adaptation function is used the shelf of western kamchatka with its warm and cold year alternations shows the dynamics of the species composition vs the year type species composition changes to make the phytoplankton community be better adapted to changing environmental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mathematical model sea area phytoplankton chlorophyll nutrient illumination temperature depth 1 introduction to date much progress has been made in developing and improving methods for remote sensing of the earth s surface these methods are widely used to obtain information on key indicators of the environmental situation in large geographical areas in particular creating and implementing spectroradiometers with which near earth satellites are equipped allows us to visualize and evaluate the distribution of chlorophyll on the surface of the world s oceans some information was obtained while making in situ measurements the use of mathematical models to analyze and supplement experimental information is very instrumental in providing us with new knowledge regarding natural ecological systems we explore the regional marine ecosystem whose phytoplankton is responsible for its functioning our goal is to assess phytoplankton with remote sensing and in situ measurements we would like to restore the distribution of phytoplankton only the upper layer is available for satellite processing which is a significant limitation for the use of remote sensing methods the satellite sees the distribution of chlorophyll temperature and illumination on the water surface in the sea a satellite sensor can receive data in a large geographic area on site measurements provide separate data in time and space we d like to reconstruct the distribution of phytoplankton in the water column using mathematical simulation part of the biomass which is concentrated in the subsurface layer and below can significantly change the spatial distribution of the total biomass the use of remote sensing data was required for the practical application of mathematical methods when making estimates and forecasts for bioresources to date there are quite a few appropriate methods to be comprehensively applied e g satellite information contact data simulation etc uitz et al 2006 sammartino et al 2018 given the contact method of data collection is at hand statistical analysis techniques are very likely to be used to overcome the discontinuity which is inevitable when obtaining expeditionary information in j uitz et al 2006 these methods are used to rank phytoplankton organisms also to size them up for the modern chromatography methods to be applied by combining the latter with satellite data on the color of the ocean it becomes possible to quantify the part of the biomass that is concentrated under the surface layer in addition to the traditionally used statistical methods the application of an artificial neural network see m sammartino et al 2018 has been proposed in this case numerous results of sample analysis are used to train and test the network and remote data are applied as input parameters mathematical modelling of phytoplankton functioning has a long history and quite a few areas of research many studies have shown the vertical distributions of phytoplankton to be largely determined by the dynamics of the seasonal thermocline carter et al 1987 v a luchin and kruz 2016 some researchers used different versions of the advection reaction diffusion model to map these scenarios klausmeier and litchman 2001 ryabov et al 2010 abakumov et al 2015 while the others put together the basic model with a description of metabolic processes kiefer and kremer 1981 or with interspecies competition models silkin et al 2016 traditionally identified among the factors affecting the parameters of phytoplankton functioning are mineral nutrition water temperature and illumination occasionally a model system may consider only a few of these factors an impact of a particular environmental aspect can be described by an equation in a model system or by an external function dynamic models of phytoplankton functioning in a vertical volume of water are based on delineating biomass changes into growth and elimination processes a detailed analysis of the depth distribution of the concentration of the plant microorganisms may additionally include a description of their passive and active movements our research area is located in the western part of the sea of okhotsk and adjoins the kamchatka peninsula this area of 37 thousand km2 is part of the sea from 51 n to 59 n and from 150 e to 160 e fig 1 the problem of phytoplankton distribution in this area is investigated when solving this problem of restoring the integral mass of phytoplankton in the water column a model system of equations is constructed satellite information is used as input data this strategy is considered to be extremely promising by the authors the areas of the water surface observed from the satellite should receive a new focus with a full coverage we applied mathematical simulation to the satellite data available for the west kamchatka shelf in the sea of okhotsk and obtained information on the state of phytoplankton the latter being crucial for understanding the state and functioning of the entire marine ecosystem of the region 2 data and methods 2 1 vertical biomass model our goal is to estimate the amount of phytoplankton by its depth distribution the depth distribution is described by the model without taking into account hydrophysical effects in fast hydrophysical processes slower biological ones are almost lost we simulate the phytoplankton functioning in a vertical motionless water column in fact the aquatic environment changes over time nevertheless this method is justified because environmental changes occur at fast times in contrast to any tangible update of indicators that characterize a biological process per se therefore to describe the phytoplankton functioning and distortions of the vertical water column in one model is extremely difficult and can be ineffective in this case our assumption of a motionless column of water is fully justified we have followed a strategy of aggregating some processes such as mixing and recycling the corresponding coefficients are accounted for in the coefficients of growth removal from the system and passive movement as mentioned above most dynamic models simulating changes in biomass over time klausmeier and litchman 2001 include the growth rate of the specific concentration of plant organisms the elimination coefficient and some movement the basic model for the dynamics of the biomass density of phytoplankton p in a vertical water column has the following forms see ryabov et al 2010 1 p t k 2 p z 2 μ c i t p e p p c t k 2 c z 2 γ μ c i t p β γ e p p i z α p c i the volume density distribution p t z of phytoplankton biomass over depth z depends on the distribution of the concentration c t z of mineral nutrients biogens irradiance in particular photosynthetically active radiation par i t z and temperature t t z the process occurs over time t 0 tm and depth z 0 zm time t is measured in days while 0 tm is the time interval for simulation depth z is measured in meters zm is the bottom depth or the depth of the photic layer the smallest of them is selected a photic layer is the upper layer of the sea within which the penetrating light intensity should be at least 1 of the incident par bigg 2003 the model basically assumes the phytoplankton is supposed to function in a motionless water column while the motion occurs only due to micro turbulent diffusion with k coefficient chorin and marsden 1992 the parameter γ denotes a part of biogen c in the phytoplankton organisms the parameter β denotes a part of mineral substances that back come at phytoplankton elimination natural mortality or predation and other the specific growth rate function µ c i t is based on the hypothesis of independence of the identified influencing factors platt et al 2005 and is expressed as 2 μ c i t μ 0 μ c c μ i i μ t t where μ 0 is a species specific constant expressing maximally possible growth rate and μ c c c c 0 c describes mineral dependence by the classical michaelis menten function monod 1949 the irradiance dependence takes a similar form μ i i i i 0 i jorgensen 2010 growth rate dependence on temperature can be represented by the function whose form is μ t t t 1 2 t t o p t 2 t 1 2 where topt expresses the optimal temperature for the propagation of phytoorganisms this function has a maximum at t topt with parameter t 1 regulating the function decrease when the temperature deviates from the optimal one many functional forms are used to describe the temperature function jorgensen 2010 our function is one of them parameters c 0 and i 0 express the half saturation constants for mineral nutrition and light intensity respectively the specific rate of phytoplankton elimination is assumed to be constant e g elimination coefficient e p e 0 this equation represents the simplest assumption as to the natural mortality of phytoplankton the specific rate of light attenuation α p c linearly considers the influence of total water turbidity and shading by plankton and minerals which can be expressed as follows α p c α 0 α 1 p α 2 c the parameters are light attenuation rate α 0 and light attenuation rate due to phytoplankton α 1 or due to minerals α 2 2 2 stationary model consider the change in the biological components of the phytoplankton biogen light system with depth in a stationary mode we can go to the stationary version of model 1 in this case there s no need to use partial derivatives when describing the interaction of system components 3 d 2 p d z 2 1 k e p μ c i t p d 2 c d z 2 γ k μ c i t β e p p d i d z α p c i there is a boundary value problem for z 0 zm where zm is the photic layer depth remote sensing data characterizing chlorophyll temperature and irradiation in the surface layer can be used as the left boundary z 0 this information is not enough the system solution requires information on the amount of biogens or chlorophill at the bottom or at the lower boundary of the photic layer z zm moreover the boundary value problem for nonlinear system 3 does not always have a solution on the whole the use of system 3 is cumbersome and inefficient to solve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations will require to form boundary conditions which can be provided by remote sensing data on the values of surface chlorophyll concentration and irradiance adding conditions for no exchange with the atmosphere forms the following two left boundary conditions but the system crosslinking requires information on the amount of biogens or chlorophill at the bottom or at least at the lower boundary of the photic layer these data collection is generally difficult due to the lack of a stable contact monitoring system therefore the practical implementation of system 3 seems problematic besides the solution of a boundary value problem with a nonlinear right hand side per se is fraught with certain theoretical and computational difficulties 2 3 model within the adaptation function an alternative interpretation of system 3 should be based on the concept of the adaptation function poluektov et al 1980 frisman and zhdanova 2009 adaptability issues are explored in models for phytoplankton in the ecosystem beckmann et al 2019 and for communities sekerci 2020 the main assumptions of the model for the reproduction process to occur in a fixed water column are in place the growth process of phytoplankton is interpreted as its desire to occupy the ecological niche most suitable for functioning and reproduction peck and waxman 2018 in this case the community of phytoplankton organisms is considered as a population and the adaptation function of the community coincides with μ c i t then model 3 can be represented as follows 4 d p d z v d μ d z p d c d z w f p c d i d z α p c i where ν is the maximum possible rate of community growth the f p function is based on the hypothesis of the inverse effect of phytoplankton on the density of mineral nutrition sunda 2012 which generally speaking does not always comply with interactions established in the ecosystem verification of model 4 as well as its subsequent implementation largely depends on the data available for research given the in situ measurements of certain components of the system are in place some model equations could be possibly replaced by external functions abakumov et al 2019 their type and degree of compliance with real biological mechanisms depends on the quality and quantity of information that the specified functions display as well as on the chosen approximation method 2 4 data description in situ data we had quite representative in situ material of the okhotsk sea area near the west kamchatka shelf fig 1 the studies included 75 bottom trawls and complimentary hydrological and ichthyoplankton stations comprehensive environmental studies were carried out at 28 of the 75 stations direct sampling at the west kamchatka license area took place from june 21 to july 4 2015 we measured nutrients at 4 levels for each station on the surface at a depth of 20 m 50 m and at the bottom as a result the in situ determination of the amounts of nitrites nitrates and ammonium substances was presented in the newsletter 2015 table 1 shows the total concentrations of inorganic forms in nitrogen compounds that limit the reproduction of marine phytoplankton collos and berges 2002 ovchinnikova et al 2012 moschonas et al 2017 in those places where the data were not available small values of the order of 1 0e 5 g m3 were used in the calculations missing values may indicate that the relevant substances either were not detected or the sample analysis was performed correctly the study also included defining chlorophyll a used by organisms for primary production measurements were made in the surface layer at a horizon of 20 m and in the lower layer the measurement results are shown in fig 2 with isolines in addition to analyzing the biochemical composition of water samples in the area environmental monitoring was also performed it included determining the water temperature at the indicated horizons water temperature distribution on the surface at a depth of 20 m and at the bottom is shown in fig 3 remote data remote sensing data from may to october 2015 2016 are used to estimate the integral biomass of phytoplankton the observation period is limited because in the remaining months the sea of okhotsk is completely or partially under ice cover which significantly reduces the information content of satellite imagery a uniform grid with a kilometer resolution was applied to the designated area denote it by s1 in each node remote data is recorded for three indicators chlorophyll a water temperature and par values in the surface water layer this grid has about 84 000 points remote information for each day includes two or three surveys of a selected area according to the number of overflights of a satellite equipped with a spectroradiometer the monthly average indicators of the integral volume of chlorophyll for two years are calculated sequentially by averaging data at the same points in the geographical grid by days and then by months the distribution of one of the three indicators the monthly average surface temperatures based on remote data is shown in fig 4 then the information is converted into numerical arrays using the computer program glance by m morozov and e fomin 2004 this visualization tool was developed by the center for multifunctional satellite environmental monitoring by the institute of automation and control processes the far eastern branch russian academy of sciences iacp feb ras vladivostok cloudiness is very typical of the atmospheric regime off the coast of kamchatka to get the results of observations cloudless days were allocated in each month data collection and conversion is carried out by the satellite monitoring center before calculations satellite data and in situ observations are statistically checked for validity provided that all data have a lognormal distribution due to non negative values the interval estimate is constructed with a confidence probability of 0 95 only data that falls within this confidence interval is considered a very small amount of invalid data was found about 120 records for the entire data volume 1 32 107 measurements for each of the three indicators to numerically solve the described models it is necessary to compare the geographical depth of each node of the grid plot topographic material was used to prepare the relevant data bitmap of the depth map with a known scale hirt and rexer 2015 was converted into a vector view vectorised by using the vextractor package http www vextrasoft com after that depth isolines were manually selected and marked with simultaneous editing and correction of defects that inevitably occur in the process of automatic vectorization the constructed isolines were saved in a text format suitable for import into the surfer program and then converted into a regular grid by using the surfer 14 program golden software http www goldensoftware com along with a linear interpolation triangulation method the grid nodes were set in such a way as to combine the depth values with the coordinates of the points at which the remote sensing data on the concentration of chlorophyll surface water temperature and illumination of the upper layer were obtained the digitisation and conversion of the topographic information was implemented by the computer graphics laboratory of the iacp feb ras 3 calculations the depth temperature distribution function is compiled in accordance with the results described by v luchin and a cruz v a 2016 the authors provide material demonstrating the dynamics of the thermocline in the sea of okhotsk from june to november i e during the season when the western coast of kamchatka is completely ice free fig 5 shows the average long term profiles of vertical gradients of water temperature in the selected region the upper boundary of the thermocline in the summer months coincides with the sea surface and in the other months ranges from 10 meter to 15 meter depth the lower boundary is more constant in the summer period until september it falls on a 40 meter horizon and in november it deepens to 50 m the surface temperature value at depth and also the temperature jump in the thermocline zone were set by a function of the following form 5 t z t 0 0 z z 1 t ϕ z z 1 z 2 t 0 t b z 1 t z z 2 t t b z 2 t z z m where ϕ z z 1 z 2 t 0 t b t 0 t b t 0 z z 1 z 2 z 1 for each month t 0 is the temperature at the sea surface recorded by the satellite z 1 and z 2 are the upper and lower boundaries of the thermocline and tb is the temperature at the bottom or at the lower boundary of the photic layer if the 200 m mark is exceeded z z m the thickness of the photic layer is defined by the depth at which the intensity of the penetrating light should be at least 1 of the incident par bigg 2003 in this region it reaches 200 m based on preliminary calculations the temperature in these horizons ranges from 2 to 2 c dobrovolsky and zalogin 1982 khen et al 2002 therefore tb is considered to be a random variable that is evenly distributed over a given interval the purpose of numerical calculations based on the use of satellite information is to compare the values of the integrated mass of phytoplankton obtained in warm and cold years in this we follow the conclusions presented by v kolomeytsev 2016 by identifying certain climate criteria such as ice cover winter surface water temperatures and some others these criteria classify annual periods as warm or cold while winter hydrological conditions are analyzed for the entire sea of okhotsk and the coast of western kamchatka the period since 1972 is included in the review we focused on the last 20 years when 2015 was declared abnormally warm throughout the entire observation period it had an absolute minimum of iciness the 2016 that followed was characterized as the coldest fig 6 shows a graphic illustration of the study conducted by the authors 3 1 trial calculations for the stationary model model 1 is the base model and model 3 is based on it the first series of calculations was performed according to model 3 estimating the total volume of chlorophyll mass in the entire photic layer of water is reduced to solving the boundary problem at each node of the grid s1 in which satellite data on chlorophyll concentration temperature and illumination are recorded the calculation was carried out according to the system of equations 3 with the following boundary conditions p 0 p 0 satellite chlorophill concentration value on the water surface c 0 c 0 surface value of biogen concentration table 1 c z l c l biogen concentration at the depth zl table 1 for z l ϵ 0 20 50 z m p z z 0 0 derivative condition indicates no exchange with atmosphere i 0 i 0 satellite irradiance on the water surface for each node the nearest stations with known biogenic samples were identified the values that were used as boundary conditions were defined as the distance weighted average of mineral concentrations at these stations the task was supposed to be solved sequentially for three layers 1 from 0 to 20 m 2 from 20 m to 50 m 3 from 50 m to the bottom below 20 m instead of satellite data the condition of smoothness of the chlorophill distribution at the layer boundary was used as the left boundary condition obviously at points where the depth did not exceed the indicated horizons the decision was reduced to one or two stages of calculation values for trial calculations in model 3 are borrowed from the article abakumov et al 2015 fig 7 shows the areas that were selected to reconstruct vertical profiles to a 20 meter horizon using model 3 fig 8 demonstrates the reconstructed chlorophyll profiles for each zone for 6 months in 2015 and 2016 respectively chlorophyll distributions are illustrated at points within each zone where the solution of the boundary value problem is characterized by rapid convergence in the coastal zone the depth at some points does not reach 20 m the quality of the solution arrived at was checked on the basis of in situ data borrowed from the newsletter 2015 the chlorophyll values at the sea surface and at depth of 20 m obtained by analyzing water samples in june july 2015 were compared with solutions to the boundary value problem as fig 2 demonstrates overestimated values of the surface concentration of chlorophyll are observed for the deep sea zone in june and values at a depth of 20 m are close to measurements in situ and in july on the contrary the surface concentrations recorded from the satellite practically correspond to in situ measurements while the calculated values on the 20 meter horizon are underestimated this indicates a poor accuracy of the estimates obtained using model 3 for the deep sea zone for the coastal zone the values obtained during the solution of the boundary problem are in good agreement with in situ measurements thus the model demonstrates its suitability for estimating the integral mass of chlorophyll at individual coastal points nevertheless solving the problem through model 3 was not quite effective solution for all three layers does not exist at all points to find it requires additional regularization these factors make it difficult to automatically implement the mathematical model 3 in all observation nodes however the model can be used to calculate the vertical profiles of the pigment at local points especially in shallow water 3 2 calculation within the adaptation model turning to the cauchy problem we get rid of the problems associated with poor convergence of the solution at individual points moreover the presence of in situ biogens measurements table 1 allows to replace the second equation of model 4 with an external function four measurements at one spatial point allow the distribution of nutrients to be approximated by using a cubic spline thus the second equation in system 4 is removed we return to the first equation of system 4 according to the proposed hypothesis on the applicability of the concept of the adaption function to model 3 the specific biomass of phytoplankton at the k th horizon depends on its value at the k 1 level in the case when the dynamics of mineral nutrition is modelled by the second ratio of system 4 such a strategy is justified the growth of phytoplankton leads to increased consumption of biogens and reduces their concentration however due to the inverse effect nutritional deficiency inhibits the development of biomass and consequently the complete depletion of the mineral substances when replacing the second equation with an external depth distribution function of nutrients the inverse effect is lost therefore the surface concentration p 0 is the initial concentration abundance of phytoplankton which is affected by the adaption coefficient thus the type of model used to calculate the integral biomass of phytoplankton in the region of western kamchatka is shown as follows 7 d p d z d μ d z e p p d i d z α p c i this model is a system of ordinary differential equations the derivative d μ d z is calculated from formulas 2 d μ d z μ c d c d z μ i d i d z μ t d t d z with help formulas after formula 2 see item 2 1 for this system we can solve the cauchy problem with given initial conditions the satellite data on the surface values of chlorophyll water temperature and par are used as initial data 3 3 estimating the model parameters model 7 has several parameters we should select the main parameters based on experimental data these parameters are μ 0 c 0 i 0 topt t 1 α 0 α 1 and α 2 in this case the values of these parameters should be verified using the chlorophyll concentrations data at three points on the sea surface at the depth of 20 m and at the bottom in june july 2015 fig 2 each image is converted to a regular grid s2 in accordance with the algorithm for digitizing the depth map the grid is constructed to have its nodes as close as possible to those of grid s1 which contains information on satellite data s2 grid does not exactly coincide with s1 grid therefore each grid s1 node has its chlorophyll calculated as the weighted average of chlorophyll concentrations at the closest grid s2 nodes the weight corresponds to the distance between the grid node s1 and the neighbouring grid node s2 the procedure was performed sequentially for each horizon the grid is set with a resolution of about one kilometer taking into account the error corresponding to the curvature of the earth s surface along the meridian the temperature function constructed for 5 was specified for the period june july 2015 in accordance with in situ measurements fig 3 the isolines shown in fig 3 were converted into a similar grid s2 a vertical temperature was plotted at each node s2 with due note of occurring a thermocline satellite temperature and its values at a 20 meter and near bottom horizons at each grid s1 node we calculated the temperature as the weighted average of temperature at the closest grid s2 nodes parameters are selected on the condition of minimizing the following function 8 φ ρ θ j p z j ρ γ p j ρ 2 where p j ρ is the value of the specific concentration of phytoplankton at the point ρ on the horizon zj zj 0 20 zm zm is the bottom or photic layer depth at the current point ρ ai bi runs through the set of all nodes of the grid s1 satellite data in which ai and bi are the geographical coordinates of the current node and θ is the vector of certain parameters μ 0 c 0 i 0 topt τ α 0 α 1 and α 2 the e p is neglected assuming that its influence is accounted for in the μ 0 value to optimise the discrepancy over the entire area under observation we can construct a function with the following form 9 ψ θ ρ s 1 φ ρ θ d ρ the summation is performed over all the nodes of s1 grid in which the data on the state of the surface water layer by remote monitoring methods can be correctly recorded to verify the parameters of model 7 any non gradient method of finding the minimum of the objective function can be used in this case the nelder and mead search method for the deformable polyhedron himmelblau 1972 was chosen the vector of values used in previous studies to construct estimates of the integrated biomass of phytoplankton from satellite data in the sea of japan pak and abakumov 2019 was taken as an initial approximation when minimizing function 9 in all parameters we could not find a global minimum on the set of positive solutions therefore the search is performed using three main parameters namely μ 0 i 0 and topt the remaining parameters are postulated on the basis of preliminary calculations and partially borrowed from the literature tanaka and mano 2012 abakumov et al 2019 the parameter values obtained as a result of verification are shown in table 2 the values representing the minimum of function 9 on the set of parameters μ 0 i 0 and topt are highlighted in bold style and the postulated values selected on the basis of previous studies are indicated in italics the maximum growth rate is very small μ 0 0 32 this was due to the fact that the process of biomass growth takes into account the process of elimination to verify the adequacy of the parameter values obtained during verification we compared the chlorophyll values on known horizons fig 2 with the those obtained during the solution of model 7 data were compared for june july 2015 i e for the period of expeditionary measurements the comparison showed that for the deep sea zone almost 86 of the observed points exceeded the values of satellite data with respect to in situ measurements the satellite aided values range from 0 4 to 1 8 mg m3 while water samples show a chlorophyll concentration of about 0 2 mg m3 sometimes up to 0 5 mg m3 at a depth of 20 m the pattern changes the estimated concentration ranges from 0 02 mg m3 to 2 5 mg m3 and the samples show a spread from 0 mg m3 to 2 mg m3 over a larger area with a local flash of concentration up to 14 mg m3 thus for a 20 meter horizon the order of values is close in the coastal zone remote data are close to water samples from 0 5 mg m3 to 2 5 mg m3 with local satellite data emissions up to 5 7 mg m3 obviously this is due to the lower cloudiness of the coast compared to the open sea at a depth of 20 m predominantly reduced estimates of chlorophyll concentrations are observed from 0 01 mg m3 to 1 9 2 8 mg m3 taken together there are mutually balancing differences between the calculated and observed values of the concentration of chlorophyll 4 results thus by solving system 7 with a given external function 5 and function с defined by the cubic spline the distribution of the biomass of phytoplankton pi at all horizons down to the bottom can be obtained at points where the depth exceeds 200 m the calculations should be limited to the thickness of the photic layer at which phytoplankton reproduces at lower horizons the reproduction process is dying away due to the lack of illumination needed to start photosynthesis as in 2015 2016 the problem is solved for each half year period from may to october on the basis of the monthly average characteristics of the surface layer obtained by remote sensing the difference in the conditions of the numerical experiments applies only to the initial data the variation in monthly average temperatures over the same biennia is obviously related to the severity of winters in the corresponding years in v a luchin and kruz 2016 one of the main characteristics of the sea water structure the so called okhotsk water mass is described in detail its core is a cold subsurface layer knowledge of its characteristics core depth temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen is important for fishing purposes and predicting the state of sea water this water mass is formed as a result of autumn winter cooling of the sea surface and vertical mixing in the active water layer in the warm season an upper slightly warmed up and desalinated water layer forms above it as well as a layer of maximum seasonal gradients of temperature and salinity the formed density stratification at the boundary between the upper quasi homogeneous layer and the subsurface cold layer contributes to the preservation of the okhotsk sea water mass until a new stage of autumn winter convection for surface concentrations of chlorophyll the differences can be due to both a decrease in the rate of reproduction and the motion response of phytoplankton to climate change i e the localisation of its main biomass at depths where the temperature regime is most favourable for many species in this case the recorded chlorophyll concentration can be reduced since the subsurface layers are inaccessible to the satellite signal there are no significant differences in the average par indicators for 2015 2016 fig 9 demonstrates the results of calculating the integral mass of chlorophyll in the entire vertical volume with due account of the bottom topography and the thickness of the photic layer a visual analysis of the solutions obtained for model 7 shows that in the warm 2015 luchin and cruz 2016 the average monthly volumes of the integral mass of chlorophyll are generally small compared to similar indicators recorded in the cold 2016 consequently cold loving psychrophilic species could be assumed to predominate in this area they breed at temperatures below 15 20 c with negative range scherer and neuhaus 2006 moyer et al 2017 the optimal temperature for these species is low from 0 c to 4 c it should be emphasized that this conclusion is formulated only on the basis of calculations performed in accordance with model 7 and satellite information on the state of the surface water layer as initial data similar calculations were made in units of biomass such a transition is considered to be expedient when restoring the vertical profiles of phytoplankton given the fact that the proportion of chlorophyll in phytoplankton is a random variable which is evenly distributed over a limited range of values vörös and padisák 1991 stoń et al 2002 sidelev and babanazarova 2008 descy et al 2009 we can move from the chlorophyll concentration to that of phytoplankton at the corresponding horizons in this study vertical biomass profiles were reconstructed at different points in the region under observation fig 10 the points at which the vertical biomass profiles were analyzed were selected from the total array 84 000 so that the distributions in them were typical of the nearby area green thus a large part of the observed area is included in the analysis three points are located in the deep sea and two points are placed in the coastal zone the graphic vertical profiles of the biomass at the points of the coastal zone are shown in fig 11 the coastal zones are shallow for almost the entire period biomass prevails in 2015 exceptions are observed in zone 5 the differences are apparently due to the fact that zone 5 is located closer to the open part of the sea of okhotsk and zone 3 is located to shelikhov bay with a different hydrological regime described in the pices special publication 2010 the deep water zone is represented by a wide variety of vertical biomass contours an important role in this is played not only by the passage of horizontal currents but also by the topography of the bottom which affects the mixing of water layers and the seasonal thermocline movement the vertical profiles reconstructed at the points of the deep sea zone are presented in fig 12 the peculiar properties of phytoplankton vertical profiles in warm 2015 contra cold 2016 could be connected with species specific phytoplankton distribution in the western kamchatka shelf these themes are discussed in next section 5 discussion 5 1 spatial distribution of integrated specific biomass when analyzing the calculations we assume that the amount of phytoplankton biomass can be judged by the distribution of chlorophyll elizarova 1993 stoń et al 2002 the main result of the calculations presented in fig 9 suggests that in the cold 2016 the reproduction of phytoplankton reaches higher volumes than in 2015 the rate of reproduction is known to depend on nutrition temperature and illumination platt et al 2005 analysis of arrays containing par values revealed the absence of significant differences between 2015 and 2016 biogens as evidenced by the data presented in table 1 differ in low concentrations and relative constancy due to the absence of strong currents off the western coast of the kamchatka peninsula according to sverdrup 1955 the areas with divergence passing near the powerful currents are most saturated with mineral nutrition the temperature impact on the phytoplankton growth is regulatory but it is significant satellite data arrays with surface temperatures showed statistically significant differences between 2015 and 2016 the spatial temperature distribution is shown in fig 4 thus the total biomass growth in the cold year 2016 can be explained by the fact that the phytoplankton community as a whole prefers low temperatures since the structure of model 7 does not include the community species analysis we turned to a qualitative review of phytoplankton species identified during environmental monitoring we examined the biological characteristics of the main species and their type variety in a given area the species structure of the phytoplankton community identified during the work is described in the newsletter 2015 see appendix as noted the main contribution to the formation of phytoplankton abundance was made by diatoms most of which are cold loving mock and junge 2007 the second place belonged to dinophytes the species structure of the phytoplankton community which was identified during the work described in the newsletter shows that the composition of diatom biomass 70 5 mg m3 in total is formed by such species as chaetoceros pseudocrinitus 15 8 mg m3 chaetoceros compressus 13 4 mg m3 chaetoceros mitra 13 4 mg m3 and chaetoceros further this genus will be denoted by c decipiens 6 1 mg m3 the portion of the remaining species about 36 taxa of this group of microalgae is substantially low vs the above ones chaetoceros is thoroughly described in the reference orlova et al 2003 shevchenko and orlova 2003 the literature particularly emphasises the bio indicator role the microalgae play with respect to the water masses of various origin according to flora inventory species accounting of the far eastern seas cited by the authors shevchenko and orlova 2003 three of the four leading species and biomass species of chaetoceros i e chaetoceros pseudocrinitus chaetoceros compressus chaetoceros decipiens are part of this cold water complex chaetoceros compressus is also present in the warm water complex which is explained by its wide range of tolerance the preference for low to negative temperatures by c pseudocrinitus is also confirmed by its description in konovalova et al 1989 who argue the species to be one of the dominant diatoms causing winter subglacial flowering of the phytoplankton at temperatures from 0 2 c to 1 8 c a description of the fourth most abundant species chaetoceros mitra is also presented here in the far eastern seas c mitra is characterised by the subglacial flowering c decipiens in accordance with the description given in the work konovalova et al 1989 actively reproduces at slightly higher temperatures 1 5 c 8 c according to gail 1963 gladyshev et al 2018 c decipiens is assigned to cold water oceanic forms the specific biomass of c decipiens is low in volume vs the other main types of diatoms thus indicating the average water temperature to be close to the lower boundary of the tolerance interval of this species the prevalence of species of the genus chaetoceros in the average long term dynamics of taxonomic composition off the west coast of kamchatka is confirmed by the results presented in lepskaya et al 2009 lepskaya 2015 in particular as was previously noted c furcellatus was dominant in the summer and its high amount was also recorded in the surface temperature jump and bottom layer this species is traditionally assigned to the northern cold loving forms russ 1959 hop et al 2002 whose development occurs as certain observations show at temperatures ranging from 1 35 c to 9 c with a maximal growth rate ranging from 0 5 c to 5 c raymont 1980 huseby et al 2013 among the diatoms not belonging to the genus chaetoceros the species coscinodiscus oculus iridi stands out by its abundance in biomass which is also classified according to gail 1963 as cold water forms the next present species is paralia sulcate which is abundant in terms of biomass and number of cells in the literature hobson and mcquoid 1997 zong 1997 gebühr et al 2009 the optimum temperature for its reproduction is 7 c 1 c regarding cell numbers sceletonema costatum is also predominant whose temperature optimum from 16 c to 26 c was described in werner 1977 with a minimal lower boundary of 6 c an indirect confirmation that the species specific features of sceletonema costatum are not fully adapted to the temperature conditions of the observed area is provided by the fact that the values of the specific biomass of the species based on the data in the information bulletin 2015 are almost zero the second group of species forming the phytoplankton biomass in the observed area is represented by dinoflagellates as the bulletin data presented in 2015 the largest although not much superior to other species contribution to the proportion of dinophytic biomass is made by dinophysidia such as dinophysis acuminata dinophysis acuta dinophysis norvegica and others a detailed description of the genus can be found in the literature konovalova 2004 the results of the study undertaken show that the discovered species of peridinium are characteristic only of the cold seas and estuaries the temperature at which their active reproduction occurs ranges from 10 c to 12 c two more relatively numerous species of protoperidinium pallidum and protoperidinium pellucidum are described as common in cold temperate and warm seas respectively among the rare organisms the optional living in unstable cold conditions psychrophile psychrobacter okhotskensis could be observed as yumoto et al 2003 reported p okhotskensis is isolated from the plant community of the coastal part of the sea of okhotsk the halophilic facultative psychrophilic bacteria psychromonas marina sp nov is also found in kawasaki et al 2002 in 2015 the biological situation showed the diatom species to almost twice exceed the dinophytes one given the analysis of the dominant species the phytoplankton community as a whole can be stated to have low temperature preferences this conclusion fits the calculated seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass fig 9 shows that its largest mass is observed in may june and september october this vegetation regime provides a maximal production in the spring and autumn periods as avramenko et al 2015 described for diatoms in temperate latitudes the largest surge in biomass was observed in june 2016 which had the coldest winter after 2000 v v kolomeitsev 2016 following the may and june upsurges especially in 2016 a significant decrease in biomass was observed in july and august in september and october a slight increase was observed in the total biomass against the two previous months a monthly comparison of biomass volumes in 2015 and 2016 at first glance has revealed various contradictions with the predominance of the cold water diatoms in the taxonomy of the area under observation in particular the volume of biomass in july 2016 is low compared to that in july 2015 this result contradicts the assumption of a cold loving composition of the plant community indeed in the cold year 2016 the volume of reproduction should have increased kolomeitsev 2016 a detailed look at the dynamics of the species structure of phytoplankton has eliminated the apparent discrepancy the study mentioned above avramenko et al 2015 notes that during the cooling period the vegetation period of diatoms goes up considerably which makes the latter move to a leading position in the algological community this result most likely explains the significant increase in biomass in june 2016 and not in may with a certain time lag apparently at this time structural changes in the microalgae composition occur thus after a cold winter diatoms significantly increase their representation in the community as shown by the studies in situ described in the report 2017 the observation period has shown that phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms thereby accounting for more than 99 of the number and biomass of planktonic microalgae in 2015 as mentioned above the proportion of diatoms exceeded the proportion of dinophytes only twice a spatial analysis of the average temperatures in the area of the west kamchatka shelf also illustrates that the high temperature region in 2016 is larger than that in 2015 fig 3 the temperature exceeds the limit that is optimal for leading species the biomass in july 2015 has exceeded that in july 2016 due to structural differences and a more favourable temperature when analysing the distribution of biomass in the following months both the algal flora composition and the variation in average temperatures should be considered in august 2016 a weak predominance of the total biomass volume is observed this result is facilitated by a lower temperature background than that in 2015 this predominance is small in 2015 diatoms do not reproduce very actively due to relatively high temperatures but dinophytes occupy a large ecological niche compared to 2016 for them the temperature in 2015 is favourable they compensate for diatoms activity decline in the warm year a qualitatively similar situation has occurred in september in 2015 the temperature has decreased vs august indicators and the values of biomass have slightly gone up obviously the increase in biomass came at the expense of cold loving diatoms occupying a large though not all proportion in the community the distribution of low temperature regions is not correlated with the regions of increased biomass density this result indicates that in 2015 phytoplankton included both cold loving and heat loving species fig 9 september left in 2016 a correlation between areas of low temperatures and areas of high biomass density is observed the kamchatka coastal zone that is marked by high temperatures is characterized by the total biomass index of less than 100 mg m2 whereas the northern open part of the plot has a region of low temperature which almost coincides with the surge in specific biomass produced by predominantly cold loving species in 2016 this information can be found in report 2017 biomass in october 2015 has a slight advantage over 2016 a close examination of average temperature distribution has confirmed the hypothesis about the effect of cooling on the algological structure of the phytoplankton community fig 9 october demonstrates that in 2015 the highest biomass concentration coincides with the region where the temperature ranges from 4 c to 7 c regions with high background temperature are also characterised by the biomass presence though to a lower extent the region of low temperatures section from 58 50 n to 59 n and from 155 e to 156 e manifests almost zero signs of phytoplankton presence in 2016 more or less significant biomass concentrations are observed in areas where the temperature also ranges from 4 c to 7 c from 55 46 n to 58 46 n and from 154 26 e to 156 26 e the densities close to zero are recorded in areas with a temperature exceeding the threshold of 7 c coastal zone or in areas with almost negative temperatures from 54 51 n to 55 51 n thus the biological explanation of the calculations based on satellite information shows that due to winter cooling in 2016 the structure of the phytoplankton community changes in favour of the diatom group of microalgae the model distribution of phytoplankton is compared with a map of average temperatures recorded by a satellite spectroradiometer the largest burst of integral biomass fits the areas where the temperature fluctuates between 4 c and 7 c on the basis of the calculations preliminary assumptions regarding the species composition of the microalgae community can be made the species most active in breeding have an optimal temperature range from 4 c to 7 c the optimal temperature values obtained coincide with the taxonomic description of several species characteristics in this region in particular c decipiens orlova et al 2003 and c furcellatus lepskaya et al 2009 preferred the indicated temperatures and formed the basis for the dominant complex in 2016 this information can be found in report 2017 5 2 vertical distribution the distribution of species in the area under study can be investigated by restoring the vertical biomass profiles at various points marked in fig 10 it should be noted that when constructing vertical profiles it is the specific biomass of phytoplankton that is taken into account not the chlorophyll mass in contrast to the previous numerical experiment coastal zone first we considered the vertical biomass profiles formed during the numerical solution of the model 7 at points 3 and 5 fig 11 shows that generally speaking biomass is predominant in the coastal zone in 2015 with an exception for point 5 in august and october 2016 for point 3 the situation has remained almost unchanged throughout the growing season from may to october the phytoplankton reproduction volumes in 2016 are consistently low against those in 2015 whereas the absolute values in 2016 are close to invariant with the vertical averaged biomass concentration of 0 035 g m3 according to the newsletter 2015 the overwhelming majority of cold water taxa are concentrated in the jump layer with its active mixing of the water layers the rapid influx of nutrients and high temperature gradients provide a favourable environment for the growth of phytoplankton biomass in the thermocline zone in the coastal zone a thermocline is not formed due to the shallow depth of the bottom for the same reason the heating of the entire water volume occurs relatively quickly therefore heat loving species are localised in the coastal zone and the share of heat loving forms in the algological composition is greater in 2015 than that in 2016 the total volume of biomass at point 3 is larger in 2015 than that in 2016 the changes in the main taxa composition most likely play a decisive role as fig 4 satellite temperature shows the temperatures at the selected point during the observed periods of two years are approximately the same so temperature contributes but indirectly in changing the volume of reproduction from year to year the cold water forms in this zone are also insignificant because the main taxa remain quasi constant at different temperatures in 2016 a more interesting dynamics of specific biomass is observed at point 5 in this case a situation similar to the previous zone is in place but in august and october the average biomass concentration formed in 2016 is higher than that in 2015 situation is explained by comparing monthly average temperatures if at point 3 they were quite close in 2015 and 2016 then at point 5 there is a clear predominance of the average august temperatures in 2016 compared to those in 2015 by contrast the indicators in october 2016 are low as already mentioned the coastal zone is characterized by the prevalence of heat loving species the temperature of august 2016 favoured those heat loving taxa and they were responsible for the main surge of biomass at that period the coastal zone is the habitat of thermophilic species but their share in 2016 went down the partial substitution of thermophilic species by cold water species explains a slight increase in the reproductive activity of phytoplankton in october at point 5 in 2016 a significant cooling was observed it formed favourable conditions for the development of those species that have replaced a certain part of heat loving ones the situation allows for various assumptions to be made regarding the species composition at a given observation point when comparing the monthly vertical biomass profiles with the temperature map we could expect in the composition of the phytoplankton community localized near point 5 certain species whose temperature optimum is close to 12 c 14 c and species that are most tolerant to temperatures ranging from 3 c to 4 c the distribution of specific biomass in the remaining months indicates a predominantly warm water group for which the temperature ranging from 10 c to 11 c is not the optimal one but within the tolerable range while comparing our considerations with the analysis of species found in the region the groups of dinoflagellates and optional psychrophiles can be predicted in the zone of point 5 depth zone consider the distribution of the phytoplankton specific concentration by depth in the zone of point 1 fig 12 there is a superiority of the biomass produced in 2016 during the cold months of may june and october with the main surges of the biomass corresponding to temperatures of about 5 c indeed may phytoplankton concentrations fluctuate around the value of 0 035 g m3 which is greatly lower than those in june 0 09 g m3 and october 0 063 g m3 respectively such dynamics of specific biomass can correspond to the biological situation in which the may volume of phytoplankton is formed by cold loving species whose reproduction occurs at low temperatures their tolerance range seems to cover the average may temperatures about 3 c though the optimal ones lie slightly higher at about 5 c which corresponds to the average indicators in june and october 2016 in 2015 the average monthly temperature in the same months was signally higher than the expected optimum which affects the slowdown in the rate of biomass reproduction in the warm periods from june to september the main contribution to the phytoplankton reproduction is made by more heat loving species this is evidenced by the fact that the average temperatures in the indicated period are almost the same both in 2015 and 2016 accordingly the vertical distributions in these months are close along the visual contour and in absolute values without a clear prevalence in any year but the share of the heat loving fraction in the phytoplankton community localized in the zone of point 1 is small so the maximal concentrations of total biomass in the warm months are lower than those in the cold period the study of vertical distributions in the point 2 zone suggests the presence of three categories of phytoplankton that differ in terms of temperature tolerance in may the biomass produced in 2016 is predominant which indicates the presence of taxonomic groups that can reproduce at low temperatures 2 c 2015 observes a lower specific volume of biomass under the same temperature conditions though june witnesses a slight increase in average temperature indicators this seems to activate another part of the algological composition its optimum is at 6 8 c therefore in 2015 when the temperature in the given zone was higher the total concentration of phytoplankton exceeds the similar indicators of 2016 this also suggests that the established average water temperature was not optimal for any existing species an indirect argument in favour of this assumption is the july vertical biomass profiles this month the concentrations of 2016 again become superior as the temperature indicator reaches its optimum while in 2015 the corresponding optimal temperature is above the optimum in august september a considerable outbreak in specific biomass is observed especially in the temperature jump zone given the average monthly temperatures in this period exceed the indicated optimum it is reasonable to assume the presence of the third group of species gravitating to an optimum temperature of 12 c apparently it is these species that provide a surge in phytoplankton concentration the october graph of the vertical profiles at this point confirms the assumption of an overwhelming proportion of organisms that reproduce at relatively high temperatures the temperature about 9 c in 2015 was generally favourable for the phytoplankton community localised at point 2 in 2016 the conditions were unfavourable with the average temperature values fluctuating at approximately 0 c the distribution of specific concentrations of phytoplankton in zone 4 would seem to indicate the predominance of species that prefer high temperatures in fact for almost the entire growing season available for satellite monitoring the average temperatures in 2015 in this area were higher than in 2016 as a response to the peculiarities of the species composition the total concentration of phytoplankton was higher in 2015 with may as an exception due to its monthly average temperature of about 3 c in both years however taking into account the absolute values of may averaged concentrations of biomass they can be clearly seen to be significantly higher that the values of concentrations in other months apparently the proportion of cold water species in the community is quite large but only in may temperature conditions favourable for their reproduction can be provided under the assumption that the phytoplankton composition changes due to a harsh winter or rather because a part of the heat loving species was replaced by cold loving one then a significant biomass growth in may 2016 looks quite understandable 6 conclusions we have estimated the phytoplankton biomass in the west kamchatka region of the sea of okhotsk the estimation has been performed by mathematical modelling based on remote sensing data of chlorophyll temperature irradiance and measurements of chlorophyll mineral matter and temperature in situ a mathematical model with an adaptive function has been used the vertical distributions of phytoplankton in the water column have been calculated using this model in this study model testing was based on a review of the main groups of phytoplankton aanalyzing is partly phenomenological in nature since the division into species is not provided for by the structure of the model research done by t orlova et al 2003 and e lepskaya 2015 is devoted to the biological description of species typical of the west kamchatka region of the sea of okhotsk the main conclusions contained in the scientific references emphasize the fact that regional species composition is stable in the long term dynamics only ratios change the set of dominant species varies depending on environmental conditions based on the volume of species reproduction under certain temperature conditions the conclusion can be made that the dominant species structure corresponds to the temperature regime this fact accounts for the results of the model in warm vs cold years comparing the results of model calculations with a change in the composition of dominant species shows the species structure of phytoplankton to be adjusted to temperature trends our results may serve as a basis for estimating the ecosystem condition in particular it is possible to estimate the bio productivity of the marine ecosystem the state of the art research is focused on the comprehensive use of mathematical modelling with in situ data and

24774,response behaviors of animals to stressors are complicated especially it is difficult to analyze temporal data in addressing the time course development of behavioral states to stressors not much study has been conducted in identifying the short term behavior conditions of indicator organisms responding to stressors hence in the present study we selected three temporal networks temporal kohonen map tkm recurrent self organizing map rsom and recursive self organizing map recsom to characterize the behavior strength of individual fish exposed to atrazine atz 0 12 mg l for 15 days the trained networks were able to detect the characteristic behavior strength segments presenting the stepwise behavior response model sbrm tkm was found suitable for detecting strong curves in a short training time but clustering was limited in grouped segments in contrast recsom was found to be most suitable for detecting behavior segments with both high and low contrast response under toxic exposure recsom was effective in clustering but could not detect segments with strong changes finally our results presented that the temporal soms especially recsoms were feasible in identifying short term time series data and could be utilized for on line monitoring of test organisms under stressful conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords behavior monitoring temporal kohonen network recurrent som recursive som stepwise response behavior model 1 introduction objective analyses are warranted for diagnosing complex response behaviors of organisms against disturbances effectively however behavior data are not extensively analyzed because they might have various behavioral patterns high variation nonlinearity and sensitivity to noise and there are limited studies analyzing quantitatively although techniques in informatics that have been frequently used to extract information from complex ecological data including populations and communities such as machine learning and artificial neural networks lek et al 2005 recknagel 2013 chon et al 1996 since the early report of selye 1973 characteristic response behaviors have been studied after exposure to toxic substances and quantitative techniques were implemented to biological early warning systems bae and park 2014 gerhardt 1999 2001 gerhardt et al 2005 introduced the stepwise stress model after measuring behavior strengths of test organisms under an electric field being stimulated by cascaded behavior changes to chemicals gerhardt et al 2005 ren et al 2007 proposed stepwise behavior response model sbrm mentioning different stages of fish response including no effect stimulation acclimation adjustment and toxic effect sbrm has been confirmed for the large number of heterogenic chemicals including xenobiotics e g organophosphorus pesticides pyrethroids and carbamates ren et al 2009 and heavy metals e g cdcl2 pan et al 2017 and then followed by serials of computational confirmations including linear fitting to produce diagnosing response landscapes wang et al 2015 a switch mechanism modeling to present thresholds for adjustment and acclimation phases ren et al 2016 and a persistence model to address intoxication and vitality see ren et al 2016 for details however behaviors expressed in a time sequence have not been specifically identified during the course of animals response to chemicals therefore we intend to detect the characteristic responding behavior of fish under chemical stressful conditions by using temporal self organizing maps soms since kohonen 1982 proposed the som networks have been extensively applied in various fields park et al 2003 de et al 2014 lópez et al 2012 strickert et al 2005 tokutaka et al 2015 including ecological science kalteh et al 2008 céréghino and park 2009 chon 2011 the movement of animals were specifically analyzed under chemical stress in association with som on different taxa including fishes e g zebrafish medaka lee et al 2015 park et al 2005 uehara et al 2015 tsai et al 2017 insects e g drosophila termite choi et al 2006 lee and chon 2011 benthic macroinvertebrates park et al 2004 son et al 2006 and birds lee et al 2006 in order to demonstrate visualization of intoxication or recovering states of organisms soms were further applied to patterning sbrm data to cluster response behaviors according to chemical concentrations and measurement times liu et al 2011 wang et al 2015 the classification of time series data using som was initially proposed by kohonen kohonen 1991 while chappell and taylor 1993 provided the temporal kohonen map tkm by applying leaky integrator in calculating weights with moving the leaky integrators from the outputs into the inputs yield koskela koskela et al 1998 proposed rsom which describes an exponentially weighted linear infinite impulse response iir filter varsta et al 1997 proposed the concept of rsom in patterning time series data based on context quantization an extra activation map was devised in addition to weight map to form a recsom for more effective time delayed information extraction voegtlin 2000 voegtlin and dominey 2002 strickert and hammer strickert and hammer 2005 proposed merge som by extending context descriptor accommodating previous weight and context together subsequently the proposed temporal soms were evaluated in various data sets including theoretical algorithms e g tree structures binary sequence automation language e g english symbolic sequence speaker data and biological sciences e g dna sequence physiological measurements hammer et al 2004 strickert and hammer 2005 strickert et al 2005 vančo and farkaš 2010 although variations existed quantitation errors were lower in recsom than other methods strickert et al 2005 voegtlin and dominey 2002 to date no studies have been conducted on patterning the dynamic time course behavior response of fish under chemical stress so we hypothesize that temporal soms may have a better performance in detecting sbrm than the general som the hypothesis was tested by the behavior strength detectability and cluster formation since the temporal networks incorporate the time delayed effects for training while the general som trains the input data in a static manner we selected three temporal networks such as temporal kohonen map tkm recurrent self organizing map rsom and recursive self organizing map recsom to characterize the responding behaviors of organisms we further assumed that recsom would have the best performance in detecting sbrms due to the double weight system devised within the network to validate this hypothesis we compared the quantization error produced during the training process across different time windows in this study we aimed to i compare performances of the selected temporal networks through training response behaviors after exposure to a toxic chemical ii discuss about the feasibility of clustering behavior segments by temporal soms and iii apply the selected temporal soms in short term time series behavior pattern recognition 2 material and methods 2 1 behavior analysis behavior responses of test organisms were measured continuously for 15 days after exposure to a toxic chemical atrazine atz 0 12 mg l 0 1 toxic unit in an online monitoring system ren et al 2007 solomon et al 2013 we used zebrafish danio rerio as the test organism to analyze behavior responses zebrafish have been frequently used as indicator species based on many advantages including rapid reproduction small size easy handling and high degree of homology with the human genome coe et al 2008 adult zebrafish with 3 4 cm in size were placed in a flow through test chamber approximately 7 cm long 5 cm in diameter provided with an electric field pan et al 2017 the response activity of zebrafish is reflected by two pairs of electrodes located at the inside walls of the test chambers which one pair of them sent a high frequency signal of altering current and the other ones are noncurrent carrying electrodes the disturbance signal of electric field within the chamber due to fish activity was transformed to digital data by a d transformers walden 1999 the signal from the flow through test chamber was sampled every second and average values of every 6 min 0 1 hour were used for analysis since behavioral responses at short term time 6 min was reported to be feasible for evaluating stressful conditions of organisms in the time scale ranging from several minutes to an hour empirically ren et al 2009 which could illustrate overall position changes but not represent immediate body responses such as trembling shaking and other body movements personal observations the signal of chemical treatment group was normalized between 0 either moribund or dying and 1 full activity with the control without treatment group database and coined as behavior strength ren et al 2007 the value of behavior strength which is an indicator to reflect movement activity indicates the intensity of behavior synthetically representing motility of the tested organism in this article temporal soms were supposed to cluster segments with similar behavior patterns normally if behavior response was intense at a certain time the behavior strength would fluctuate strongly for simplicity high changes of behavior would be regarded as strong segments and gentle response would be regards as weak segments the time window of 5 data points of behavior strengths 0 1 hour 5 0 5 hour are defined as segment in this study a typical example is shown in fig 1 four individuals in each chamber with four replications four chambers were used for measuring behavior strength and the separate behavior strength was used to indicate the behavior responses of zebrafish in total the data consisted of 14 400 points 3600 points 4 individuals 14 400 for training the networks 2 2 soms applied to temporal data as for the temporal som we first selected the temporal kohonen map tkm chappell and taylor 1993 which is one of the earlier temporal soms with a clear biological realism the modified tkm recurrent som rsom koskela et al 1998 was selected to compare with tkm their similarities generalize time delayed feedbacks finally the recursive som voegtlin and dominey 2002 was chosen as it could use a characteristically different algorithm with a time delayed copy of rsom activities allowing a homogeneous connection between feed forward and feed back updating procedures see sections 2 2 3 and 2 2 4 listed below for detailed explanations the positive control was regarded as general som training see section 3 2 1 general som compared with other temporal som methods 2 2 1 self organizing map som in the general som kohonen 1982 the nodes are arranged on a two dimensional grid with every neuron equipped with weights wi r fig 2 if input sequences to be denoted by x t x 1 xn where each element xt indicates a series of behavior strength data at time point t 1 t n the distance between input data and weight will be obtained by adopting equation 1 1 d i t x t w i t 2 where 2 denotes the euclidean distance once the winner node best matching unit bmu is determined which has the minimum distance between input element and neuron weight the weights are updated as equation 2 2 w i t 1 w i t γ t h i b t x t w i t where h i b t is the value of the neighborhood function and γ t 0 1 denotes the learning rate the parameters i and b in function h i b t denote the index of selected i and bmu respectively we chose the gaussian bell function h i b e d i b 2 σ 2 to narrow the training map to ensure the neuron specialization for initialization voegtlin and dominey 2002 fig 2 2 2 2 temporal kohonen map tkm and recurrent self organizing map rsom both tkm and rsom are similar since training could be mainly based on recurrent operations applied to input data sequences both algorithms tkm and rsom use the leaky integration to compute the distance applied between input and weight but they are different in expression of the context training varsta et al 2001 for tkm the activation term the first component in right side of eq 3 would be subtracted from the euclidean difference between input and weight fig 2 based on equation 3 3 d i t α d i t 1 1 2 x t w i t 2 where α 0 1 denotes a memory constant which controls the level of context decay the neuron with the maximum activity indicates the bmu the update rule of tkm takes place through hebbian learning at each time step in the similar way as for the standard som fig 2 in rsom activation terms are updated in lining with the difference between input and weight eq 4 whereas the activation could be updated through subtraction of euclidean distance in tkm as stated above fig 2 based on equation 4 4 y i t 1 α y i t 1 α x t w i t where yi t denotes the leaked quantity of neuron i at time step t with the coefficient α analogous to the one in tkm the rsom produces the context in a larger space than tkm since the directions are stored as vectors either plus or minus instead of the scalar euclidean distance koskela et al 1998 the bmu is the minimum leaked quantity at each step in rsom whereas the bmu is the maximum leaked quantity in tkm chappell and taylor 1993 in addition the previous weight was used for updating the current weight in both tkm and som but the weight was updated in association with activation changes in rsom see varsta et al 2001 for details 2 2 3 recursive self organizing map recsom recsom is essentially different from tkm and rsom regarding the following features i each neuron in recsom has two dimensional weights ii input sequencing and iii map activation whereas the previous two networks tkm and rsom have only one dimension of weight for input sequencing fig 2 w i x t neuron weight associated with input sequence x t at time t w i y t neuron containing map activations y i t 1 associated with the context once the distance between the current input and weight was calculated the current activation weight map w i y and previous activation map by yi were produced concurrently fig 2 the combination of these two dimension weights could be defined as quantization errors of recsom eq 5 5 e i t α x t w i x t 2 β y i t 1 w i y t 2 in which α and β are constants above 0 the bmu in recsom could be defined as the unit that minimizes ei using y i t e i t directly would result in unstable representations a transfer function y i f e i which is opted to achieve stable convergence see voegtlin and dominey 2002 for detail convenient transfer functions are exponential function as shown in equation 6 6 y i e x p e i finally current activation weight maps and activation maps in recsom are changed according to update rule respectively as shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 w i x t 1 w i x t γ t h i b t x t w i x t 8 w i y t 1 w i y t γ t h i b t y t 1 w i y t 2 3 training the networks the behavior strength data with the time window of 5 points are given as input for the three temporal soms tkm rsom recsom and general som equally the sample units are 14 400 points in a sequence while the variable represents a series of vectors consisting of behavior strength in 5 time points the time window was overlapped with 1 unit for each iteration see section 2 1 behavioral data according to vesanto et al 2000 the initial number of nodes was 600 3600 4 5 600 in the present study various ranges in the number of nodes based on the convergence efficiency and detectability of segments were analyzed with the number 289 17 17 we opted the square map instead of the rectangular map to observe the gradient of data e g time and bs values equally on horizontal and vertical axes similar to the previous study varsta et al 1997 we set α in tkm as 0 3 and rsom as 0 6 voegtlin and dominey 2002 the α and β values for recsom were identified as 2 and 0 06 respectively voegtlin and dominey 2002 we adjusted the values as 3 and 0 06 for α and β in recsom respectively regarding quantization error minimization and convergence performance in our study to check the feasibility of tkm rsom and recsom we initially tested with the well known data set of the mackey glass chaotic time series in eq 9 which has been already used for testing temporal som networks similar to voegtlin and dominey 2002 9 d x t d t α x t τ 1 x 10 t τ β x t where α and β are 0 2 and 0 1 respectively series begin chaos when τ the delay constant was above 16 8 we calculated the chaotic time series though 4th order runge kutta method süli and mayers 2003 to resolve the eq 9 fig 3 time window of 20 units was used for training which means a cluster of 20 sequential units is used as input for each training iteration similar to the reports of kohonen 2014 linear initialization was used to speed up training process with more stable results before training the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data were aligned along the dimension of the map grid to have greatest eigenvectors see kohonen 2001 for detail in this study we performed matlab based the mathworks r2014a data analysis the learning process of the som was conducted using the som toolbox vesanto et al 2000 developed by the laboratory of information and computer science helsinki university of technology http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox we tested general som to evaluate the performance of temporal networks while the constant values were used in the temporal soms as stated above we allowed the learning rate to change in each iteration in general som with the updating rule α a t b in which a and b would be chosen suitably in som toolbox version 2 0 b could be equal to the length of input data minus 1 and divided by 99 and a b α i n i α i n i 0 5 in rough training and α i n i 0 05 in finetune training in default 3 results 3 1 mackey glass time series detection of time series data was observed for each method even though differences were observed among the methods fig 4 the temporal soms were tested by mackey glass series before patterning the behavior strength data tkm was effective in detecting high level changes fig 5 2c due to tkm s strong response to context with the current segment applying the euclidean distance invariably eq 3 comparing with rsom which calculates the current criterion by input minus weight allowing negative values sometimes eq 4 but the tkm was limited in clustering the detected nodes fig 4a all the nodes were spread over the map without showing clear groupings of the nodes or gradients over the map in x t changes recurrent som showed better clustering when being compared with tkm but clustering was not found to be more effective than in tkm in finding strong segments of x t although a few strong segments were detected in the map fig 4b as stated above allowing negative values in updating activation of rsom contributed to decrease in the response of activation to strong segments as shown in fig 4c both strong and weak segments were recognized in recursive som even though clustering was not better illustrative in comparing to rsom the main frame of clustering was formed although a few isolating nodes were produced in the map cluster formation was substantially better than tkm considering the equations of recsom eqs 7 and 8 both the input and the time delayed copy of activities are analogous to single input vector in the classical som algorithm hence each unit of the map will learn to represent a couple of input and context recursively and then the homogeneous connections between them could be achieved 3 2 behavior strength time series in som 3 2 1 general som we trained the general som with the same dataset under similar conditions performed in the temporal networks for comparison convergence was achieved faster for 28 768 iterations with proper clustering along the vertical axis fig 5 1a however som was ineffectual to detect the strong segments fig 5 1c which suggested that the general som was not effective in detecting the strong segments almost all the grouped segments were flat although groups showed the gradient of behavior strength fairly well from low to high levels 3 2 2 temporal kohonen map tkm subsequently we tested the temporal networks with the same behavior strength data similar trends to the results of temporal som were observed as shown in mackey glass curve fig 4 tkm showed fast convergence capacity with practically lower level of errors for nearly 20 000 iterations fig 5 2b quantization errors decreased sharply beyond 20 000 iterations with the final quantization error equal to 0 062 as shown in fig 5 2c strong segments were effectively found to be similar to the case of mackay glass series fig 4 a the vertical bar indicates the higher red color and lower blue color levels of behavior strength fig 5 2c in tkm however the levels of behavior strength showed no gradient but randomly spread over the entire map seemingly without any regularity fig 5 2d shows the number of segments grouped in each node it was noteworthy that a large number of segments grouped at a small number of nodes showing extremely higher variability in the number of grouped nodes that range from 1 to 1003 for example at the top right corner of the map several nodes had a remarkably large number of segments this corner matched the late time locally red color shown in the vertical bar however the overall time gradient was not observed in the entire map fig 5 2d 3 2 3 recurrent som the convergence was slowly achieved in rsom for nearly 100 000 iterations with the final quantization error equal to 0 097 fig 5 3a when being compared with the tkm fig 5 2a quantitation errors which decreased gradually as the training proceeded were not as much fluctuating as in tkm it was noteworthy that rsom clustering shown in fig 5 3a was comparatively better than clusters of tkm fig 5 2a the higher red color and lower blue color levels of behavior strength well aligned and could be observed at the bottom area and top areas of the map respectively fig 5 3c it was suggested that rsom was not effective to recognize segments with a strong change in behavior strengths curves were predominantly flat and only a few strong curves were found in the map red circle for an example fig 5 3c in contrast to the case of mackey glass time series fig 4b grouped segments within the nodes were greater ranges 1 120 in rsom compared to tkm the time gradients appeared in the late period located at the top left area of the map fig 5 3b 3 2 4 recursive som recsom effectively identified both strong and weak segments and achieved relatively faster convergence through training fig 5 4b c among the target networks strong segments were well identified in the map the higher red color and lower blue color levels of behavior strength were well aligned in the left and right areas of the map respectively strong segments were more frequently observed in the intermediate to higher levels of behavior strengths whereas flat curves were mostly found in the area of lower levels close to toxic effects convergence was achieved faster but comparatively slower than tkm strong fluctuation in quantitation error lasted for nearly 40 000 iterations with the final quantization error equal to 0 048 comparing with 20 000 iterations with tkm fig 5 4b clusters were formed with a few outlier nodes in the map fig 5 4a although the clustering was not as complete as in the case of rsom fig 5 3a 3 2 5 comparing temporal soms in order to compare the efficiency of three temporal som methods we checked quantization errors across different time windows overall recsom showed the 1owest range in quantitazation errors fig 6 the errors of tkm were consistently higher than recsom linearly increasing with the enlargement of time windows in a series rsom showed higher levels of error in a similar range across different time windows the time window of rsom for 11quantization error was comparatively smaller than tkm therefore recsom has a better accuracy than others in most cases and rsom has the best robustness 4 discussion our study demonstrates the feasibility of temporal som networks in clustering short term time series data when test organisms are exposed to a toxic chemical fig 5 the results suggested that temporal soms were all better in detecting behavior strength segments comparing with regular som the results match our hypothesis that temporal soms are more suitable in addressing time series behavioral changes indicating existence of time delayed effects during the procedure of behavior responses after exposure to stressor moreover the quantization error could be occurred minimum for recsom fig 6 which further supports our second hypothesis that recsom performs better than tkm and rsom in detecting the short term time series behavior strengths since visualization of som is one of the advantages in data analysis clustering of different segments could be effectively presented each segment pattern is separately addressed in the map in accordance with the behavior strength levels and time fig 7 shows examples of detected nodes in som fig 7a matched with each empirical sbrm fig 7b and the detected nodes in fig 5 4c remarkably matches different modes of sbrm inset a stimulation higher behavior strength was followed by lower behavior strength resulted due to initial toxic stimulation in a small degree on zebrafish inset b acclimation the intermediate higher behavior strength levels were reduced rapidly due to strong sensitivity to the toxic chemical on zebrafish inset c adjustment behavior strength levels were slightly increased with an initiation of partial recover inset d readjustment increasing in the behavior strength values followed by decreasing in the behavior strength values indicates recover response of zebrafish against chemical toxicity inset e toxic effect flat lower values of behavior strength at minimum level indicate the moribund or dying state of zebrafish it is also noteworthy that there are other nodes on som with slight variation associating with the typical patterns as shown in segment patterns in the trained maps e g fig 5 4 fig 7 which indicates that the network could further find variants of sbrm more studies are warranted in this aspect to precisely define the varieties of behavior modes with additional training for the temporal soms to our knowledge the present study is the first to report on clustering of short term time series behavior data after exposure to toxic chemical although the temporal soms were previously applied to other fields of study including engineering horio and yamakawa 2001 generally time series data are analyzed by autocorrelation or fourier transform function periodicity of response behaviors under chemical stress was described based on the autocorrelation analyses to observe varying responses at different factors such as chemicals and concentrations ren et al 2019 yang et al 2018 however temporal soms are more suitable for detecting the short term time series data whereas autocorrelation could be applicable only for long time data to find periodicity residing within the data sets in our study we intend to detect the short term time series data specifically within a time window 0 5 h in this study since sbrm are observed in a short sequence for practical diagnosing purpose zhang et al 2012 although strong segments the fluctuation of behavior is large were well detected on mackey glass time series of rsom fig 4b the strong segments were not well found in the behavioral data fig 5 3c this might be due to complexity residing in behavioral data in mackey glass time series all curves are similar in behavior data however behavior strength values were extremely variable across different levels as shown in fig 1 rsom was limited in extracting information from the data with extreme fluctuations since soms are heuristic models global optima could not be obtained easily the parameters and initial conditions must be determined empirically based on trials and errors in order to partly overcome this difficulty linear initialization methods have been proposed by kohonen kohonen 2001 to narrow down the training range in the initial stage although initialization helps to convergence there are numerous parameter combinations to be tested with more theoretical studies are required for describing the importance of convergence space in the temporal network possibly a study on extrapolation of convergence properties of soms in topology conservation ritter and schulten 1988 for instance in the future an additional approach would be utilized to recognize capability of som we used the trained som to detect each input segment on the real time series on line detection system would be useful for monitoring a certain mode or a series of modes observed in sbrm fig 5 5 conclusion our study proved the feasibility of temporal som networks in detecting short term time series behavior response data of organisms under chemical stress conditions each state in sbrm is specifically matched with the detected segments by the trained temporal soms overall recsom was most suitable for identifying the segments matching the empirical sbrm considering segments detectability and clustering formation tkm is effective in detecting strong curves but limited in clustering recurrent som was faster in convergence but ineffective in detecting strong segments

24774,response behaviors of animals to stressors are complicated especially it is difficult to analyze temporal data in addressing the time course development of behavioral states to stressors not much study has been conducted in identifying the short term behavior conditions of indicator organisms responding to stressors hence in the present study we selected three temporal networks temporal kohonen map tkm recurrent self organizing map rsom and recursive self organizing map recsom to characterize the behavior strength of individual fish exposed to atrazine atz 0 12 mg l for 15 days the trained networks were able to detect the characteristic behavior strength segments presenting the stepwise behavior response model sbrm tkm was found suitable for detecting strong curves in a short training time but clustering was limited in grouped segments in contrast recsom was found to be most suitable for detecting behavior segments with both high and low contrast response under toxic exposure recsom was effective in clustering but could not detect segments with strong changes finally our results presented that the temporal soms especially recsoms were feasible in identifying short term time series data and could be utilized for on line monitoring of test organisms under stressful conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords behavior monitoring temporal kohonen network recurrent som recursive som stepwise response behavior model 1 introduction objective analyses are warranted for diagnosing complex response behaviors of organisms against disturbances effectively however behavior data are not extensively analyzed because they might have various behavioral patterns high variation nonlinearity and sensitivity to noise and there are limited studies analyzing quantitatively although techniques in informatics that have been frequently used to extract information from complex ecological data including populations and communities such as machine learning and artificial neural networks lek et al 2005 recknagel 2013 chon et al 1996 since the early report of selye 1973 characteristic response behaviors have been studied after exposure to toxic substances and quantitative techniques were implemented to biological early warning systems bae and park 2014 gerhardt 1999 2001 gerhardt et al 2005 introduced the stepwise stress model after measuring behavior strengths of test organisms under an electric field being stimulated by cascaded behavior changes to chemicals gerhardt et al 2005 ren et al 2007 proposed stepwise behavior response model sbrm mentioning different stages of fish response including no effect stimulation acclimation adjustment and toxic effect sbrm has been confirmed for the large number of heterogenic chemicals including xenobiotics e g organophosphorus pesticides pyrethroids and carbamates ren et al 2009 and heavy metals e g cdcl2 pan et al 2017 and then followed by serials of computational confirmations including linear fitting to produce diagnosing response landscapes wang et al 2015 a switch mechanism modeling to present thresholds for adjustment and acclimation phases ren et al 2016 and a persistence model to address intoxication and vitality see ren et al 2016 for details however behaviors expressed in a time sequence have not been specifically identified during the course of animals response to chemicals therefore we intend to detect the characteristic responding behavior of fish under chemical stressful conditions by using temporal self organizing maps soms since kohonen 1982 proposed the som networks have been extensively applied in various fields park et al 2003 de et al 2014 lópez et al 2012 strickert et al 2005 tokutaka et al 2015 including ecological science kalteh et al 2008 céréghino and park 2009 chon 2011 the movement of animals were specifically analyzed under chemical stress in association with som on different taxa including fishes e g zebrafish medaka lee et al 2015 park et al 2005 uehara et al 2015 tsai et al 2017 insects e g drosophila termite choi et al 2006 lee and chon 2011 benthic macroinvertebrates park et al 2004 son et al 2006 and birds lee et al 2006 in order to demonstrate visualization of intoxication or recovering states of organisms soms were further applied to patterning sbrm data to cluster response behaviors according to chemical concentrations and measurement times liu et al 2011 wang et al 2015 the classification of time series data using som was initially proposed by kohonen kohonen 1991 while chappell and taylor 1993 provided the temporal kohonen map tkm by applying leaky integrator in calculating weights with moving the leaky integrators from the outputs into the inputs yield koskela koskela et al 1998 proposed rsom which describes an exponentially weighted linear infinite impulse response iir filter varsta et al 1997 proposed the concept of rsom in patterning time series data based on context quantization an extra activation map was devised in addition to weight map to form a recsom for more effective time delayed information extraction voegtlin 2000 voegtlin and dominey 2002 strickert and hammer strickert and hammer 2005 proposed merge som by extending context descriptor accommodating previous weight and context together subsequently the proposed temporal soms were evaluated in various data sets including theoretical algorithms e g tree structures binary sequence automation language e g english symbolic sequence speaker data and biological sciences e g dna sequence physiological measurements hammer et al 2004 strickert and hammer 2005 strickert et al 2005 vančo and farkaš 2010 although variations existed quantitation errors were lower in recsom than other methods strickert et al 2005 voegtlin and dominey 2002 to date no studies have been conducted on patterning the dynamic time course behavior response of fish under chemical stress so we hypothesize that temporal soms may have a better performance in detecting sbrm than the general som the hypothesis was tested by the behavior strength detectability and cluster formation since the temporal networks incorporate the time delayed effects for training while the general som trains the input data in a static manner we selected three temporal networks such as temporal kohonen map tkm recurrent self organizing map rsom and recursive self organizing map recsom to characterize the responding behaviors of organisms we further assumed that recsom would have the best performance in detecting sbrms due to the double weight system devised within the network to validate this hypothesis we compared the quantization error produced during the training process across different time windows in this study we aimed to i compare performances of the selected temporal networks through training response behaviors after exposure to a toxic chemical ii discuss about the feasibility of clustering behavior segments by temporal soms and iii apply the selected temporal soms in short term time series behavior pattern recognition 2 material and methods 2 1 behavior analysis behavior responses of test organisms were measured continuously for 15 days after exposure to a toxic chemical atrazine atz 0 12 mg l 0 1 toxic unit in an online monitoring system ren et al 2007 solomon et al 2013 we used zebrafish danio rerio as the test organism to analyze behavior responses zebrafish have been frequently used as indicator species based on many advantages including rapid reproduction small size easy handling and high degree of homology with the human genome coe et al 2008 adult zebrafish with 3 4 cm in size were placed in a flow through test chamber approximately 7 cm long 5 cm in diameter provided with an electric field pan et al 2017 the response activity of zebrafish is reflected by two pairs of electrodes located at the inside walls of the test chambers which one pair of them sent a high frequency signal of altering current and the other ones are noncurrent carrying electrodes the disturbance signal of electric field within the chamber due to fish activity was transformed to digital data by a d transformers walden 1999 the signal from the flow through test chamber was sampled every second and average values of every 6 min 0 1 hour were used for analysis since behavioral responses at short term time 6 min was reported to be feasible for evaluating stressful conditions of organisms in the time scale ranging from several minutes to an hour empirically ren et al 2009 which could illustrate overall position changes but not represent immediate body responses such as trembling shaking and other body movements personal observations the signal of chemical treatment group was normalized between 0 either moribund or dying and 1 full activity with the control without treatment group database and coined as behavior strength ren et al 2007 the value of behavior strength which is an indicator to reflect movement activity indicates the intensity of behavior synthetically representing motility of the tested organism in this article temporal soms were supposed to cluster segments with similar behavior patterns normally if behavior response was intense at a certain time the behavior strength would fluctuate strongly for simplicity high changes of behavior would be regarded as strong segments and gentle response would be regards as weak segments the time window of 5 data points of behavior strengths 0 1 hour 5 0 5 hour are defined as segment in this study a typical example is shown in fig 1 four individuals in each chamber with four replications four chambers were used for measuring behavior strength and the separate behavior strength was used to indicate the behavior responses of zebrafish in total the data consisted of 14 400 points 3600 points 4 individuals 14 400 for training the networks 2 2 soms applied to temporal data as for the temporal som we first selected the temporal kohonen map tkm chappell and taylor 1993 which is one of the earlier temporal soms with a clear biological realism the modified tkm recurrent som rsom koskela et al 1998 was selected to compare with tkm their similarities generalize time delayed feedbacks finally the recursive som voegtlin and dominey 2002 was chosen as it could use a characteristically different algorithm with a time delayed copy of rsom activities allowing a homogeneous connection between feed forward and feed back updating procedures see sections 2 2 3 and 2 2 4 listed below for detailed explanations the positive control was regarded as general som training see section 3 2 1 general som compared with other temporal som methods 2 2 1 self organizing map som in the general som kohonen 1982 the nodes are arranged on a two dimensional grid with every neuron equipped with weights wi r fig 2 if input sequences to be denoted by x t x 1 xn where each element xt indicates a series of behavior strength data at time point t 1 t n the distance between input data and weight will be obtained by adopting equation 1 1 d i t x t w i t 2 where 2 denotes the euclidean distance once the winner node best matching unit bmu is determined which has the minimum distance between input element and neuron weight the weights are updated as equation 2 2 w i t 1 w i t γ t h i b t x t w i t where h i b t is the value of the neighborhood function and γ t 0 1 denotes the learning rate the parameters i and b in function h i b t denote the index of selected i and bmu respectively we chose the gaussian bell function h i b e d i b 2 σ 2 to narrow the training map to ensure the neuron specialization for initialization voegtlin and dominey 2002 fig 2 2 2 2 temporal kohonen map tkm and recurrent self organizing map rsom both tkm and rsom are similar since training could be mainly based on recurrent operations applied to input data sequences both algorithms tkm and rsom use the leaky integration to compute the distance applied between input and weight but they are different in expression of the context training varsta et al 2001 for tkm the activation term the first component in right side of eq 3 would be subtracted from the euclidean difference between input and weight fig 2 based on equation 3 3 d i t α d i t 1 1 2 x t w i t 2 where α 0 1 denotes a memory constant which controls the level of context decay the neuron with the maximum activity indicates the bmu the update rule of tkm takes place through hebbian learning at each time step in the similar way as for the standard som fig 2 in rsom activation terms are updated in lining with the difference between input and weight eq 4 whereas the activation could be updated through subtraction of euclidean distance in tkm as stated above fig 2 based on equation 4 4 y i t 1 α y i t 1 α x t w i t where yi t denotes the leaked quantity of neuron i at time step t with the coefficient α analogous to the one in tkm the rsom produces the context in a larger space than tkm since the directions are stored as vectors either plus or minus instead of the scalar euclidean distance koskela et al 1998 the bmu is the minimum leaked quantity at each step in rsom whereas the bmu is the maximum leaked quantity in tkm chappell and taylor 1993 in addition the previous weight was used for updating the current weight in both tkm and som but the weight was updated in association with activation changes in rsom see varsta et al 2001 for details 2 2 3 recursive self organizing map recsom recsom is essentially different from tkm and rsom regarding the following features i each neuron in recsom has two dimensional weights ii input sequencing and iii map activation whereas the previous two networks tkm and rsom have only one dimension of weight for input sequencing fig 2 w i x t neuron weight associated with input sequence x t at time t w i y t neuron containing map activations y i t 1 associated with the context once the distance between the current input and weight was calculated the current activation weight map w i y and previous activation map by yi were produced concurrently fig 2 the combination of these two dimension weights could be defined as quantization errors of recsom eq 5 5 e i t α x t w i x t 2 β y i t 1 w i y t 2 in which α and β are constants above 0 the bmu in recsom could be defined as the unit that minimizes ei using y i t e i t directly would result in unstable representations a transfer function y i f e i which is opted to achieve stable convergence see voegtlin and dominey 2002 for detail convenient transfer functions are exponential function as shown in equation 6 6 y i e x p e i finally current activation weight maps and activation maps in recsom are changed according to update rule respectively as shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 w i x t 1 w i x t γ t h i b t x t w i x t 8 w i y t 1 w i y t γ t h i b t y t 1 w i y t 2 3 training the networks the behavior strength data with the time window of 5 points are given as input for the three temporal soms tkm rsom recsom and general som equally the sample units are 14 400 points in a sequence while the variable represents a series of vectors consisting of behavior strength in 5 time points the time window was overlapped with 1 unit for each iteration see section 2 1 behavioral data according to vesanto et al 2000 the initial number of nodes was 600 3600 4 5 600 in the present study various ranges in the number of nodes based on the convergence efficiency and detectability of segments were analyzed with the number 289 17 17 we opted the square map instead of the rectangular map to observe the gradient of data e g time and bs values equally on horizontal and vertical axes similar to the previous study varsta et al 1997 we set α in tkm as 0 3 and rsom as 0 6 voegtlin and dominey 2002 the α and β values for recsom were identified as 2 and 0 06 respectively voegtlin and dominey 2002 we adjusted the values as 3 and 0 06 for α and β in recsom respectively regarding quantization error minimization and convergence performance in our study to check the feasibility of tkm rsom and recsom we initially tested with the well known data set of the mackey glass chaotic time series in eq 9 which has been already used for testing temporal som networks similar to voegtlin and dominey 2002 9 d x t d t α x t τ 1 x 10 t τ β x t where α and β are 0 2 and 0 1 respectively series begin chaos when τ the delay constant was above 16 8 we calculated the chaotic time series though 4th order runge kutta method süli and mayers 2003 to resolve the eq 9 fig 3 time window of 20 units was used for training which means a cluster of 20 sequential units is used as input for each training iteration similar to the reports of kohonen 2014 linear initialization was used to speed up training process with more stable results before training the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data were aligned along the dimension of the map grid to have greatest eigenvectors see kohonen 2001 for detail in this study we performed matlab based the mathworks r2014a data analysis the learning process of the som was conducted using the som toolbox vesanto et al 2000 developed by the laboratory of information and computer science helsinki university of technology http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox we tested general som to evaluate the performance of temporal networks while the constant values were used in the temporal soms as stated above we allowed the learning rate to change in each iteration in general som with the updating rule α a t b in which a and b would be chosen suitably in som toolbox version 2 0 b could be equal to the length of input data minus 1 and divided by 99 and a b α i n i α i n i 0 5 in rough training and α i n i 0 05 in finetune training in default 3 results 3 1 mackey glass time series detection of time series data was observed for each method even though differences were observed among the methods fig 4 the temporal soms were tested by mackey glass series before patterning the behavior strength data tkm was effective in detecting high level changes fig 5 2c due to tkm s strong response to context with the current segment applying the euclidean distance invariably eq 3 comparing with rsom which calculates the current criterion by input minus weight allowing negative values sometimes eq 4 but the tkm was limited in clustering the detected nodes fig 4a all the nodes were spread over the map without showing clear groupings of the nodes or gradients over the map in x t changes recurrent som showed better clustering when being compared with tkm but clustering was not found to be more effective than in tkm in finding strong segments of x t although a few strong segments were detected in the map fig 4b as stated above allowing negative values in updating activation of rsom contributed to decrease in the response of activation to strong segments as shown in fig 4c both strong and weak segments were recognized in recursive som even though clustering was not better illustrative in comparing to rsom the main frame of clustering was formed although a few isolating nodes were produced in the map cluster formation was substantially better than tkm considering the equations of recsom eqs 7 and 8 both the input and the time delayed copy of activities are analogous to single input vector in the classical som algorithm hence each unit of the map will learn to represent a couple of input and context recursively and then the homogeneous connections between them could be achieved 3 2 behavior strength time series in som 3 2 1 general som we trained the general som with the same dataset under similar conditions performed in the temporal networks for comparison convergence was achieved faster for 28 768 iterations with proper clustering along the vertical axis fig 5 1a however som was ineffectual to detect the strong segments fig 5 1c which suggested that the general som was not effective in detecting the strong segments almost all the grouped segments were flat although groups showed the gradient of behavior strength fairly well from low to high levels 3 2 2 temporal kohonen map tkm subsequently we tested the temporal networks with the same behavior strength data similar trends to the results of temporal som were observed as shown in mackey glass curve fig 4 tkm showed fast convergence capacity with practically lower level of errors for nearly 20 000 iterations fig 5 2b quantization errors decreased sharply beyond 20 000 iterations with the final quantization error equal to 0 062 as shown in fig 5 2c strong segments were effectively found to be similar to the case of mackay glass series fig 4 a the vertical bar indicates the higher red color and lower blue color levels of behavior strength fig 5 2c in tkm however the levels of behavior strength showed no gradient but randomly spread over the entire map seemingly without any regularity fig 5 2d shows the number of segments grouped in each node it was noteworthy that a large number of segments grouped at a small number of nodes showing extremely higher variability in the number of grouped nodes that range from 1 to 1003 for example at the top right corner of the map several nodes had a remarkably large number of segments this corner matched the late time locally red color shown in the vertical bar however the overall time gradient was not observed in the entire map fig 5 2d 3 2 3 recurrent som the convergence was slowly achieved in rsom for nearly 100 000 iterations with the final quantization error equal to 0 097 fig 5 3a when being compared with the tkm fig 5 2a quantitation errors which decreased gradually as the training proceeded were not as much fluctuating as in tkm it was noteworthy that rsom clustering shown in fig 5 3a was comparatively better than clusters of tkm fig 5 2a the higher red color and lower blue color levels of behavior strength well aligned and could be observed at the bottom area and top areas of the map respectively fig 5 3c it was suggested that rsom was not effective to recognize segments with a strong change in behavior strengths curves were predominantly flat and only a few strong curves were found in the map red circle for an example fig 5 3c in contrast to the case of mackey glass time series fig 4b grouped segments within the nodes were greater ranges 1 120 in rsom compared to tkm the time gradients appeared in the late period located at the top left area of the map fig 5 3b 3 2 4 recursive som recsom effectively identified both strong and weak segments and achieved relatively faster convergence through training fig 5 4b c among the target networks strong segments were well identified in the map the higher red color and lower blue color levels of behavior strength were well aligned in the left and right areas of the map respectively strong segments were more frequently observed in the intermediate to higher levels of behavior strengths whereas flat curves were mostly found in the area of lower levels close to toxic effects convergence was achieved faster but comparatively slower than tkm strong fluctuation in quantitation error lasted for nearly 40 000 iterations with the final quantization error equal to 0 048 comparing with 20 000 iterations with tkm fig 5 4b clusters were formed with a few outlier nodes in the map fig 5 4a although the clustering was not as complete as in the case of rsom fig 5 3a 3 2 5 comparing temporal soms in order to compare the efficiency of three temporal som methods we checked quantization errors across different time windows overall recsom showed the 1owest range in quantitazation errors fig 6 the errors of tkm were consistently higher than recsom linearly increasing with the enlargement of time windows in a series rsom showed higher levels of error in a similar range across different time windows the time window of rsom for 11quantization error was comparatively smaller than tkm therefore recsom has a better accuracy than others in most cases and rsom has the best robustness 4 discussion our study demonstrates the feasibility of temporal som networks in clustering short term time series data when test organisms are exposed to a toxic chemical fig 5 the results suggested that temporal soms were all better in detecting behavior strength segments comparing with regular som the results match our hypothesis that temporal soms are more suitable in addressing time series behavioral changes indicating existence of time delayed effects during the procedure of behavior responses after exposure to stressor moreover the quantization error could be occurred minimum for recsom fig 6 which further supports our second hypothesis that recsom performs better than tkm and rsom in detecting the short term time series behavior strengths since visualization of som is one of the advantages in data analysis clustering of different segments could be effectively presented each segment pattern is separately addressed in the map in accordance with the behavior strength levels and time fig 7 shows examples of detected nodes in som fig 7a matched with each empirical sbrm fig 7b and the detected nodes in fig 5 4c remarkably matches different modes of sbrm inset a stimulation higher behavior strength was followed by lower behavior strength resulted due to initial toxic stimulation in a small degree on zebrafish inset b acclimation the intermediate higher behavior strength levels were reduced rapidly due to strong sensitivity to the toxic chemical on zebrafish inset c adjustment behavior strength levels were slightly increased with an initiation of partial recover inset d readjustment increasing in the behavior strength values followed by decreasing in the behavior strength values indicates recover response of zebrafish against chemical toxicity inset e toxic effect flat lower values of behavior strength at minimum level indicate the moribund or dying state of zebrafish it is also noteworthy that there are other nodes on som with slight variation associating with the typical patterns as shown in segment patterns in the trained maps e g fig 5 4 fig 7 which indicates that the network could further find variants of sbrm more studies are warranted in this aspect to precisely define the varieties of behavior modes with additional training for the temporal soms to our knowledge the present study is the first to report on clustering of short term time series behavior data after exposure to toxic chemical although the temporal soms were previously applied to other fields of study including engineering horio and yamakawa 2001 generally time series data are analyzed by autocorrelation or fourier transform function periodicity of response behaviors under chemical stress was described based on the autocorrelation analyses to observe varying responses at different factors such as chemicals and concentrations ren et al 2019 yang et al 2018 however temporal soms are more suitable for detecting the short term time series data whereas autocorrelation could be applicable only for long time data to find periodicity residing within the data sets in our study we intend to detect the short term time series data specifically within a time window 0 5 h in this study since sbrm are observed in a short sequence for practical diagnosing purpose zhang et al 2012 although strong segments the fluctuation of behavior is large were well detected on mackey glass time series of rsom fig 4b the strong segments were not well found in the behavioral data fig 5 3c this might be due to complexity residing in behavioral data in mackey glass time series all curves are similar in behavior data however behavior strength values were extremely variable across different levels as shown in fig 1 rsom was limited in extracting information from the data with extreme fluctuations since soms are heuristic models global optima could not be obtained easily the parameters and initial conditions must be determined empirically based on trials and errors in order to partly overcome this difficulty linear initialization methods have been proposed by kohonen kohonen 2001 to narrow down the training range in the initial stage although initialization helps to convergence there are numerous parameter combinations to be tested with more theoretical studies are required for describing the importance of convergence space in the temporal network possibly a study on extrapolation of convergence properties of soms in topology conservation ritter and schulten 1988 for instance in the future an additional approach would be utilized to recognize capability of som we used the trained som to detect each input segment on the real time series on line detection system would be useful for monitoring a certain mode or a series of modes observed in sbrm fig 5 5 conclusion our study proved the feasibility of temporal som networks in detecting short term time series behavior response data of organisms under chemical stress conditions each state in sbrm is specifically matched with the detected segments by the trained temporal soms overall recsom was most suitable for identifying the segments matching the empirical sbrm considering segments detectability and clustering formation tkm is effective in detecting strong curves but limited in clustering recurrent som was faster in convergence but ineffective in detecting strong segments
