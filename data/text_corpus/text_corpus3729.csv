18645,greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting have the potential to increase the resilience of water management and reduce the need for investment in conventional water supply schemes however their water savings would partly depend on the location and built form of urban development and hence its household sizes and rainwater per dwelling we have therefore tested how spatial planning options would affect the future viability of alternative water supply in the greater south east of england our integrated modelling framework for the first time forecasts the future densities and variability of built form to provide inputs to the modelling of alternative water supply we show that using projections of the existing housing stock would have been unsound and that using standard dwelling types and household sizes would have substantially overestimated the water savings by not fully representing how the variability in dwelling dimensions and household sizes would affect the cost effectiveness of these systems we compare the spatial planning trend over a 30 year period with either compaction at higher densities within existing urban boundaries or market led more dispersed development we show how the viability of alternative water supply would differ between these three spatial planning options the water savings of rainwater harvesting would vary greatly at a regional scale depending on residential densities and rainfall greywater recycling would be less affected by spatial planning but would have a finer balance between system costs and water savings and its feasibility would vary locally depending on household sizes and water efficiency the sensitivity of the water savings to differences in rainfall and water prices would vary with residential density the findings suggest that forecasts of residential densities rainfall and the water price could be used in conjunction with more detailed local studies to indicate how spatial planning would affect the future water saving potential of alternative water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords greywater recycling rainwater harvesting residential density land use forecasting dwelling typologies household size 1 introduction future water shortages are expected in many parts of the world due to climate change and increasing population and incomes alcamo et al 2007 the greater south east of england already has seriously water stressed areas environment agency 2013 and the frequency of droughts is projected to increase met office 2011 this has led to increased interest in developing plans for water resource management that are resilient in the face of urbanisation and climate change defra 2016 current linear urban water management practices require a transition to more circular urban water management butler et al 2011 with reduced import of water high rates of recycling and reduced export of wastewater and stormwater alternative sources of water supply such as greywater recycling gwr and rainwater harvesting rwh could have a role to play in this transition the uk water companies are required to produce water resources management plans that look ahead 25 years taking into account climate change and population growth and consider options for bulk water transfers between water company areas environment agency et al 2012 alternative water supply aws at the building scale may therefore be beneficial if this helps to generate a surplus that could be redistributed to reduce the need for major investments such as reservoirs conventional water supply in most countries is subsidised through supportive measures for large projects analogous subsidy measures should be considered for aws for appropriate comparative analysis campisano et al 2017 and its financial benefits on a regional scale may be much more significant than the benefit to the individual consumer friedler and hadari 2006 although there has been a reasonable uptake of aws for commercial and public buildings the uptake for residential buildings is low this is probably due to the multiplicity of stakeholders such as planners developers owners and occupiers and uncertainties about its cost effectiveness and acceptability to households domestic water demand is a substantial and growing proportion of water consumption therefore understanding the long term potential of aws for dwellings would be a useful step towards a whole system assessment of water management plans decisions on the provision of policy support would require a long term perspective because the rate of introduction of aws could only be relatively slow new build in the uk only adds around 1 per year to the housing stock and the retrofitting of existing dwellings would probably only occur when convenient such as during refurbishment the water savings and costs of aws systems depend on regional scale factors such as rainfall and water prices they also depend on factors that vary from dwelling to dwelling such as water consumption per person household size and roof area morales pinzón et al 2015 previous modelling of aws has been either for specific dwellings friedler and hadari 2006 or existing areas using dwelling typologies kim and furumai 2012 palla et al 2012 however household sizes and roof areas vary with residential density and new build in the future will be different from the past spatial planning constrains the release of land for urban development and hence the location and density of dwellings as evidenced by comparing london which is constrained within a green belt with the sprawl of some north american cities or the ribbons of urbanisation in flanders the demand for residential land is generally greater in areas with good access to jobs and amenities and if demand exceeds supply housing will tend to increase in density over time hence the demand for housing changes spatially as a result of population growth socio economic transformation and transport improvements forecasting urban development therefore requires a model von thünen 1826 and cannot be estimated simply by projections from the existing housing stock mitchell et al 2001 recognised the need for integration between built form and households when modelling catchment water cycles existing dwellings were represented in their aquacycle model as blocks and groups of dwellings as clusters models have since been developed for testing urban water management options such as uwot makropoulos et al 2008 kim and furumai 2012 used five building types to model rwh options for an existing residential district and found that half of the water savings would be for dwellings far exceeding any other building type their analysis did not consider cost effectiveness possibly because in japan about half of the installation cost would be subsidised by local government thames water 2017 considered the feasibility and costs of aws for planned housing developments but only tested aws for two dwelling types low rise or high rise each with an assumed household size the switch project used 49 unit blocks for characterising existing land use mackay and last 2010 but only 8 were residential and they were not designed for modelling future development the main limitation of the above studies is that they rely on inputs of urban growth densities and households a number of studies have used urban models for testing urban water management scenarios urich and rauch 2014a these have mostly used cellular automata models for the bottom up dynamic simulation of the urban development process urich and rauch 2014b combined a cellular automata model described in sitzenfrei et al 2013 with drainage modelling they simulated a range of urban development scenarios and found that spatial planning policy would be one of the factors that would affect flood risk the limitations of cellular automata models are that they are based on transition rules specified by the user and they require inputs of urban growth they do not model the location choice of firms and households and so they are unsuitable for modelling radical changes in regional spatial planning and transport policies willuweit and o sullivan 2013 used the moland model this included a macro level system dynamics model to spatially allocate regional development but only for the trend which was then represented by cellular automata modelling to provide inputs to a water balance model this used 4 hectare grid cells but without details of the dwellings and households and gwr and rwh were included but based on user inputs of assumed capacities and percentage uptakes this lack of detail means that the aws water savings were estimated rather than modelled polebitski et al 2011 coupled a water demand model with the urbansim model waddell et al 2010 to forecast regional domestic water demand urbansim does include the behavioural choice modelling of land use and transport but it dynamically explores the urban development processes using numerous micro simulations and this would have unnecessarily complicated our research the above models have used either grid cell or parcel based representations of neighbourhood layouts where each grid cell or parcel is represented by buildings and floor space for a typical development type for example urbansim used 2 25 ha grid cells and more recently parcels with typically 25 development types of which 8 are residential and 8 mixed use however this leads to difficulties matching and reconciling data sources such as allocating census tract household data to the residential floor space of individual parcels or matching map data with model outputs abraham et al 2005 we have chosen to use a land use and transport interaction luti model that includes behavioural choice modelling and converges to a partial equilibrium for a given forecast year echenique et al 2013 this type of model is well established in practice for testing spatial planning options and produces stable forecasts for testing the aws scenarios for reviews of urban modelling see hensher et al 2004 we use an innovative statistical method of converting the forecasts of the luti model into an abstract representation of the housing stock and land use with sufficient detail to test aws systems for individual dwellings hargreaves 2015 the findings presented in this paper are the outcome of multi disciplinary research that has for the first time developed an integrated modelling framework to test how regional spatial planning would affect the potential of building scale water technologies water companies have expressed a strong interest in using this type of model as a collaborative planning tool for constructive engagement with planning authorities on high level scenario analysis it could enable focused optioneering on the spatial supply and demand for water depending on where land is likely to be developed its density and land use types government agencies have also recognised the value of an integrated modelling tool to test the sustainability of options at an early stage of the planning process and the east of england regional development agency supported this objective by funding the development of the state of the art luti model that we used for our research our modelling framework could easily be enhanced to encompass all aspects of water management related to spatial development however for clarity and conciseness we demonstrate its capabilities by testing gwr and rwh scenarios the modelling is an aid to understanding how interactions between the relevant factors would affect future outcomes rather than attempting to forecast actual water savings we therefore exclude some variables unrelated to spatial planning that would have made our findings more opaque because of their differing effects on the uptake of aws such as its acceptability to developers and households we show how spatial planning options would affect the future viability of aws systems and the importance of researching this within an urban modelling framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 research context 2 1 1 the study area the greater south east of england has a population of over 20 million ons 2014 consisting of london and its surrounding regions the urban areas are quite compact due to planning constraints such as local plans green belts and areas of outstanding natural beauty to protect green space from urban sprawl we chose electoral wards as the most appropriate level of spatial detail for the urban modelling because these are the smallest areas that had all the planning data needed for carrying out the research there are 3 218 wards in the greater south east ranging in size from around 220 to 23 000 people with average population of 7 040 fig 1 a shows their average densities in year 2001 as dwellings per hectare of residential land dph fig 1b shows that the average household size per ward varies greatly with smaller households in the remote areas and some high density areas see appendix a1 1 of the supplementary materials for further details 2 1 2 forecast period we have tested scenarios for a forecast year of 2031 this is the furthest point in the future for which sufficient information existed about local planning policies a base year of 2001 was chosen because this had the most complete dataset at the time of carrying out the research this 30 year period allows a sufficient amount of demographic and socioeconomic change for clear differences to emerge between the base year and the forecast year the population was projected to increase from 8 8 million in 2001 to around 12 1 million in 2031 2 2 research inputs 2 2 1 future availability of residential land in urban areas we have used household projections from the uk national trip end model dft 2009 and density targets from the local development frameworks of the local authorities we have combined these densities and additional households to estimate how much land the local authorities expect to become available within urban boundaries over the forecast period such as by redeveloping industrial sites land outside urban boundaries is estimated from gis data on land use and protected areas we refer to dwellings that existed in the base year and would still exist in the forecast year as existing and those that would be built during the forecast period as new build 2 2 2 water consumption we collected data from the water resources management plans environment agency et al 2012 of the relevant water companies for each water resource zone wrz a wrz is the largest possible zone in which all resources can be shared and in which all customers will experience the same risk of supply failure from a resource shortfall there are 49 wrzs in the greater south east and they range from a few hundred to over 3 million households this data includes the micro components of water use for metered and unmetered households toilet flushing clothes washing outdoor use bathroom washbasins showers baths dishwashing and miscellaneous both for recent years and projections for the forecast year in litres per person per day l p d fig 2 uses toilet flushing as an example to show that projected water consumption varies considerably within the study area toilet flushing is around 20 of total domestic water use we assume each ward would have the same water consumption per person as the wrz within which it lies see appendix a1 2 2 2 2 3 rainfall we have used annual average rainfall and number of wet days appendix a1 1 for the period 1981 to 2010 met office 2011 and there are marked differences in rainfall with the east being generally drier than the west we assume that the rainfall per ward is the same as the nearest weather station fig 3 2 3 the integrated modelling framework the flow chart in fig 4 illustrates our integrated modelling framework the remainder of section 2 describes its components and scenario design inputs the spatial scales of the inputs models and outputs are summarised in table 1 2 3 1 luti model the luti model forecasts the spatial allocation of employment households and population it had been calibrated for the base year so that its outputs per zone matched the base year data the inputs included industrial consumption and production per sector employment households and population by socio economic classification residential and non domestic land floor space property prices and transport network times costs and capacities the model endogenously generates rents to balance demand and supply using an iterative procedure this includes not only quantitative aspects of utility such as cost and time but also qualitative aspects such as what consumers of land are willing to tolerate in order to have a lower monetary rent for example living in a high rise building projections had been input to the model of the land available for development and transport capacities a forecast had been produced for year 2011 for validation purposes and also for the 2031 forecast year the model calibration and data sources are described in echenique et al 2013 2 3 2 tiles model the average residential densities per ward from the luti model are systematically converted into tiles to represent the dwellings and associated residential land each tile represents one hectare of residential land occupied by dwellings of predefined dimensions and plot size we chose to use 20 tile types as shown in fig 5 the tiles act as a database of the housing stock and residential land use there are two versions of each tile type to represent either existing dwellings or new build dwellings the tiles model had been calibrated using english housing survey clg 2009 census and gis data dclg 2005 to deterministically produce the expected frequency distribution of plot size per dwelling type found to be a gamma distribution for any given average density and age of dwellings it then systematically selects a set of tiles to approximate this frequency distribution this includes whole and fractions of tiles so that the summing of all the tiles matches the residential land and dwellings per ward as forecast by the luti model see appendix a1 4 for further details the method calibration and validation are described in hargreaves 2015 these discrete tiles are useful as a shared medium for multidisciplinary research hargreaves et al 2017 this simultaneous matching of the land dwellings and variability of their plot sizes would have been very difficult to achieve if using a land parcel or grid cell method the tiles method can achieve this because the tiles are an abstract representation of the land use and dwellings without being constrained to match a predesigned layout simulating the future layout of residential areas is unnecessary for testing aws systems for individual buildings 2 3 3 household model the inputs to the household model are the tiles and population per ward the luti model takes into account the socio economic classification of households when forecasting population per unit area of floor space which thereby indirectly forecasts the household size per dwelling per ward the office for national statistics and the english housing survey provided data on the numbers of occupants per dwelling type per ward these are then proportionally adjusted per ward using doubly constrained estimation to match the total households and population per ward as forecasts by the luti model hence these household sizes per dwelling type change over the forecast period and vary both spatially and between the spatial planning options 2 3 4 aws models of the water savings one of the strengths of our novel method is that data specific to each tile are input directly to the aws models i e its dwelling dimensions household size water demands land use and rainfall these models then calculate at building scale whether aws would be feasible and if so its water savings thereby completing a calibrated chain of modelling from regional to building scale the water savings and system costs are summed per tile and then aggregated per ward or to whatever spatial scale of output is required we have assumed that the supply of greywater for recycling would only be from bathroom washing and bathing facilities and that harvested rainwater would only be from dwelling roof tops for hygiene reasons the water saving efficiency of an aws system depends on its storage capacity and the temporal balance between the supply and demand for non potable water not all of the available inflow will be used because this may either temporally exceed the available storage or the water demand may exceed supply and the tank runs dry the amount that is used and results in a water saving is known as the yield y e min c q where y y i e l d l i t r e s e e f f i c i e n c y o f w a t e r s a v i n g c n o n p o t a b l e d e m a n d l i t r e s q i n f l o w o f n o n p o t a b l e w a t e r t o t h e s t o r a g e t a n k l i t r e s the water saving efficiency for rainwater harvesting is normally calculated using functions that include the dimensionless parameters of the demand fraction d and storage fraction s fewkes 2000 d c q s s q where s s t o r a g e t a n k c a p a c i t y m 3 we have only tested basic aws systems that had known and calibrated parameters for calculating their water saving efficiency at the time of carrying out the research these parameters are from published research that simulated systems supplying water for toilet flushing only and they take into account the temporal inconsistencies of water demand and supply this enabled us to model water savings and system sizes using the inputs per tile of roof areas rainfall and household water demands for the gwr systems we use water saving efficiencies of 0 85 for household systems those that serve an individual dwelling and 0 9 for communal systems those that serve multiple apartments from liu et al 2010 however rwh systems can vary greatly in efficiency because roof area household size and rainfall vary between dwellings we use the modified storage fraction method devised by campisano and modica 2012 that includes annual rainfall and the ratio of dry days to wet days this enables us to better represent the differing climates from the drier east to the wetter west campisano et al 2013 fitted regression curves to simulation results for sites in climate areas of italy classified using the köppen geiger classification scheme kottek et al 2006 we use their regression coefficients for areas in italy with temperate climate without a dry season which have similar rainfall to the greater south east our resulting water saving efficiencies appendix a1 5 2 closely match those of the unmodified method in the literature fewkes 2000 palla et al 2011 we assume that these systems would be designed in accordance with the relevant british standard code of practice bsi 2009 bsi 2010 which recommend regular replenishment of stored water to avoid stagnation daily for gwr and every 18 days for rwh this has little effect on the water savings of gwr because the daily supply of greywater and the demands for toilet flushing are relatively consistent however it does limit the water saving potential of rwh because it restricts the tank size to 18 365 days of rainfall volume i e to a maximum storage fraction of 0 05 note that codes of practice and regulations vary internationally and can be conflicting yu et al 2013 and tend to be more supportive in water scarce countries oron et al 2014 aws systems can also supply a wider range of uses than toilet flushing such as clothes washing and irrigation but these are more temporally inconsistent calibrated parameters for modelling their water saving efficiency and system size were unavailable in the literature and more recent research on this topic such as campisano and lupia 2017 is still local and case study specific we would have needed to make dwelling specific assumptions about appliances and user behaviour to design such systems and this would have been impracticable for our regional scale modelling if we had included the supply of water for irrigation this may have affected our findings due to the effects of spatial planning on future garden sizes however this is unlikely to have affected our results because these water savings would be limited by constraints such as storage time the temporal inconsistency of clothes washing and garden irrigation and for gwr the presence of chemicals in the greywater 2 3 5 feasibility test of aws per tile we have devised a feasibility test to exclude aws if it would clearly not be cost effective for a dwelling to make the findings easier to interpret we assume that all areas would have the same water supply price of 3 5 m3 which is at the top of the current range aws is selected for a dwelling if its cost savings on mains water supply would exceed its overall cost within a payback period of 35 years this is substantially longer than a commercially acceptable rate of return on investment but may be conceivable for assessing social value applying this lenient test to both gwr and rwh ensures that sufficient systems are selected to clearly show how the spatial planning scenarios would affect the future viability of aws we estimated the capital operating and maintenance costs from a review of the literature including environment agency 2011 friedler and hadari 2006 melville shreeve et al 2016 the rwh system costs vary depending on the modelled storage tank capacity for gwr a standard system cost has been assumed for household systems but the cost would be less for communal systems due to economies of scale and reduces depending on the number of apartments per block the feasibility of gwr varies depending on the combination of the water price system cost and the supply and use of greywater per dwelling calculated from its household size and the micro components of water demand per person based on our assumptions household gwr would become noticeably less feasible in areas with less than around 2 2 occupants per dwelling these factors also affect rwh but its feasibility depends more on rainfall and roof areas for further details see appendix a1 6 2 4 scenario design inputs 2 4 1 spatial planning options we have estimated the inputs for the trend option from the local development frameworks of the local authorities the new build would be on brownfield land with good public transport access the trend policy has greater constraints on the release of land than in the past and so the densities of new build are forecast to be generally higher than existing dwellings with a greater proportion of terraced houses and apartments this would be similar to many other city regions that are pursuing smart growth planning policies to constrain sprawl and reduce the need for car travel spatial planning affects where new dwellings are located and hence their household sizes and built form and so we tested two distinct spatial planning options to compare with the trend option these comprise of compaction for which all future urban development would be by infilling at higher densities within existing urban boundaries and market led which would allow development on green field land in the areas with strongest demand for housing and at lower densities than the trend these represent differing views on the priorities for urban development with compaction aiming to reduce car travel and energy consumption whereas market led responds to the countervailing socioeconomic pressures for an increase in housing supply where there is greatest demand the three options are designed by adjusting the inputs to the luti model on the amounts of residential land available for development per ward the luti model then endogenously allocates the employment households and population to the wards and the resulting residential densities are processed into the tiles and their household sizes 2 4 2 luti model forecasts table 2 summarises the spatial options using a selection of variables and fig 6 shows the outputs of the luti model for the new build dwellings and their average densities per ward london would have the biggest increase in dwellings over the forecast period and as expected this would be greatest for compaction and least for the more dispersed market led option compaction would result in higher densities than the trend whereas market led would be the least constrained but would still have high densities in areas with the greatest demand for housing consequently compaction would result in more apartments and terraced houses than the trend whereas market led would have more detached and semi detached houses and consume the greatest amount of land appendix a1 7 has further details 2 4 3 estimating the percentage of imperviousness of residential areas to illustrate the broader capabilities of our integrated modelling framework we have estimated the average percentage of imperviousness pimp of residential land see appendix a1 8 for details compaction would result in urban infilling often with high rise apartments next to lower density existing houses whereas new build for the other spatial options would be constrained by local planning policies to be more similar to its surroundings apartments typically include some green space whereas the gardens of high density houses are mostly paved consequently if comparing wards of the same overall average density in the forecast year the imperviousness of these areas would be lower for compaction than the trend our findings closely correspond with the average pimps reported in butler et al 2018 for existing residential areas of london of 50 for apartments and 55 for dense housing the advantage of our method is that it can be used to model the impacts of spatial planning policies on the future pimp of residential land 2 4 4 water demand scenarios existing dwellings would have water company estimates of water consumption as a weighted average of metered and unmetered households there are two scenarios for new build comprising of either the water company demand projections for metered dwellings or a water efficiency scenario of 120 l p d that reflects the water efficiency requirements of uk building regulations table 3 shows these water demand scenarios the water demand scenarios are input as micro components of consumption per average person in a wrz this simplifying assumption may result in some underestimation of the differences in water consumption between spatial planning options however separating the correlated effects of household income plot size and water use in order to understand how spatial planning would affect water demands per dwelling would have required further research 2 4 5 aws system scenarios as shown in table 4 household gwr systems are considered for all dwellings and household rwh for houses only this is based on the optimistic assumption that suitable retrofitting opportunities would arise during the forecast period communal aws systems are only considered for new build apartments because the feasibility of networks between houses or retrofitting existing apartments would depend on site specific factors beyond the scope of our study we have not tested hybrid systems because dixon et al 1999 found that there was limited advantage in extending a gwr system to also include rwh communal systems may be suitable for some houses if densely clustered but their costs water saving efficiency and applicability would have required research at a more detailed scale only a small proportion of new build houses are likely to be suitably clustered for the trend but the proportion would be more significant for compaction however communal systems particularly for gwr are less acceptable to occupants than household systems domènech and saurí 2010 ward et al 2013 and this may limit their future uptake for houses therefore only testing communal systems for apartments is unlikely to have affected our findings 3 results 3 1 impact of spatial factors on the feasibility of aws the feasibility of gwr would be positively correlated with household size and water consumption per person but this would be less apparent for rwh because roof areas and rainfall are more crucial for its feasibility appendix a2 1 provides further details new build is directly affected by spatial planning and in the longer term will become an increasingly large proportion of the housing stock and installing aws as part of new build is more practicable than retrofitting fig 7 therefore shows the average water savings per person per ward for the new build of the trend calculated as the sum of the water savings for new build divided by the sum of the occupants of all new build dwellings the scatter plots illustrate how these water savings vary between wards of similar density the lines show the average value rather than purporting to be a trend the maps illustrate how water savings would differ greatly between adjacent wards indicating that targeting the most appropriate technology to a locality would require spatial detailed modelling the feasibility of household gwr would be finely balanced between its water savings and its cost per household and so the water savings of gwr fig 7a would be low for many wards but for a few it would meet almost all of the water demand for toilet flushing described in section 2 2 2 this shows the importance of modelling future household sizes and water demands household gwr would rarely be cost effective in wards with small households and or low water demands as can be seen by comparing its water savings with figs 1b and 2 however the water savings of rwh fig 7b vary less between wards of similar density because they are more closely related to rainwater supply they would therefore be low in higher density areas because these have less roof area per dwelling appendix a1 1 and also in dryer areas e g east of london 3 2 comparison of the aws water savings between the spatial options fig 8 shows the dwellings and water savings aggregated to the wrz scale for existing dwellings and the new build of each spatial option appendix a2 2 1 explains the aggregation process there would be clear differences in water savings between existing and new build especially for rapidly growing urban areas such as london gwr would be more viable for new build than existing because our scenarios included communal systems for new build apartments conversely rwh would be slightly less viable for new build than existing because new build would generally be of higher density spatial planning would obviously affect not only the built form of new build but also how the future water demands would be distributed spatially within the study area the water savings therefore differ spatially between the spatial options depending on both the amount of development and how spatial factors affect its suitability for aws compaction with gwr fig 8b would have the greatest water savings for the urban centres such as london partly because it would have the greatest increase in dwellings in these areas fig 8a and partly because they would be at higher densities with a greater proportion of apartments conversely rwh fig 8c is best suited to lower density areas and so its water savings would be greater for the more dispersed lower density development of the market led option these findings show the importance of taking into account spatial planning if formulating long term policy support for aws 3 3 the relationships between residential density and potential water savings the following charts show the average water savings per person within 10 dph wide average density bands to smooth out some of the variability i e the total water savings divided by the total occupants for all wards within the average density band for either existing or new build at higher densities these water savings per person are greater for new build than existing due to the communal systems and this is particularly noticeable for gwr fig 9 a the water savings of rwh fig 9b generally decline with increasing density due to less roof area per person the water savings of aws would be much lower for the water efficiency scenario because although communal systems would still be feasible household systems would rarely be cost effective with such low water demands although the results for household and communal systems are not shown separately those for new build household systems are similar to those for existing household systems we have tested new build with either 0 50 higher or 0 50 lower water prices fig 9c shows that the water savings for gwr are very sensitive to water price especially in low and medium density areas because if the water price were lower then fewer household gwr systems would pass our feasibility test and vice versa communal gwr is less sensitive to water price because its cost per dwelling would be lower this suggests that the future feasibility of gwr would increase if household systems could be better tailored to suit different household sizes and characteristics rwh would be more robust to uncertainties about future water prices fig 9d however its water savings would be sensitive to rainfall because this has a greater affect on its cost effectiveness particularly in higher density areas where dwellings have less roof area per occupant see appendix a2 2 2 further research could more fully explore the impacts of climate change by using rainfall projections 3 4 comparison with methods that use standard dwelling typologies and household sizes previous models thi hoang duong et al 2011 kim and furumai 2012 thames water 2017 used an average household size per dwelling type and or standard dwelling typologies we therefore compare our findings with those that we would have obtained by using these more aggregate methods fig 10 a compares the gwr water savings for new build using average household size per dwelling type with our results shown in fig 9a i e using household sizes of 2 5 2 4 2 3 and 1 7 for detached semidetached terraced and apartments respectively from uk census data using these average household sizes would have substantially overestimated the water savings of gwr for wards with average density less than around 55 dph i e most of the wards the reason is that household gwr systems are less feasible for smaller households and many wards have smaller than average households see fig 1b therefore a method that assumes average household sizes would overestimate how many dwellings would be feasible for gwr and hence the total water savings per ward similarly fig 10b compares the water savings per person of rwh using the standard typology per dwelling type with our results in fig 9b for new build this shows that using average dimensions per dwelling type would consistently overestimate the water savings by around 25 the reasons are that some dwellings are smaller than average for their type and so are less likely to have sufficient roof area for rwh to be cost effective also as mentioned in section 2 3 2 the frequency distributions of plot density per dwelling type are positively skewed signifying that the majority of dwellings have smaller dimensions than if calculated as an average consequently if we had used standard dwelling typologies we would have overestimated the feasibility of rwh and hence the water savings 4 discussion future urbanisation is likely to be higher density than before and consequently the water saving potential of aws will differ between existing dwellings and new build estimates based on projections of the housing stock would therefore be unsound instead our novel integrated modelling framework embeds detailed water modelling within a practical model for long term urban planning that provides inputs to the aws modelling at the building scale this is an advance in water modelling and the urban modelling and water modelling are inseparable for this purpose our findings on the relationships between individual factors match what would be expected from the literature however it would have been very difficult to understand their future combined effect and how this would vary spatially without the aid of this integrated modelling framework the results are conditional on our choice of inputs and assumptions but these can easily be adjusted this type of modelling tool could be useful for constructive engagement between water companies and planning authorities on scenario analysis for urban development and water resources planning it has the potential to test scenarios for various aspects of water management related to spatial development built form and water demands the methods could be applied internationally if the models are recalibrated to local data and standards the outputs of tiles and households could also be used as a spatial database for more spatially detailed modelling of future urban layouts and urban water management 5 conclusions our integrated modelling framework represents how spatial planning would affect the future location of dwellings and their variability in roof areas and household sizes so that the impacts of spatial planning on the future feasibility and water savings of aws can be modelled at the building scale which is an important advance on previous methods methods based on standard typologies and household sizes would substantially overestimate the future water savings by failing to identify how many dwellings would have insufficient roof area or household size for aws to be cost effective spatial planning would greatly affect the feasibility and water savings of rwh because it affects the location and urban densities of new build and hence rainfall roof areas and rainwater per person household gwr would be less affected by spatial planning but its feasibility would be more finely balanced between the system cost and its water savings showing the importance of our modelling of spatial differences in future household sizes communal systems would depend on the suitability of future built form and hence spatial planning the market led option would generally result in lower density development and thereby increase the water saving potential of rwh conversely compaction would lead to a greater concentration of higher density development and would increase the water saving potential of communal systems particularly gwr the findings suggest that forecasts of residential densities rainfall and water price could be used in conjunction with more detailed local studies to indicate how spatial planning would affect the future water saving potential of aws this may help to identify the most suitable type of aws for a locality and enable coordination between planning authorities and water companies on targeted bottom up policy support such as building design standards subsidies and local planning guidance

18645,greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting have the potential to increase the resilience of water management and reduce the need for investment in conventional water supply schemes however their water savings would partly depend on the location and built form of urban development and hence its household sizes and rainwater per dwelling we have therefore tested how spatial planning options would affect the future viability of alternative water supply in the greater south east of england our integrated modelling framework for the first time forecasts the future densities and variability of built form to provide inputs to the modelling of alternative water supply we show that using projections of the existing housing stock would have been unsound and that using standard dwelling types and household sizes would have substantially overestimated the water savings by not fully representing how the variability in dwelling dimensions and household sizes would affect the cost effectiveness of these systems we compare the spatial planning trend over a 30 year period with either compaction at higher densities within existing urban boundaries or market led more dispersed development we show how the viability of alternative water supply would differ between these three spatial planning options the water savings of rainwater harvesting would vary greatly at a regional scale depending on residential densities and rainfall greywater recycling would be less affected by spatial planning but would have a finer balance between system costs and water savings and its feasibility would vary locally depending on household sizes and water efficiency the sensitivity of the water savings to differences in rainfall and water prices would vary with residential density the findings suggest that forecasts of residential densities rainfall and the water price could be used in conjunction with more detailed local studies to indicate how spatial planning would affect the future water saving potential of alternative water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords greywater recycling rainwater harvesting residential density land use forecasting dwelling typologies household size 1 introduction future water shortages are expected in many parts of the world due to climate change and increasing population and incomes alcamo et al 2007 the greater south east of england already has seriously water stressed areas environment agency 2013 and the frequency of droughts is projected to increase met office 2011 this has led to increased interest in developing plans for water resource management that are resilient in the face of urbanisation and climate change defra 2016 current linear urban water management practices require a transition to more circular urban water management butler et al 2011 with reduced import of water high rates of recycling and reduced export of wastewater and stormwater alternative sources of water supply such as greywater recycling gwr and rainwater harvesting rwh could have a role to play in this transition the uk water companies are required to produce water resources management plans that look ahead 25 years taking into account climate change and population growth and consider options for bulk water transfers between water company areas environment agency et al 2012 alternative water supply aws at the building scale may therefore be beneficial if this helps to generate a surplus that could be redistributed to reduce the need for major investments such as reservoirs conventional water supply in most countries is subsidised through supportive measures for large projects analogous subsidy measures should be considered for aws for appropriate comparative analysis campisano et al 2017 and its financial benefits on a regional scale may be much more significant than the benefit to the individual consumer friedler and hadari 2006 although there has been a reasonable uptake of aws for commercial and public buildings the uptake for residential buildings is low this is probably due to the multiplicity of stakeholders such as planners developers owners and occupiers and uncertainties about its cost effectiveness and acceptability to households domestic water demand is a substantial and growing proportion of water consumption therefore understanding the long term potential of aws for dwellings would be a useful step towards a whole system assessment of water management plans decisions on the provision of policy support would require a long term perspective because the rate of introduction of aws could only be relatively slow new build in the uk only adds around 1 per year to the housing stock and the retrofitting of existing dwellings would probably only occur when convenient such as during refurbishment the water savings and costs of aws systems depend on regional scale factors such as rainfall and water prices they also depend on factors that vary from dwelling to dwelling such as water consumption per person household size and roof area morales pinzón et al 2015 previous modelling of aws has been either for specific dwellings friedler and hadari 2006 or existing areas using dwelling typologies kim and furumai 2012 palla et al 2012 however household sizes and roof areas vary with residential density and new build in the future will be different from the past spatial planning constrains the release of land for urban development and hence the location and density of dwellings as evidenced by comparing london which is constrained within a green belt with the sprawl of some north american cities or the ribbons of urbanisation in flanders the demand for residential land is generally greater in areas with good access to jobs and amenities and if demand exceeds supply housing will tend to increase in density over time hence the demand for housing changes spatially as a result of population growth socio economic transformation and transport improvements forecasting urban development therefore requires a model von thünen 1826 and cannot be estimated simply by projections from the existing housing stock mitchell et al 2001 recognised the need for integration between built form and households when modelling catchment water cycles existing dwellings were represented in their aquacycle model as blocks and groups of dwellings as clusters models have since been developed for testing urban water management options such as uwot makropoulos et al 2008 kim and furumai 2012 used five building types to model rwh options for an existing residential district and found that half of the water savings would be for dwellings far exceeding any other building type their analysis did not consider cost effectiveness possibly because in japan about half of the installation cost would be subsidised by local government thames water 2017 considered the feasibility and costs of aws for planned housing developments but only tested aws for two dwelling types low rise or high rise each with an assumed household size the switch project used 49 unit blocks for characterising existing land use mackay and last 2010 but only 8 were residential and they were not designed for modelling future development the main limitation of the above studies is that they rely on inputs of urban growth densities and households a number of studies have used urban models for testing urban water management scenarios urich and rauch 2014a these have mostly used cellular automata models for the bottom up dynamic simulation of the urban development process urich and rauch 2014b combined a cellular automata model described in sitzenfrei et al 2013 with drainage modelling they simulated a range of urban development scenarios and found that spatial planning policy would be one of the factors that would affect flood risk the limitations of cellular automata models are that they are based on transition rules specified by the user and they require inputs of urban growth they do not model the location choice of firms and households and so they are unsuitable for modelling radical changes in regional spatial planning and transport policies willuweit and o sullivan 2013 used the moland model this included a macro level system dynamics model to spatially allocate regional development but only for the trend which was then represented by cellular automata modelling to provide inputs to a water balance model this used 4 hectare grid cells but without details of the dwellings and households and gwr and rwh were included but based on user inputs of assumed capacities and percentage uptakes this lack of detail means that the aws water savings were estimated rather than modelled polebitski et al 2011 coupled a water demand model with the urbansim model waddell et al 2010 to forecast regional domestic water demand urbansim does include the behavioural choice modelling of land use and transport but it dynamically explores the urban development processes using numerous micro simulations and this would have unnecessarily complicated our research the above models have used either grid cell or parcel based representations of neighbourhood layouts where each grid cell or parcel is represented by buildings and floor space for a typical development type for example urbansim used 2 25 ha grid cells and more recently parcels with typically 25 development types of which 8 are residential and 8 mixed use however this leads to difficulties matching and reconciling data sources such as allocating census tract household data to the residential floor space of individual parcels or matching map data with model outputs abraham et al 2005 we have chosen to use a land use and transport interaction luti model that includes behavioural choice modelling and converges to a partial equilibrium for a given forecast year echenique et al 2013 this type of model is well established in practice for testing spatial planning options and produces stable forecasts for testing the aws scenarios for reviews of urban modelling see hensher et al 2004 we use an innovative statistical method of converting the forecasts of the luti model into an abstract representation of the housing stock and land use with sufficient detail to test aws systems for individual dwellings hargreaves 2015 the findings presented in this paper are the outcome of multi disciplinary research that has for the first time developed an integrated modelling framework to test how regional spatial planning would affect the potential of building scale water technologies water companies have expressed a strong interest in using this type of model as a collaborative planning tool for constructive engagement with planning authorities on high level scenario analysis it could enable focused optioneering on the spatial supply and demand for water depending on where land is likely to be developed its density and land use types government agencies have also recognised the value of an integrated modelling tool to test the sustainability of options at an early stage of the planning process and the east of england regional development agency supported this objective by funding the development of the state of the art luti model that we used for our research our modelling framework could easily be enhanced to encompass all aspects of water management related to spatial development however for clarity and conciseness we demonstrate its capabilities by testing gwr and rwh scenarios the modelling is an aid to understanding how interactions between the relevant factors would affect future outcomes rather than attempting to forecast actual water savings we therefore exclude some variables unrelated to spatial planning that would have made our findings more opaque because of their differing effects on the uptake of aws such as its acceptability to developers and households we show how spatial planning options would affect the future viability of aws systems and the importance of researching this within an urban modelling framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 research context 2 1 1 the study area the greater south east of england has a population of over 20 million ons 2014 consisting of london and its surrounding regions the urban areas are quite compact due to planning constraints such as local plans green belts and areas of outstanding natural beauty to protect green space from urban sprawl we chose electoral wards as the most appropriate level of spatial detail for the urban modelling because these are the smallest areas that had all the planning data needed for carrying out the research there are 3 218 wards in the greater south east ranging in size from around 220 to 23 000 people with average population of 7 040 fig 1 a shows their average densities in year 2001 as dwellings per hectare of residential land dph fig 1b shows that the average household size per ward varies greatly with smaller households in the remote areas and some high density areas see appendix a1 1 of the supplementary materials for further details 2 1 2 forecast period we have tested scenarios for a forecast year of 2031 this is the furthest point in the future for which sufficient information existed about local planning policies a base year of 2001 was chosen because this had the most complete dataset at the time of carrying out the research this 30 year period allows a sufficient amount of demographic and socioeconomic change for clear differences to emerge between the base year and the forecast year the population was projected to increase from 8 8 million in 2001 to around 12 1 million in 2031 2 2 research inputs 2 2 1 future availability of residential land in urban areas we have used household projections from the uk national trip end model dft 2009 and density targets from the local development frameworks of the local authorities we have combined these densities and additional households to estimate how much land the local authorities expect to become available within urban boundaries over the forecast period such as by redeveloping industrial sites land outside urban boundaries is estimated from gis data on land use and protected areas we refer to dwellings that existed in the base year and would still exist in the forecast year as existing and those that would be built during the forecast period as new build 2 2 2 water consumption we collected data from the water resources management plans environment agency et al 2012 of the relevant water companies for each water resource zone wrz a wrz is the largest possible zone in which all resources can be shared and in which all customers will experience the same risk of supply failure from a resource shortfall there are 49 wrzs in the greater south east and they range from a few hundred to over 3 million households this data includes the micro components of water use for metered and unmetered households toilet flushing clothes washing outdoor use bathroom washbasins showers baths dishwashing and miscellaneous both for recent years and projections for the forecast year in litres per person per day l p d fig 2 uses toilet flushing as an example to show that projected water consumption varies considerably within the study area toilet flushing is around 20 of total domestic water use we assume each ward would have the same water consumption per person as the wrz within which it lies see appendix a1 2 2 2 2 3 rainfall we have used annual average rainfall and number of wet days appendix a1 1 for the period 1981 to 2010 met office 2011 and there are marked differences in rainfall with the east being generally drier than the west we assume that the rainfall per ward is the same as the nearest weather station fig 3 2 3 the integrated modelling framework the flow chart in fig 4 illustrates our integrated modelling framework the remainder of section 2 describes its components and scenario design inputs the spatial scales of the inputs models and outputs are summarised in table 1 2 3 1 luti model the luti model forecasts the spatial allocation of employment households and population it had been calibrated for the base year so that its outputs per zone matched the base year data the inputs included industrial consumption and production per sector employment households and population by socio economic classification residential and non domestic land floor space property prices and transport network times costs and capacities the model endogenously generates rents to balance demand and supply using an iterative procedure this includes not only quantitative aspects of utility such as cost and time but also qualitative aspects such as what consumers of land are willing to tolerate in order to have a lower monetary rent for example living in a high rise building projections had been input to the model of the land available for development and transport capacities a forecast had been produced for year 2011 for validation purposes and also for the 2031 forecast year the model calibration and data sources are described in echenique et al 2013 2 3 2 tiles model the average residential densities per ward from the luti model are systematically converted into tiles to represent the dwellings and associated residential land each tile represents one hectare of residential land occupied by dwellings of predefined dimensions and plot size we chose to use 20 tile types as shown in fig 5 the tiles act as a database of the housing stock and residential land use there are two versions of each tile type to represent either existing dwellings or new build dwellings the tiles model had been calibrated using english housing survey clg 2009 census and gis data dclg 2005 to deterministically produce the expected frequency distribution of plot size per dwelling type found to be a gamma distribution for any given average density and age of dwellings it then systematically selects a set of tiles to approximate this frequency distribution this includes whole and fractions of tiles so that the summing of all the tiles matches the residential land and dwellings per ward as forecast by the luti model see appendix a1 4 for further details the method calibration and validation are described in hargreaves 2015 these discrete tiles are useful as a shared medium for multidisciplinary research hargreaves et al 2017 this simultaneous matching of the land dwellings and variability of their plot sizes would have been very difficult to achieve if using a land parcel or grid cell method the tiles method can achieve this because the tiles are an abstract representation of the land use and dwellings without being constrained to match a predesigned layout simulating the future layout of residential areas is unnecessary for testing aws systems for individual buildings 2 3 3 household model the inputs to the household model are the tiles and population per ward the luti model takes into account the socio economic classification of households when forecasting population per unit area of floor space which thereby indirectly forecasts the household size per dwelling per ward the office for national statistics and the english housing survey provided data on the numbers of occupants per dwelling type per ward these are then proportionally adjusted per ward using doubly constrained estimation to match the total households and population per ward as forecasts by the luti model hence these household sizes per dwelling type change over the forecast period and vary both spatially and between the spatial planning options 2 3 4 aws models of the water savings one of the strengths of our novel method is that data specific to each tile are input directly to the aws models i e its dwelling dimensions household size water demands land use and rainfall these models then calculate at building scale whether aws would be feasible and if so its water savings thereby completing a calibrated chain of modelling from regional to building scale the water savings and system costs are summed per tile and then aggregated per ward or to whatever spatial scale of output is required we have assumed that the supply of greywater for recycling would only be from bathroom washing and bathing facilities and that harvested rainwater would only be from dwelling roof tops for hygiene reasons the water saving efficiency of an aws system depends on its storage capacity and the temporal balance between the supply and demand for non potable water not all of the available inflow will be used because this may either temporally exceed the available storage or the water demand may exceed supply and the tank runs dry the amount that is used and results in a water saving is known as the yield y e min c q where y y i e l d l i t r e s e e f f i c i e n c y o f w a t e r s a v i n g c n o n p o t a b l e d e m a n d l i t r e s q i n f l o w o f n o n p o t a b l e w a t e r t o t h e s t o r a g e t a n k l i t r e s the water saving efficiency for rainwater harvesting is normally calculated using functions that include the dimensionless parameters of the demand fraction d and storage fraction s fewkes 2000 d c q s s q where s s t o r a g e t a n k c a p a c i t y m 3 we have only tested basic aws systems that had known and calibrated parameters for calculating their water saving efficiency at the time of carrying out the research these parameters are from published research that simulated systems supplying water for toilet flushing only and they take into account the temporal inconsistencies of water demand and supply this enabled us to model water savings and system sizes using the inputs per tile of roof areas rainfall and household water demands for the gwr systems we use water saving efficiencies of 0 85 for household systems those that serve an individual dwelling and 0 9 for communal systems those that serve multiple apartments from liu et al 2010 however rwh systems can vary greatly in efficiency because roof area household size and rainfall vary between dwellings we use the modified storage fraction method devised by campisano and modica 2012 that includes annual rainfall and the ratio of dry days to wet days this enables us to better represent the differing climates from the drier east to the wetter west campisano et al 2013 fitted regression curves to simulation results for sites in climate areas of italy classified using the köppen geiger classification scheme kottek et al 2006 we use their regression coefficients for areas in italy with temperate climate without a dry season which have similar rainfall to the greater south east our resulting water saving efficiencies appendix a1 5 2 closely match those of the unmodified method in the literature fewkes 2000 palla et al 2011 we assume that these systems would be designed in accordance with the relevant british standard code of practice bsi 2009 bsi 2010 which recommend regular replenishment of stored water to avoid stagnation daily for gwr and every 18 days for rwh this has little effect on the water savings of gwr because the daily supply of greywater and the demands for toilet flushing are relatively consistent however it does limit the water saving potential of rwh because it restricts the tank size to 18 365 days of rainfall volume i e to a maximum storage fraction of 0 05 note that codes of practice and regulations vary internationally and can be conflicting yu et al 2013 and tend to be more supportive in water scarce countries oron et al 2014 aws systems can also supply a wider range of uses than toilet flushing such as clothes washing and irrigation but these are more temporally inconsistent calibrated parameters for modelling their water saving efficiency and system size were unavailable in the literature and more recent research on this topic such as campisano and lupia 2017 is still local and case study specific we would have needed to make dwelling specific assumptions about appliances and user behaviour to design such systems and this would have been impracticable for our regional scale modelling if we had included the supply of water for irrigation this may have affected our findings due to the effects of spatial planning on future garden sizes however this is unlikely to have affected our results because these water savings would be limited by constraints such as storage time the temporal inconsistency of clothes washing and garden irrigation and for gwr the presence of chemicals in the greywater 2 3 5 feasibility test of aws per tile we have devised a feasibility test to exclude aws if it would clearly not be cost effective for a dwelling to make the findings easier to interpret we assume that all areas would have the same water supply price of 3 5 m3 which is at the top of the current range aws is selected for a dwelling if its cost savings on mains water supply would exceed its overall cost within a payback period of 35 years this is substantially longer than a commercially acceptable rate of return on investment but may be conceivable for assessing social value applying this lenient test to both gwr and rwh ensures that sufficient systems are selected to clearly show how the spatial planning scenarios would affect the future viability of aws we estimated the capital operating and maintenance costs from a review of the literature including environment agency 2011 friedler and hadari 2006 melville shreeve et al 2016 the rwh system costs vary depending on the modelled storage tank capacity for gwr a standard system cost has been assumed for household systems but the cost would be less for communal systems due to economies of scale and reduces depending on the number of apartments per block the feasibility of gwr varies depending on the combination of the water price system cost and the supply and use of greywater per dwelling calculated from its household size and the micro components of water demand per person based on our assumptions household gwr would become noticeably less feasible in areas with less than around 2 2 occupants per dwelling these factors also affect rwh but its feasibility depends more on rainfall and roof areas for further details see appendix a1 6 2 4 scenario design inputs 2 4 1 spatial planning options we have estimated the inputs for the trend option from the local development frameworks of the local authorities the new build would be on brownfield land with good public transport access the trend policy has greater constraints on the release of land than in the past and so the densities of new build are forecast to be generally higher than existing dwellings with a greater proportion of terraced houses and apartments this would be similar to many other city regions that are pursuing smart growth planning policies to constrain sprawl and reduce the need for car travel spatial planning affects where new dwellings are located and hence their household sizes and built form and so we tested two distinct spatial planning options to compare with the trend option these comprise of compaction for which all future urban development would be by infilling at higher densities within existing urban boundaries and market led which would allow development on green field land in the areas with strongest demand for housing and at lower densities than the trend these represent differing views on the priorities for urban development with compaction aiming to reduce car travel and energy consumption whereas market led responds to the countervailing socioeconomic pressures for an increase in housing supply where there is greatest demand the three options are designed by adjusting the inputs to the luti model on the amounts of residential land available for development per ward the luti model then endogenously allocates the employment households and population to the wards and the resulting residential densities are processed into the tiles and their household sizes 2 4 2 luti model forecasts table 2 summarises the spatial options using a selection of variables and fig 6 shows the outputs of the luti model for the new build dwellings and their average densities per ward london would have the biggest increase in dwellings over the forecast period and as expected this would be greatest for compaction and least for the more dispersed market led option compaction would result in higher densities than the trend whereas market led would be the least constrained but would still have high densities in areas with the greatest demand for housing consequently compaction would result in more apartments and terraced houses than the trend whereas market led would have more detached and semi detached houses and consume the greatest amount of land appendix a1 7 has further details 2 4 3 estimating the percentage of imperviousness of residential areas to illustrate the broader capabilities of our integrated modelling framework we have estimated the average percentage of imperviousness pimp of residential land see appendix a1 8 for details compaction would result in urban infilling often with high rise apartments next to lower density existing houses whereas new build for the other spatial options would be constrained by local planning policies to be more similar to its surroundings apartments typically include some green space whereas the gardens of high density houses are mostly paved consequently if comparing wards of the same overall average density in the forecast year the imperviousness of these areas would be lower for compaction than the trend our findings closely correspond with the average pimps reported in butler et al 2018 for existing residential areas of london of 50 for apartments and 55 for dense housing the advantage of our method is that it can be used to model the impacts of spatial planning policies on the future pimp of residential land 2 4 4 water demand scenarios existing dwellings would have water company estimates of water consumption as a weighted average of metered and unmetered households there are two scenarios for new build comprising of either the water company demand projections for metered dwellings or a water efficiency scenario of 120 l p d that reflects the water efficiency requirements of uk building regulations table 3 shows these water demand scenarios the water demand scenarios are input as micro components of consumption per average person in a wrz this simplifying assumption may result in some underestimation of the differences in water consumption between spatial planning options however separating the correlated effects of household income plot size and water use in order to understand how spatial planning would affect water demands per dwelling would have required further research 2 4 5 aws system scenarios as shown in table 4 household gwr systems are considered for all dwellings and household rwh for houses only this is based on the optimistic assumption that suitable retrofitting opportunities would arise during the forecast period communal aws systems are only considered for new build apartments because the feasibility of networks between houses or retrofitting existing apartments would depend on site specific factors beyond the scope of our study we have not tested hybrid systems because dixon et al 1999 found that there was limited advantage in extending a gwr system to also include rwh communal systems may be suitable for some houses if densely clustered but their costs water saving efficiency and applicability would have required research at a more detailed scale only a small proportion of new build houses are likely to be suitably clustered for the trend but the proportion would be more significant for compaction however communal systems particularly for gwr are less acceptable to occupants than household systems domènech and saurí 2010 ward et al 2013 and this may limit their future uptake for houses therefore only testing communal systems for apartments is unlikely to have affected our findings 3 results 3 1 impact of spatial factors on the feasibility of aws the feasibility of gwr would be positively correlated with household size and water consumption per person but this would be less apparent for rwh because roof areas and rainfall are more crucial for its feasibility appendix a2 1 provides further details new build is directly affected by spatial planning and in the longer term will become an increasingly large proportion of the housing stock and installing aws as part of new build is more practicable than retrofitting fig 7 therefore shows the average water savings per person per ward for the new build of the trend calculated as the sum of the water savings for new build divided by the sum of the occupants of all new build dwellings the scatter plots illustrate how these water savings vary between wards of similar density the lines show the average value rather than purporting to be a trend the maps illustrate how water savings would differ greatly between adjacent wards indicating that targeting the most appropriate technology to a locality would require spatial detailed modelling the feasibility of household gwr would be finely balanced between its water savings and its cost per household and so the water savings of gwr fig 7a would be low for many wards but for a few it would meet almost all of the water demand for toilet flushing described in section 2 2 2 this shows the importance of modelling future household sizes and water demands household gwr would rarely be cost effective in wards with small households and or low water demands as can be seen by comparing its water savings with figs 1b and 2 however the water savings of rwh fig 7b vary less between wards of similar density because they are more closely related to rainwater supply they would therefore be low in higher density areas because these have less roof area per dwelling appendix a1 1 and also in dryer areas e g east of london 3 2 comparison of the aws water savings between the spatial options fig 8 shows the dwellings and water savings aggregated to the wrz scale for existing dwellings and the new build of each spatial option appendix a2 2 1 explains the aggregation process there would be clear differences in water savings between existing and new build especially for rapidly growing urban areas such as london gwr would be more viable for new build than existing because our scenarios included communal systems for new build apartments conversely rwh would be slightly less viable for new build than existing because new build would generally be of higher density spatial planning would obviously affect not only the built form of new build but also how the future water demands would be distributed spatially within the study area the water savings therefore differ spatially between the spatial options depending on both the amount of development and how spatial factors affect its suitability for aws compaction with gwr fig 8b would have the greatest water savings for the urban centres such as london partly because it would have the greatest increase in dwellings in these areas fig 8a and partly because they would be at higher densities with a greater proportion of apartments conversely rwh fig 8c is best suited to lower density areas and so its water savings would be greater for the more dispersed lower density development of the market led option these findings show the importance of taking into account spatial planning if formulating long term policy support for aws 3 3 the relationships between residential density and potential water savings the following charts show the average water savings per person within 10 dph wide average density bands to smooth out some of the variability i e the total water savings divided by the total occupants for all wards within the average density band for either existing or new build at higher densities these water savings per person are greater for new build than existing due to the communal systems and this is particularly noticeable for gwr fig 9 a the water savings of rwh fig 9b generally decline with increasing density due to less roof area per person the water savings of aws would be much lower for the water efficiency scenario because although communal systems would still be feasible household systems would rarely be cost effective with such low water demands although the results for household and communal systems are not shown separately those for new build household systems are similar to those for existing household systems we have tested new build with either 0 50 higher or 0 50 lower water prices fig 9c shows that the water savings for gwr are very sensitive to water price especially in low and medium density areas because if the water price were lower then fewer household gwr systems would pass our feasibility test and vice versa communal gwr is less sensitive to water price because its cost per dwelling would be lower this suggests that the future feasibility of gwr would increase if household systems could be better tailored to suit different household sizes and characteristics rwh would be more robust to uncertainties about future water prices fig 9d however its water savings would be sensitive to rainfall because this has a greater affect on its cost effectiveness particularly in higher density areas where dwellings have less roof area per occupant see appendix a2 2 2 further research could more fully explore the impacts of climate change by using rainfall projections 3 4 comparison with methods that use standard dwelling typologies and household sizes previous models thi hoang duong et al 2011 kim and furumai 2012 thames water 2017 used an average household size per dwelling type and or standard dwelling typologies we therefore compare our findings with those that we would have obtained by using these more aggregate methods fig 10 a compares the gwr water savings for new build using average household size per dwelling type with our results shown in fig 9a i e using household sizes of 2 5 2 4 2 3 and 1 7 for detached semidetached terraced and apartments respectively from uk census data using these average household sizes would have substantially overestimated the water savings of gwr for wards with average density less than around 55 dph i e most of the wards the reason is that household gwr systems are less feasible for smaller households and many wards have smaller than average households see fig 1b therefore a method that assumes average household sizes would overestimate how many dwellings would be feasible for gwr and hence the total water savings per ward similarly fig 10b compares the water savings per person of rwh using the standard typology per dwelling type with our results in fig 9b for new build this shows that using average dimensions per dwelling type would consistently overestimate the water savings by around 25 the reasons are that some dwellings are smaller than average for their type and so are less likely to have sufficient roof area for rwh to be cost effective also as mentioned in section 2 3 2 the frequency distributions of plot density per dwelling type are positively skewed signifying that the majority of dwellings have smaller dimensions than if calculated as an average consequently if we had used standard dwelling typologies we would have overestimated the feasibility of rwh and hence the water savings 4 discussion future urbanisation is likely to be higher density than before and consequently the water saving potential of aws will differ between existing dwellings and new build estimates based on projections of the housing stock would therefore be unsound instead our novel integrated modelling framework embeds detailed water modelling within a practical model for long term urban planning that provides inputs to the aws modelling at the building scale this is an advance in water modelling and the urban modelling and water modelling are inseparable for this purpose our findings on the relationships between individual factors match what would be expected from the literature however it would have been very difficult to understand their future combined effect and how this would vary spatially without the aid of this integrated modelling framework the results are conditional on our choice of inputs and assumptions but these can easily be adjusted this type of modelling tool could be useful for constructive engagement between water companies and planning authorities on scenario analysis for urban development and water resources planning it has the potential to test scenarios for various aspects of water management related to spatial development built form and water demands the methods could be applied internationally if the models are recalibrated to local data and standards the outputs of tiles and households could also be used as a spatial database for more spatially detailed modelling of future urban layouts and urban water management 5 conclusions our integrated modelling framework represents how spatial planning would affect the future location of dwellings and their variability in roof areas and household sizes so that the impacts of spatial planning on the future feasibility and water savings of aws can be modelled at the building scale which is an important advance on previous methods methods based on standard typologies and household sizes would substantially overestimate the future water savings by failing to identify how many dwellings would have insufficient roof area or household size for aws to be cost effective spatial planning would greatly affect the feasibility and water savings of rwh because it affects the location and urban densities of new build and hence rainfall roof areas and rainwater per person household gwr would be less affected by spatial planning but its feasibility would be more finely balanced between the system cost and its water savings showing the importance of our modelling of spatial differences in future household sizes communal systems would depend on the suitability of future built form and hence spatial planning the market led option would generally result in lower density development and thereby increase the water saving potential of rwh conversely compaction would lead to a greater concentration of higher density development and would increase the water saving potential of communal systems particularly gwr the findings suggest that forecasts of residential densities rainfall and water price could be used in conjunction with more detailed local studies to indicate how spatial planning would affect the future water saving potential of aws this may help to identify the most suitable type of aws for a locality and enable coordination between planning authorities and water companies on targeted bottom up policy support such as building design standards subsidies and local planning guidance

18646,primary microplastics are mostly produced as part of the daily plastic product use the emission process is often invisible but poses potential ecological hazards thus primary microplastics deserve public attention due to china s huge population base and its rapid economic development primary microplastics emissions are of both regional and global significance this study is the first to establish the emission inventory of primary microplastics in mainland china it was estimated that the primary microplastic waste from mainland china amounts to 737 29 gg and one sixth of this amount entered the aquatic environment in 2015 the highest proportion of this waste was attributable to tire dust and synthetic fiber accounting for 53 91 and 28 77 of the total respectively in mainland china the primary microplastics emissions mainly depend on the population followed by the level of economic development it was roughly estimated that 538 g of microplastics is produced by each person in china at the grid scale the spatial difference in the total primary microplastics emissions in mainland china primarily depends on the population density distribution and transportation network we studied the entire life cycle of several sources of microplastics from production to discharge into the aquatic environment we suggested different control measures under different nodes increasing microplastics treatment in sewage treatment plants should be a short term viable way to achieve some measure of reduction in their entry to the environment in mainland china our research can not only raise public awareness about primary microplastics but can also guide the development of environmental policies to reduce plastic pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords primary microplastics emission inventory mainland china sewage treatment plants 1 introduction given their low cost and versatile properties plastics are widely used in contemporary society given the large scale production use and discarding of plastics the concentration of plastics in the environment especially microplastics is dramatically increasing geyer et al 2017 microplastics are widely defined as synthetic polymers with an upper size limit of 5 mm and without a specified lower limit arthur et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 microplastics are widely distributed in a variety of environmental media including fresh and marine waters sediments and soils due to their small size they are easily absorbed by organisms when the particles reach a certain concentration they are known to cause physical and toxicological damage cole et al 2013 von moos et al 2012 researchers have reported the presence of a variety of microplastics in human feces gonzales 2018 therefore the emission and sources of microplastic pollution are now recognized to be of importance microplastics are released into the environment from both primary and secondary sources andrady 2011 cole et al 2011 primary microplastics often refer to pellets and pccps which are produced and enter the environment with small sizes cheung and fok 2017 cole et al 2011 however some studies have proposed a broader range of primary microplastics boucher and friot 2017 kole et al 2017 sundt et al 2014 van wezel et al 2016 they proposed that primary microplastics include not only intentionally created microplastics e g pccps but also by products during the use of related plastic products such as microfibers detached from clothing tyre dust from running cars microplastics discharged from artificial turfs and paints and so on as well as unintentionally released ones e g pelleted raw materials they considered that primary microplastics are those as adding new plastic material of micro size to the environment sundt et al 2014 secondary microplastics originate from fragmentation of larger plastic litter in the environment rochman et al 2013 attempts have been made to estimate the total quantity of plastic waste it has been estimated that 275 million metric tons mt of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010 with 4 8 12 7 million mt entering the ocean and china providing the highest input quantity jambeck et al 2015 rivers potentially act as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris thus the amount of plastic waste that enters the sea via rivers is believed to be of concern a global model of plastic inputs from rivers to oceans was established based on data on waste management population density and hydrological information and it was estimated that between 1 15 and 2 41 million mt of plastic waste currently enters the ocean every year from rivers lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 used a similar model but compiled a larger data set to calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into seas and provided a number range between 0 0041 and 4 104 mt yr both lebreton et al 2017 and schmidt et al 2017 concluded that china s rivers account for a large proportion of the world s plastic debris transported to the ocean the emission of secondary microplastics has therefore attracted considerable public attention compared to the second source only a few studies have focused on the emission of primary microplastics the current research on primary source emission inventory mainly focuses on single source emission factors or emissions among them the release of microfibers during washing and the discharge of microbeads during cleaning processes are the most common cheung and fok et al 2017 estimated that 209 7 trillion microbeads 3 069 mt are emitted into the aquatic environment of mainland china every year research on emissions of all kinds of primary microplastics is relatively preliminary at present a few environmental protection agencies or government departments estimate the emissions of primary microplastics at the national scale both denmark and norway have estimated primary microplastic emission fluxes of 10 65 mt and 839 60 mt respectively the international union for conservation of nature iucn provided a rough estimate of global primary microplastic emissions and calculated the amount discharged into the ocean in some developed countries of europe and the united states releases from primary microplastics are equivalent to or outweigh those of secondary microplastics from mismanaged waste boucher and friot 2017 the issue posed by emissions of primary microplastics is becoming increasingly prominent although the proportion of marine plastics from primary sources is not very large about 15 31 boucher and friot 2017 it still deserves our attention because of the following characteristics 1 they are mainly produced due to daily plastic product use 2 these emissions are invisible 3 they are difficult to treat and avoid 4 at present countries or organizations including the united states netherlands and austria etc have begun to ban microplastics used in pccps leslie 2015 but compared to large plastic litter people pay less attention to the emissions of primary microplastics 5 when they are discharged the sizes of the polluting particles are much smaller than those of typical waste and thus their ecological hazards are greater population growth and rapid economic development in recent decades has led to an exponential increase in plastic product consumption in china china is the most populous country in the world with approximately 1 39 billion citizens in 2017 by the end of 2017 there were 310 million vehicles in china ranking second in the world after the united states nbsc 2018 in addition primary microplastics are mostly produced due to the manufacture and use of plastic products thus the emissions of primary microplastics in china are of both regional and global significance given the large amount of primary microplastics in use and the potential for their long range transportation the purpose of this paper is to provide an emission inventory of primary microplastics in mainland china in 2015 based on major primary microplastic emission activity levels and their emission factors efs collected from the literature to estimate as many sources of microplastics emission as possible we selected the definition of primary microplastics that includes more emission sources boucher and friot 2017 kole et al 2017 sundt et al 2014 van wezel et al 2016 this is the first study to present these results at the grid level for mainland china thereby illustrating the geographical distribution of these emissions by describing and estimating the characteristics of primary microplastic emissions our research aims to improve the understanding of the public on this aspect and raise their awareness on primary microplastics our results can not only provide important information toward developing environmental policies to reduce plastic pollution which is typically ignored in conventional waste management as awareness about it is yet to increase but also serve as a guidance for further large scale regression simulations and exposure analyses 2 methods 2 1 determination of main emission sources based on the relevant literature we identified the main sources of primary microplastics in mainland china boucher and friot 2017 lassen et al 2015 sundt et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the finalized list generated for this study included the following 1 synthetic fibers produced during washing and present in indoor dust 2 tire dust comprising tiny particles produced by friction and transfer of particles between the tire and ground 3 architectural coatings such as paint falling off during the process of painting buildings 4 marine coatings 5 vehicle paint 6 road markings 7 plastic dust pellets from raw material production or generated during transport 8 plastic granules from artificial turfs and other application and 9 microbeads produced in the use of personal care and cosmetics products pccps 2 2 estimation of provincial emissions in mainland china in 2015 the primary microplastics emissions for each source can be calculated using the formula in the form seen below 1 e j 1 k e f i j a i j where e denotes emissions a is the emission related activity level and ef is the emission factor i j and k indicate the emission sources sub sources and number of sub sources specific estimation formulas for emissions from each sub source are shown in table 1 the estimation of activity levels a involved many factors nearly 50 in this study due to their complexity most of the factors in a were collected from official published sources and related research cheung and fok 2017 cncia 2015 meec 2014 nbsc 2016a b data for a few factors mainly those referring to paints which account for only approximately 6 of total emissions can only be obtained at the national scale and thus they were allocated to each province from the national level based on the most closely related statistical data for example when estimating the activity level of road marking data on the amount of paint used in road marking are available at the national scale only hence the total road mileage in each province is used to allocate the national total emission at the provincial scale data on emission related activity level at the provincial scale and the source for each factor are listed in the si in addition efs are key to estimating emissions thus an effort was made to collect a large amount of related data from the literature hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 oecd 2009 sundt et al 2014 verschoor et al 2016 the value and source of each ef are shown in table 2 2 3 geographic distribution the emissions of each source at the provincial scale were obtained from the above calculations in order to conduct a comprehensive investigation calculate the model and formulate policy at a finer spatial scale researchers need to establish more detailed spatial emission inventories kuenen et al 2014 wang et al 2005 gridded emission inventories can be developed using the proxy based estimates with downscaling techniques proxy based methods require relatively less data and thus they are widely used for developing gridded emission inventories bouwman et al 1997 li et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 in this study several socio economic data such as population gdp traffic network water network and built up area were used as the spatial proxies table 3 we divided the emissions of each source by the grid area to obtain the emission density of each source in every grid lastly the individual primary microplastics emission densities in 2015 were mapped on 0 25 0 25 grids using the spatial allocation method can inevitably introduce some uncertainty bouwman et al 1997 li et al 2019 however we have minimized such uncertainties firstly the parameters that are most closely related to the emission activities of each source are selected for spatial allocation secondly the spatial differences of each emission activity are fully considered in the spatial allocation for example when distributing fibers and pccps the differences between urban and rural areas are taken into account and the total emissions of the corresponding areas are allocated using urban and rural populations respectively for the spatial distribution of tire dust we considered the differences in emission activities among highways urban roads and rural roads and the spatial distribution of emissions in the corresponding areas was carried out using vector data of three regional roads 2 4 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty in emissions arises from two aspects uncertainty in efs and related activity data we acknowledge that for many types of sources in mainland china very little is known about actual activity levels and efs and thus this lack of data does not allow us to analyze a certain prerequisite number of samples which is required to obtain a reasonable probability density distribution function therefore we assumed that the activity levels follow a normal distribution zhao et al 2011a 2011b 2012 and the efs follow a lognormal distribution bond et al 2004 li et al 2018 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2005 thus the arithmetic mean of the activity level and the geometric mean of the ef were applied in the monte carlo simulation we determined the standard deviations of efs and activity levels based on the u s epa s method and other studies streets et al 2003 u s epa 1999 wei et al 2011 first the activity levels were classified into four categories based on data reliability and availability table s2 1 raw material and vehicle paint standard deviation 30 2 pccps from urban areas synthetic fiber produced during washing in urban areas building paint tire dust standard deviation 60 3 pccps from rural areas synthetic fiber produced during washing in rural areas synthetic fiber shed from indoor clothing marine coating road marking standard deviation 100 and 4 artificial turf standard deviation 200 the specific basis for the classification is shown in table s2 the efs were classified into five categories based on data reliability and availability 1 pccps standard deviation 80 2 synthetic fibers produced during machine washing standard deviation 150 3 synthetic fibers shed indoors from clothing in urban areas artificial turf vehicle paint building paint raw material tire dust standard deviation 200 4 marine coating road marking standard deviation 300 5 synthetic fiber produced during hand washing synthetic fiber shed indoor from clothing in rural areas standard deviation 500 the classification basis is shown in table s3 monte carlo simulation was used to characterize the overall uncertainty for each source category the calculations of microplastics emission were replicated 10 000 times with a random selection of all inputs by matlab li et al 2019 shen et al 2013 2 5 quantities discharged into the aquatic environment the pathway of primary microplastics from different sources discharging into the aquatic environment is complex and diverse and the related research data are relatively scarce thus it is difficult to estimate the amount of microplastics entering the aquatic environment to facilitate this we simplified the pathways of different sources entering aquatic ecosystems into four categories domestic sewage pathway road runoff pathway wind pathway and adjacent waters pathway mainly marine coating burton 2017 lassen et al 2015 verschoor et al 2016 fig 1 the pathways and quantification of primary microplastics into the aquatic environment are as follows 1 domestic sewage pathway mainly including synthetic fibers from washing pccps and interior paints the microplastics discharged during the rinsing process and can be termed as wastewater the microplastics in the wastewater enter the aquatic environment in two ways cheung and fok 2017 a direct discharge of untreated sewage equation 2 2 q a w p 1 e w p r u n t r e a t e d where q a w p 1 is the amount directly discharged into the aquatic environment through the un treated wastewater e w p is the emission of microplastics from the domestic sewage pathway and r u n t r e a t e d is the percentage of untreated sewage cheung and fok 2017 b the proportion that escapes treatment from the sewage treatment plant stp equation 3 3 q a w p 2 e w p 1 r u n t r e a t e d 1 r r e where q a w p 2 is the amount of microplastics that escapes from the stp and r r e is the sewage treatment efficiency boucher and friot 2017 2 road runoff pathway mainly including tire dust vehicle paints exterior paints road marking artificial turf and plastic pellets these microplastics are discharged on the road and some of them are washed away by rainwater because of the differences in the drainage infrastructure and pavement hardening the pathways to the aquatic environment in urban and rural areas differ slightly part of the emissions from rural areas are discharged directly into surface water while those from urban areas are mainly discharged into the drainage system through sewers urban areas possess two kinds of drainage systems a separate sewer or a combined sewer here we assumed 50 of each kind the sewage entering the former drainage system is discharged directly into the receiving water body in mainland china while the sewage entering the latter kind is discharged partially into the receiving water body after treatment boucher and friot 2017 yang et al 2015 fig 1 thus these release amounts were calculated using equation 4 4 q a r r p e r r p r d i r e c t 1 2 r s e w e r 1 2 r s e w e r 1 r r e where q a r r p refers to the emissions of microplastics into aquatic environments through the road runoff pathway r d i r e c t is the percentage directly discharged into the surface water r s e w e r is the share of microplastics discharged into the sewer verschoor et al 2016 and r r e is the sewage treatment efficiency boucher and friot 2017 the above parameters vary depending on the type of the source 3 wind pathway when tire particles and road markings are shed onto roads a part of these emissions is spread by the wind to surface waters it is estimated that 10 of road emissions will be blown to surface waters or oceans by wind wang et al 2015 4 adjacent waters pathway this pathway only covers emissions from marine coatings following previous studies we assume that almost all such emissions eventually enter the aquatic environment boucher and friot 2017 in addition in order to formulate more detailed emission reduction strategies we sorted out the key nodes of primary microplastics entering aquatic systems where node 1 represents the production stage of the relevant plastic products node 2 represents the microplastics production stage and node 3 represents the microplastics treatment stage fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 primary microplastic emissions in mainland china using the approach described in the previous section it was estimated that the primary microplastic emissions from mainland china amounted to 7372 87 million tons in 2015 because of the country s large human and vehicular population the emissions from primary sources are about 85 times that of norway and 400 times that of denmark lassen et al 2015 sundt et al 2014 the first and second highest proportions of these emissions in mainland china were attributed to tire dust and synthetic fibers accounting for 53 91 and 28 77 respectively fig 2 a as a comparison the proportion of tire dust in primary microplastics in norway is quite high 53 6 while that of other sources is relatively small and the proportion of synthetic fibers is less than 12 5 sundt et al 2014 this may be because while norway has a much smaller human population than that of mainland china its vehicular population is comparable 3 2 geographical distribution and emission characteristics due to wide differences in population density economic development and consumption mode emission patterns and rates were considerably different among various regions in mainland china the annual emissions per unit area can reflect the absolute density of pollution sources which was found to decrease from east to west for each source fig 3 a and e from the perspective of provincial scale the highest emissions per unit area were found in shanghai city which recorded estimated emission densities of 2446 31 kg km2 which were about two to three times as many as that of the second beijing city and third places tianjin city fig 3e fig 3b illustrates the close relationship between the emission density of microplastics and population density at the provincial scale n 31 r2 0 99 p 0 01 proving that the emission characteristics of primary microplastics produced as part of everyday use is a representation of population density there is a significant positive correlation between primary microplastic emissions and the population in each province n 31 r2 0 93 p 0 01 fig 3c it can be estimated that every human in mainland china emits 538 g of microplastics per year equivalent to every human discarding one plastic bag per week moreover a good correlation was observed between per capita emissions and per capita gdp fig 3d while the relevance was lower for the population r2 0 21 0 93 the above analysis shows that on the one hand primary microplastics emissions result from daily use of plastic product usage and thus the emissions depend largely on population size on the other hand because some emissions e g tire dust comprise a large proportion of total primary microplastics and given the extent of motor vehicle ownership in mainland china these emissions also depend on economic development therefore the level of economic development is an important factor in this regard in addition china s economic disparities are easily reflected in urban rural than inter provincial disparities treiman 2012 although the rural population in china was slightly higher than that in urban areas in 2015 the emissions of primary microplastics in urban areas were about twice that in rural areas considering all the provinces the proportion of tire dust was generally the largest and far greater than the proportions of other types of microplastics only hubei hunan and chongqing recorded relatively low proportions of tire dust similar to those of fiber based microplastics about 40 the main reason for this finding is that these provinces have fewer motor vehicles per capita than other provinces nbsc 2016b when the emissions were presented at raster resolution more detailed distribution characteristics were revealed generally speaking the spatial differences in total emissions of primary microplastics in mainland china mainly depend on the distribution of the population density and transportation network fig 4 emission densities of areas such as jing jin ji region yangtze river delta pearl river delta and the central plains were generally higher than those of the other regions the spatial distribution of primary microplastics emissions from various sources is affected by different factors distribution patterns of various sources can be divided into several types as follows 1 in terms of the sources of pccps and synthetic textiles major urban areas stood out as the main emission centers because their emissions are closely related to people s washing and personal care habits although urban areas have a larger population emissions from these two sources were 3 and 340 times respectively those from rural areas 2 tire dust and road markings are mainly related to the density of the road network at the raster scale 3 since plastic production was highly correlated with local demand at the provincial scale r2 0 60 n 30 p 0 05 the emissions of plastic raw materials were mostly distributed in the more developed regions 4 high density emissions from building paints and artificial turfs were found to be mostly located in metropolitan areas this is because these two kinds of pollution sources arise from the process of urbanization and the associated construction activities for public infrastructure 3 3 uncertainty analysis fig 5 shows the uncertainty distribution of total emissions of primary microplastics in 2015 the results indicate that the distribution of total emissions conforms to a lognormal distribution and the distribution characteristics are determined by the uncertainty of emission factors and activity data the 95 confidence interval range of the total uncertainty distribution is 5 86e 08 to 1 75e 09 kg yr which includes our calculated emissions 7 37e 08 kg yr the results of the uncertainty analysis for each source are presented in fig 6 it shows that the uncertainty associated with the total emissions of microplastics is mainly attributable to tires fibers and artificial turf the three relevant sub ranges are 2 88e 08 to 8 13e 08 1 10e 08 to 7 80e 08 and 2 27e 07 to 5 32e 08 kg yr respectively the highest uncertainties arise from road marking 3 93e 06 kg yr 88 33 759 20 and marine coating 2 01e 06 kg yr 87 70 734 23 although these two sources of emissions are relatively small there is a great uncertainty in the estimation of their emissions at present and thus we should strengthen our research on the emissions of microplastics for these two aspects in the future 3 4 quantity discharged into the aquatic environment and policy recommendations it was estimated that about 120 28 gg of primary microplastics entered the aquatic environment in 2015 which is equivalent to one sixth of the total emissions the largest source of primary microplastics entering the aquatic environment changed from tire dust to synthetic fibers fig 2b this result is in agreement with past findings regarding the high proportion of synthetic fiber microplastics in the marine environment browne et al 2011 salvador et al 2017 due to the huge population base and rapid economic development of mainland china a large number of primary microplastics are discharged and a significant proportion enters the aquatic environment unlike secondary source microplastics primary source microplastic emissions mostly originate from the use process of plastic products and most of them are invisible in order to reduce the discharge of primary microplastics to the environment especially to the aquatic ecosystem we analyzed the entire process of production and entry into the environment i e routes of several sources of primary microplastics to identify controllable link nodes fig 1 firstly it is most efficient to prevent microplastic pollution at the design stage itself when considering the life cycle node 1 for example spinning and weaving methods and the selection of fiber type is extremely important with regard to reducing the release of fiber agarwal et al 2011 for tires it is crucial to improve the wear resistance of the tire in the manufacturing process for example tires that use silica as filler are less susceptible to wear and tear than tires with black carbon verschoor et al 2016 because these products are daily consumables the consumer choices should be taken into account while improving production technology long time periods are needed to popularize new technologies secondly it is relatively easier to consider pollution control measures pertaining to the production process node 2 for example the washing process of fibers produces microplastics suitable filters in washing machines may therefore serve as a very effective way to control the amount of fibers being introduced in the wastewater during the laundry process by preventing them from entering the sewage system mermaids 2016 tire friction can be better reduced by improving the composition and maintenance of roads as well as their surface infrastructure the use of appropriate pavement materials can reduce tire wear verschoor et al 2016 however replacing current roads is expensive and will be a long term process in mainland china thus although the above two methods are effective they have a long implementation period and weak market controllability finally increasing the treatment of microplastics in sewage treatment plants node 3 should be a short term viable solution to reduce the entry of microplastics into the environment examples include adding a fine grid filter to trap microplastics after mixing in the ultraviolet disinfection tank or before the effluent water is discharged bai et al 2018 the formulation of specific emission reduction measures requires more data support therefore it is of great significance to take up in depth researches which will support the control policies of microplastics 4 conclusion primary microplastics are mostly produced due to the daily use of plastic products the emission process is often invisible and poses potential ecological hazards thus this topic deserves public attention due to mainland china s huge population base and rapid economic development emissions of primary microplastics in china are both regionally and globally significant the emission inventory of primary microplastics in mainland china was first established in this study it was estimated that primary microplastic emissions from mainland china amounted to 737 29 gg million tons in 2015 and that one sixth of this amount entered the aquatic environment the highest proportions were attributed to tire dust and synthetic fibers accounting for 53 91 and 28 77 of the total respectively the emissions of primary microplastics mainly depend on the population followed by the level of economic development it can be roughly estimated that 538 g person of microplastics are generated by each person in china the emission density in the eastern region is higher than that in the western region at the grid scale the spatial difference in the total emissions of primary microplastics in mainland china depends primarily on the distribution of population density and the transportation network the uncertainty pertaining to total microplastic emissions mainly arises from tires fibers and artificial turf the three sub ranges are 2 88e 08 to 8 13e 08 1 10e 08 to 7 80e 08 and 2 27e 07 to 5 32e 08 kg yr we analyzed the entire life cycle of several sources of microplastics from production to discharge to the aquatic environment we ascertained various control measures under different nodes increasing the treatment of microplastics in sewage treatment plants appears to be a short term viable way to reduce the entry of microplastics into the environment improving product technology is another key method to reduce the emissions of primary microplastics but such interventions are not likely to be implemented in the near future overall by estimating primary microplastic emissions and analyzing emission characteristics our study not only raises public awareness and concerns about primary microplastics but also guides the development of environmental policies to reduce plastic pollution however only a few reliable emission factors are currently available and thus the emission inventory is likely to be characterized by large uncertainties

use and discarding of plastics the concentration of plastics in the environment especially microplastics is dramatically increasing geyer et al 2017 microplastics are widely defined as synthetic polymers with an upper size limit of 5 mm and without a specified lower limit arthur et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 microplastics are widely distributed in a variety of environmental media including

microplastic pollution are now recognized to be of importance microplastics are released into the environment from both primary and secondary sources andrady 2011 cole et al 2011 primary microplastics often refer to pellets and pccps which are produced and enter the environment with small sizes cheung and fok 2017 cole et al 2011 however some studies have proposed a broader range of primary microplastics boucher and friot 2017 kole et al 2017 sundt et al 2014 van wezel et al 2016 they proposed that primary microplastics include not only intentionally created microplastics e g pccps but also by products during the use of related plastic products such as microfibers detached from clothing tyre dust from running cars microplastics discharged from artificial turfs and paints and so on as well as unintentionally released ones e g pelleted raw materials they considered that primary microplastics are those as adding new plastic material of micro size to the environment sundt et al 2014 secondary microplastics originate from fragmentation of larger plastic litter in the environment rochman et al 2013 attempts have been made to estimate the total quantity of plastic waste it has been estimated that 275 million metric tons mt of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010 with 4 8 12 7 million mt entering the ocean and china providing the highest input quantity jambeck et al 2015 rivers potentially act as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris thus the amount of plastic waste that enters the sea via rivers is believed to be of concern a global model of plastic inputs from rivers to oceans was established based on data on waste management population density and hydrological information and it was estimated that between 1 15 and 2 41 million mt of plastic waste currently enters the ocean every year from rivers lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 used a similar model but compiled a larger data set to calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into seas and provided a number range between 0 0041 and 4 104 mt yr both lebreton et al 2017 and schmidt et al 2017 concluded that china s rivers account for a large proportion of the world s plastic debris transported to the ocean the emission of secondary microplastics has therefore attracted considerable public attention compared to the second source only a few studies have focused on the emission of primary microplastics the current research on primary source emission inventory mainly focuses on single source emission factors or emissions among them the release of microfibers during washing and the discharge of microbeads during cleaning processes are the most common cheung and fok et al 2017 estimated that 209 7 trillion microbeads 3 069 mt are emitted into the aquatic environment of mainland china every year research on emissions of all kinds of primary microplastics is relatively preliminary at present a few environmental protection agencies or government departments estimate the emissions of primary microplastics at the national scale both denmark and norway have estimated primary microplastic emission fluxes of 10 65 mt and 839 60 mt respectively the international union for conservation of nature iucn provided a rough estimate of global primary microplastic emissions and calculated the amount discharged into the ocean in some developed countries of europe and the united states releases from primary microplastics are equivalent to or outweigh those of secondary microplastics from mismanaged waste boucher and friot 2017 the issue posed by emissions of primary microplastics is becoming increasingly prominent although the proportion of marine plastics from primary sources is not very large about 15 31 boucher and friot 2017 it still deserves our attention because of the following characteristics 1 they are mainly produced due to daily plastic product use 2 these emissions are invisible 3 they are difficult to treat and avoid 4 at present countries or organizations including the united states netherlands and austria etc have begun to ban microplastics used in pccps leslie 2015 but compared to large plastic litter people pay less attention to the emissions of primary microplastics 5 when they are discharged the sizes of the polluting particles are much smaller than those of typical waste and thus their ecological hazards are greater population growth and rapid economic development in recent decades has led to an exponential increase in plastic product consumption in china china is the most populous country in the world with approximately 1 39 billion citizens in 2017 by the end of 2017 there were 310 million vehicles in china ranking second in the world after the united states nbsc 2018 in addition primary microplastics are mostly produced due to the manufacture and use of plastic products thus the emissions of primary microplastics in china are of both regional and global significance given the large amount of primary microplastics in use and the potential for their long range transportation the purpose of this paper is to provide an emission inventory of primary microplastics in mainland china in 2015 based on major primary microplastic emission activity levels and their emission factors efs collected from the literature to estimate as many sources of microplastics emission as possible we selected the definition of primary microplastics that includes more emission sources boucher and friot 2017 kole et al 2017 sundt et al 2014 van wezel et al 2016 this is the first study to present these results at the grid level for mainland china thereby illustrating the geographical distribution of these emissions by describing and estimating the characteristics of primary microplastic emissions our research aims to improve the understanding of the public on this aspect and raise their awareness on primary microplastics our results can not only provide important information toward developing environmental policies to reduce plastic pollution which is typically ignored in conventional waste management as awareness about it is yet to increase but also serve as a guidance for further large scale regression simulations and exposure analyses 2 methods 2 1 determination of main emission sources based on the relevant literature we identified the main sources of primary microplastics in mainland china boucher and friot 2017 lassen et al 2015 sundt et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the finalized list generated for this study included the following 1 synthetic fibers produced during washing and present in indoor dust 2 tire dust comprising tiny particles produced by friction and transfer of particles between the tire and ground 3 architectural coatings such as paint falling off during the process of painting buildings 4 marine coatings 5 vehicle paint 6 road markings 7 plastic dust pellets from raw material production or generated during transport 8 plastic granules from artificial turfs and other application and 9 microbeads produced in the use of personal care and cosmetics products pccps 2 2 estimation of provincial emissions in mainland china in 2015 the primary microplastics emissions for each source can be calculated using the formula in the form seen below 1 e j 1 k e f i j a i j where e denotes emissions a is the emission related activity level and ef is the emission factor i j and k indicate the emission sources sub sources and number of sub sources specific estimation formulas for emissions from each sub source are shown in table 1 the estimation of activity levels a involved many factors nearly 50 in this study due to their complexity most of the factors in a were collected from official published sources and related research cheung and fok 2017 cncia 2015 meec 2014 nbsc 2016a b data for a few factors mainly those referring to paints which account for only approximately 6 of total emissions can only be obtained at the national scale and thus they were allocated to each province from the national level based on the most closely related statistical data for example when estimating the activity level of road marking data on the amount of paint used in road marking are available at the national scale only hence the total road mileage in each province is used to allocate the national total emission at the provincial scale data on emission related activity level at the provincial scale and the source for each factor are listed in the si in addition efs are key to estimating emissions thus an effort was made to collect a large amount of related data from the literature hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 oecd 2009 sundt et al 2014 verschoor et al 2016 the value and source of each ef are shown in table 2 2 3 geographic distribution the emissions of each source at the provincial scale were obtained from the above calculations in order to conduct a comprehensive investigation calculate the model and formulate policy at a finer spatial scale researchers need to establish more detailed spatial emission inventories kuenen et al 2014 wang et al 2005 gridded emission inventories can be developed using the proxy based estimates with downscaling techniques proxy based methods require relatively less data and thus they are widely used for developing gridded emission inventories bouwman et al 1997 li et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 in this study several socio economic data such as population gdp traffic network water network and built up area were used as the spatial proxies table 3 we divided the emissions of each source by the grid area to obtain the emission density of each source in every grid lastly the individual primary microplastics emission densities in 2015 were mapped on 0 25 0 25 grids using the spatial allocation method can inevitably introduce some uncertainty bouwman et al 1997 li et al 2019 however we have minimized such uncertainties firstly the parameters that are most closely related to the emission activities of each source are selected for spatial allocation secondly the spatial differences of each emission activity are fully considered in the spatial allocation for example when distributing fibers and pccps the differences between urban and rural areas are taken into account and the total emissions of the corresponding areas are allocated using urban and rural populations respectively for the spatial distribution of tire dust we considered the differences in emission activities among highways urban roads and rural roads and the spatial distribution of emissions in the corresponding areas was carried out using vector data of three regional roads 2 4 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty in emissions arises from two aspects uncertainty in efs and related activity data we acknowledge that for many types of sources in mainland china very little is known about actual activity levels and efs and thus this lack of data does not allow us to analyze a certain prerequisite number of samples which is required to obtain a reasonable probability density distribution function therefore we assumed that the activity levels follow a normal distribution zhao et al 2011a 2011b 2012 and the efs follow a lognormal distribution bond et al 2004 li et al 2018 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2005 thus the arithmetic mean of the activity level and the geometric mean of the ef were applied in the monte carlo simulation we determined the standard deviations of efs and activity levels based on the u s epa s method and other studies streets et al 2003 u s epa 1999 wei et al 2011 first the activity levels were classified into four categories based on data reliability and availability table s2 1 raw material and vehicle paint standard deviation 30 2 pccps from urban areas synthetic fiber produced during washing in urban areas building paint tire dust standard deviation 60 3 pccps from rural areas synthetic fiber produced during washing in rural areas synthetic fiber shed from indoor clothing marine coating road marking standard deviation 100 and 4 artificial turf standard deviation 200 the specific basis for the classification is shown in table s2 the efs were classified into five categories based on data reliability and availability 1 pccps standard deviation 80 2 synthetic fibers produced during machine washing standard deviation 150 3 synthetic fibers shed indoors from clothing in urban areas artificial turf vehicle paint building paint raw material tire dust standard deviation 200 4 marine coating road marking standard deviation 300 5 synthetic fiber produced during hand washing synthetic fiber shed indoor from clothing in rural areas standard deviation 500 the classification basis is shown in table s3 monte carlo simulation was used to characterize the overall uncertainty for each source category the calculations of microplastics emission were replicated 10 000 times with a random selection of all inputs by matlab li et al 2019 shen et al 2013 2 5 quantities discharged into the aquatic environment the pathway of primary microplastics from different sources discharging into the aquatic environment is complex and diverse and the related research data are relatively scarce thus it is difficult to estimate the amount of microplastics entering the aquatic environment to facilitate this we simplified the pathways of different sources entering aquatic ecosystems into four categories domestic sewage pathway road runoff pathway wind pathway and adjacent waters pathway mainly marine coating burton 2017 lassen et al 2015 verschoor et al 2016 fig 1 the pathways and quantification of primary microplastics into the aquatic environment are as follows 1 domestic sewage pathway mainly including synthetic fibers from washing pccps and interior paints the microplastics discharged during the rinsing process and can be termed as wastewater the microplastics in the wastewater enter the aquatic environment in two ways cheung and fok 2017 a direct discharge of untreated sewage equation 2 2 q a w p 1 e w p r u n t r e a t e d where q a w p 1 is the amount directly discharged into the aquatic environment through the un treated wastewater e w p is the emission of microplastics from the domestic sewage pathway and r u n t r e a t e d is the percentage of untreated sewage cheung and fok 2017 b the proportion that escapes treatment from the sewage treatment plant stp equation 3 3 q a w p 2 e w p 1 r u n t r e a t e d 1 r r e where q a w p 2 is the amount of microplastics that escapes from the stp and r r e is the sewage treatment efficiency boucher and friot 2017 2 road runoff pathway mainly including tire dust vehicle paints exterior paints road marking artificial turf and plastic pellets these microplastics are discharged on the road and some of them are washed away by rainwater because of the differences in the drainage infrastructure and pavement hardening the pathways to the aquatic environment in urban and rural areas differ slightly part of the emissions from rural areas are discharged directly into surface water while those from urban areas are mainly discharged into the drainage system through sewers urban areas possess two kinds of drainage systems a separate sewer or a combined sewer here we assumed 50 of each kind the sewage entering the former drainage system is discharged directly into the receiving water body in mainland china while the sewage entering the latter kind is discharged partially into the receiving water body after treatment boucher and friot 2017 yang et al 2015 fig 1 thus these release amounts were calculated using equation 4 4 q a r r p e r r p r d i r e c t 1 2 r s e w e r 1 2 r s e w e r 1 r r e where q a r r p refers to the emissions of microplastics into aquatic environments through the road runoff pathway r d i r e c t is the percentage directly discharged into the surface water r s e w e r is the share of microplastics discharged into the sewer verschoor et al 2016 and r r e is the sewage treatment efficiency boucher and friot 2017 the above parameters vary depending on the type of the source 3 wind pathway when tire particles and road markings are shed onto roads a part of these emissions is spread by the wind to surface waters it is estimated that 10 of road emissions will be blown to surface waters or oceans by wind wang et al 2015 4 adjacent waters pathway this pathway only covers emissions from marine coatings following previous studies we assume that almost all such emissions eventually enter the aquatic environment boucher and friot 2017 in addition in order to formulate more detailed emission reduction strategies we sorted out the key nodes of primary microplastics entering aquatic systems where node 1 represents the production stage of the relevant plastic products node 2 represents the microplastics production stage and node 3 represents the microplastics treatment stage fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 primary microplastic emissions in mainland china using the approach described in the previous section it was estimated that the primary microplastic emissions from mainland china amounted to 7372 87 million tons in 2015 because of the country s large human and vehicular population the emissions from primary sources are about 85 times that of norway and 400 times that of denmark lassen et al 2015 sundt et al 2014 the first and second highest proportions of these emissions in mainland china were attributed to tire dust and synthetic fibers accounting for 53 91 and 28 77 respectively fig 2 a as a comparison the proportion of tire dust in primary microplastics in norway is quite high 53 6 while that of other sources is relatively small and the proportion of synthetic fibers is less than 12 5 sundt et al 2014 this may be because while norway has a much smaller human population than that of mainland china its vehicular population is comparable 3 2 geographical distribution and emission characteristics due to wide differences in population density economic development and consumption mode emission patterns and rates were considerably different among various regions in mainland china the annual emissions per unit area can reflect the absolute density of pollution sources which was found to decrease from east to west for each source fig 3 a and e from the perspective of provincial scale the highest emissions per unit area were found in shanghai city which recorded estimated emission densities of 2446 31 kg km2 which were about two to three times as many as that of the second beijing city and third places tianjin city fig 3e fig 3b illustrates the close relationship between the emission density of microplastics and population density at the provincial scale n 31 r2 0 99 p 0 01 proving that the emission characteristics of primary microplastics produced as part of everyday use is a representation of population density there is a significant positive correlation between primary microplastic emissions and the population in each province n 31 r2 0 93 p 0 01 fig 3c it can be estimated that every human in mainland china emits 538 g of microplastics per year equivalent to every human discarding one plastic bag per week moreover a good correlation was observed between per capita emissions and per capita gdp fig 3d while the relevance was lower for the population r2 0 21 0 93 the above analysis shows that on the one hand primary microplastics emissions result from daily use of plastic product usage and thus the emissions depend largely on population size on the other hand because some emissions e g tire dust comprise a large proportion of total primary microplastics and given the extent of motor vehicle ownership in mainland china these emissions also depend on economic development therefore the level of economic development is an important factor in this regard in addition china s economic disparities are easily reflected in urban rural than inter provincial disparities treiman 2012 although the rural population in china was slightly higher than that in urban areas in 2015 the emissions of primary microplastics in urban areas were about twice that in rural areas considering all the provinces the proportion of tire dust was generally the largest and far greater than the proportions of other types of microplastics only hubei hunan and chongqing recorded relatively low proportions of tire dust similar to those of fiber based microplastics about 40 the main reason for this finding is that these provinces have fewer motor vehicles per capita than other provinces nbsc 2016b when the emissions were presented at raster resolution more detailed distribution characteristics were revealed generally speaking the spatial differences in total emissions of primary microplastics in mainland china mainly depend on the distribution of the population density and transportation network fig 4 emission densities of areas such as jing jin ji region yangtze river delta pearl river delta and the central plains were generally higher than those of the other regions the spatial distribution of primary microplastics emissions from various sources is affected by different factors distribution patterns of various sources can be divided into several types as follows 1 in terms of the sources of pccps and synthetic textiles major urban areas stood out as the main emission centers because their emissions are closely related to people s washing and personal care habits although urban areas have a larger population emissions from these two sources were 3 and 340 times respectively those from rural areas 2 tire dust and road markings are mainly related to the density of the road network at the raster scale 3 since plastic production was highly correlated with local demand at the provincial scale r2 0 60 n 30 p 0 05 the emissions of plastic raw materials were mostly distributed in the more developed regions 4 high density emissions from building paints and artificial turfs were found to be mostly located in metropolitan areas this is because these two kinds of pollution sources arise from the process of urbanization and the associated construction activities for public infrastructure 3 3 uncertainty analysis fig 5 shows the uncertainty distribution of total emissions of primary microplastics in 2015 the results indicate that the distribution of total emissions conforms to a lognormal distribution and the distribution characteristics are determined by the uncertainty of emission factors and activity data the 95 confidence interval range of the total uncertainty distribution is 5 86e 08 to 1 75e 09 kg yr which includes our calculated emissions 7 37e 08 kg yr the results of the uncertainty analysis for each source are presented in fig 6 it shows that the uncertainty associated with the total emissions of microplastics is mainly attributable to tires fibers and artificial turf the three relevant sub ranges are 2 88e 08 to 8 13e 08 1 10e 08 to 7 80e 08 and 2 27e 07 to 5 32e 08 kg yr respectively the highest uncertainties arise from road marking 3 93e 06 kg yr 88 33 759 20 and marine coating 2 01e 06 kg yr 87 70 734 23 although these two sources of emissions are relatively small there is a great uncertainty in the estimation of their emissions at present and thus we should strengthen our research on the emissions of microplastics for these two aspects in the future 3 4 quantity discharged into the aquatic environment and policy recommendations it was estimated that about 120 28 gg of primary microplastics entered the aquatic environment in 2015 which is equivalent to one sixth of the total emissions the largest source of primary microplastics entering the aquatic environment changed from tire dust to synthetic fibers fig 2b this result is in agreement with past findings regarding the high proportion of synthetic fiber microplastics in the marine environment browne et al 2011 salvador et al 2017 due to the huge population base and rapid economic development of mainland china a large number of primary microplastics are discharged and a significant proportion enters the aquatic environment unlike secondary source microplastics primary source microplastic emissions mostly originate from the use process of plastic products and most of them are invisible in order to reduce the discharge of primary microplastics to the environment especially to the aquatic ecosystem we analyzed the entire process of production and entry into the environment i e routes of several sources of primary microplastics to identify controllable link nodes fig 1 firstly it is most efficient to prevent microplastic pollution at the design stage itself when considering the life cycle node 1 for example spinning and weaving methods and the selection of fiber type is extremely important with regard to reducing the release of fiber agarwal et al 2011 for tires it is crucial to improve the wear resistance of the tire in the manufacturing process for example tires that use silica as filler are less susceptible to wear and tear than tires with black carbon verschoor et al 2016 because these products are daily consumables the consumer choices should be taken into account while improving production technology long time periods are needed to popularize new technologies secondly it is relatively easier to consider pollution control measures pertaining to the production process node 2 for example the washing process of fibers produces microplastics suitable filters in washing machines may therefore serve as a very effective way to control the amount of fibers being introduced in the wastewater during the laundry process by preventing them from entering the sewage system mermaids 2016 tire friction can be better reduced by improving the composition and maintenance of roads as well as their surface infrastructure the use of appropriate pavement materials can reduce tire wear verschoor et al 2016 however replacing current roads is expensive and will be a long term process in mainland china thus although the above two methods are effective they have a long implementation period and weak market controllability finally increasing the treatment of microplastics in sewage treatment plants node 3 should be a short term viable solution to reduce the entry of microplastics into the environment examples include adding a fine grid filter to trap microplastics after mixing in the ultraviolet disinfection tank or before the effluent water is discharged bai et al 2018 the formulation of specific emission reduction measures requires more data support therefore it is of great significance to take up in depth researches which will support the control policies of microplastics 4 conclusion primary microplastics are mostly produced due to the daily use of plastic products the emission process is often invisible and poses potential ecological hazards thus this topic deserves public attention due to mainland china s huge population base and rapid economic development emissions of primary microplastics in china are both regionally and globally significant the emission inventory of primary microplastics in mainland china was first established in this study it was estimated that primary microplastic emissions from mainland china amounted to 737 29 gg million tons in 2015 and that one sixth of this amount entered the aquatic environment the highest proportions were attributed to tire dust and synthetic fibers accounting for 53 91 and 28 77 of the total respectively the emissions of primary microplastics mainly depend on the population followed by the level of economic development it can be roughly estimated that 538 g person of microplastics are generated by each person in china the emission density in the eastern region is higher than that in the western region at the grid scale the spatial difference in the total emissions of primary microplastics in mainland china depends primarily on the distribution of population density and the transportation network the uncertainty pertaining to total microplastic emissions mainly arises from tires fibers and artificial turf the three sub ranges are 2 88e 08 to 8 13e 08 1 10e 08 to 7 80e 08 and 2 27e 07 to 5 32e 08 kg yr we analyzed the entire life cycle of several sources of microplastics from production to discharge to the aquatic environment we ascertained various control measures under different nodes increasing the treatment of microplastics in sewage treatment plants appears to be a short term viable way to reduce the entry of microplastics into the environment improving product technology is another key method to reduce the emissions of primary microplastics but such interventions are not likely to be implemented in the near future overall by estimating primary microplastic emissions and analyzing emission characteristics our study not only raises public awareness and concerns about primary microplastics but also guides the development of environmental policies to reduce plastic pollution however only a few reliable emission factors are currently available and thus the emission inventory is likely to be characterized by large uncertainties

18647,river bank filtration rbf is considered to efficiently remove nitrate and trace organic micropollutants omp from polluted surface waters this is essential for maintaining good groundwater quality and providing high quality drinking water predicting the fate of omp during rbf is difficult as the biogeochemical factors controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood to determine in situ removal efficiency and degradation rates of nitrate and omp indicator substances we conducted a field study in a rbf system during a period of one and a half years incorporating temporally and spatially varying redox conditions and temperature changes typically occurring in temperate climates rbf was analyzed by means of mixing ratios between infiltrated river water and groundwater as well as average residence times of surface water towards the individual groundwater observation wells these results were used to calculate temperature dependent first order degradation rates of redox sensitive species and several omp five out of ten investigated omp were completely removed along rbf pathways we demonstrate that degradation rates of several omp during bank filtration were controlled by redox conditions and temperature whereby temperature itself also had a significant influence on the extent of the most reactive oxic zone the seasonal variations in temperature alone could explain a considerable percentage of the variance in dissolved oxygen 34 nitrate 81 as well as the omps diclofenac 44 and sulfamethoxazole 76 estimated in situ degradation rates roughly varied within one order of magnitude for temperature changes between 5 c and 20 c this study highlights that temporal variability in temperature and redox zonation is a significant factor for migration and degradation of nitrate and several omps graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals in situ degradation rates denitrification river groundwater interaction urban water cycle 1 introduction the main sources of organic micropollutants omps in the aquatic system are from farm manure on agricultural land and effluents from sewage treatment plants stp petrie et al 2015 an important fraction of the omp are not fully eliminated in the waste water treatment processes and thus released to surface waters such as rivers and lakes vieno et al 2005 within the surface waters the omps are transported substantially downstream while photochemical degradation is likely to be an important loss mechanism boreen et al 2003 omps even appear at low concentrations in groundwater especially in stp effluent impacted rivers where surface water is used indirectly for drinking water production via bank filtration maeng et al 2011 river bank filtration rbf is an important effective and cheap technique for surface water purification due to filtration of suspended solids bacteria viruses or parasites adsorption and biodegradation of inorganic and some organic pollutants hamann et al 2016 consequently improved understanding of the environmental fate and transport of wastewater derived pollutants is essential for effective protection of vital aquatic ecosystem services environmental health and drinking water supplies the potential for attenuation of omp and corresponding removal rates strongly depend on subsurface residence time temperature burke et al 2014 redox condition wiese et al 2011 particulate organic carbon content of the substrate hebig et al 2017 labile dissolved organic carbon concentrations hoppe jones et al 2012 and the evolving local microbial community bertelkamp et al 2016 all of them are site specific or strongly vary in time reported removal rates of omp varied up to three orders of magnitude among different subsurface environments and experimental setups greskowiak et al 2017 an increased number of laboratory batch and column studies bertelkamp et al 2014 burke et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 as well as modelling studies of artificial groundwater recharge greskowiak et al 2006 and bank filtration systems henzler et al 2014 2016 revealed that factors including seasonal temperature variations redox conditions and physical chemical properties of omp had strong impacts on their attenuation and degradation behavior but natural attenuation and degradation processes of omp under a wide range of environmental conditions at the field scale are studied rarely massmann et al 2006 heberer et al 2008 schaper et al 2018 and correlation to factors that are well known to affect the degradation rate may be weak greskowiak et al 2017 despite the large number of omp found in natural environments little is known about their transport behavior in groundwater rather many more experimental studies especially field studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of degradation mechanisms and controlling factors the objectives of this study were i to assess the behavior of representative omps under seasonal varying redox states and temperatures present in the aquatic system and ii to quantify in situ degradation rates and their dependence on environmental conditions during rbf for this purpose concentrations of a number of omps were measured at the field scale during a period of one and a half years with a high temporal resolution of about four weeks this unique data set allows a comprehensive assessment of the interlinked processes and controls governing solute attenuation to disentangle the mixed effects of seasonal variations in the redox state temperature occurrence of omps in the surface water and the hydraulic controls during rbf 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in potsdam brandenburg germany where a bank filtration water works is operated south of the sacrow paretzer kanal which is part of the havel river system connecting berlin with the lower river havel sidestepping the city of potsdam the havel is a lowland river with a catchment area of about 24 000 km2 located in northeastern germany flowing mainly through the federal states of brandenburg and berlin the havel discharge is strongly regulated by several barrages and large flow through lakes e g tegeler see and wannsee mean discharge at the study side was 24 m³ s 1 with a standard deviation of about 14 m³ s 1 the main tributaries of the havel are the river spree and the teltow canal especially by these tributaries the havel is impacted by sewage treatment plant effluents from the city of berlin e g heberer 2002 in total six relevant stp treat the wastewater of about 3 7 million people the portion of sewage effluents at the havel discharge at the study site at mean discharge is about 16 4 m³ s 1 the distance from the study site to the waste water effluents varies between approximately 14 km stp stahnsdorf and ruhleben 40 km stp wansdorf and 60 km stp münchhofe for details about the potsdam berlin waterways and the locations of the stp see heberer 2002 the aquifer adjacent to the sacrow paretzer kanal is formed by quaternary sediments mainly consisting of silica sand and gravels which are semi confined aquifers stratified by glacial till layers from the later pleistocene the glaciofluvial sediments above the till were deposited during weichsel glacial period qswa while those below belong to the saale glacial period qsd the aquifer extends from approximately 36 m a s l to 5 m below average sea level the aquifer is underlain by an aquitard of the holstein interglacial the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer sediments varies between 2 9 10 05 m s 1 and 1 75 10 03 m s 1 and was slightly higher for the qswa 6 94 10 4 m s 1 compared to the qsd 2 39 10 4 m s 1 sediments estimates based on pumping tests the monitoring design consisted of six observation points one located at the northern floodplain of the river three distributed along the southern river shoreline and two further in a transect roughly perpendicular to the river aligned

two observation wells each were placed together with different filter screen elevation the shallow ones are located approximately in the qswa sediments and the deeper ones are located approximately in

reported as half the detection limit the investigated compounds were chosen because of their common occurrence in the havel catchment and their expected fate and reactivity during bank filtration heberer 2002 jekel et al 2015 schaper et al 2018 table 1 2 3 calculation of mixing ratios and residence times in order to estimate the mixing ratio between infiltrated surface water and original groundwater i e dilution of effluent impacted river water with groundwater at each observation well we used naturally occurring solute concentrations assuming a linear mixing model between independent endmembers the mixing ratios between the members were evaluated by means of multivariate statistical analysis using the mix code carrera et al 2004 mix contains a maximum likelihood method to estimate mixing ratios while acknowledging uncertainty in endmember concentrations to improve the quality of computations three species were included in our analyses acesulfame cl na an essential assumption for the calculation of the mixing ratios is that the included species exhibit a conservative behavior and that their values significantly differ between surface water and groundwater the values of groundwater endmembers were taken from the deep groundwater observation well u100 assumed to be not affected by infiltration from the sacrow paretzer kanal average residence times of surface water towards the individual groundwater observation wells were evaluated based on the propagation of the seasonal temperature signal into the aquifer the seasonal temperature signal is transported into the saturated sediment via advection and conduction but is retarded to a certain degree depending on heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment that means the thermal front moves slower than the water particle or conservative solutes itself and the amplitude of the seasonal temperature signal is reduced with increasing transport distance munz and schmidt 2017 nonetheless seasonal temperature signals can penetrate at least to distances of several tens of meters into the aquifer upon bank filtration and can therefore be detected in equipped standard observation boreholes in the vicinity of the river wang et al 2019 aquifer residence times can be assessed based on the time shift of the fitted sinusoidal temperature oscillation to the measured temperature data the temperature time lag difference in temperature time shift between surface water and groundwater observation well can be converted to an estimate of the aquifer residence time using the thermal retardation factor relating the flow velocity of a water parcel conservative transport to that of advective conductive transport of temperature hoehn and cirpka 2006 where the measured groundwater temperature data show a clear sinusoidal pattern and amplitude the propagation of the river temperature is well applicable in the last years this concept has also been applied to the more dynamic situation of hyporheic exchange flows and residence times analytically as well as numerically e g munz et al 2016 munz et al 2017 2 4 potential for pharmaceutical removal degradation rates the river groundwater interface is considered as being a hotspot for microbial activity and biogeochemical reactions for horizontally dominated exchange within the hyporheic zone e g trauth et al 2015 or for groundwater recharge as in river bank filtration e g van driezum et al 2018 if concentrations of dissolved substances observed in the groundwater do not agree with the predicted concentrations by means of the mixing ratios than removal processes must be occurring also including chemical or biological degradation the redox zonation within the aquifer is characterized by the disappearance of oxygen o2 nitrate no3 or the appearance of manganese mn2 and iron fe2 as suggested by massmann et al 2008 rather than by their redox potential sulphate reduction was monitored based on sulphate decrease to evaluate the role of aerobic respiration on doc we used metabolism calculation as proposed by battin 1999 evaluating the difference in do concentration between river and groundwater δdo against the difference in doc concentration between river and groundwater δdoc assuming a molar respiratory quotient of 1 1 i e metabolism of one mole of doc requires one mole of oxygen idealized stoichiometry of aerobic microbially mediated processes ch2o o2 co2 h2o δdo in this case is equal to δdoc the potential for pharmaceutical removal of a given compound during rbf at the river groundwater interface and along subsurface flow paths was quantified by the percentage of removal pr for each individual pollutant heberer et al 2008 massmann et al 2008 depending on the time of infiltration temperature and redox condition within the aquifer their concentration in the recharge sources the corresponding surface water groundwater mixing ratios and the subsurface residence times the first order degradation rate constant k was calculated with respect to the subsurface residence time the retardation factor and the corresponding mixing ratios between the river and w07high oxic or between w07low and w03low anoxic in respect to the subsurface zone where the observed substances were clearly degraded for oxic degradation the degradation rate is likely much higher in the immediate vicinity of the streambed then further downgradient henzler et al 2014 and hence the quantified degradation rates potentially underestimate local rates close to the streambed if dissolved substances were completely degraded along their subsurface flow path concentration in the observation well is equal to the detection limit the calculated rate constants have to be regarded as minimum values of degradation rates if a calculated degradation rate was slightly negative it was set to zero and the difference in concentrations between river and observations well was attributed to be caused by uncertainties in the detected concentrations or underestimated desorption processes 2 5 statistical analysis to assess sampling variability in the source concentrations all omp recorded in the river were reported along with their spatial and temporal variations therefore we used the average of the standard deviations of all river concentrations per sampling campaign sdspace and the standard deviation of all concentrations measured during one day sdtime multiple regression models were used to identify the influence of physicochemical aquifer parameters t doc ph ec and eh on the fate of redox sensitive species and observed omp if the reported p values were smaller than 0 01 the parameter was assumed to have a significant effect on the observed concentration for all parameters having a significant effect a linear model was fitted to the experimental data and was evaluated in terms of r2 to characterize the non parametric relationships between predictor variables and the observed concentrations we used spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the statistical analyses the variables were log normalized when bivariate relations showed a clear non linear behavior e g do versus t to perform the statistical analyses we used the software environment r r development core team 2011 3 results 3 1 hydraulic situation and temperature dynamics seasonal variation in river water level at the study site situated at river kilometer 20 21 ranged between 29 8 m a s l february march and 29 4 m a s l july august the yearly water level fluctuation was about only 0 4 m within the observation period between december 2015 and july 2017 rainfall induced discharge events occurred in july 2017 resulting in a short peak in river water level of about 29 8 m a s l fig 2 a the boundary condition of river water level which only varies slightly in combination with the quasi continuous pumping rates at the waterworks caused an almost temporally constant hydraulic gradient d h from the river toward the pumping well gallery d h δ h δ l where δ h is difference of hydraulic head and δ l is horizontal distance yielding to continuous river water infiltration into the aquifer via bank filtration based on the hydraulic conditions the rbf system is seen to be fairly stable without pronounced flood events that induce short term variations in mixing ratios and residence times seasonal temperature extremes ranged between a minimum of 1 c in winter december february and a maximum of 22 c in summer june august temperature variation in the river could be approximated well by a sinusoidal function r2 0 94 with amplitude of about 10 1 c fig 2c and d the seasonal temperature signal thermal front penetrates into the aquifer by heat advection and conduction sinusoidal temperature oscillations at the groundwater observation wells were reduced in amplitude and shifted towards later times compared to the temperature oscillation in the river fig 2c the temperature amplitude reduced to 0 4 c at a distance of about 120 m w04low from the river shore line strong seasonal temperature oscillation with minimum temperatures below 6 c only occurred within the nearshore aquifer along the first 10 20 m of the infiltration zone w07 for a detailed spatial temperature distribution within the aquifer see results of transient 3 d modelling of flow and heat transport of wang et al 2019 3 2 mixing ratios and residence times the concentrations of acesulfame chloride and sodium in the river tend to vary seasonally with maximum concentrations in october november 2016 and minimum concentrations in may june 2016 and 2017 fig sm 1 the seasonal course of these conservative substances at the groundwater observation wells followed the trend observed in the river but was individually shifted in time the concentration range at the observation wells was close to the range observed in the river fig sm 1 average background concentration of deep lateral groundwater u100 was about 1224 ng l 1 for acesulfame 32 mg l 1 for sodium and 46 mg l 1 for chloride generally the groundwater observation wells are dominated by infiltrated surface water throughout the entire observation period the spatial distribution of the average mixing ratios is illustrated in fig 1b the portion of surface water in the aquifer at the near shore is above 94 whereby the surface water contribution at w07high is 100 no mixing effects of the source concentrations details about the deviation between measured and calculated concentrations are presented in detail in table sm 2 the average uncertainty of the mixing ratios of the observation wells dominated by surface water infiltration ranged between 3 0 w08 and 2 5 w07low tab sm 2 the subsurface residence times ranged between 18 d close to the river and 438 d close to the pumping well gallery fig 1c residence times of w08 49 d and w09 59 d were slightly higher than those of w07high a temperature retardation factor of 2 4 was used for the analyses calculated from literature derived values of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity for sandy materials stonestrom and blasch 2003 addressing the uncertainty in the temperature retardation factor which reasonably might vary between 2 1 and 2 7 would end up in variations in the estimated aquifer residence times of 2 days for w07high and of 15 days for w03low 3 3 redox condition in the aquifer the river water was almost saturated with o2 during the entire observation period varying between 12 mg l 1 in winter and 5 mg l 1 in summer mean nitrate concentration in the river was 5 2 mg l 1 with slight seasonal variation with a maximum of 9 4 mg l 1 in winter and a minimum of 4 1 mg l 1 in summer following the course of the oxygen concentration fig 3 a in comparison to the permanent oxic river water the groundwater at the observation wells was substantially reduced in w07high and w07low close to the river shore line 13 5 m with a depth of 0 1 2 1 m and 5 6 7 6 m below the river bottom respectively fig 1c the redox condition displayed strong seasonal variations fig 1d in summer all oxygen was removed before reaching the first groundwater observation well w07high only when aquifer temperatures were below 11 c from december 2015 until june 2016 and from december 2016 until april 2017 oxic conditions were encountered in w07high with maximum concentrations of 3 mg l 1 shortly after the observed peak in oxygen also the no3 concentration reached its maximum of 6 mg l 1 which was comparable to the corresponding no3 concentration within the river at the time of infiltration t res 18 d only on 30 08 2016 when temperature at w07high was highest 20 2 c the no3 concentration decreased to zero in w07high mn2 appeared only in autumn at times when o2 had been fully depleted and shortly after the no3 concentration decreased to zero fig 3b at w07low mn2 and fe2 appeared between june 2016 and january 2017 when the oxygen and nitrate were completely degraded fig 3c in winter 2017 no o2 breakthrough was observed and maximum concentration of no3 peaked at march 2017 with concentration up to 3 mg l 1 for a short period roughly half of the corresponding river concentration wells w03low and w04low far from the shore line never contained oxygen or nitrate but iron concentration of up to 1 mg l 1 no sulphate reduction was observed at the observation wells with exception of w07low average sulfate concentration in the river and w04low was about 187 mg l 1 and 194 mg l 1 respectively on top of the seasonal variations the no3 concentrations dropped to zero during the rainfall induced discharge events in july 2017 that occasional drop down propagated towards the near shore observation wells in contrast no substantial event based variation in o2 mn2 and fe2 concentration were observed neither in the river nor in the groundwater observation wells 3 4 doc throughout the year river doc concentrations were quite constant with a mean value of 6 9 mg c l 1 and a standard deviation of 0 6 mg c l 1 average groundwater doc concentrations were always less than river water concentrations fig sm 3 the doc concentration from the river towards the observation wells decreased only within the first meters of the infiltration area oxygenated zone the doc concentration between river and w07high decreased in average of about 4 2 mg c l 1 between april and november 2016 64 of the total doc present and of about only 1 5 mg c l 1 between december 2016 and july 2017 23 the degree of doc removal fluctuated slightly between both periods but did not show any seasonality nor did it show a clear relation to the hydraulic conditions throughout the entire observation period the δdo exceeds the δdoc an according metabolism plot for w07high is shown in fig sm 4 3 5 concentration of omp in the river and in the aquifer fig 4 shows the observed omp concentrations in the river along with the spatial and temporal variations observed concentrations were comparable along the river and over the course of one day cp sdspace and sdtime in figs 5 and 6 the surface water is well mixed by frequently induced turbulent water circulation through shipping observed concentrations were typically in the higher nanogram per liter level except valsartan which occur in the mg per liter level fig 4 the occurrence of omps in the river was grouped according to their occurrence and seasonal variation in their concentrations fig 4 table 1 and their fate and conditions of degradation in the aquifer table 1 figs 5 and 6 in the deeper lateral groundwater u100 out of the observed omps only acesulfame c u 100 1224 ng l 1 primidone c u 100 31 ng l 1 and phenazone c u 100 935 ng l 1 were detected phenazone sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen substantially varied in their measured concentration between mid june and mid july 2017 fig 4 when the water level and discharge in the river quickly raised due to strong precipitation events fig 2 the concentration increased after the rise up of the water level by about 35 phenazone 28 sulfamethoxazole and 760 ibuprofen afterwards the concentrations of phenazone and sulfamethoxazole decreased below the pre event concentration whereas the concentration of ibuprofen stayed above the pre event concentration 56 the results of the degradation rates and the statistical analyses are presented in table 2 the results highlight the significant effect of seasonal temperature variations on the fate of redox sensitive species and several omp within the shallow aquifer within the thermally active zone w07high the seasonal variations in temperature alone can explain a considerable percentage of the variance in do 34 nitrate 81 as well as diclofenac 44 and sulfamethoxazole 76 for these substances we observed a negative correlation between temperature and concentration in the water sample in contrast only a minor part of the variance in phenazone and carbamazepine can be explained by seasonal variations in temperature 28 for these substances we observed a positive correlation between temperature and concentration in the water sample 4 discussion 4 1 redox zonation and nitrate removal at the river groundwater interface the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations substantially decrease sm 3 according to this interface being considered a hotspot for microbial activity and biogeochemical reactions along the subsurface flow path of the bank filtrate distinguishable redox zones develop due to the sequential order of terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate manganese and iron oxides and hydroxides the observed redox zonation highly depended on the environmental temperature which can explain 34 of the variance in do and 81 of the variance in no3 using a simple linear model the highest rates of oxygen consumption in the aquifer pr 99 at w07 occurred when groundwater temperatures where high fig 3b in winter when average temperature in the aquifer falls below 8 c oxygen consumption rates significantly decreased resulting in a breakthrough of oxygen at w07high pr 75 the decrease in oxygen concentration along the subsurface flow path is presumably caused by intense heterotrophic aerobic respiration of doc as a river borne carbon source and particulate organic matter poc present in the aquifer at all times but particularly in winter the molecular decrease in oxygen between river and w07high exceeded the decrease in doc fig sm 4 this indicates that besides dissolved organic carbon poc present in the aquifer or more likely fresh organic matter of the clogging layer may act as an additional electron donor during rbf as has been previously found in riverbank filtration settings grunheid et al 2005 the percentage of nitrate removal between river and w07 ranged between 6 and 89 only for longer flow paths towards w03 the entire nitrate load imported from the river into the aquifer was removed pr 99 nitrate degradation rates of the near groundwater zone were about 1 5 of first order rate constants of rbf and artificial recharge sites reported for berlin henzler et al 2016 greskowiak et al 2006 and about one order of magnitude smaller than for natural riparian zones trauth et al 2018 decreasing do concentrations favor anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification limited by the inhibition effect of do and the temperature dependent degradation rates several studies observed a threshold in do concentrations of about 2 mg l 1 below which denitrification activity strongly increases whereby various nitrogen species can be efficiently assimilated transformed or permanently removed rivett et al 2008 finally temperature is a crucial control on the activity of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria significantly affecting degradation rates in hyporheic zones hill et al 1998 riparian groundwater trauth et al 2018 and rbf systems this study 4 2 concentration of omp in the river seasonal changes in concentrations in the surface water are caused by changes in precipitation and dilution and by changes in elimination rates through photochemical degradation biodegradation and or adsorption processes loraine and pettigrove 2006 the seasonal course of acesulfame and carbamazepine concentrations which have been found to be stable in surface aquatic environments tixier et al 2003 were related to changing dilution of effluents with maximum concentrations in october 2016 after a long period of low river discharge maximum variation in observed concentrations caused by dilution at the study site is expected to be about 60 caused by variations in the river discharge to effluent discharge ratio assuming a constant input by the stp clofibric acid was not detected in the surface water during the entire observation period even though it is assumed to exhibit a significant persistence in the aquatic system tixier et al 2003 some of the compounds observed e g phenazone primidone and sulfamethoxazole seem to show a significant persistence in the surface water though these substances partly are affected by degradation and sorption processes in an aquatic environment meierjohann et al 2016 seasonal variation in degradation and sorption processes which tend to increase with increasing temperature seems to compensate seasonal variations in observed concentrations due to dilution fig 4b concentrations of most omp in the havel river system tend to vary seasonally with higher concentrations in winter and lower concentrations in summer most likely caused by photochemical degradation boreen et al 2003 in winter the global radiation is low often below 200 w m 2 and the sunshine duration is short often below 1 h d 1 under these conditions photo transformation is limited as an elimination pathway the opposite conditions are prevailing in summer with high global radiation up to 1100 w m 2 and daily sunshine duration up to 15 h d 1 creating excellent conditions for photochemical degradation of the pharmaceuticals the observed concentrations of valsartan cc 0 85 r2 0 72 diclofenac cc 0 87 r2 0 67 and bezafibrate cc 0 86 r2 0 76 were found to significantly decrease with sunshine duration of the previous month 4 3 concentration of omp in the aquifer 4 3 1 persistent omp primidone and acesulfame were detected in the bank filtrate fig sm 1 especially the artificial sweetener acesulfame is assumed to be persistent in the aquatic environment and thus supposed to act as an ideal wastewater marker engelhardt et al 2013 recently burke et al 2014 demonstrated that acesulfame was not attenuated in laboratory column studies under cold conditions 6 5 c but displayed slight removal under warm conditions 19 5 c we found that acesulfame was transported within the aquifer in a conservative manner under anoxic aquifer conditions quite independent of the temperature conditions k equal to zero only under the oxic conditions between 09 2016 and 04 2017 we observed slight degradation of acesulfame average k 0 009 d 1 sdtime 0 005 d 1 4 3 2 degradation under oxic aquifer condition out of the nine compounds detected in the surface water bezafibrate k 0 13 d 1 and ibuprofen k 0 09 d 1 were not present any more in the bank filtrate these substances are well known to be biodegradable under oxic conditions while the minimum in situ degradation rates at our site with rather short distance rbf were substantially higher than previously reported during long term long distance rbf table 1 the calculated degradation rates in combination with the low source concentration in the river during summer when the extent of the oxic zone is narrow are sufficient for a complete removal of these substances at the nearshore aquifer throughout the entire observation period phenazone diclofenac and valsartan were efficiently attenuation under oxic conditions in winter when temperature was low and oxygen was present in the near shore aquifer the removal rates of these compounds decreased under anoxic conditions up to a persistent behavior in summer when temperatures were high and oxygen did not penetrate into the aquifer based on the experimental data alone it is not possible to clearly quantify the single effect of temperature and the redox regime on the degradation rates due to the cross correlation between both effects within the nearshore aquifer burke et al 2014 observed a significant decrease in phenazone degradation rates in saturated laboratory columns under oxic penoxic conditions at a temperature of 19 4 c k 5 53 d 1 and a temperature of 6 5 c k 1 64 d 1 within that temperature range the removal rate constant of phenazone decreased by a factor of 3 but was about two orders of magnitude higher than degradation rates found in this study average phenazone concentrations at w03 548 ng l 1 and w04 779 ng l 1 were predominantly higher than the concentrations in the river 74 ng l 1 about half of these values could be explained by mixing with the lateral groundwater flow constituting an additional source with much higher phenazone concentration c u 100 935 ng l 1 desorption seems not to be a suited explanation since phenazone is reported not to be subject to sorption desorption in an aquifer henzler et al 2014 massmann et al 2008 average degradation rates of diclofenac of the near groundwater zone were about 0 07 d 1 generally diclofenac is known to be better attenuated at higher temperatures whereby the temperature effect observed during infiltration was rather low due to the strong variations in river concentrations which were almost zero in summer however the observed rate constant in laboratory column studies with undisturbed sediment cores from a riverbank filtration site at lake wannsee substantially decreased by a factor of 1 6 for the temperature settings of 6 5 c k 6 4 d 1 and 19 4 c k 10 4 d 1 burke et al 2014 but were about two orders of magnitude higher than degradation rates found in our field study which is often the case for degradation rates e g watson et al 2005 when aquifer conditions turned anaerobic diclofenac behaves persistent burke et al 2014 and can be transported over longer distances within the aquifer the measured breakthrough of diclofenac at w03 t res 104 d r diclofenac 1 in between 02 2017 and 05 2017 with concentrations of about 200 ng l 1 were related to high concentrations in the river paired with anoxic aquifer conditions between 10 2016 and 01 2017 whereas the breakthrough at w04 resulted from the previous year when high river concentrations paired with anoxic aquifer conditions at the nearshore aquifer between december 2015 and march 2016 but it remains unclear why in w03 no breakthrough of diclofenac was observed in spring 2016 under these circumstances average degradation rates of valsartan of the near groundwater zone were about 0 13 d 1 despite the degradation valsartan was still detected within the aquifer demonstrating the relevance of this compound for drinking water suppliers thus more information on the environmental behavior of valsartan is needed 4 3 3 degradation under anoxic aquifer condition carbamazepine was detected in all near shore observation wells caused by low degradation rates of carbamazepine under prevailing oxic condition along the river shore line in contrast to the generally reported high persistence of carbamazepine in groundwater environments heberer 2002 schmidt et al 2017 wiese et al 2011 under anoxic conditions we observed high elimination rates up to 100 k 0 039 d 1 moreover we found that occurrence of iron reducing conditions dominate carbamazepine degradation in groundwater average degradation rates of sulfamethoxazole were in the range of other bank filtration sites grunheid et al 2005 henzler et al 2014 but were found to significantly depend on groundwater temperatures fig 6 likely due to decreased microbial activity at lower temperatures 5 conclusion greskowiak et al 2017 reveals a huge natural variability in compound specific first order degradation rate constants even for similar types of field studies they clarified some of the tremendous uncertainties about the influencing factors and how and to what degree they affect the degradation process in a specific environment our study is a step forward to quantitatively verify environmental effects on the in situ variability in degradation rate constants river and groundwater hydrological and hydrochemical data were analytically and statistically evaluated to quantify the environmental factors that control attenuation efficiency of nitrate and trace organic micropollutants from polluted surface waters during river bank filtration on a row of monitoring wells with groundwater travel times ranging between 18 and 438 days the presented dataset for rbf at field scale from a monthly sampling campaign during a one and a half year period incorporates temporally and spatially varying redox conditions and temperature changes typically occurring in temperate climates our study emphasizes that degradation rates of several omp during bank filtration are controlled by redox conditions and temperature whereby temperature also has a significant influence on the extent of the most reactive oxic suboxic zones we highlight that temperature plays a crucial role in controlling in situ degradation rates which were found to vary within one order of magnitude for temperature changes between 5 c and 20 c comparing to degradation rates commonly derived from laboratory experiments these in situ values are more representative with regard to the geological aquifer complexity and biogeochemical conditions of natural systems comparing the determined first order degradation rate constants of this study with those of greskowiak et al 2006 and henzler et al 2014 who modeled the coupled transport and degradation of several omp it seems that at least the magnitudes of rate constants are transferable from one field site to another for comparable hydrogeological and geochemical aquifer conditions this has important implications for local and catchment scale management strategies aiming to reduce future pollutant concentrations in drinking water production wells especially those substances showing enhanced degradation only under oxic conditions potentially threaten groundwater quality if they infiltrate under anoxic conditions into the aquifer e g diclofenac phenazone valsartan however for other omp such as carbamazepine the presence of anoxic conditions seems to yield substantial removal potential decreasing the exposure of downstream pumping wells to refine the estimation of the degradation parameters presented herein further investigations as well as simulations including the spatially and temporally variable temperature and redox conditions of the rbf site are needed especially to support guideline values for omp in

18647,river bank filtration rbf is considered to efficiently remove nitrate and trace organic micropollutants omp from polluted surface waters this is essential for maintaining good groundwater quality and providing high quality drinking water predicting the fate of omp during rbf is difficult as the biogeochemical factors controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood to determine in situ removal efficiency and degradation rates of nitrate and omp indicator substances we conducted a field study in a rbf system during a period of one and a half years incorporating temporally and spatially varying redox conditions and temperature changes typically occurring in temperate climates rbf was analyzed by means of mixing ratios between infiltrated river water and groundwater as well as average residence times of surface water towards the individual groundwater observation wells these results were used to calculate temperature dependent first order degradation rates of redox sensitive species and several omp five out of ten investigated omp were completely removed along rbf pathways we demonstrate that degradation rates of several omp during bank filtration were controlled by redox conditions and temperature whereby temperature itself also had a significant influence on the extent of the most reactive oxic zone the seasonal variations in temperature alone could explain a considerable percentage of the variance in dissolved oxygen 34 nitrate 81 as well as the omps diclofenac 44 and sulfamethoxazole 76 estimated in situ degradation rates roughly varied within one order of magnitude for temperature changes between 5 c and 20 c this study highlights that temporal variability in temperature and redox zonation is a significant factor for migration and degradation of nitrate and several omps graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals in situ degradation rates denitrification river groundwater interaction urban water cycle 1 introduction the main sources of organic micropollutants omps in the aquatic system are from farm manure on agricultural land and effluents from sewage treatment plants stp petrie et al 2015 an important fraction of the omp are not fully eliminated in the waste water treatment processes and thus released to surface waters such as rivers and lakes vieno et al 2005 within the surface waters the omps are transported substantially downstream while photochemical degradation is likely to be an important loss mechanism boreen et al 2003 omps even appear at low concentrations in groundwater especially in stp effluent impacted rivers where surface water is used indirectly for drinking water production via bank filtration maeng et al 2011 river bank filtration rbf is an important effective and cheap technique for surface water purification due to filtration of suspended solids bacteria viruses or parasites adsorption and biodegradation of inorganic and some organic pollutants hamann et al 2016 consequently improved understanding of the environmental fate and transport of wastewater derived pollutants is essential for effective protection of vital aquatic ecosystem services environmental health and drinking water supplies the potential for attenuation of omp and corresponding removal rates strongly depend on subsurface residence time temperature burke et al 2014 redox

artificial groundwater recharge greskowiak et al 2006 and bank filtration systems henzler et al 2014 2016 revealed that factors including seasonal temperature variations redox conditions and physical chemical properties of omp had strong impacts on their attenuation and degradation behavior but natural attenuation and degradation processes of omp under a wide range of environmental conditions at the field scale are studied rarely massmann et al 2006 heberer et al 2008 schaper et al 2018 and correlation to factors that are well known to affect the degradation rate may be weak greskowiak et al 2017 despite the large number of omp found in natural environments little is known about their transport behavior in groundwater rather many more experimental studies especially field studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of degradation mechanisms and controlling factors the objectives of this study were i to assess the behavior of representative omps under seasonal varying redox states and temperatures present in the aquatic system and ii to quantify in situ degradation rates and their dependence on environmental conditions during rbf for this purpose concentrations of a number of omps were measured at the field scale during a period of one and a half years with a high temporal resolution of about four weeks this unique data set allows a comprehensive assessment of the interlinked processes and controls governing solute attenuation to disentangle the mixed effects of seasonal variations in the redox state temperature occurrence of omps in the surface water and the hydraulic controls during rbf 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in potsdam brandenburg germany where a bank filtration water works is operated south of the sacrow paretzer kanal which is part of the havel river system connecting berlin with the lower river havel sidestepping the city of potsdam the havel is a lowland river with a catchment area of about 24 000 km2 located in northeastern germany flowing mainly through the federal states of brandenburg and berlin the havel discharge is strongly regulated by several barrages and large flow through lakes e g tegeler see and wannsee mean discharge at the study side was 24 m³ s 1 with a standard deviation of about 14 m³ s 1 the main tributaries of the havel are the river spree and the teltow canal especially by these tributaries the havel is impacted by sewage treatment plant effluents from the city of berlin e g heberer 2002 in total six relevant stp treat the wastewater of about 3 7 million people the portion of sewage effluents at the havel discharge at the study site at mean discharge is about 16 4 m³ s 1 the distance from the study site to the waste water effluents varies between approximately 14 km stp stahnsdorf and ruhleben 40 km stp wansdorf and 60 km stp münchhofe for details about the potsdam berlin waterways and the locations of the stp see heberer 2002 the aquifer adjacent to the sacrow paretzer kanal is formed by quaternary sediments mainly consisting of silica sand and gravels which are semi confined aquifers stratified by glacial till layers from the later pleistocene the glaciofluvial sediments above the till were deposited during weichsel glacial period qswa while those below belong to the saale glacial period qsd the aquifer extends from approximately 36 m a s l to 5 m below average sea level the aquifer is underlain by an aquitard of the holstein interglacial the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer sediments varies between 2 9 10 05 m s 1 and 1 75 10 03 m s 1 and was slightly higher for the qswa 6 94 10 4 m s 1 compared to the qsd 2 39 10 4 m s 1 sediments estimates based on pumping tests the monitoring design consisted of six observation points one located at the northern floodplain of the river three distributed along the southern river shoreline and two further in a transect roughly perpendicular to the river aligned along the groundwater flow direction between the river and the pumping well gallery as ascertained by a numerical groundwater flow model wang et al 2019 fig 1 a and b along this transect w07 w03 w04 two observation wells each were placed together with different filter screen elevation the shallow ones are located approximately in the qswa sediments and the deeper ones are located approximately in the qsd sediments fig 1c continuous measurements of hydraulic heads and temperatures within the surface water and in the nine groundwater observation wells were automatically recorded with a temporal resolution of 15 min rugged troll 100 accuracy pressure 0 1 temperature 0 3 c daily sums of sunshine duration and air temperature was measured at the nearby climate station in potsdam 52 38 12 9 n 13

physicochemical parameters had stabilized surface water samples were taken in about 1 5 m distance to the shoreline of the river bank as grab samples 1 l in between 0 05 m 0 5 m below the water surface on may 2016 december 2016 january 2017 and february 2017 surface water samples were taken at three positions along the river shoreline furthermore on march 2017 surface water samples were collected over the course of one day every 6 h 2 a m 8 a m 2 p m and 8 p m water samples were filled in 80 ml and 250 ml brown glass bottles without any air entrapment and brought to the laboratory at the same day or latest one day afterwards samples were stored at 4 c and full water analysis was generally performed one day after sampling concentrations of major anions were analyzed with an ion

chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms at pwu potsdamer wasser und umweltlabor gmbh commercially accredited laboratory following the german din standard 38407 f36 details concerning the procedures as well as hplc ms ms analyses can be found in hebig et al 2017 the limit of detection was 10 ng l 1 for all omps except for valsartan 20 ng l 1 non detects below the detection limit were reported as half the detection limit the investigated compounds were chosen because of their common occurrence in the havel catchment and their expected fate and reactivity during bank filtration heberer 2002 jekel et al 2015 schaper et al 2018 table 1 2 3 calculation of mixing ratios and residence times in order to estimate the mixing ratio between infiltrated surface water and original groundwater i e dilution of effluent impacted river water with groundwater at each observation well we used naturally occurring solute concentrations assuming a linear mixing model between independent endmembers the mixing ratios between the members were evaluated by means of multivariate statistical analysis using the mix code carrera et al 2004 mix contains a maximum likelihood method to estimate mixing ratios while acknowledging uncertainty in endmember concentrations to improve the quality of computations three species were included in our analyses acesulfame cl na an essential assumption for the calculation of the mixing ratios is that the included species exhibit a conservative behavior and that their values significantly differ between surface water and groundwater the values of groundwater endmembers were taken from the deep groundwater observation well u100 assumed to be not affected by infiltration from the sacrow paretzer kanal average residence times of surface water towards the individual groundwater observation wells were evaluated based on the propagation of the seasonal temperature signal into the aquifer the seasonal temperature signal is transported into the saturated sediment via advection and conduction but is retarded to a certain degree depending on heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment that means the thermal front moves slower than the water particle or conservative solutes itself and the amplitude of the seasonal temperature signal is reduced with increasing transport distance munz and schmidt 2017 nonetheless seasonal temperature signals can penetrate at least to distances of several tens of meters into the aquifer upon bank filtration and can therefore be detected in equipped standard observation boreholes in the vicinity of the river wang et al 2019 aquifer residence times can be assessed based on the time shift of the fitted sinusoidal temperature oscillation to the measured temperature data the temperature time lag difference in temperature time shift between surface water and groundwater observation well can be converted to an estimate of the aquifer residence time using the thermal retardation factor relating the flow velocity of a water parcel conservative transport to that of advective conductive transport of temperature hoehn and cirpka 2006 where the measured groundwater temperature data show a clear sinusoidal pattern and amplitude the propagation of the river temperature is well applicable in the last years this concept has also been applied to the more dynamic situation of hyporheic exchange flows and residence times analytically as well as numerically e g munz et al 2016 munz et al 2017 2 4 potential for pharmaceutical removal degradation rates the river groundwater interface is considered as being a hotspot for microbial activity and biogeochemical reactions for horizontally dominated exchange within the hyporheic zone e g trauth et al 2015 or for groundwater recharge as in river bank filtration e g van driezum et al 2018 if concentrations of dissolved substances observed in the groundwater do not agree with the predicted concentrations by means of the mixing ratios than removal processes must be occurring also including chemical or biological degradation the redox zonation within the aquifer is characterized by the disappearance of oxygen o2 nitrate no3 or the appearance of manganese mn2 and iron fe2 as suggested by massmann et al 2008 rather than by their redox potential sulphate reduction was monitored based on sulphate decrease to evaluate the role of aerobic respiration on doc we used metabolism calculation as proposed by battin 1999 evaluating the difference in do concentration between river and groundwater δdo against the difference in doc concentration between river and groundwater δdoc assuming a molar respiratory quotient of 1 1 i e metabolism of one mole of doc requires one mole of oxygen idealized stoichiometry of aerobic microbially mediated processes ch2o o2 co2 h2o δdo in this case is equal to δdoc the potential for pharmaceutical removal of a given compound during rbf at the river groundwater interface and along subsurface flow paths was quantified by the percentage of removal pr for each individual pollutant heberer et al 2008 massmann et al 2008 depending on the time of infiltration temperature and redox condition within the aquifer their concentration in the recharge sources the corresponding surface water groundwater mixing ratios and the subsurface residence times the first order degradation rate constant k was calculated with respect to the subsurface residence time the retardation factor and the corresponding mixing ratios between the river and w07high oxic or between w07low and w03low anoxic in respect to the subsurface zone where the observed substances were clearly degraded for oxic degradation the degradation rate is likely much higher in the immediate vicinity of the streambed then further downgradient henzler et al 2014 and hence the quantified degradation rates potentially underestimate local rates close to the streambed if dissolved substances were completely degraded along their subsurface flow path concentration in the observation well is equal to the detection limit the calculated rate constants have to be regarded as minimum values of degradation rates if a calculated degradation rate was slightly negative it was set to zero and the difference in concentrations between river and observations well was attributed to be caused by uncertainties in the detected concentrations or underestimated desorption processes 2 5 statistical analysis to assess sampling variability in the source concentrations all omp recorded in the river were reported along with their spatial and temporal variations therefore we used the average of the standard deviations of all river concentrations per sampling campaign sdspace and the standard deviation of all concentrations measured during one day sdtime multiple regression models were used to identify the influence of physicochemical aquifer parameters t doc ph ec and eh on the fate of redox sensitive species and observed omp if the reported p values were smaller than 0 01 the parameter was assumed to have a significant effect on the observed concentration for all parameters having a significant effect a linear model was fitted to the experimental data and was evaluated in terms of r2 to characterize the non parametric relationships between predictor variables and the observed concentrations we used spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the statistical analyses the variables were log normalized when bivariate relations showed a clear non linear behavior e g do versus t to perform the statistical analyses we used the software environment r r development core team 2011 3 results 3 1 hydraulic situation and temperature dynamics seasonal variation in river water level at the study site situated at river kilometer 20 21 ranged between 29 8 m a s l february march and 29 4 m a s l july august the yearly water level fluctuation was about only 0 4 m within the observation period between december 2015 and july 2017 rainfall induced discharge events occurred in july 2017 resulting in a short peak in river water level of about 29 8 m a s l fig 2 a the boundary condition of river water level which only varies slightly in combination with the quasi continuous pumping rates at the waterworks caused an almost temporally constant hydraulic gradient d h from the river toward the pumping well gallery d h δ h δ l where δ h is difference of hydraulic head and δ l is horizontal distance yielding to continuous river water infiltration into the aquifer via bank filtration based on the hydraulic conditions the rbf system is seen to be fairly stable without pronounced flood events that induce short term variations in mixing ratios and residence times seasonal temperature extremes ranged between a minimum of 1 c in winter december february and a maximum of 22 c in summer june august temperature variation in the river could be approximated well by a sinusoidal function r2 0 94 with amplitude of about 10 1 c fig 2c and d the seasonal temperature signal thermal front penetrates into the aquifer by heat advection and conduction sinusoidal temperature oscillations at the groundwater observation wells were reduced in amplitude and shifted towards later times compared to the temperature oscillation in the river fig 2c the temperature amplitude reduced to 0 4 c at a distance of about 120 m w04low from the river shore line strong seasonal temperature oscillation with minimum temperatures below 6 c only occurred within the nearshore aquifer along the first 10 20 m of the infiltration zone w07 for a detailed spatial temperature distribution within the aquifer see results of transient 3 d modelling of flow and heat transport of wang et al 2019 3 2 mixing ratios and residence times the concentrations of acesulfame chloride and sodium in the river tend to vary seasonally with maximum concentrations in october november 2016 and minimum concentrations in may june 2016 and 2017 fig sm 1 the seasonal course of these conservative substances at the groundwater observation wells followed the trend observed in the river but was individually shifted in time the concentration range at the observation wells was close to the range observed in the river fig sm 1 average background concentration of deep lateral groundwater u100 was about 1224 ng l 1 for acesulfame 32 mg l 1 for sodium and 46 mg l 1 for chloride generally the groundwater observation wells are dominated by infiltrated surface water throughout the entire observation period the spatial distribution of the average mixing ratios is illustrated in fig 1b the portion of surface water in the aquifer at the near shore is above 94 whereby the surface water contribution at w07high is 100 no mixing effects of the source concentrations details about the deviation between measured and calculated concentrations are presented in detail in table sm 2 the average uncertainty of the mixing ratios of the observation wells dominated by surface water infiltration ranged between 3 0 w08 and 2 5 w07low tab sm 2 the subsurface residence times ranged between 18 d close to the river and 438 d close to the pumping well gallery fig 1c residence times of w08 49 d and w09 59 d were slightly higher than those of w07high a temperature retardation factor of 2 4 was used for the analyses calculated from literature derived values of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity for sandy materials stonestrom and blasch 2003 addressing the uncertainty in the temperature retardation factor which reasonably might vary between 2 1 and 2 7 would end up in variations in the estimated aquifer residence times of 2 days for w07high and of 15 days for w03low 3 3 redox condition in the aquifer the river water was almost saturated with o2 during the entire observation period varying between 12 mg l 1 in winter and 5 mg l 1 in summer mean nitrate concentration in the river was 5 2 mg l 1 with slight seasonal variation with a maximum of 9 4 mg l 1 in winter and a minimum of 4 1 mg l 1 in summer following the course of the oxygen concentration fig 3 a in comparison to the permanent oxic river water the groundwater at the observation wells was substantially reduced in w07high and w07low close to the river shore line 13 5 m with a depth of 0 1 2 1 m and 5 6 7 6 m below the river bottom respectively fig 1c the redox condition displayed strong seasonal variations fig 1d in summer all oxygen was removed before reaching the first groundwater observation well w07high only when aquifer temperatures were below 11 c from december 2015 until june 2016 and from december 2016 until april 2017 oxic conditions were encountered in w07high with maximum concentrations of 3 mg l 1 shortly after the observed peak in oxygen also the no3 concentration reached its maximum of 6 mg l 1 which was comparable to the corresponding no3 concentration within the river at the time of infiltration t res 18 d only on 30 08 2016 when temperature at w07high was highest 20 2 c the no3 concentration decreased to zero in w07high mn2 appeared only in autumn at times when o2 had been fully depleted and shortly after the no3 concentration decreased to zero fig 3b at w07low mn2 and fe2 appeared between june 2016 and january 2017 when the oxygen and nitrate were completely degraded fig 3c in winter 2017 no o2 breakthrough was observed and maximum concentration of no3 peaked at march 2017 with concentration up to 3 mg l 1 for a short period roughly half of the corresponding river concentration wells w03low and w04low far from the shore line never contained oxygen or nitrate but iron concentration of up to 1 mg l 1 no sulphate reduction was observed at the observation wells with exception of w07low average sulfate concentration in the river and w04low was about 187 mg l 1 and 194 mg l 1 respectively on top of the seasonal variations the no3 concentrations dropped to zero during the rainfall induced discharge events in july 2017 that occasional drop down propagated towards the near shore observation wells in contrast no substantial event based variation in o2 mn2 and fe2 concentration were observed neither in the river nor in the groundwater observation wells 3 4 doc throughout the year river doc concentrations were quite constant with a mean value of 6 9 mg c l 1 and a standard deviation of 0 6 mg c l 1 average groundwater doc concentrations were always less than river water concentrations fig sm 3 the doc concentration from the river towards the observation wells decreased only within the first meters of the infiltration area oxygenated zone the doc concentration between river and w07high decreased in average of about 4 2 mg c l 1 between april and november 2016 64 of the total doc present and of about only 1 5 mg c l 1 between december 2016 and july 2017 23 the degree of doc removal fluctuated slightly between both periods but did not show any seasonality nor did it show a clear relation to the hydraulic conditions throughout the entire observation period the δdo exceeds the δdoc an according metabolism plot for w07high is shown in fig sm 4 3 5 concentration of omp in the river and in the aquifer fig 4 shows the observed omp concentrations in the river along with the spatial and temporal variations observed concentrations were comparable along the river and over the course of one day cp sdspace and sdtime in figs 5 and 6 the surface water is well mixed by frequently induced turbulent water circulation through shipping observed concentrations were typically in the higher nanogram per liter level except valsartan which occur in the mg per liter level fig 4 the occurrence of omps in the river was grouped according to their occurrence and seasonal variation in their concentrations fig 4 table 1 and their fate and conditions of degradation in the aquifer table 1 figs 5 and 6 in the deeper lateral groundwater u100 out of the observed omps only acesulfame c u 100 1224 ng l 1 primidone c u 100 31 ng l 1 and phenazone c u 100 935 ng l 1 were detected phenazone sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen substantially varied in their measured concentration between mid june and mid july 2017 fig 4 when the water level and discharge in the river quickly raised due to strong precipitation events fig 2 the concentration increased after the rise up of the water level by about 35 phenazone 28 sulfamethoxazole and 760 ibuprofen afterwards the concentrations of phenazone and sulfamethoxazole decreased below the pre event concentration whereas the concentration of ibuprofen stayed above the pre event concentration 56 the results of the degradation rates and the statistical analyses are presented in table 2 the results highlight the significant effect of seasonal temperature variations on the fate of redox sensitive species and several omp within the shallow aquifer within the thermally active zone w07high the seasonal variations in temperature alone can explain a considerable percentage of the variance in do 34 nitrate 81 as well as diclofenac 44 and sulfamethoxazole 76 for these substances we observed a negative correlation between temperature and concentration in the water sample in contrast only a minor part of the variance in phenazone and carbamazepine can be explained by seasonal variations in temperature 28 for these substances we observed a positive correlation between temperature and concentration in the water sample 4 discussion 4 1 redox zonation and nitrate removal at the river groundwater interface the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations substantially decrease sm 3 according to this interface being considered a hotspot for microbial activity and biogeochemical reactions along the subsurface flow path of the bank filtrate distinguishable redox zones develop due to the sequential order of terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate manganese and iron oxides and hydroxides the observed redox zonation highly depended on the environmental temperature which can explain 34 of the variance in do and 81 of the variance in no3 using a simple linear model the highest rates of oxygen consumption in the aquifer pr 99 at w07 occurred when groundwater temperatures where high fig 3b in winter when average temperature in the aquifer falls below 8 c oxygen consumption rates significantly decreased resulting in a breakthrough of oxygen at w07high pr 75 the decrease in oxygen concentration along the subsurface flow path is presumably caused by intense heterotrophic aerobic respiration of doc as a river borne carbon source and particulate organic matter poc present in the aquifer at all times but particularly in winter the molecular decrease in oxygen between river and w07high exceeded the decrease in doc fig sm 4 this indicates that besides dissolved organic carbon poc present in the aquifer or more likely fresh organic matter of the clogging layer may act as an additional electron donor during rbf as has been previously found in riverbank filtration settings grunheid et al 2005 the percentage of nitrate removal between river and w07 ranged between 6 and 89 only for longer flow paths towards w03 the entire nitrate load imported from the river into the aquifer was removed pr 99 nitrate degradation rates of the near groundwater zone were about 1 5 of first order rate constants of rbf and artificial recharge sites reported for berlin henzler et al 2016 greskowiak et al 2006 and about one order of magnitude smaller than for natural riparian zones trauth et al 2018 decreasing do concentrations favor anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification limited by the inhibition effect of do and the temperature dependent degradation rates several studies observed a threshold in do concentrations of about 2 mg l 1 below which denitrification activity strongly increases whereby various nitrogen species can be efficiently assimilated transformed or permanently removed rivett et al 2008 finally temperature is a crucial control on the activity of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria significantly affecting degradation rates in hyporheic zones hill et al 1998 riparian groundwater trauth et al 2018 and rbf systems this study 4 2 concentration of omp in the river seasonal changes in concentrations in the surface water are caused by changes in precipitation and dilution and by changes in elimination rates through photochemical degradation biodegradation and or adsorption processes loraine and pettigrove 2006 the seasonal course of acesulfame and carbamazepine concentrations which have been found to be stable in surface aquatic environments tixier et al 2003 were related to changing dilution of effluents with maximum concentrations in october 2016 after a long period of low river discharge maximum variation in observed concentrations caused by dilution at the study site is expected to be about 60 caused by variations in the river discharge to effluent discharge ratio assuming a constant input by the stp clofibric acid was not detected in the surface water during the entire observation period even though it is assumed to exhibit a significant persistence in the aquatic system tixier et al 2003 some of the compounds observed e g phenazone primidone and sulfamethoxazole seem to show a significant persistence in the surface water though these substances partly are affected by degradation and sorption processes in an aquatic environment meierjohann et al 2016 seasonal variation in degradation and sorption processes which tend to increase with increasing temperature seems to compensate seasonal variations in observed concentrations due to dilution fig 4b concentrations of most omp in the havel river system tend to vary seasonally with higher concentrations in winter and lower concentrations in summer most likely caused by photochemical degradation boreen et al 2003 in winter the global radiation is low often below 200 w m 2 and the sunshine duration is short often below 1 h d 1 under these conditions photo transformation is limited as an elimination pathway the opposite conditions are prevailing in summer with high global radiation up to 1100 w m 2 and daily sunshine duration up to 15 h d 1 creating excellent conditions for photochemical degradation of the pharmaceuticals the observed concentrations of valsartan cc 0 85 r2 0 72 diclofenac cc 0 87 r2 0 67 and bezafibrate cc 0 86 r2 0 76 were found to significantly decrease with sunshine duration of the previous month 4 3 concentration of omp in the aquifer 4 3 1 persistent omp primidone and acesulfame were detected in the bank filtrate fig sm 1 especially the artificial sweetener acesulfame is assumed to be persistent in the aquatic environment and thus supposed to act as an ideal wastewater marker engelhardt et al 2013 recently burke et al 2014 demonstrated that acesulfame was not attenuated in laboratory column studies under cold conditions 6 5 c but displayed slight removal under warm conditions 19 5 c we found that acesulfame was transported within the aquifer in a conservative manner under anoxic aquifer conditions quite independent of the temperature conditions k equal to zero only under the oxic conditions between 09 2016 and 04 2017 we observed slight degradation of acesulfame average k 0 009 d 1 sdtime 0 005 d 1 4 3 2 degradation under oxic aquifer condition out of the nine compounds detected in the surface water bezafibrate k 0 13 d 1 and ibuprofen k 0 09 d 1 were not present any more in the bank filtrate these substances are well known to be biodegradable under oxic conditions while the minimum in situ degradation rates at our site with rather short distance rbf were substantially higher than previously reported during long term long distance rbf table 1 the calculated degradation rates in combination with the low source concentration in the river during summer when the extent of the oxic zone is narrow are sufficient for a complete removal of these substances at the nearshore aquifer throughout the entire observation period phenazone diclofenac and valsartan were efficiently attenuation under oxic conditions in winter when temperature was low and oxygen was present in the near shore aquifer the removal rates of these compounds decreased under anoxic conditions up to a persistent behavior in summer when temperatures were high and oxygen did not penetrate into the aquifer based on the experimental data alone it is not possible to clearly quantify the single effect of temperature and the redox regime on the degradation rates due to the cross correlation between both effects within the nearshore aquifer burke et al 2014 observed a significant decrease in phenazone degradation rates in saturated laboratory columns under oxic penoxic conditions at a temperature of 19 4 c k 5 53 d 1 and a temperature of 6 5 c k 1 64 d 1 within that temperature range the removal rate constant of phenazone decreased by a factor of 3 but was about two orders of magnitude higher than degradation rates found in this study average phenazone concentrations at w03 548 ng l 1 and w04 779 ng l 1 were predominantly higher than the concentrations in the river 74 ng l 1 about half of these values could be explained by mixing with the lateral groundwater flow constituting an additional source with much higher phenazone concentration c u 100 935 ng l 1 desorption seems not to be a suited explanation since phenazone is reported not to be subject to sorption desorption in an aquifer henzler et al 2014 massmann et al 2008 average degradation rates of diclofenac of the near groundwater zone were about 0 07 d 1 generally diclofenac is known to be better attenuated at higher temperatures whereby the temperature effect observed during infiltration was rather low due to the strong variations in river concentrations which were almost zero in summer however the observed rate constant in laboratory column studies with undisturbed sediment cores from a riverbank filtration site at lake wannsee substantially decreased by a factor of 1 6 for the temperature settings of 6 5 c k 6 4 d 1 and 19 4 c k 10 4 d 1 burke et al 2014 but were about two orders of magnitude higher than degradation rates found in our field study which is often the case for degradation rates e g watson et al 2005 when aquifer conditions turned anaerobic diclofenac behaves persistent burke et al 2014 and can be transported over longer distances within the aquifer the measured breakthrough of diclofenac at w03 t res 104 d r diclofenac 1 in between 02 2017 and 05 2017 with concentrations of about 200 ng l 1 were related to high concentrations in the river paired with anoxic aquifer conditions between 10 2016 and 01 2017 whereas the breakthrough at w04 resulted from the previous year when high river concentrations paired with anoxic aquifer conditions at the nearshore aquifer between december 2015 and march 2016 but it remains unclear why in w03 no breakthrough of diclofenac was observed in spring 2016 under these circumstances average degradation rates of valsartan of the near groundwater zone were about 0 13 d 1 despite the degradation valsartan was still detected within the aquifer demonstrating the relevance of this compound for drinking water suppliers thus more information on the environmental behavior of valsartan is needed 4 3 3 degradation under anoxic aquifer condition carbamazepine was detected in all near shore observation wells caused by low degradation rates of carbamazepine under prevailing oxic condition along the river shore line in contrast to the generally reported high persistence of carbamazepine in groundwater environments heberer 2002 schmidt et al 2017 wiese et al 2011 under anoxic conditions we observed high elimination rates up to 100 k 0 039 d 1 moreover we found that occurrence of iron reducing conditions dominate carbamazepine degradation in groundwater average degradation rates of sulfamethoxazole were in the range of other bank filtration sites grunheid et al 2005 henzler et al 2014 but were found to significantly depend on groundwater temperatures fig 6 likely due to decreased microbial activity at lower temperatures 5 conclusion greskowiak et al 2017 reveals a huge natural variability in compound specific first order degradation rate constants even for similar types of field studies they clarified some of the tremendous uncertainties about the influencing factors and how and to what degree they affect the degradation process in a specific environment our study is a step forward to quantitatively verify environmental effects on the in situ variability in degradation rate constants river and groundwater hydrological and hydrochemical data were analytically and statistically evaluated to quantify the environmental factors that control attenuation efficiency of nitrate and trace organic micropollutants from polluted surface waters during river bank filtration on a row of monitoring wells with groundwater travel times ranging between 18 and 438 days the presented dataset for rbf at field scale from a monthly sampling campaign during a one and a half year period incorporates temporally and spatially varying redox conditions and temperature changes typically occurring in temperate climates our study emphasizes that degradation rates of several omp during bank filtration are controlled by redox conditions and temperature whereby temperature also has a significant influence on the extent of the most reactive oxic suboxic zones we highlight that temperature plays a crucial role in controlling in situ degradation rates which were found to vary within one order of magnitude for temperature changes between 5 c and 20 c comparing to degradation rates commonly derived from laboratory experiments these in situ values are more representative with regard to the geological aquifer complexity and biogeochemical conditions of natural systems comparing the determined first order degradation rate constants of this study with those of greskowiak et al 2006 and henzler et al 2014 who modeled the coupled transport and degradation of several omp it seems that at least the magnitudes of rate constants are transferable from one field site to another for comparable hydrogeological and geochemical aquifer conditions this has important implications for local and catchment scale management strategies aiming to reduce future pollutant concentrations in drinking water production wells especially those substances showing enhanced degradation only under oxic conditions potentially threaten groundwater quality if they infiltrate under anoxic conditions into the aquifer e g diclofenac phenazone valsartan however for other omp such as carbamazepine the presence of

18648,microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated aromatics frequently suffers from the long dechlorination period and the generation of toxic metabolites biocathode bioelectrochemical systems were verified to be effective in the degradation of various refractory pollutants however the electrochemical and microbial related working mechanisms for bio dechlorination by electro stimulation remain poorly understood in this study we reported the significantly improved 2 4 6 trichlorophenol dechlorination activity through the weak electro stimulation cathode potential of 0 36 v vs she as evidenced by the 3 1 times higher dechlorination rate and the complete dechlorination ability with phenol as the end dechlorination product the high reductive dechlorination rate 20 8 μm d could be maintained by utilizing electrode as an effective electron donor coulombic efficiency of 82 3 4 8 cyclic voltammetry analysis of the cathodic biofilm gave the direct evidences of the cathodic respiration with the improved and positive shifted reduction peaks of 2 4 6 tcp 2 4 dcp and 4 cp the optimal 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination rate 24 2 μm d was obtained when a small amount of lactate 2 mm was added and the generation of h2 and ch4 were accompanied due to the biological fermentation and methanogenesis the electrical stimulation significantly altered the cathodic biofilm structure and composition with some potential dechlorinators like acetobacterium predominated the microbial interactions in the ecological network of cathodic biofilm were more simplified than the planktonic community however some potential dechlorinators acetobacterium desulfovibrio etc shared more positive interactions the co existence and possible cooperative relationships between potential dechlorinators and fermenters sedimentibacter etc were revealed meanwhile the competitive interrelations between potential dechlorinators and methanogens methanomassiliicoccus were found in the network of plankton the fermenters and methanogens possessed the more positive interrelations electro stimulation at the cathodic potential of 0 36 v selectively enhanced the dechlorination function while it showed little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis process the study gave suggestions for the enhanced bioremediation of chlorinated aromatics in views of the electro stimulation capacity efficiency and microbial interrelations related microbial mechanism graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 4 6 trichlorophenol reductive dechlorination electrical stimulation electro active microorganism biocathode microbial interaction 1 introduction halogenated aromatic compounds hacs constitute an important class of organic pollutants in the environment because of their toxicity persistence and widespread use häggblom and bossert 2003 twenty three types of halogenated benzenes or phenols have been recorded as priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency which occupied 18 of the total list epa 1981 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp is one of the notorious representatives and has been extensively applied as a pesticide precursor or formed during drinking water disinfection tan et al 2009 reductive dehalogenation of hacs via organohalide respiring bacteria has been considered as one of the most crucial bioremediation routes for hac detoxification in anoxic or anaerobic contaminated sites sediments groundwater etc jugder et al 2016 however because of the physiological toxicity of hacs and the external electron donor deficiency the currently reported dehalogenation populations possess either low dehalogenation rate or incomplete dehalogenation capacity richardson 2016 häggblom et al 2000 the reported hacs dehalogenation period would usually take from a few days to weeks richardson 2016 häggblom et al 2000 to date some obligate organohalide respiring isolates like dehalococcoides and dehalobacter were found that could efficiently dechlorinate 2 4 6 tcp wang and he 2013 but no isolate was able to dechlorinate 2 4 6 tcp completely to phenol wang et al 2014 villemur et al 2006 the lack of electron donor short chain organics h2 in dechlorination systems was majorly caused by the low h2 solubility or electron scramble of competitive metabolic processes methanogenesis denitrification etc chambon et al 2013 li et al 2010 the enhanced reduction of various refractory pollutants has been observed in bioelectrochemical cathodes by introducing a constant negative potential aulenta et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 the application of electrode as a potential electron donor is a favorable means because of its continuous direct and sustainable characteristics chen et al 2018 previously anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans and geobacter lovelyi were found to utilize electrons from the electrode surface and reductively dechlorinate 2 chlorophenol or tetrachloroethylene strycharz et al 2008 2010 the reductive dechlorination of chlorophenols have been investigated through adding co substrates or electron mediators in constructed bioelectrochemical systems zhang et al 2011 2014 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2019 however the electrochemical and microbial mechanisms of the electro stimulated bio dechlorination require further study the electrochemical evidence by utilizing electrode as electron donor for stimulating the dechlorination activity is still lacking besides studies on the cathodic microbiome were majorly focused on the bacterial community composition and structure succession by high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 while the microbial interactions of different populations in the biocathode systems are poorly understood notably in most of the bio dehalogenation systems dehalogenation was always accompanied with fermentation and methanogenesis because of the electron scramble by adding organic acids as carbon and electron source chambon et al 2013 li et al 2010 farai et al 2012 in natural environment dehalogenators and fermenters are symbiotic while dehalogenators and methanogens are competitive chambon et al 2013 farai et al 2012 however how those functional populations were influenced under the electro stimulated environments including not only the microbial community succession but also the microbial ecological interrelations remain poorly understood in this study microbial dechlorination activities for 2 4 6 tcp were investigated by stimulation with a negatively polarized graphite electrode 0 36 v vs she this study aims to reveal whether cathode could serve as an alternative electron donor to stimulate bio dechlorination and how the potential dechlorinators methanogens fermenters or electroactive populations associate to achieve the high dechlorination efficiency when double electron donors hydrosoluble lactate and insoluble solid state electrode co existed microbiome structure and ecological network analyses aimed to identify the potential dechlorinators fermenters and methanogens and their collaborative or competitive interrelations the obviously improved dechlorination performance and the microbiome analyses highlighted the function and mechanism of the accelerated electro stimulated dechlorination system for potential bioremediation applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial consortium enrichment the microbial source was obtained from chlorophenol polluted soil collected at around a pesticide factory in shandong province china the detail information of the microbial consortium enrichment process was described before li et al 2013b after acclimatization for more than one year the culture could stably dechlorinate 100 μm of 2 4 6 tcp to 4 cp within 14 d by utilizing 20 mm of lactate as the electron donor the 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination results were shown in fig s1 2 2 biocathode bioelectrochemial system bes setup biocathode bess were set up in

potential was measured at 0 36 v fig s2 all the potential without special statement was against she 2 3 biocathode bess acclimation and start up catholyte composed of 5 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs 1 ml l vitamin stock solution l ml l sl 10 trace element solution 100 μm 2 4 6 tcp and or 2 mm sodium lactate li et al 2013a the anaerobic anolyte contained 100 mm of potassium ferrocyanide 99 purity during preparation both catholyte and anolyte were bubbled with n2 99 99 of purity for 15 min to remove oxygen for solution exchange the catholyte and anolyte were all discharged and meanwhile the chambers were refilled with n2 then the prepared catholyte and anolyte were injected immediately into cathode and anode chambers the 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination consortium 5 ml about 10 of inoculation percentage was inoculated into cathode to allow the cathodic biofilm development once 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination activity was observed in the cathode the catholyte exchange and repeated inoculation were conducted after repeated inoculation for about four times nearly 20 d the microbial inoculation terminated and catholyte exchange was started every 4 d when 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination was observed the stable dechlorination performance rate efficiency and metabolites generation was observed after acclimation for about 40 d about 20 d of acclimation and 20 d of medium exchange after that acclimation was continued for another 20 d to confirm the stable dechlorination activity the whole acclimation procedure lasted for approximately 60 d to achieve the stable dechlorination activity separate reactors were simultaneously started up with four different operating conditions including a lactate fed biocathode l bc b non lactate fed biocathode nl bc c open circuit and d abiotic cathode the l bc indicated the reactors fed with 2 mm sodium lactate and the cathodic potential of 0 36v throughout the operation for the nl bc the initial operation mode was the same with the l bc after the mature biofilm was formed about 40 d sodium lactate was replaced with nahco3 for at least 3 cycles to testify the biofilm cathode respiring ability during dechlorination open circuit reactors were the ones with the disconnected circuits throughout the operation abiotic cathode reactors indicated the ones without microbial inoculation during acclimation sextuplicate batch experiments were conducted in parallel under each identical condition all experiments were conducted at a constant ambient temperature 25 2 c 2 4 chemicals and analytical methods 2 4 6 trichlorophenol

reagent china the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp and its dechlorination metabolites including 2 4 dcp 4 cp and phenol were determined by gc ms shimadzu kyoto japan li et al 2016 before performing gc ms analysis a liquid sample 1 ml was taken from the cathode chamber pretreated by acidifying extracted with acetonitrile 1 ml and ethyl acetate 1 ml and finally dehydrated with sodium sulfate anhydrous for each test standard samples were pretreated and determined together with samples to be tested to determine the recovery rate lactate and organic metabolites acetate and propionate were determined

where the voltage was obtained from the resister through the data acquisition system the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated according to equation c e c t 0 c t v 6 f 100 q in this equation q indicates the generated electricity quantity c calculated by multiplying the accumulated area of current a and time s c t0 and c t indicate the determined concentration of 2 4 6 tcp at time 0 and t d v represents the effective cathodic volume l the 6 in the formula is the theoretical number of electrons the cathode gets when 1 mole of 2 4 6 tcp is completely dechlorinated to phenol f is the faraday constant 96485 c mol 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency was calculated by dividing the decreased 2 4 6 tcp concentration with the initial one the dechlorination rate constant was simulated by fitting with the first order kinetic model c c 0 e x p k t t where c represents 2 4 6 tcp concentration μm at time t d and c 0 is the initial 2 4 6 tcp concentration the rate constant k t d 1 was

and unconnected for 1 h after catholyte exchange before cv test the applied concentration of 2 4 6 tcp 2 4 dcp or 4 cp were 100 μm 2 5 microbial community analysis the microbial community structure and composition in both cathodic biofilm and suspension of l bc nl bc and open circuit were analyzed by 16s rrna gene based illumina miseq sequencing when lactate was removed for at least six cycles samples were taken from nl bc samples in cathode carbon brush were pretreated by cutting into pieces immerging into 10 ml pbs and washing out by an oscillator and then the washed out solution was collected and concentrated to 1 5 ml by centrifugation at 12000 rps the detail methods for dna extraction amplification sequencing and taxonomic classification have been described previously chen et al 2018 principal component analysis pca was performed to evaluate the topological variation of microbial community composition among the different operation conditions by canoco 4 5 pearson correlation between microbes and three crucial environmental variables 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency acetate generation and ch4 generation were calculated by majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com the visualization of both pca and pearson correlation were using originpro 2016 the 16s rrna gene sequence data were deposited in ncbi sequence read archive under the accession number of srp151178 2 6 construction of molecular ecological network to evaluate the microbial interactions of potential dechlorination populations fermentation populations and methanogens in cathodic biofilm and suspension two phylogenetic molecular ecological networks mens were constructed with the random matrix theory based rmt based interface approach zhou et al 2010 deng et al 2012 liang et al 2019 all identified operational taxonomic units otus for bacteria and archaea were applied for the network construction the topological properties of the network including number of nodes and links averaged connectivity path length clustering coefficient and modularity were processed by network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena the constructed networks for biofilm and plankton community were visualized by cytoscape 3 6 1 software 3 results 3 1 reductive dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp after inoculating for approximately 60 d the similar current variation trend stable cathode potential fig s2 and 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency were observed under each batch cycle suggesting the constructed systems have become stable 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiencies and kinetics measured in a cycle were shown in fig 1 and table s1 the significantly enhanced 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination activity was observed in l bc with the removal efficiency er achieving 83 7 2 1 and 99 5 3 2 at 2 d and 4 d respectively fig 1a table s1 phenol was the major determined dechlorination product in l bc a trace amount of 2 4 dcp and 4 cp once appeared at 2 d and they were further dechlorinated completely to phenol after 4 d fig 1a the further degradation of phenol was not observed after the following 10 d fig s3 in comparison little 2 4 6 tcp was removed in abiotic cathode at 4 d fig 1d reflecting the restrictive dechlorination capacity at potential of 0 36 v the result was coincident with a previous study finding that the pure electrochemical process contributed little to chlorophenol decomposition when cathode potential was higher than 0 44 v cheng et al 1997 meanwhile the dechlorination process in open circuit was similar with that by the enriched microbial consortium fig s1 s3b only 36 4 of er was observed at 4 d and the end of dechlorination appeared after 12 d following with 2 4 dcp and 4 cp as the intermediates or end dechlorination products in either the enriched microbial consortium or open circuit 4 cp was the final dechlorination product after lactate was removed nl bc the dechlorination activity could still be maintained with phenol as the end dechlorination product 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency was reduced to 88 2 3 1 at 4 d with the generation of some metabolites 2 4 dcp 4 cp and phenol fig 1b the complete dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp to phenol was observed at 8 d fig s3 under all the tested conditions the rate constants k for 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination was fitted well with the first order kinetics r 2 0 970 table s1 the distinctly higher k was observed in l bc k 1 37 0 02 r 2 0 970 than in nl bc k 0 53 0 02 r 2 0 990 or open circuit k 0 11 0 01 r 2 0 995 the coulombic efficiencies in l bc and nl bc achieved 43 8 3 2 and 82 3 4 8 respectively revealed 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination relied more on electrode after lactate removal 3 2 performance of lactate fermentation and gas generation in l bc lactate was completely consumed within 2 d and the gradual generation of short chain acid and gas were observed as the fermentation byproducts fig 2 a at 4 d acetate and propionate approached 1 1 mm and 0 5 mm respectively accompanied with some amount of h2 0 35 μm ch4 1 7 mm and co2 0 15 mm fig 2b the gradual increase in the concentration of ch4 indicated the increased activity of methanogens neither lactate fermentation nor gas generation was observed in the abiotic cathode confirming their reliance on microbial participation lactate fermentation performance in open circuit was similar with l bc and both lactate fermentation and gas formation were observed fig 2a and b this indicated that electro stimulation had little impact on both lactate fermentation and gas generation as lactate was removed nl bc only negligible acetate or ch4 were detected while no h2 or co2 generation was observed indicating their restrictive ability for biocathode gas generation under cathode potential of 0 36 v besides it also illustrated that the generation of ch4 and h2 majorly relied on the biological fermentation and methanogenesis previously some studies found that the generation of h2 or ch4 in bess could only proceed below 0 41 v and 0 5 v respectively cheng et al 2009 combing the lactate decomposition results in l bc nl bc and abiotic cathode it is inferred that the generation of h2 and ch4 would probably be derived from biological effect but not by the cathodic potential 3 3 electrochemical evidences for the enhanced dechlorination by cv analysis after the stable dechlorination activity was obtained cv analysis was performed to testify the electrochemical characteristics of cathodic biofilm in abiotic cathode added with 2 4 6 tcp cv curve presented a small peak peak a arising at 0 27 v fig 3 a while no recognizable peak was observed without 2 4 6 tcp fig 3b two obvious reduction peaks were found at 0 057 v peak b nl bc and 0 005 v peak c l bc with the onset potential ranged between 0 1 and 0 2 v respectively fig 3a since no remarkable peak was observed in the absence of 2 4 6 tcp peaks b nl bc and c l bc would probably derive from 2 4 6 tcp reduction both peak b and c were positively shifted compared with peak a also the 13 8 times peak c a nl bc and 3 6 times peak b a l bc higher peak currents were observed the much smaller peak area of b than c demonstrated the distinctly affected electrochemical characteristics after lactate removal the reduction capacity of 4 cp or 2 4 dcp by cathodic biofilm were also testified fig 3 c d two small reduction peaks d 0 19 v or f 0 25 v were observed with the addition of 4 cp or 2 4 dcp in the abiotic cathode similarly in biocathode with the addition of 4 cp or 2 4 dcp two positively shifted peaks were observed peak d 0 016 v peak f 0 003 v meanwhile the peak currents of d and f were 2 7 and 1 4 times higher than d and f respectively the obvious positive shift of reduction peak and the higher peak current indicated the enhanced reduction activity of 2 4 dcp or 4 cp in l bc 3 4 microbial community structure and composition the detailed information on the high throughput sequencing the diversity and dominant phyla and classes for bacteria and archaea were described in supplementary materials tables s2 and s3 and fig s4 principal component analysis pca fig s5a showed the similar bacterial otu composition in biofilm and plankton of l bc and biofilm of nl bc while distinctly different bacterial communities were obtained in the enriched culture open circuit or the plankton of nl bc for the archaea the similar otus were observed in the biofilms of l bc nl bc and open circuit however the considerable different archaeal community composition was found between clusters of electro stimulated samples with the original enrichment fig s5b the pca analysis showed that electro stimulation obviously altered the microbial structure bacterial structure and composition relative abundance over 0 1 at genus level were described in fig 4 a electro stimulation distinctly promoted the enrichment of potential electro active dechlorinating and fermenting genera like acetobacterium clostridium pseudomonas and desulfovibrio acetobacterium was the most abundant in all electro stimulated systems 46 5 in biofilm and 44 3 in the plankton of l bc 47 1 in biofilm and 25 8 in the plankton of nl bc except for the open circuit or the original enrichment acetobacterium is homoacetogenic and halogen respiring which utilizes halogenated organic compounds like tetrachloromethane and pentabrominated diphenyl ether michal et al 2012 ding et al 2013 clostridium 2 1 9 1 and pseudomonas 4 6 7 9 which hold the diverse physiologies were predominant in all electro stimulated systems both clostridium and pseudomonas were reported as lactate utilizing fermenters akao et al 2007 ma et al 2007 and reductive dechlorinators xu et al 2014 garg et al 2013 besides clostridium and pseudomonas were reported as electro active which could respire with both anode and cathode choi et al 2014 logan 2009 su et al 2012 desulfovibrio responsible for 2 chlorophenol reductive dechlorination sun et al 2000 was more abundant in biofilms of l bc 5 8 6 7 and nl bc 4 3 4 9 and desulfovibrio was also reported that could respire with either anode logan 2009 or cathode croese et al 2011 some fermentative genera like anaerocella sedimentibacter or hydrogenoanaerobacterium yang et al 2009 imachi et al 2016 song and dong 2009 took higher proportion in l bc 4 6 3 4 and 3 0 respectively than nl bc 1 5 1 2 and 1 2 respectively indicating their close correlation with lactate as for open circuit the proportions of acetobacterium 16 3 and desulfovibrio 0 2 were obviously lower than the electro stimulation system l bc nl bc however the abundance of other potential functional genera like anaerocella 10 0 sedimentibacter 9 7 clostridium 2 9 and pseudomonas 4 1 were similar in the original enrichment the unclassified genera in family anaerolineaceae were the most predominant 46 8 while little was found in the other electro stimulated systems some obligate organohalide respiring bacteria were also detected in the original enriched culture like dehalobacter 0 05 and dehalobacterium 0 5 wang and he 2013 trueba santiso and parlad 2017 however none of them was found in either cathodic biofilm or suspension demonstrating their irrelevance with biocathode dechlorination archaeal composition and structure at the genus level were presented in fig 4b methanosarcina was a typical acetate utilizing methanogen chae et al 2010 which was the most predominant in all electro stimulated systems or open circuit 64 6 93 4 methanomassiliicoccus a hydrogen utilizing methanogen dridi et al 2012 was dominant in the enriched culture 85 7 while its abundance became much lower after electro acclimation 3 8 24 3 methanobacterium a hydrogen utilizing methanogen kotsyurbenko et al 2007 was observed in all electro stimulated systems 2 5 8 9 but was barely found in the enriched culture 3 5 pearson correlation and molecular ecological networks pearson correlation of the identified otus with environmental variables and the ones with which showed the significant correlations were displayed in fig 5 respectively 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency was positively correlated with some potential dechlorinators or fermenters including acetobacterium pearson correlation coefficient r 0 85 significant correlation coefficient p 0 01 pseudomonas r 0 6 p 0 05 desulfovibrio r 0 7 p 0 05 anaerocella r 0 6 p 0 05 and hydrogenoanaerobacterium r 0 7 p 0 01 fig 5a among them hydrogenoanaerobacterium the potential fermenter displayed the significantly negative correlation with acetate and ch4 it should be noticed that acetobacterium showed a negative correlation without significant difference with acetate fig 5 so its homoacetogenic function was excluded in the system meanwhile sedimentibacter was significantly positive correlated with both acetate and ch4 and yet significantly negative correlated with the dechlorination efficiency some identified archaea like methanosarcina methanomassiliicoccus and methanoplasma were significantly positive correlated with ch4 of which methanomassiliicoccus showed a positive correlation with acetate and a negative correlation with 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency while methanosarcina displayed a negative correlation with acetate fig 5b the overall rmt based networks of cathodic biofilm and plankton were both divided into two distinct modules with 32 nodes fig s6 the obviously different topological properties of biofilm and plankton networks indicated their great difference in microbial interaction table s4 the network of plankton possesses distinctly higher averaged connectivity demonstrating a more complex network several clostridium and pseudomonas species spread over the major modules consistent with their high abundance and diverse physiologies archaea like methanosarcina and methanomassiliicoccus shared numerous associations with bacteria suggesting their tight relationships with bacteria subnetworks were constructed with the otus which represented the significant correlation with environmental variables fig 6 the distinct different network interactions were found between biofilm and plankton in the network of biofilm acetobacterium otu123 displayed a positive correlation with desulfovibrio otu137 pseudomonas otu143 and sedimentibacter otu126 fig 6a demonstrating their similar preferred ecological niche or cooperative activities long and azam 2001 while both acetobacterium otu123 and pseudomonas otu143 showed a negative correlation with methanomassiliicoccus otu256 which signified their potential competing relationships long and azam 2001 pseudomonas otu234 was positively related with two typical methanogens methanosarcina otu250 and methanobacterium otu257 while desulfovibrio otu137 was negatively correlated with methanobacterium otu257 however in the plankton acetobacterium otu123 showed only a positive correlation with pseudomonas otu143 and otu234 otu10 also from the genus of acetobacterium displayed positive correlations with sedimentibacter otu74 and pseudomonas otu35 specifically some nodes from the same genus otu125 and otu137 from desulfovibrio otu224 and otu19 from clostridium shared diverse correlations indicating somehow exclusion mechanisms or niche partitioning among the versatile genus both clostridium otu224 and pseudomonas otu139 showed positive correlations with hydrogenoanaerobacterium otu116 and methanosarcina otu250 while methanomassiliicoccus otu256 displayed a negative correlation with sedimentibacter otu74 among of them acetobacterium otu123 and pseudomonas otu143 displayed the consistent positive correlation with each other in either biofilm or plankton implying the very similar phylogenetic relatedness between the two genera fuhrman and steele 2008 4 discussion in this study the remarkably enhanced 2 4 6 tcp bio dechlorination activity was obtained by supplying a constant cathode potential of 0 36 v the outstanding 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination capacity was manifested in the accelerated dechlorination rate 24 2 μm d 3 0 times higher than open circuit and the complete dechlorination ability with phenol as the sole final dechlorination product no accumulation of toxic intermediate 4 cp fig 1 as reported the longest distance from hydroxyl to para chlorine made chlorine in para position stable and 4 cp the most difficult to be dechlorinated wang et al 2014 to date this is one of a very few that represented the complete dechlorination capacity during 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination wang et al 2014 villemur et al 2006 cv analysis for the first time gave the clear electrochemical evidence for the dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp in biocathode and further confirmed the complete dechlorination ability by using electrode as the effective electron donor fig 3 fig 2 showed electro stimulation had little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis microbiome structure and ecological network analyses suggested that under the cathodic potential of 0 36v electro stimulation selectively increased the abundance of some potential dechlorinators acetobacterium desulfovibrio etc while no obvious impact on methanogens and fermenters was observed the potential dechlorinators displayed collaborative interrelations with fermenters but somewhat competitive interrelations with methanogens so far although anaeromyxobacter or geobacter have been confirmed to possess the cathode respiring ability the enhanced dechlorination capacity in the two strains acclimated electro stimulation systems had never been mentioned strycharz et al 2008 2010 zhang et al 2014 reported that pentachlorophenol was dechlorinated to 4 cp and phenol by immobilizing humin on cathode however the dechlorination activity was lost in the absence of formate liu et al 2013 speculated the electron transfer between electrode and electro active bacteria during pentachlorophenol dechlorination but the direct bioelectrochemical evidence was lacking and the dechlorination metabolites were unclear acetobacterium was found as the most abundant potential dechlorinating genus in biofilm figs 4 and 5 however its cathode respiring ability was never reported instead some other dominant genera which was highly related with 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination were reported as cathode respiring like pseudomonas and desulfovibrio figs 4 and 5 the widely existed positive correlations between acetobacterium otu 123 pseudomonas otu 143 and desulfovibrio otu 137 in the network of biofilm fig 6 demonstrated their coexistence and cooperative interactions to achieve the high dechlorination rate by respiring electrons directly from electrode or indirectly via the mutual intraspecific or interspecies electron transfer processes nagarajan et al 2013 maphosa et al 2012 on the other hand the highest dechlorination rate was observed when lactate and electrode coexisted fig 1 lactate decomposition laws in different systems verified h2 and ch4 generation came solely from the microbial participated lactate fermentation and h2 acetate utilized methanogenesis independent from electrode electrolysis fig 2 therefore the high dechlorination rates would possibly due to the availability of sufficient electrons from both electrode and lactate fermentation otherwise the low dechlorination performance in nl bc could be possibly caused by the deficiency of either electrons or carbon sources the microbial community analyses found that compared with open circuit electro stimulation distinctly increased the relative abundance of some potential dechlorinators while it did not show the obvious impact on fermenters and methanogens in both composition and abundance in the network of biofilm acetobacterium otu 123 displayed sort of competitive relations with methanomassiliicoccus otu 256 a potential hydrogen utilizing methanogen demonstrated their potential relations by scrambling for electrons chambon et al 2013 meanwhile acetobacterium otu 123 was positively correlated with a potential fermenter of sedimentibacter otu126 demonstrating their potential syntrophic relationships farai et al 2012 otu 10 also from the genus of acetobacterium was highly related with other otus in the network of plankton acetobacterium otu 10 showed the diversified interactions as compared with otu 123 demonstrating their different physiologies clostridium represented close relations with methanogens like methanosarcina and fermenters like hydrogenoanaerobacterium in the network of plankton demonstrating its potential fermentation or dechlorination function pseudomonas also known as fermenters displayed the positive correlations with methanogens in biofilm such as otu 234 with both otu 257 and otu 250 and plankton such as otu 110 with both otu 257 and otu 250 suggesting their possible syntrophic functions deng et al 2012 in general the ecological interrelations of potential dechlorinators fermenters and methanogens in the electro stimulated systems followed the similar law with the microbial enrichment systems the more complex network in plankton than in biofilm revealed the more diversified microbial interrelations the possible reason would be that electro stimulation had great impact on the biofilm community to attract the colonization of electro active bacteria or the ones which shared the preferred environmental conditions with them although the microbial community in plankton was supposed to come majorly from biofilm detachment the presence of lactate boosted the growth of microbial communities which utilized lactate and its fermentation metabolites acetate propionate h2 etc on the other hand although less connectivity was observed in the network of biofilm functional otus dechlorinators and fermenters gathered around and shared more interactions while they dispersed with little interactions in the network of plankton fig 6 therefore the electro stimulation could optimize the microbial structure and interrelations which might corporately enhance 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination 5 conclusions this study reported the significantly enhanced 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination activity by the weak electrical stimulation dechlorination performances and electrochemical evidence clearly revealed the biofilm community utilized electrode as an effective electron donor to maintain the high dechlorination ability electro stimulation at the cathodic potential of 0 36 v selectively enhanced the dechlorination function while it showed little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis processes in the electro stimulated systems the potential dechlorinators presented symbiotic or somewhat competitive relationships with fermenters or methanogens the distinctly enhanced dechlorination performance and the reveal of microbial mechanism would be beneficial for the in situ bioremediation of chlorinated aromatics through the weak electrical stimulation

18648,microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated aromatics frequently suffers from the long dechlorination period and the generation of toxic metabolites biocathode bioelectrochemical systems were verified to be effective in the degradation of various refractory pollutants however the electrochemical and microbial related working mechanisms for bio dechlorination by electro stimulation remain poorly understood in this study we reported the significantly improved 2 4 6 trichlorophenol dechlorination activity through the weak electro stimulation cathode potential of 0 36 v vs she as evidenced by the 3 1 times higher dechlorination rate and the complete dechlorination ability with phenol as the end dechlorination product the high reductive dechlorination rate 20 8 μm d could be maintained by utilizing electrode as an effective electron donor coulombic efficiency of 82 3 4 8 cyclic voltammetry analysis of the cathodic biofilm gave the direct evidences of the cathodic respiration with the improved and positive shifted reduction peaks of 2 4 6 tcp 2 4 dcp and 4 cp the optimal 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination rate 24 2 μm d was obtained when a small amount of lactate 2 mm was added and the generation of h2 and ch4 were accompanied due to the biological fermentation and methanogenesis the electrical stimulation significantly altered the cathodic biofilm structure and composition with some potential dechlorinators like acetobacterium predominated the microbial interactions in the ecological network of cathodic biofilm were more simplified than the planktonic community however some potential dechlorinators acetobacterium desulfovibrio etc shared more positive interactions the co existence and possible cooperative relationships between potential dechlorinators and fermenters sedimentibacter etc were revealed meanwhile the competitive interrelations between potential dechlorinators and methanogens methanomassiliicoccus were found in the network of plankton the fermenters and methanogens possessed the more positive interrelations electro stimulation at the cathodic potential of 0 36 v selectively enhanced the dechlorination function while it showed little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis process the study gave suggestions for the enhanced bioremediation of chlorinated aromatics in views of the electro stimulation capacity efficiency and microbial interrelations related microbial mechanism graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 4 6 trichlorophenol reductive dechlorination electrical stimulation electro active microorganism biocathode microbial interaction 1 introduction halogenated aromatic compounds hacs constitute an important class of organic pollutants in the environment because of their toxicity persistence and widespread use häggblom and bossert 2003 twenty three types of halogenated benzenes or phenols have been recorded as priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency which occupied 18 of the total list epa 1981 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp is one of the notorious representatives and has been extensively applied as a pesticide precursor or formed during drinking water disinfection tan et al 2009 reductive dehalogenation of hacs via organohalide respiring bacteria has been considered as one of the most crucial bioremediation routes for hac detoxification in anoxic or anaerobic contaminated sites sediments groundwater etc jugder et al 2016 however because of the physiological toxicity of hacs and the external electron donor deficiency the currently reported dehalogenation populations possess either low dehalogenation rate or incomplete dehalogenation capacity richardson 2016 häggblom et al 2000 the reported hacs dehalogenation period would usually take from a few days to weeks richardson 2016 häggblom et al 2000 to date some obligate organohalide respiring isolates like dehalococcoides and dehalobacter were found that could efficiently dechlorinate 2 4 6 tcp wang and he 2013 but no isolate was able to dechlorinate 2 4 6 tcp completely to phenol wang et al 2014 villemur et al 2006 the lack of electron donor short chain organics h2 in dechlorination systems was majorly caused by the low h2 solubility or electron scramble of competitive metabolic processes methanogenesis denitrification etc chambon et al 2013 li et al 2010 the enhanced reduction of various refractory pollutants has been observed in bioelectrochemical cathodes by introducing a constant negative potential aulenta et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 the application of electrode as a potential electron donor is a favorable means because of its continuous direct and sustainable characteristics chen et al 2018 previously anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans and geobacter lovelyi were found to utilize electrons from the electrode surface and reductively dechlorinate 2 chlorophenol or tetrachloroethylene strycharz et al 2008 2010 the reductive dechlorination of chlorophenols have been investigated through adding co substrates or electron mediators in constructed bioelectrochemical systems zhang et al 2011 2014 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2019 however the electrochemical and microbial mechanisms of the electro stimulated bio dechlorination require further study the electrochemical evidence by utilizing electrode as electron donor for stimulating the dechlorination activity is still lacking besides studies on the cathodic microbiome were majorly focused on the bacterial community composition and structure succession by high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 while the microbial interactions of different populations in the biocathode systems are poorly understood notably in most of the bio dehalogenation systems dehalogenation was always accompanied with fermentation and methanogenesis because of the electron scramble by adding organic acids as carbon and electron source chambon et al 2013 li et al 2010 farai et al 2012 in natural environment dehalogenators and fermenters are symbiotic while dehalogenators and methanogens are competitive chambon et al 2013 farai et al 2012 however how those functional populations were influenced under the electro stimulated environments including not only the microbial community succession but also the microbial ecological interrelations remain poorly understood in this study microbial dechlorination activities for 2 4 6 tcp were investigated by stimulation with a negatively polarized graphite electrode 0 36 v vs she this study aims to reveal whether cathode could serve as an alternative electron donor to stimulate bio dechlorination and how the potential dechlorinators methanogens fermenters or electroactive populations associate to achieve the high dechlorination efficiency when double electron donors hydrosoluble lactate and insoluble solid state electrode co existed microbiome structure and ecological network analyses aimed to identify the potential dechlorinators fermenters and methanogens and their collaborative or competitive interrelations the obviously improved dechlorination performance and the microbiome analyses highlighted the function and mechanism of the accelerated electro stimulated dechlorination system for potential bioremediation applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial consortium enrichment the microbial source was obtained from chlorophenol polluted soil collected at around a pesticide factory in shandong province china the detail information of the microbial consortium enrichment process was described before li et al 2013b after acclimatization for more than one year the culture could stably dechlorinate 100 μm of 2 4 6 tcp to 4 cp within 14 d by utilizing 20 mm of lactate as the electron donor the 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination results were shown in fig s1 2 2 biocathode bioelectrochemial system bes setup biocathode bess were set up in

pbs 1 ml l vitamin stock solution l ml l sl 10 trace element solution 100 μm 2 4 6 tcp and or 2 mm sodium lactate li et al 2013a the anaerobic anolyte contained 100 mm of potassium ferrocyanide 99 purity during preparation both catholyte and anolyte were bubbled with n2 99 99 of purity for 15 min to remove oxygen for solution exchange the catholyte and anolyte were all discharged and meanwhile the chambers were refilled with n2 then the prepared catholyte and anolyte were injected immediately into cathode and anode chambers the 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination consortium 5 ml about 10 of inoculation percentage was inoculated into cathode to allow the cathodic biofilm development once 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination activity was observed in the cathode the catholyte exchange and repeated inoculation were conducted after repeated inoculation for about four times nearly 20 d the microbial inoculation terminated and catholyte exchange was started every 4 d when 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination was observed the stable dechlorination performance rate efficiency and metabolites generation was observed after acclimation for about 40 d about 20 d of acclimation and 20 d of medium exchange after that acclimation was continued for another 20 d to confirm the stable dechlorination activity the whole acclimation procedure lasted for approximately 60 d to achieve the stable dechlorination activity separate reactors were simultaneously started up with four different operating conditions including a lactate fed biocathode l bc b non lactate fed biocathode nl bc c open circuit and d abiotic cathode the l bc indicated the reactors fed with 2 mm sodium lactate and the cathodic potential of 0 36v throughout the operation for the nl bc the initial operation mode was the same with the l bc after the mature biofilm was formed about 40 d sodium lactate was replaced with nahco3 for at least 3 cycles to testify the biofilm cathode respiring ability during dechlorination open circuit reactors were the ones with the disconnected circuits throughout the operation abiotic cathode reactors indicated the ones without microbial inoculation during acclimation sextuplicate batch experiments were conducted in parallel under each identical condition all experiments were conducted at a constant ambient temperature 25 2 c 2 4 chemicals and analytical methods 2 4 6 trichlorophenol

and composition in both cathodic biofilm and suspension of l bc nl bc and open circuit were analyzed by 16s rrna gene based illumina miseq sequencing when lactate was removed for at least six cycles samples were taken from nl bc samples in cathode carbon brush were pretreated by cutting into pieces immerging into 10 ml pbs and washing out by an oscillator and then the washed out solution was collected and concentrated to 1 5 ml by centrifugation at 12000 rps the detail methods for dna extraction amplification sequencing and taxonomic classification have been described previously chen et al 2018 principal component analysis pca was performed to evaluate the topological variation of microbial community composition among the different operation conditions by canoco 4 5 pearson correlation between microbes and three crucial environmental variables 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency acetate generation and ch4 generation were calculated by majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com the visualization of both pca and pearson correlation were using originpro 2016 the 16s rrna gene sequence data were deposited in ncbi sequence read archive under the accession number of srp151178 2 6 construction of molecular ecological network to evaluate the microbial interactions of potential dechlorination populations fermentation populations and methanogens in cathodic biofilm and suspension two phylogenetic molecular ecological networks mens were constructed with the random matrix theory based rmt based interface approach zhou et al 2010 deng et al 2012 liang et al 2019 all identified operational taxonomic units otus for bacteria and archaea were applied for the network construction the topological properties of the network including number of nodes and links averaged connectivity path length clustering coefficient and modularity were processed by network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena the constructed networks for biofilm and plankton community were visualized by cytoscape 3 6 1 software 3 results 3 1 reductive dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp after inoculating for approximately 60 d the similar current variation trend stable cathode potential fig s2 and 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency were observed under each batch cycle suggesting the constructed systems have become stable 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiencies and kinetics measured in a cycle were shown in fig 1 and table s1 the significantly enhanced 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination activity was observed in l bc with the removal efficiency er achieving 83 7 2 1 and 99 5 3 2 at 2 d and 4 d respectively fig 1a table s1 phenol was the major determined dechlorination product in l bc a trace amount of 2 4 dcp and 4 cp once appeared at 2 d and they were further dechlorinated completely to phenol after 4 d fig 1a the further degradation of phenol was not observed after the following 10 d fig s3 in comparison little 2 4 6 tcp was removed in abiotic cathode at 4 d fig 1d reflecting the restrictive dechlorination capacity at potential of 0 36 v the result was coincident with a previous study finding that the pure electrochemical process contributed little to chlorophenol decomposition when cathode potential was higher than 0 44 v cheng et al 1997 meanwhile the dechlorination process in open circuit was similar with that by the enriched microbial consortium fig s1 s3b only 36 4 of er was observed at 4 d and the end of dechlorination appeared after 12 d following with 2 4 dcp and 4 cp as the intermediates or end dechlorination products in either the enriched microbial consortium or open circuit 4 cp was the final dechlorination product after lactate was removed nl bc the dechlorination activity could still be maintained with phenol as the end dechlorination product 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency was reduced to 88 2 3 1 at 4 d with the generation of some metabolites 2 4 dcp 4 cp and phenol fig 1b the complete dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp to phenol was observed at 8 d fig s3 under all the tested conditions the rate constants k for 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination was fitted well with the first order kinetics r 2 0 970 table s1 the distinctly higher k was observed in l bc k 1 37 0 02 r 2 0 970 than in nl bc k 0 53 0 02 r 2 0 990 or open circuit k 0 11 0 01 r 2 0 995 the coulombic efficiencies in l bc and nl bc achieved 43 8 3 2 and 82 3 4 8 respectively revealed 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination relied more on electrode after lactate removal 3 2 performance of lactate fermentation and gas generation in l bc lactate was completely consumed within 2 d and the gradual generation of short chain acid and gas were observed as the fermentation byproducts fig 2 a at 4 d acetate and propionate approached 1 1 mm and 0 5 mm respectively accompanied with some amount of h2 0 35 μm ch4 1 7 mm and co2 0 15 mm fig 2b the gradual increase in the concentration of ch4 indicated the increased activity of methanogens neither lactate fermentation nor gas generation was observed in the abiotic cathode confirming their reliance on microbial participation lactate fermentation performance in open circuit was similar with l bc and both lactate fermentation and gas formation were observed fig 2a and b this indicated that electro stimulation had little impact on both lactate fermentation and gas generation as lactate was removed nl bc only negligible acetate or ch4 were detected while no h2 or co2 generation was observed indicating their restrictive ability for biocathode gas generation under cathode potential of 0 36 v besides it also illustrated that the generation of ch4 and h2 majorly relied on the biological fermentation and methanogenesis previously some studies found that the generation of h2 or ch4 in bess could only proceed below 0 41 v and 0 5 v respectively cheng et al 2009 combing the lactate decomposition results in l bc nl bc and abiotic cathode it is inferred that the generation of h2 and ch4 would probably be derived from biological effect but not by the cathodic potential 3 3 electrochemical evidences for the enhanced dechlorination by cv analysis after the stable dechlorination activity was obtained cv analysis was performed to testify the electrochemical characteristics of cathodic biofilm in abiotic cathode added with 2 4 6 tcp cv curve presented a small peak peak a arising at 0 27 v fig 3 a while no recognizable peak was observed without 2 4 6 tcp fig 3b two obvious reduction peaks were found at 0 057 v peak b nl bc and 0 005 v peak c l bc with the onset potential ranged between 0 1 and 0 2 v respectively fig 3a since no remarkable peak was observed in the absence of 2 4 6 tcp peaks b nl bc and c l bc would probably derive from 2 4 6 tcp reduction both peak b and c were positively shifted compared with peak a also the 13 8 times peak c a nl bc and 3 6 times peak b a l bc higher peak currents were observed the much smaller peak area of b than c demonstrated the distinctly affected electrochemical characteristics after lactate removal the reduction capacity of 4 cp or 2 4 dcp by cathodic biofilm were also testified fig 3 c d two small reduction peaks d 0 19 v or f 0 25 v were observed with the addition of 4 cp or 2 4 dcp in the abiotic cathode similarly in biocathode with the addition of 4 cp or 2 4 dcp two positively shifted peaks were observed peak d 0 016 v peak f 0 003 v meanwhile the peak currents of d and f were 2 7 and 1 4 times higher than d and f respectively the obvious positive shift of reduction peak and the higher peak current indicated the enhanced reduction activity of 2 4 dcp or 4 cp in l bc 3 4 microbial community structure and composition the detailed information on the high throughput sequencing the diversity and dominant phyla and classes for bacteria and archaea were described in supplementary materials tables s2 and s3 and fig s4 principal component analysis pca fig s5a showed the similar bacterial otu composition in biofilm and plankton of l bc and biofilm of nl bc while distinctly different bacterial communities were obtained in the enriched culture open circuit or the plankton of nl bc for the archaea the similar otus were observed in the biofilms of l bc nl bc and open circuit however the considerable different archaeal community composition was found between clusters of electro stimulated samples with the original enrichment fig s5b the pca analysis showed that electro stimulation obviously altered the microbial structure bacterial structure and composition relative abundance over 0 1 at genus level were described in fig 4 a electro stimulation distinctly promoted the enrichment of potential electro active dechlorinating and fermenting genera like acetobacterium clostridium pseudomonas and desulfovibrio acetobacterium was the most abundant in all electro stimulated systems 46 5 in biofilm and 44 3 in the plankton of l bc 47 1 in biofilm and 25 8 in the plankton of nl bc except for the open circuit or the original enrichment acetobacterium is homoacetogenic and halogen respiring which utilizes halogenated organic compounds like tetrachloromethane and pentabrominated diphenyl ether michal et al 2012 ding et al 2013 clostridium 2 1 9 1 and pseudomonas 4 6 7 9 which hold the diverse physiologies were predominant in all electro stimulated systems both clostridium and pseudomonas were reported as lactate utilizing fermenters akao et al 2007 ma et al 2007 and reductive dechlorinators xu et al 2014 garg et al 2013 besides clostridium and pseudomonas were reported as electro active which could respire with both anode and cathode choi et al 2014 logan 2009 su et al 2012 desulfovibrio responsible for 2 chlorophenol reductive dechlorination sun et al 2000 was more abundant in biofilms of l bc 5 8 6 7 and nl bc 4 3 4 9 and desulfovibrio was also reported that could respire with either anode logan 2009 or cathode croese et al 2011 some fermentative genera like anaerocella sedimentibacter or hydrogenoanaerobacterium yang et al 2009 imachi et al 2016 song and dong 2009 took higher proportion in l bc 4 6 3 4 and 3 0 respectively than nl bc 1 5 1 2 and 1 2 respectively indicating their close correlation with lactate as for open circuit the proportions of acetobacterium 16 3 and desulfovibrio 0 2 were obviously lower than the electro stimulation system l bc nl bc however the abundance of other potential functional genera like anaerocella 10 0 sedimentibacter 9 7 clostridium 2 9 and pseudomonas 4 1 were similar in the original enrichment the unclassified genera in family anaerolineaceae were the most predominant 46 8 while little was found in the other electro stimulated systems some obligate organohalide respiring bacteria were also detected in the original enriched culture like dehalobacter 0 05 and dehalobacterium 0 5 wang and he 2013 trueba santiso and parlad 2017 however none of them was found in either cathodic biofilm or suspension demonstrating their irrelevance with biocathode dechlorination archaeal composition and structure at the genus level were presented in fig 4b methanosarcina was a typical acetate utilizing methanogen chae et al 2010 which was the most predominant in all electro stimulated systems or open circuit 64 6 93 4 methanomassiliicoccus a hydrogen utilizing methanogen dridi et al 2012 was dominant in the enriched culture 85 7 while its abundance became much lower after electro acclimation 3 8 24 3 methanobacterium a hydrogen utilizing methanogen kotsyurbenko et al 2007 was observed in all electro stimulated systems 2 5 8 9 but was barely found in the enriched culture 3 5 pearson correlation and molecular ecological networks pearson correlation of the identified otus with environmental variables and the ones with which showed the significant correlations were displayed in fig 5 respectively 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency was positively correlated with some potential dechlorinators or fermenters including acetobacterium pearson correlation coefficient r 0 85 significant correlation coefficient p 0 01 pseudomonas r 0 6 p 0 05 desulfovibrio r 0 7 p 0 05 anaerocella r 0 6 p 0 05 and hydrogenoanaerobacterium r 0 7 p 0 01 fig 5a among them hydrogenoanaerobacterium the potential fermenter displayed the significantly negative correlation with acetate and ch4 it should be noticed that acetobacterium showed a negative correlation without significant difference with acetate fig 5 so its homoacetogenic function was excluded in the system meanwhile sedimentibacter was significantly positive correlated with both acetate and ch4 and yet significantly negative correlated with the dechlorination efficiency some identified archaea like methanosarcina methanomassiliicoccus and methanoplasma were significantly positive correlated with ch4 of which methanomassiliicoccus showed a positive correlation with acetate and a negative correlation with 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination efficiency while methanosarcina displayed a negative correlation with acetate fig 5b the overall rmt based networks of cathodic biofilm and plankton were both divided into two distinct modules with 32 nodes fig s6 the obviously different topological properties of biofilm and plankton networks indicated their great difference in microbial interaction table s4 the network of plankton possesses distinctly higher averaged connectivity demonstrating a more complex network several clostridium and pseudomonas species spread over the major modules consistent with their high abundance and diverse physiologies archaea like methanosarcina and methanomassiliicoccus shared numerous associations with bacteria suggesting their tight relationships with bacteria subnetworks were constructed with the otus which represented the significant correlation with environmental variables fig 6 the distinct different network interactions were found between biofilm and plankton in the network of biofilm acetobacterium otu123 displayed a positive correlation with desulfovibrio otu137 pseudomonas otu143 and sedimentibacter otu126 fig 6a demonstrating their similar preferred ecological niche or cooperative activities long and azam 2001 while both acetobacterium otu123 and pseudomonas otu143 showed a negative correlation with methanomassiliicoccus otu256 which signified their potential competing relationships long and azam 2001 pseudomonas otu234 was positively related with two typical methanogens methanosarcina otu250 and methanobacterium otu257 while desulfovibrio otu137 was negatively correlated with methanobacterium otu257 however in the plankton acetobacterium otu123 showed only a positive correlation with pseudomonas otu143 and otu234 otu10 also from the genus of acetobacterium displayed positive correlations with sedimentibacter otu74 and pseudomonas otu35 specifically some nodes from the same genus otu125 and otu137 from desulfovibrio otu224 and otu19 from clostridium shared diverse correlations indicating somehow exclusion mechanisms or niche partitioning among the versatile genus both clostridium otu224 and pseudomonas otu139 showed positive correlations with hydrogenoanaerobacterium otu116 and methanosarcina otu250 while methanomassiliicoccus otu256 displayed a negative correlation with sedimentibacter otu74 among of them acetobacterium otu123 and pseudomonas otu143 displayed the consistent positive correlation with each other in either biofilm or plankton implying the very similar phylogenetic relatedness between the two genera fuhrman and steele 2008 4 discussion in this study the remarkably enhanced 2 4 6 tcp bio dechlorination activity was obtained by supplying a constant cathode potential of 0 36 v the outstanding 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination capacity was manifested in the accelerated dechlorination rate 24 2 μm d 3 0 times higher than open circuit and the complete dechlorination ability with phenol as the sole final dechlorination product no accumulation of toxic intermediate 4 cp fig 1 as reported the longest distance from hydroxyl to para chlorine made chlorine in para position stable and 4 cp the most difficult to be dechlorinated wang et al 2014 to date this is one of a very few that represented the complete dechlorination capacity during 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination wang et al 2014 villemur et al 2006 cv analysis for the first time gave the clear electrochemical evidence for the dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp in biocathode and further confirmed the complete dechlorination ability by using electrode as the effective electron donor fig 3 fig 2 showed electro stimulation had little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis microbiome structure and ecological network analyses suggested that under the cathodic potential of 0 36v electro stimulation selectively increased the abundance of some potential dechlorinators acetobacterium desulfovibrio etc while no obvious impact on methanogens and fermenters was observed the potential dechlorinators displayed collaborative interrelations with fermenters but somewhat competitive interrelations with methanogens so far although anaeromyxobacter or geobacter have been confirmed to possess the cathode respiring ability the enhanced dechlorination capacity in the two strains acclimated electro stimulation systems had never been mentioned strycharz et al 2008 2010 zhang et al 2014 reported that pentachlorophenol was dechlorinated to 4 cp and phenol by immobilizing humin on cathode however the dechlorination activity was lost in the absence of formate liu et al 2013 speculated the electron transfer between electrode and electro active bacteria during pentachlorophenol dechlorination but the direct bioelectrochemical evidence was lacking and the dechlorination metabolites were unclear acetobacterium was found as the most abundant potential dechlorinating genus in biofilm figs 4 and 5 however its cathode respiring ability was never reported instead some other dominant genera which was highly related with 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination were reported as cathode respiring like pseudomonas and desulfovibrio figs 4 and 5 the widely existed positive correlations between acetobacterium otu 123 pseudomonas otu 143 and desulfovibrio otu 137 in the network of biofilm fig 6 demonstrated their coexistence and cooperative interactions to achieve the high dechlorination rate by respiring electrons directly from electrode or indirectly via the mutual intraspecific or interspecies electron transfer processes nagarajan et al 2013 maphosa et al 2012 on the other hand the highest dechlorination rate was observed when lactate and electrode coexisted fig 1 lactate decomposition laws in different systems verified h2 and ch4 generation came solely from the microbial participated lactate fermentation and h2 acetate utilized methanogenesis independent from electrode electrolysis fig 2 therefore the high dechlorination rates would possibly due to the availability of sufficient electrons from both electrode and lactate fermentation otherwise the low dechlorination performance in nl bc could be possibly caused by the deficiency of either electrons or carbon sources the microbial community analyses found that compared with open circuit electro stimulation distinctly increased the relative abundance of some potential dechlorinators while it did not show the obvious impact on fermenters and methanogens in both composition and abundance in the network of biofilm acetobacterium otu 123 displayed sort of competitive relations with methanomassiliicoccus otu 256 a potential hydrogen utilizing methanogen demonstrated their potential relations by scrambling for electrons chambon et al 2013 meanwhile acetobacterium otu 123 was positively correlated with a potential fermenter of sedimentibacter otu126 demonstrating their potential syntrophic relationships farai et al 2012 otu 10 also from the genus of acetobacterium was highly related with other otus in the network of plankton acetobacterium otu 10 showed the diversified interactions as compared with otu 123 demonstrating their different physiologies clostridium represented close relations with methanogens like methanosarcina and fermenters like hydrogenoanaerobacterium in the network of plankton demonstrating its potential fermentation or dechlorination function pseudomonas also known as fermenters displayed the positive correlations with methanogens in biofilm such as otu 234 with both otu 257 and otu 250 and plankton such as otu 110 with both otu 257 and otu 250 suggesting their possible syntrophic functions deng et al 2012 in general the ecological interrelations of potential dechlorinators fermenters and methanogens in the electro stimulated systems followed the similar law with the microbial enrichment systems the more complex network in plankton than in biofilm revealed the more diversified microbial interrelations the possible reason would be that electro stimulation had great impact on the biofilm community to attract the colonization of electro active bacteria or the ones which shared the preferred environmental conditions with them although the microbial community in plankton was supposed to come majorly from biofilm detachment the presence of lactate boosted the growth of microbial communities which utilized lactate and its fermentation metabolites acetate propionate h2 etc on the other hand although less connectivity was observed in the network of biofilm functional otus dechlorinators and fermenters gathered around and shared more interactions while they dispersed with little interactions in the network of plankton fig 6 therefore the electro stimulation could optimize the microbial structure and interrelations which might corporately enhance 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination 5 conclusions this study reported the significantly enhanced 2 4 6 tcp reductive dechlorination activity by the weak electrical stimulation dechlorination performances and electrochemical evidence clearly revealed the biofilm community utilized electrode as an effective electron donor to maintain the high dechlorination ability electro stimulation at the cathodic potential of 0 36 v selectively enhanced the dechlorination function while it showed little influence on either fermentation or methanogenesis processes in the electro stimulated systems the potential dechlorinators presented symbiotic or somewhat competitive relationships with fermenters or methanogens the distinctly enhanced dechlorination performance and the reveal of microbial mechanism would be beneficial for the in situ bioremediation of chlorinated aromatics through the weak electrical stimulation

18649,the sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification soad process offers a feasible alternative to mainstream heterotrophic denitrification in treating domestic sewage with insufficient organics previously soad has been successfully applied in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr however the biofilm properties and biokinetics are still not thoroughly understood the present study was therefore designed to investigate these features of sulfur oxidizing biofilms sobfs cultivated in a lab scale mbbr under stable operation for over a year the biofilms developed were 160 μm thick had an uneven and porous surface on which elemental sulfur s0 accumulated and the sob biomass was highly diverse the bioprocess kinetics were evaluated through 12 batch experiments the results were interpreted by adopting a two step sulfide oxidation model sulfide s0 and s0 sulfate with all specific rates having a linear regression coefficient of r2 0 9 moreover the inhibitory kinetic analysis revealed that 1 the maximum treatment capacity about 480 mg s m2 h and 80 mg n m2 h was observed at low sulfide level 40 mg s l while higher sulfide level 60 150 mg s l showed increasing inhibition on the oxidation of both sulfide and sulfur and denitrification 2 the denitritation activity decreased by up to 43 when free nitrous acid reached a maximum of 8 6 μg n l whereas the oxidation of sulfide and sulfur did not have any significant effect interestingly two physiologically diverse sob groups were found in this special biofilm the mechanisms of the cooperation and competition for electron donors and acceptors between these two sob clades are proposed the results of this study greatly enhance our understanding of the design and optimization of soad mbbr for mainstream nitrogen removal graphical

factors in biofilm studies persson et al 2014 piculell et al 2016 have yet to be thoroughly investigated for the moving bed biofilm system in the present study the morphology chemical and microbial compositions of soad process based moving bed biofilms taken from a long term 360 day operational system were characterized and the biokinetics were investigated with a focus on the effects of sulfide and nitrate nitrite concentrations through 12 batch experiments to the best of our knowledge this experiment is the first to report the biokinetics of an soad process based moving bed biofilm the outcomes improve the understanding of mainstream soad and shed light on the development of the corresponding biofilm reactors with respect to design criteria and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 sob biofilm cultivation the biofilms used in this study were taken from a 10 l tightly sealed lab scale mbbr as shown in fig s1 in supplementary information si 700 k3 carriers with a specific media surface of 500 m2 m3 carrier were filled into the reactor accounting for a filling degree of 60 and a surface area of 3 0 m2 gilbert et al 2014 a mechanical mixer provided mixing at 80 10 rpm with a g value of 17 s 1 in the reactor synthetic saline wastewater with composition as described in si 1 was fed into the reactor the influent ph value was kept at 7 5 0 3 the ambient temperature and dissolved oxygen do of the bulk liquid was kept at 22 1 c and 0 1 mg o2 l respectively the carriers were taken from the parent reactor on day 300 for characterizing the biofilm morphology and thickness using microscopes as described in section 2 5 the biomass from the biofilm was detached for elemental composition analysis as described in section 2 3 and microbial community analysis as described in section 2 6 2 2 batch tests three groups of batch tests were conducted with the sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilms sobfs cultivated and taken from the lab scale mbbr as shown in table 1 synthetic wastewater with free and saline sulfide fss and nitrate nitrite concentrations corresponding to various sulfur to nitrogen s n mass ratios was prepared for the tests the s n mass ratio mimicked a wide range of actual operating conditions with excessive sufficient balanced and deficient amounts of primary electron donors i e fss for complete denitrification the batch experimental system consisted of a glass batch reactor with a working volume of 2 4 l equipped with a ph meter for online monitoring fig s2 the reactor was sealed with a lid fitted with a rubber ring magnetic stirrers ensured thorough mixing at 160 10 rpm with a g value of 20 s 1 in the reactors all tests were performed in duplicate in parallel at the ambient temperature 22 1 c given that sampling may lead to pressure loss a gasbag filled with inert gas n2 was connected to the reactor to prevent oxygen ingress prior to each test 60 k3 carriers were randomly collected from the lab scale mbbr resulting in a surface area of 0 26 m2 the carriers were gently rinsed with deionized water to remove substrate residuals before being placed into the bulk medium in the batch reactor the medium was prepared so that it had the same composition as the synthetic wastewater fed into the mbbr excluding fss and nitrate nitrite and was deoxygenated via carefully purging n2 gas for 15 min the test started immediately after the rapid injection of fss and nitrate nitrite concentrated stock solutions which were freshly prepared to obtain the required initial batch test concentrations table 1 the initial ph of all tests was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 by adding hcl 1 m and naoh 1 m solutions to simulate the ph value in the full scale soad reactor wu et al 2016 which is midway between the optimal ph values of 7 and 8 for denitratation and denitritation respectively qian et al 2015 from each of the batch tests samples were taken at regular intervals and analyzed for ph fss sulfate ammonia nitrate and nitrite levels group a of the batch tests bt a investigated the effect of fss concentrations on the activities of sobfs in terms of sulfur oxidation and denitrification the concentration of fss generated in domestic wastewater via sulfate reduction generally falls in the range of 40 150 mg s l wu et al 2016 therefore the fss concentrations of 150 90 60 and 40 mg s l were tested in batch tests a1 a2 a3 and a4 respectively the initial nitrate concentration was maintained at 40 mg n l hence the s n mass ratios in the four tests were 3 8 2 3 1 5 and 1 0 g s g n respectively group b of the batch tests bt b focused on the effect of nitrate concentrations on the sobf kinetics the initial nitrate concentrations were 20 30 50 and 90 mg no3 n l in batch tests b1 b2 b3 and b4 respectively simulating the nitrate strength in domestic wastewater gilbert et al 2014 the initial fss concentration in bt b was always maintained at around 75 mg s l which is close to the average influent fss concentration 79 5 8 mg s l of the sulfur based denitrifying reactor monitored in a large scale plant with the involvement of soad process wu et al 2016 this yielded s n mass ratios in the same range of 0 8 3 8 g s g n nitrite can be produced as a nitrogen intermediate through partial nitrification and denitrification and its accumulation may cause free nitrous acid fna to build up which may lead to an inhibitory effect on the denitrification activity of sob in the soad process zhou et al 2007 therefore in group c of the batch tests bt c the effect of nitrite concentrations on the soad process was examined similar to bt b the initial concentrations of fss in the four bt c tests were all designed to be 75 mg s l whereas the initial concentrations of nitrite were 25 45 75 and 110 mg no2 n l to obtain the s n mass ratios 0 7 3 0 g s g n the major focus of this group of batch tests was on the fna impact on the sobf kinetics 2 3 chemical analysis the bulk liquid sample was filtered through 0 22 μm disposable millipore filters after filtration the fss level was immediately determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate and thiosulfate levels were analyzed on an ion chromatograph hic super 20a shimadzu nitrate and nitrite levels were determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method and colorimetric method respectively apha 2005 the level of ammonium was determined with a flow injection analyzer quikchem 8500 lachat instruments the attached biomass of two representative carriers taken from the parent reactor on day 300 was removed with a scalpel the detached biomass was dehydrated in a freeze dryer modulyo freeze dryer thermo usa prior to elemental analysis by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps physical electronic 5600 multi technique system 2 4 kinetic analysis the bio oxidation of fss can be described by a two step model as defined in eq 1 and eq 2 which represent the oxidative half reactions of h2s s0 and s0 so42 xu et al 2016 and the direct oxidation of fss to sulfate is defined in eq 3 the denitrification can be analyzed with two reduction half reactions of denitratation no3 no2 and denitritation no2 n2 as shown in eq 4 and eq 5 winkler et al 2015 direct reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas no3 n2 is defined in eq 6 electron donor reactions 1 1 4 h 2 s 1 4 h s 1 2 s 0 3 4 h e δ g m θ 26 68 k j m o l 2 1 6 s 0

to the sampling time h versus time h divided by the specific surface area m2 l all regression coefficients r2 exceeded 0 9 with p 0 05 the details are described in si 3 2 5 microscopic analysis the morphology of the hydrated biofilm matrix was examined in situ under an optical microscope olympus cx41 with a ccd camera on day 300 the biofilm samples were also analyzed by raman microscopy renishaw rm 3000 micro raman system to determine the chemical composition the measurements were made with a he ne laser 633 nm 25 mw for excitation the raman spectra from 2000 cm 1 to 100 cm 1 were recorded within an exposure time of 100 s after the measurement the biofilm matrix did not show any significant visible changes ivleva et al 2009 the biofilm thickness was determined by visualizing the longitudinal section of a cut slice by optical coherence tomography octg 900 thorlabs gmbh the mean thickness of the biofilm matrix l f 1 n i 1 n l f i was determined for each image where n is the number of thickness measurements and l f i is the biofilm thickness at location i piculell et al 2016 2 6 microbial community analysis the detached biomass obtained on day 300 was also collected for microbial community analysis the microbial community of the biomass was examined using high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the analytical procedure consisted of dna extraction pcr amplification pyrosequencing and data analysis the community structure analysis is described in si 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilms 3 1 1 operating performance of the lab scale mbbr the operating performance of the parent mbbr is summarized in table s1 the previous operation day 0 240 of the reactor has been described by cui et al 2018 in the present study the reactor was further operated and monitored from day 241 365 stage iiib during which a nitrogen removal efficiency of 95 4 was achieved at a nitrogen loading rate of 0 18 0 01 kg n m3 d with an hrt of 4 h moreover the cultivated sobfs maintained a stable biomass concentration 1 36 0 14 g l of attached volatile solids with the overall biomass specific and surface specific denitrification rates of approximately 0 12 0 01 g n g vss d and 0 57 0 07 g n m2 d respectively it should also be noted that the ratio of changed sulfate the end product of sulfur oxidation to reduced sulfur compounds i e δsulfate δsulfide δthiosulfate х 100 were felt in the range of 94 104 the result implies that nearly all the reduced sulfur compounds were completely converted to sulfate 3 1 2 biofilm property fig 1 a shows the surface structure of the biofilm matrix visualized by an optical microscope the biofilm showed a scraggly and uneven surface which was unexpected given that other moving bed biofilms performing nitrification hoang et al 2014 piculell et al 2016 and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox gilbert et al 2014 had a smooth and even surface moreover the biomass was extensively covered in a greyish complex with arborous and branched characteristics the observation of this complex was in agreement with the description of biogenic s0 klok et al 2012 raman microscopy was therefore applied to determine the chemical composition of the in situ biofilm matrix the raman spectra of the biomass and greyish complex are presented in figs 1c and d the raman signal of 1129 and 1063 cm 1 showed c o c c and c n stretching the spectrum of 1294 cm 1 signified a ch2 twist and the spectrum of 1439 cm 1 indicated a coo symmetry ivleva et al 2009 the results demonstrate the prevalence of biofilm specific biomass as in other biofilms ivleva et al 2009 however the raman spectra of the greyish complex were displayed at 474 214 and 153 cm 1 fig 1d which are assigned to elemental sulfur mcguire et al 2001 the elemental composition determined by xps also showed that the s mass accounted for 3 42 of the total biomass which was greater than those of sewage sludge 2 20 and other sulfide oxidizing cultures performing denitrification 1 40 2 31 fajardo et al 2012 yang et al 2016 the s0 accumulation in the biofilm structure legitimizes the speculation of s0 generation in previously investigated autotrophic denitrifying biofilm systems using sulfide okabe et al 2005 tang et al 2010 moreover s0 accumulation could also lead to excessive biofilm growth which increases the difficulty of mass transfer and slows down the entire denitrification process kostrytsia et al 2018 this finding indicates that s0 generation and accumulation could pose a consistent challenge to the sulfur utilizing biofilm reactor kostrytsia et al 2018 the biofilm thickness lf is a critical parameter in the kinetic evaluation of a biofilm system piculell et al 2016 in the present study the thickness of the biofilm was determined from images visualized by optical coherence tomography fig 1b the thickness was measured at 10 different locations and the average was calculated to be 162 28 μm this value is similar to the thickness of autotrophic nitrifying moving bed biofilms about 50 180 μm hoang et al 2014 as reported in the literature a thin biofilm 200 μm often has a much lower mass transfer resistance than a thicker biofilm 200 μm bishop 1997 hence the diffusive boundary layer would have had little negative effect on the substrate mass transfer of the sobfs examined which is strongly in favor of the zero order kinetics applied in the present batch tests 3 1 3 microbial community analysis the microbial community composition wase revealed through illumina miseqtm high throughput pyrosequencing analysis the results of the phylogenetic classification are presented in fig 1e the details of microbial community at phylum and class levels are shown in table s5 the phylum proteobacteria was particularly enriched as consistent with many other denitrifying biofilm systems the sob are all identified as proteobacteria zhang et al 2015 kostrytsia et al 2018 within proteobacteria the class with the maximum relative abundance was α proteobacteria 42 1 followed by γ proteobacteria 19 3 β proteobacteria 16 5 and ε proteobacteria 1 0 in our sobf communities the α proteobacteria paracoccus 10 0 widely reported as sulfur utilizing facultative denitrifiers shao et al 2010 was detected along with maribius 11 3 tropicibacter 4 1 rhodobacter 2 6 and oceanicola 2 2 all of which belong to the same family rhodobacteraceae ghosh and dam 2009 thiobacillus accounting for 9 3 is widely found in soad systems with the function of simultaneous sulfide and nitrogen removal as well as elemental sulfur recovery shao et al 2010 wang et al 2015 sedimenticola 8 3 thioalbus 7 6 and thiohalobacter 2 3 of γ proteobacteria have recently been detected in saltmarsh and marine sediments flood et al 2015 park et al 2011 they are all halo tolerant sob while being physiologically close to thiobacillus the sobfs in the present study was cultivated with saline synthetic mainstream wastewater and the salt content of the bulk liquid approx 4000 mg cl l could have induced the enrichment of the halo tolerant sob the sobfs bacterial community is phylogenetically diverse this observation is inconsistent with many bacterial consortia performing soad in which thiobacillus and sulfurimonas always dominate table 2 the bacterial diversity of the mbbr culture is proven to be higher than that in other forms of biofilm reactors e g biotrickling filters liu et al 2019 as the moving bed carriers could provide unique ecological niches for the growth of diverse sob the cultures with a high diversity might enhance and accelerate soad as they are more flexible and more resistant to dynamic environment than cultures with a lower diversity watsuntorn et al 2019 the influence of the bacterial diversity in sobfs on the soad performance is still under investigation and will be evaluated in a follow up experiment 3 2 effect of free and saline sulfide fss 3 2 1 sulfur transformation electron donor reaction batch tests a1 to a4 investigated the behavior of sobfs for various initial fss concentrations the measured concentrations of fss sulfate nitrate and nitrite are plotted against time in fig 2 and the ammonium concentration can be found in fig s4 in accordance with an et al 2010 and xu et al 2016 the sulfur transformation occurred in two steps oxidation of fss step 1 and oxidation of biologically produced elemental sulfur bps0 to sulfate step 2 hereafter this paper interprets all of the batch tests in terms of these two steps when fss was utilized by the sobfs as the electron donor the fss concentration fell to almost zero in 1 7 h at the increasing surface specific rates of 189 484 mg fss s m2 h in batch tests a1 to a4 fig 2 meanwhile the sulfate generation rates were very low at only 3 8 73 7 mg so4 2 s m2 h the sulfate generated in step 1 accounted for only 2 3 3 7 10 and 18 8 of the initial concentration of fss increased sulfate fss initial х 100 in a1 to a4 respectively this indicates that the functional sob tended to convert fss to bps0 instead of sulfate to maintain a constant electron flux which is in concordance with previous studies okabe et al 2005 moraes et al 2012 note that bps0 either accumulates on the surface of biofilms tang et al 2010 or is suspended in the bulk liquid xu et al 2015 therefore the level of bps0 was not experimentally measured in this study because i not enough biofilm carriers were available in the batch tests for sacrificial ex situ measurement and even if there were there is no method available for the in situ measurement of bps0 attached to biofilms and ii the fraction of bps0 on the biofilm surface and in the bulk liquid changes over time klok et al 2012 the concentrations of bps0 shown in figs 2 and 4 and fig 5 were determined by subtracting the concentration of total soluble sulfur compounds from the initial fss concentration i e bps0 fss initial fss thiosulfate sulfate according to the method reported by klok et al 2012 another common sulfur intermediate thiosulfate xu et al 2015 was present but always at negligible concentrations 5 mg s l fig s5 after depletion of the fss end of step 1 the sulfur intermediate bps0 was utilized as the main electron donor fig 2 in step 2 the specific sulfate generation rate increased as the initial fss concentration decreased i e the rate in a1 9 mg so4 2 s m2 h was lower than those in a2 27 mg so4 2 s m2 h and a3 39 mg so4 2 s m2 h table 3 due to the highest initial fss designated in a1 150 mg l this result indicates the consistently negative impact of fss on bioactivity even if the bulk liquid is free of fss however the rate in a4 22 mg so4 2 s m2 h was lower than those in a2 and a3 this could be explained by the fact that a4 was operated under electron deficient conditions with fss initial of 40 mg s l and s n ratio 1 g s g n which led to a low reaction rate as well these results suggest that 1 step 2 imposes a limit on the design of the sulfur oxidation process because the rate of bps0 oxidation is significantly lower than that of fss oxidation and 2 the maximum bps0 oxidation rate occurs under moderate initial fss concentrations 60 mg l of fssinitial in this study and a theoretical s n ratio of 1 5 g s g n fig 3 a show that the sobf specific fss oxidation rate decreased as the initial fss concentration increased from a4 to a1 clearly demonstrating the inhibitory effect on the soad kinetics the literature also documents controversial threshold concentrations of fss beyond which it inhibit soad process some researchers claim that fss is not inhibited until it reaches 300 600 mg s l cardoso et al 2006 an et al 2010 tang et al 2010 while others argue that it is inhibited even at the low levels of 15 22 mg s l mora et al 2015 qian et al 2015 for step 1 with fss the inhibition and its kinetic parameters were analyzed via aiba type and edwards type models with the regression coefficient r2 exceeding 0 99 as described in si 5 as shown in fig 3a the initial fss started having a negative impact on the bioactivity of sobfs from 40 mg s l onward the sobfs were fed saline synthetic mainstream wastewater containing only 48 mg fss s linfluent and were cultivated under completely mixed conditions in which the fss was undetectable in the bulk liquid as shown in table s1 therefore the growth environment did not favor a high level of fss the inhibition coefficient ki of fss oxidation in the sobf system in both models fell in the range of 76 86 mg s l which is close to 78 mg s l as reported in mora et al 2015 who examined the fss inhibition with the detached biomass from a fixed sulfur oxidizing biofilm in a desulfurization biotrickling filter in step 2 the inhibitory effect on sulfate generation with bps0 as the electron donor was also investigated by simulating the inhibition with a non competitive model as the fss level was close to zero in this step as shown in fig 3b the results confirm that the bps0 oxidation was also negatively affected by the fss concentration the obtained ki 15 28 mg s l is lower than the value from step 1 indicating that the bps0 oxidation was even more sensitive than the fss oxidation the nitrogen reduction was closely coupled to sulfur oxidation as verified in section 3 4 which means the inhibition of denitrification was consistent with that of sulfur oxidation and will not be discussed here the simulated kinetic parameters i e maximum conversion rate half saturation and inhibition coefficients which have been summarized in table s6 provide useful information in designing sob biofilm reactors and predicting possible inhibition on sobfs in order to maintain stable operation the fss inhibition could be attributed to the destruction of the functional enzymes by the undissociated h2s permeating the cell while metal sulfide precipitation from the reaction of h2s with metal cofactors e g cu2 ni essential for enzyme activation could also lead to inhibition tang et al 2009 the exact inhibition mechanism on sobfs is not entirely clear requiring more in depth investigations 3 2 2 autotrophic denitratation and denitritation electron acceptor reaction the associated nitrate and nitrite reductions in bt a fig 2 reveal that in step 1 nitrate was directly reduced to n2 gas according to eq 6 as nitrite was not detected in the bulk liquid however in step 2 when bps0 was used as the electron donor nitrite was obviously accumulated in all cases the denitratation and denitritation rates in step 2 were significantly lower than the denitrification rates determined in step 1 table 3 suggesting that both the bioactivities of nitrate and nitrite reduction decreased when electron donor was changed from fss to bps0 the results also indicate that the denitratation and denitritation reactions occurred simultaneously denitratation rate r n o 3 denitratation rate r n o 2 in step 1 and the denitritation process reacted more slowly than the denitratation process r n o 2 r n o 3 in step 2 leading to nitrite accumulation in the bulk liquid nitrite accumulation is always associated with fna amassment the fna concentrations were determined using the equation fna no2 n ka х 10ph in which ka equals e 2300 273 15 t for a given temperature oc zhou et al 2007 fna increased in proportion to nitrite accumulation in step 2 in all cases of bt a the maximum amounts of fna in a1 a2 and a3 were in the range of 0 03 0 70 μg n l all these values are below the inhibitory threshold 2 μg n l for denitrification zhou et al 2007 the maximal fna 2 82 μg n l appeared at the end of a4 indicating no impact on the denitrification and sulfur oxidation it should also be noted that the ammonium concentrations in all tests of bt a b and c were considered as nearly no changes indicating that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia was not likely to occur dolejs et al 2015 in sum two step kinetics for fss oxidation coupled with denitrification are described the results of bt a show that fss could lead to consistent inhibition of sob bioactivities a lower concentration of fss e g 40 mg s l in the influent is recommended if the maximum fss and nitrate conversion rates are preferred additionally bps0 oxidation is the rate limiting step for the so ad process or alternatively fss must be supplied in excess for simultaneous bps0 production and denitrification 3 3 effects of nitrate and nitrite the effect of nitrate on the so ad process was evaluated in bt b with the results shown in fig 4 bt b revealed the same two step behavior as that seen in bt a in step 1 of bt b the nitrate level dropped while fss was available and nitrite was minimally accumulated in the bulk liquid i e r n o 3 r n o 2 which is consistent with bt a in all cases nitrate kept converting into n2 gas when fss was used as the electron donor eq 6 regardless of the initial nitrate concentration according to bt b and the initial fss concentration according to bt a therefore instead of nitrate nitrite was putatively prioritized as the electron acceptor by sobfs when fss was used the maximum denitrification rate 100 mg n m2 h was found in bt b3 with a medium nitrate concentration of 50 mg n l fig 4c and the lowest reaction rate 54 mg n m2 h occurred under conditions of low nitrate loading b1 fig 4a in step 2 denitritation was r n o 2 18 22 mg n m2 h slower than denitratation r n o 3 26 50 mg n m2 h which contributed to the accumulation of nitrite up to 2 6 and 20 mg no2 n l in the bulk liquid in b1 b2 and b3 respectively at the time when the nitrate level was reduced to near zero fig 4 this finding implies that nitrite was less preferred than nitrate as the electron acceptor by sobfs when bps0 was used which is also in support of the finding of kostrytsia et al 2018 moreover in bt b4 nitrate was never completely consumed resulting in the maximum nitrite accumulation 36 mg n l in the bulk liquid fig 4d as a consequence the fna level reached 3 01 μg n l but only at the end of b4 the fna levels in the other cases were always negligible showing that fna had little negative impact on activities of bt b therefore it can be concluded that fna in bt a and bt b did not cause a negative impact on sobfs activity provided that the ph remained high fig s6 in bt b both nitrate and nitrite were reduced to minimum detectable concentrations within 7 9 h in b1 and b2 figs 4a and b when the s n mass ratios were 3 8 and 2 5 g s g n respectively in contrast a considerable amount of nitrite remained at the end of b3 and b4 with the s n ratios of 1 5 and 0 8 respectively figs 4c and d this means that s n ratios below 1 5 g s g n i e electron balanced conditions will be able to drive partial denitrification no3 no2 process in bt c the effect of nitrite on the sobf activity was evaluated with the results shown in fig 5 it is interesting to find that the denitritation rates step 1 in bt c are often higher than those in bt b the maximum fna levels in bt c occurred at the beginning of all tests with the values of 2 0 3 8 5 7 and 8 6 μg n l the denitritation rate in bt c4 was considerably lower than those in bt c2 and bt c3 which indicates that the denitritation could be hindered with a bioactivity reduction of 16 43 at the fna level of 8 6 μg n l this finding is in agreement with the inhibition simulations using both edwards type and aiba type models fig 3d showing ki 4 68 4 82 μg n l was slightly lower than the maximum fna level this result is also in line with the finding reported by qian et al 2016 in which an 81 decrease in denitritation activity was observed in a thiosulfate cultivated sulfur oxidizing bacterium when fna increased from 2 to 8 μg n l moreover the specific fss oxidation rates in bt c 326 426 mg s m2 h were close to those of bt b 332 402 mg s m2 h suggesting that fss oxidation was not significantly affected by nitrite or constrained by fna at the existing levels this was also verified by the result of inhibition simulations showing that the estimated inhibition coefficients 30 7 139 5 μg n l table s8 far exceeded the present maximum fna level 8 6 μg n l we can thus conclude that fna did not have any significant negative impact on the fss oxidation regardless of the electron acceptors however sulfate generation in step 1 completely ceased at the existing fna levels and the possible principle behind is discussed in section 3 5 in step 2 due to the oxidation of fss eq 1 fna rapidly decreased to a negligible level less than 0 5 μg n l within approximately 2 h along with the decrease in nitrite and the increase in ph value fig s6 therefore fna was not expected to inhibit either nitrite reduction or sulfur oxidation in this step the denitritation rates 8 22 mg n m2 h were also considerably decreased compared with the values 69 125 mg n m2 h obtained in step 1 table 3 which can be explained by the lower oxidative capacity of elemental sulfur 19 48 kj mol eq 2 than fss 26 68 kj mol eq 1 as the electron donor furthermore we found that the denitritation rates in step 2 were no longer higher than those in bt b which further demonstrates that denitritation is the rate limiting step for sobfs when bps0 is used as the electron donor in a nutshell denitrification including denitratation and denitritation can be influenced by the feeding nitrate or nitrite concentrations and inhibited by fna while fss oxidation cannot the obtained kinetics also reveal that sobfs prefer nitrite as the electron acceptor in the step 1 fss oxidation while sobfs prefer nitrate as electron acceptor in the step 2 bps0 oxidation these outcomes open the opportunity for designing and upgrading the biosystem based on the soad process 3 4 electron transfer and balance to consolidate the understanding of the biokinetics of sobfs the electron transfer and balance of all batch tests are conducted the electron transfer was assessed with a simplified denitrifying and sulfur oxidizing stoichiometry described by eqs 1 6 the electron acceptance capacities with respect to denitratation denitritation and denitrification were 2 3 and 5 mmol e 14 mg n respectively winkler et al 2015 similarly the electron donation capacities of fss to bps0 bps0 to so4 2 and fss to so4 2 were 2 6 and 8 mmol e 32 mg s respectively mora et al 2015 accordingly the specific rates of electron transfer including the electron donation from sulfur oxidation and electron acceptance by nitrogen reduction were calculated as i the specific electron acceptance rate mmol e m2 h the specific conversion rate of no3 to no2 mg n m2 h x 2 mmol e 14 mg n the specific conversion rate of no2 to n2 mg n m2 h x 3 mmol e 14 mg n the specific conversion rate of no3 to n2 mg n m2 h x 5 mmol e 14 mg n on the other hand ii the specific electron donation rate mmol e m2 h the specific conversion rate of fss to bps0 mg s m2 h x 2 mmol e 32 mg s the specific conversion rate of bps0 to so4 2 mg s m2 h x 6 mmol e 32 mg s the specific conversion rate of fss to so4 2 mg s m2 h x 8 mmol e 32 mg s the calculated results were shown in fig 6 we found the specific electron transfer rates in step 1 are two to ten times higher than those in step 2 this huge difference between the electron transfer rates in steps 1 and 2 reiterates the need to dualize the so ad process this two step concept can be applied in the optimization of processes such as those occurring in sequential reactors for achieving fss oxidation and bps0 oxidation separately as expected the electron donation rates were all slightly higher than the electron acceptance rates apart from those electrons used for catabolism the rest electrons are used for producing biomass in anabolism the yield coefficients derived from electron donation electron acceptance electron donation for the fss and bps0 oxidation are 0 049 0 136 g cod g cod yfss and 0 184 0 237 g cod g cod ybps respectively both of which fall in the reported ranges of 0 044 0 417 g cod g cod yfss and 0 108 0 390 g cod g cod ybps xu et al 2016 3 5 two sob groups in the moving bed biofilms from the perspective of molecular biology enzymatic sulfide oxidation can proceed via one of two distinct pathways the non alphaproteobacteria pathway and the alphaproteobacteria sox pathway shao et al 2010 the former is generally taken by thiobacillus dominated cultures in various types of soad biosystems wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 through the non alphaproteobacteria pathway two electrons are provided by sulfide to electron transport chain at the quinone level via the membrane bound sulfide quinone reductase sqr which is an essential flavoprotein for chemolithotrophic sob griesbeck et al 2000 the bps0 can be reductively activated and transported into the cytoplasm prior to further oxidation to sulfite and sulfate by other sulfur oxidizing enzymes ghosh and dam 2009 in this case biological sulfide oxidation occurs in two steps as illustrated in eq 1 and eq 2 in contrast sulfide and sulfur can also be oxidized through the α proteobacteria pathway governed by the conserved sox operon through which sulfide is directly converted into sulfate eq 3 without production of any sulfur intermediates as reviewed by ghosh and dam 2009 the sox enzyme system is the main sulfur oxidizing pathway of α proteobacteria e g paracoccus pantotrophus and p denitrificans watsuntorn et al 2019 these two physiologically diverse groups are tentatively classified as sobi and sobii from the results of bt a and bt b we found that sulfate was generated when fss was used in step 1 implying the existence of both alphaproteobacteria and non alphaproteobacteria pathways in the present study both sobi and sobii were enriched in this moving bed biofilm fig 1e which is in keeping with the kinetic results figs 2 and 4 moreover sulfate was not generated in step 1 in any cases of bt c indicating the absence of sobii bioactivity this outcome implies that sobii lack nitrite reductase and they were not metabolically active in bt c the speculated mechanism of soad in the present biosystem is summarized in fig 7 both sobi and sobii can use fss and bps0 as electron donor and nitrate as electron acceptor while the nitrite produced by sobii can be further incorporated and utilized by sobi a similar denitrification mechanism has also been proposed in a recent study for s0 driven denitrification chen et al 2018 however the competition for fss between the two sob groups has never been reported it is more valuable to the soad process for sobii to directly oxidize fss to sulfate 8 mol e transferred mol soxidized without going through the rate limiting bps0 oxidation process according to the results in fig 3a the ki of sobii 25 17 27 68 mg s l is far below that of sobi 71 04 84 71 mg s l table s7 indicating that sobii are more sensitive to fss than sobi this outcome suggests that a lower fss concentration in the influent would benefit sobii bioactivity and enhance the overall denitrification capacity to our best knowledge this study is the first to propose the existence of both competition and cooperation between two sob groups in the soad process based bioreactor this finding provides an alternative insight on soad biomass from the microbiological point of view and sheds light on the process optimization especially when dealing with biofilm reactors nevertheless the present experiment can only provide limited knowledge on the microbial characteristics of sobi and sobii further investigations are needed to flesh out the proposed mechanism and the sobii enrichment strategy 4 conclusions this paper presents an in depth study on sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification in a moving bed biofilm reactor for mainstream wastewater treatment with a focus on the determination of the biofilm properties and kinetics the main findings are summarized as follows 1 elemental sulfur accumulated on the surface of a thin sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilm with an average thickness of 160 μm this surface was dominated by highly diversified sob communities 2 the biofilm kinetics were well described by the two step sulfide oxidation concept the oxidation of sulfide and biologically produced sulfur denitrification processes and their interconnections were determined experimentally and stoichiometrically 3 a low sulfide concentration e g 40 mg s l is suggested to maintain a high treatment capacity for mainstream soad as sulfide consistently showed increasing inhibitory effects on the oxidation of sulfide s0 and denitrification 4 fna can inhibit denitritation at a concentration of 8 6 μg n l but it cannot inhibit the oxidation of sulfide s0 5 two physiologically diverse sob groups sobi and sobii are speculated with biological reaction experimental evidence and the mechanisms governing their competition and cooperation are proposed

18649,the sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification soad process offers a feasible alternative to mainstream heterotrophic denitrification in treating domestic sewage with insufficient organics previously soad has been successfully applied in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr however the biofilm properties and biokinetics are still not thoroughly understood the present study was therefore designed to investigate these features of sulfur oxidizing biofilms sobfs cultivated in a lab scale mbbr under stable operation for over a year the biofilms developed were 160 μm thick had an uneven and porous surface on which elemental sulfur s0 accumulated and the sob biomass was highly diverse the bioprocess kinetics were evaluated through 12 batch experiments the results were interpreted by adopting a two step sulfide oxidation model sulfide s0 and s0 sulfate with all specific rates having a linear regression coefficient of r2 0 9 moreover the inhibitory kinetic analysis revealed that 1 the maximum treatment capacity about 480 mg s m2 h and 80 mg n m2 h was observed at low sulfide level 40 mg s l while higher sulfide level 60 150 mg s l showed increasing inhibition on the oxidation of both sulfide and sulfur and denitrification 2 the denitritation activity decreased by up to 43 when free nitrous acid reached a maximum of 8 6 μg n l whereas the oxidation of sulfide and sulfur did not have any significant effect interestingly two physiologically diverse sob groups were found in this special biofilm the mechanisms of the cooperation and competition for electron donors and acceptors between these two sob clades are proposed the results of this study greatly enhance our understanding of the design and optimization of soad mbbr for mainstream nitrogen removal graphical

factors in biofilm studies persson et al 2014 piculell et al 2016 have yet to be thoroughly investigated for the moving bed biofilm system in the present study the morphology chemical and microbial compositions of soad process based moving bed biofilms taken from a long term 360 day operational system were characterized and the biokinetics were investigated with a focus on the effects of sulfide and nitrate nitrite concentrations through 12 batch experiments to the best of our knowledge this experiment is the first to report the biokinetics of an soad process based moving bed biofilm the outcomes improve the understanding of mainstream soad and shed light on the development of the corresponding biofilm reactors with respect to design criteria and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 sob biofilm cultivation the biofilms used in this study were taken from a 10 l tightly sealed lab scale mbbr as shown in fig s1 in supplementary information si 700 k3 carriers with a specific media surface of 500 m2 m3 carrier were filled into the reactor accounting for a filling degree of 60 and a surface area of 3 0 m2 gilbert et al 2014 a mechanical mixer provided mixing at 80 10 rpm with a g value of 17 s 1 in the reactor synthetic saline wastewater with composition as described in si 1 was fed into the reactor the influent ph value was kept at 7 5 0 3 the ambient temperature and dissolved oxygen do of the bulk liquid was kept at 22 1 c and 0 1 mg o2 l respectively the carriers were taken from the parent reactor on day 300 for characterizing the biofilm morphology and thickness using microscopes as described in section 2 5 the biomass from the biofilm was detached for elemental composition analysis as described in section 2 3 and microbial community analysis as described in section 2 6 2 2 batch tests three groups of batch tests were conducted with the sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilms sobfs cultivated and taken from the lab scale mbbr as shown in table 1 synthetic wastewater with free and saline sulfide fss and nitrate nitrite concentrations corresponding to various sulfur to nitrogen s n mass ratios was prepared for the tests the s n mass ratio mimicked a wide range of actual operating conditions with excessive sufficient balanced and deficient amounts of primary electron donors i e fss for complete denitrification the batch experimental system consisted of a glass batch reactor with a working volume of 2 4 l equipped with a ph meter for online monitoring fig s2 the reactor was sealed with a lid fitted with a rubber ring magnetic stirrers ensured thorough mixing at 160 10 rpm with a g value of 20 s 1 in the reactors all tests were performed in duplicate in parallel at the ambient temperature 22 1 c given that sampling may lead to pressure loss a gasbag filled with inert gas n2 was connected to the reactor to prevent oxygen ingress prior to each test 60 k3 carriers were randomly collected from the lab scale mbbr resulting in a surface area of 0 26 m2 the carriers were gently rinsed with deionized water to remove substrate residuals before being placed into the bulk medium in the batch reactor the medium was prepared so that it had the same composition as the synthetic wastewater fed into the mbbr excluding fss and nitrate nitrite and was deoxygenated via carefully purging n2 gas for 15 min the test started immediately after the rapid injection of fss and nitrate nitrite concentrated stock solutions which were freshly prepared to obtain the required initial batch test concentrations table 1 the initial ph of all tests was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 by adding hcl 1 m and naoh 1 m solutions to simulate the ph value in the full scale soad reactor wu et al 2016 which is midway between the optimal ph values of 7 and 8 for denitratation and denitritation respectively qian et al 2015 from each of the batch tests samples were taken at regular intervals and analyzed for ph fss sulfate ammonia nitrate and nitrite levels group a of the batch tests bt a investigated the effect of fss concentrations on the activities of sobfs in terms of sulfur oxidation and denitrification the concentration of fss generated in domestic wastewater via sulfate reduction generally falls in the range of 40 150 mg s l wu et al 2016 therefore the fss concentrations of 150 90 60 and 40 mg s l were tested in batch tests a1 a2 a3 and a4 respectively the initial nitrate concentration was maintained at 40 mg n l hence the s n mass ratios in the four tests were 3 8 2 3 1 5 and 1 0 g s g n respectively group b of the batch tests bt b focused on the effect of nitrate concentrations on the sobf kinetics the initial nitrate concentrations were 20 30 50 and 90 mg no3 n l in batch tests b1 b2 b3 and b4 respectively simulating the nitrate strength in domestic wastewater gilbert et al 2014 the initial fss concentration in bt b was always maintained at around 75 mg s l which is close to the average influent fss concentration 79 5 8 mg s l of the sulfur based denitrifying reactor monitored in a large scale plant with the involvement of soad process wu et al 2016 this yielded s n mass ratios in the same range of 0 8 3 8 g s g n nitrite can be produced as a nitrogen intermediate through partial nitrification and denitrification and its accumulation may cause free nitrous acid fna to build up which may lead to an inhibitory effect on the denitrification activity of sob in the soad process zhou et al 2007 therefore in group c of the batch tests bt c the effect of nitrite concentrations on the soad process was examined similar to bt b the initial concentrations of fss in the four bt c tests were all designed to be 75 mg s l whereas the initial concentrations of nitrite were 25 45 75 and 110 mg no2 n l to obtain the s n mass ratios 0 7 3 0 g s g n the major focus of this group of batch tests was on the fna impact on the sobf kinetics 2 3 chemical analysis the bulk liquid sample was filtered through 0 22 μm disposable millipore filters after filtration the fss level was immediately determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate and thiosulfate levels were analyzed on an ion chromatograph hic super 20a shimadzu nitrate and nitrite levels were determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method and colorimetric method respectively apha 2005 the level of ammonium was determined with a flow injection analyzer quikchem 8500 lachat instruments the attached biomass of two representative carriers taken from the parent reactor on day 300 was removed with a scalpel the detached biomass was dehydrated in a freeze dryer modulyo freeze dryer thermo usa prior to elemental analysis by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps physical electronic 5600 multi technique system 2 4 kinetic analysis the bio oxidation of fss can be described by a two step model as defined in eq 1 and eq 2 which represent the oxidative half reactions of h2s s0 and s0 so42 xu et al 2016 and the direct oxidation of fss to sulfate is defined in eq 3 the denitrification can be analyzed with two reduction half reactions of denitratation no3 no2 and denitritation no2 n2 as shown in eq 4 and eq 5 winkler et al 2015 direct reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas no3 n2 is defined in eq 6 electron donor reactions 1 1 4 h 2 s 1 4 h s 1 2 s 0 3 4 h e δ g m θ 26 68 k j m o l 2 1 6 s 0

to the sampling time h versus time h divided by the specific surface area m2 l all regression coefficients r2 exceeded 0 9 with p 0 05 the details are described in si 3 2 5 microscopic analysis the morphology of the hydrated biofilm matrix was examined in situ under an optical microscope olympus cx41 with a ccd camera on day 300 the biofilm samples were also analyzed by raman microscopy renishaw rm 3000 micro raman system to determine the chemical composition the measurements were made with a he ne laser 633 nm 25 mw for excitation the raman spectra from 2000 cm 1 to 100 cm 1 were recorded within an exposure time of 100 s after the measurement the biofilm matrix did not show any significant visible changes ivleva et al 2009 the biofilm thickness was determined by visualizing the longitudinal section of a cut slice by optical coherence tomography octg 900 thorlabs gmbh the mean thickness of the biofilm matrix l f 1 n i 1 n l f i was determined for each image where n is the number of thickness measurements and l f i is the biofilm thickness at location i piculell et al 2016 2 6 microbial community analysis the detached biomass obtained on day 300 was also collected for microbial community analysis the microbial community of the biomass was examined using high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene the analytical procedure consisted of dna extraction pcr amplification pyrosequencing and data analysis the community structure analysis is described in si 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilms 3 1 1 operating performance of the lab scale mbbr the operating performance of the parent mbbr is summarized in table s1 the previous operation day 0 240 of the reactor has been described by cui et al 2018 in the present study the reactor was further operated and monitored from day 241 365 stage iiib during which a nitrogen removal efficiency of 95 4 was achieved at a nitrogen loading rate of 0 18 0 01 kg n m3 d with an hrt of 4 h moreover the cultivated sobfs maintained a stable biomass concentration 1 36 0 14 g l of attached volatile solids with the overall biomass specific and surface specific denitrification rates of approximately 0 12 0 01 g n g vss d and 0 57 0 07 g n m2 d respectively it should also be noted that the ratio of changed sulfate the end product of sulfur oxidation to reduced sulfur compounds i e δsulfate δsulfide δthiosulfate х 100 were felt in the range of 94 104 the result implies that nearly all the reduced sulfur compounds were completely converted to sulfate 3 1 2 biofilm property fig 1 a shows the surface structure of the biofilm matrix visualized by an optical microscope the biofilm showed a scraggly and uneven surface which was unexpected given that other moving bed biofilms performing nitrification hoang et al 2014 piculell et al 2016 and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox gilbert et al 2014 had a smooth and even surface moreover the biomass was extensively covered in a greyish complex with arborous and branched characteristics the observation of this complex was in agreement with the description of biogenic s0 klok et al 2012 raman microscopy was therefore applied to determine the chemical composition of the in situ biofilm matrix the raman spectra of the biomass and greyish complex are presented in figs 1c and d the raman signal of 1129 and 1063 cm 1 showed c o c c and c n stretching the spectrum of 1294 cm 1 signified a ch2 twist and the spectrum of 1439 cm 1 indicated a coo symmetry ivleva et al 2009 the results demonstrate the prevalence of biofilm specific biomass as in other biofilms ivleva et al 2009 however the raman spectra of the greyish complex were displayed at 474 214 and 153 cm 1 fig 1d which are assigned to elemental sulfur mcguire et al 2001 the elemental composition determined by xps also showed that the s mass accounted for 3 42 of the total biomass which was greater than those of sewage sludge 2 20 and other sulfide oxidizing cultures performing denitrification 1 40 2 31 fajardo et al 2012 yang et al 2016 the s0 accumulation in the biofilm structure legitimizes the speculation of s0 generation in previously investigated autotrophic denitrifying biofilm systems using sulfide okabe et al 2005 tang et al 2010 moreover s0 accumulation could also lead to excessive biofilm growth which increases the difficulty of mass transfer and slows down the entire denitrification process kostrytsia et al 2018 this finding indicates that s0 generation and accumulation could pose a consistent challenge to the sulfur utilizing biofilm reactor kostrytsia et al 2018 the biofilm thickness lf is a critical parameter in the kinetic evaluation of a biofilm system piculell et al 2016 in the present study the thickness of the biofilm was determined from images visualized by optical coherence tomography fig 1b the thickness was measured at 10 different locations and the average was calculated to be 162 28 μm this value is similar to the thickness of autotrophic nitrifying moving bed biofilms about 50 180 μm hoang et al 2014 as reported in the literature a thin biofilm 200 μm often has a much lower mass transfer resistance than a thicker biofilm 200 μm bishop 1997 hence the diffusive boundary layer would have had little negative effect on the substrate mass transfer of the sobfs examined which is strongly in favor of the zero order kinetics applied in the present batch tests 3 1 3 microbial community analysis the microbial community composition wase revealed through illumina miseqtm high throughput pyrosequencing analysis the results of the phylogenetic classification are presented in fig 1e the details of microbial community at phylum and class levels are shown in table s5 the phylum proteobacteria was particularly enriched as consistent with many other denitrifying biofilm systems the sob are all identified as proteobacteria zhang et al 2015 kostrytsia et al 2018 within proteobacteria the class with the maximum relative abundance was α proteobacteria 42 1 followed by γ proteobacteria 19 3 β proteobacteria 16 5 and ε proteobacteria 1 0 in our sobf communities the α proteobacteria paracoccus 10 0 widely reported as sulfur utilizing facultative denitrifiers shao et al 2010 was detected along with maribius 11 3 tropicibacter 4 1 rhodobacter 2 6 and oceanicola 2 2 all of which belong to the same family rhodobacteraceae ghosh and dam 2009 thiobacillus accounting for 9 3 is widely found in soad systems with the function of simultaneous sulfide and nitrogen removal as well as elemental sulfur recovery shao et al 2010 wang et al 2015 sedimenticola 8 3 thioalbus 7 6 and thiohalobacter 2 3 of γ proteobacteria have recently been detected in saltmarsh and marine sediments flood et al 2015 park et al 2011 they are all halo tolerant sob while being physiologically close to thiobacillus the sobfs in the present study was cultivated with saline synthetic mainstream wastewater and the salt content of the bulk liquid approx 4000 mg cl l could have induced the enrichment of the halo tolerant sob the sobfs bacterial community is phylogenetically diverse this observation is inconsistent with many bacterial consortia performing soad in which thiobacillus and sulfurimonas always dominate table 2 the bacterial diversity of the mbbr culture is proven to be higher than that in other forms of biofilm reactors e g biotrickling filters liu et al 2019 as the moving bed carriers could provide unique ecological niches for the growth of diverse sob the cultures with a high diversity might enhance and accelerate soad as they are more flexible and more resistant to dynamic environment than cultures with a lower diversity watsuntorn et al 2019 the influence of the bacterial diversity in sobfs on the soad performance is still under investigation and will be evaluated in a follow up experiment 3 2 effect of free and saline sulfide fss 3 2 1 sulfur transformation electron donor reaction batch tests a1 to a4 investigated the behavior of sobfs for various initial fss concentrations the measured concentrations of fss sulfate nitrate and nitrite are plotted against time in fig 2 and the ammonium concentration can be found in fig s4 in accordance with an et al 2010 and xu et al 2016 the sulfur transformation occurred in two steps oxidation of fss step 1 and oxidation of biologically produced elemental sulfur bps0 to sulfate step 2 hereafter this paper interprets all of the batch tests in terms of these two steps when fss was utilized by the sobfs as the electron donor the fss concentration fell to almost zero in 1 7 h at the increasing surface specific rates of 189 484 mg fss s m2 h in batch tests a1 to a4 fig 2 meanwhile the sulfate generation rates were very low at only 3 8 73 7 mg so4 2 s m2 h the sulfate generated in step 1 accounted for only 2 3 3 7 10 and 18 8 of the initial concentration of fss increased sulfate fss initial х 100 in a1 to a4 respectively this indicates that the functional sob tended to convert fss to bps0 instead of sulfate to maintain a constant electron flux which is in concordance with previous studies okabe et al 2005 moraes et al 2012 note that bps0 either accumulates on the surface of biofilms tang et al 2010 or is suspended in the bulk liquid xu et al 2015 therefore the level of bps0 was not experimentally measured in this study because i not enough biofilm carriers were available in the batch tests for sacrificial ex situ measurement and even if there were there is no method available for the in situ measurement of bps0 attached to biofilms and ii the fraction of bps0 on the biofilm surface and in the bulk liquid changes over time klok et al 2012 the concentrations of bps0 shown in figs 2 and 4 and fig 5 were determined by subtracting the concentration of total soluble sulfur compounds from the initial fss concentration i e bps0 fss initial fss thiosulfate sulfate according to the method reported by klok et al 2012 another common sulfur intermediate thiosulfate xu et al 2015 was present but always at negligible concentrations 5 mg s l fig s5 after depletion of the fss end of step 1 the sulfur intermediate bps0 was utilized as the main electron donor fig 2 in step 2 the specific sulfate generation rate increased as the initial fss concentration decreased i e the rate in a1 9 mg so4 2 s m2 h was lower than those in a2 27 mg so4 2 s m2 h and a3 39 mg so4 2 s m2 h table 3 due to the highest initial fss designated in a1 150 mg l this result indicates the consistently negative impact of fss on bioactivity even if the bulk liquid is free of fss however the rate in a4 22 mg so4 2 s m2 h was lower than those in a2 and a3 this could be explained by the fact that a4 was operated under electron deficient conditions with fss initial of 40 mg s l and s n ratio 1 g s g n which led to a low reaction rate as well these results suggest that 1 step 2 imposes a limit on the design of the sulfur oxidation process because the rate of bps0 oxidation is significantly lower than that of fss oxidation and 2 the maximum bps0 oxidation rate occurs under moderate initial fss concentrations 60 mg l of fssinitial in this study and a theoretical s n ratio of 1 5 g s g n fig 3 a show that the sobf specific fss oxidation rate decreased as the initial fss concentration increased from a4 to a1 clearly demonstrating the inhibitory effect on the soad kinetics the literature also documents controversial threshold concentrations of fss beyond which it inhibit soad process some researchers claim that fss is not inhibited until it reaches 300 600 mg s l cardoso et al 2006 an et al 2010 tang et al 2010 while others argue that it is inhibited even at the low levels of 15 22 mg s l mora et al 2015 qian et al 2015 for step 1 with fss the inhibition and its kinetic parameters were analyzed via aiba type and edwards type models with the regression coefficient r2 exceeding 0 99 as described in si 5 as shown in fig 3a the initial fss started having a negative impact on the bioactivity of sobfs from 40 mg s l onward the sobfs were fed saline synthetic mainstream wastewater containing only 48 mg fss s linfluent and were cultivated under completely mixed conditions in which the fss was undetectable in the bulk liquid as shown in table s1 therefore the growth environment did not favor a high level of fss the inhibition coefficient ki of fss oxidation in the sobf system in both models fell in the range of 76 86 mg s l which is close to 78 mg s l as reported in mora et al 2015 who examined the fss inhibition with the detached biomass from a fixed sulfur oxidizing biofilm in a desulfurization biotrickling filter in step 2 the inhibitory effect on sulfate generation with bps0 as the electron donor was also investigated by simulating the inhibition with a non competitive model as the fss level was close to zero in this step as shown in fig 3b the results confirm that the bps0 oxidation was also negatively affected by the fss concentration the obtained ki 15 28 mg s l is lower than the value from step 1 indicating that the bps0 oxidation was even more sensitive than the fss oxidation the nitrogen reduction was closely coupled to sulfur oxidation as verified in section 3 4 which means the inhibition of denitrification was consistent with that of sulfur oxidation and will not be discussed here the simulated kinetic parameters i e maximum conversion rate half saturation and inhibition coefficients which have been summarized in table s6 provide useful information in designing sob biofilm reactors and predicting possible inhibition on sobfs in order to maintain stable operation the fss inhibition could be attributed to the destruction of the functional enzymes by the undissociated h2s permeating the cell while metal sulfide precipitation from the reaction of h2s with metal cofactors e g cu2 ni essential for enzyme activation could also lead to inhibition tang et al 2009 the exact inhibition mechanism on sobfs is not entirely clear requiring more in depth investigations 3 2 2 autotrophic denitratation and denitritation electron acceptor reaction the associated nitrate and nitrite reductions in bt a fig 2 reveal that in step 1 nitrate was directly reduced to n2 gas according to eq 6 as nitrite was not detected in the bulk liquid however in step 2 when bps0 was used as the electron donor nitrite was obviously accumulated in all cases the denitratation and denitritation rates in step 2 were significantly lower than the denitrification rates determined in step 1 table 3 suggesting that both the bioactivities of nitrate and nitrite reduction decreased when electron donor was changed from fss to bps0 the results also indicate that the denitratation and denitritation reactions occurred simultaneously denitratation rate r n o 3 denitratation rate r n o 2 in step 1 and the denitritation process reacted more slowly than the denitratation process r n o 2 r n o 3 in step 2 leading to nitrite accumulation in the bulk liquid nitrite accumulation is always associated with fna amassment the fna concentrations were determined using the equation fna no2 n ka х 10ph in which ka equals e 2300 273 15 t for a given temperature oc zhou et al 2007 fna increased in proportion to nitrite accumulation in step 2 in all cases of bt a the maximum amounts of fna in a1 a2 and a3 were in the range of 0 03 0 70 μg n l all these values are below the inhibitory threshold 2 μg n l for denitrification zhou et al 2007 the maximal fna 2 82 μg n l appeared at the end of a4 indicating no impact on the denitrification and sulfur oxidation it should also be noted that the ammonium concentrations in all tests of bt a b and c were considered as nearly no changes indicating that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia was not likely to occur dolejs et al 2015 in sum two step kinetics for fss oxidation coupled with denitrification are described the results of bt a show that fss could lead to consistent inhibition of sob bioactivities a lower concentration of fss e g 40 mg s l in the influent is recommended if the maximum fss and nitrate conversion rates are preferred additionally bps0 oxidation is the rate limiting step for the so ad process or alternatively fss must be supplied in excess for simultaneous bps0 production and denitrification 3 3 effects of nitrate and nitrite the effect of nitrate on the so ad process was evaluated in bt b with the results shown in fig 4 bt b revealed the same two step behavior as that seen in bt a in step 1 of bt b the nitrate level dropped while fss was available and nitrite was minimally accumulated in the bulk liquid i e r n o 3 r n o 2 which is consistent with bt a in all cases nitrate kept converting into n2 gas when fss was used as the electron donor eq 6 regardless of the initial nitrate concentration according to bt b and the initial fss concentration according to bt a therefore instead of nitrate nitrite was putatively prioritized as the electron acceptor by sobfs when fss was used the maximum denitrification rate 100 mg n m2 h was found in bt b3 with a medium nitrate concentration of 50 mg n l fig 4c and the lowest reaction rate 54 mg n m2 h occurred under conditions of low nitrate loading b1 fig 4a in step 2 denitritation was r n o 2 18 22 mg n m2 h slower than denitratation r n o 3 26 50 mg n m2 h which contributed to the accumulation of nitrite up to 2 6 and 20 mg no2 n l in the bulk liquid in b1 b2 and b3 respectively at the time when the nitrate level was reduced to near zero fig 4 this finding implies that nitrite was less preferred than nitrate as the electron acceptor by sobfs when bps0 was used which is also in support of the finding of kostrytsia et al 2018 moreover in bt b4 nitrate was never completely consumed resulting in the maximum nitrite accumulation 36 mg n l in the bulk liquid fig 4d as a consequence the fna level reached 3 01 μg n l but only at the end of b4 the fna levels in the other cases were always negligible showing that fna had little negative impact on activities of bt b therefore it can be concluded that fna in bt a and bt b did not cause a negative impact on sobfs activity provided that the ph remained high fig s6 in bt b both nitrate and nitrite were reduced to minimum detectable concentrations within 7 9 h in b1 and b2 figs 4a and b when the s n mass ratios were 3 8 and 2 5 g s g n respectively in contrast a considerable amount of nitrite remained at the end of b3 and b4 with the s n ratios of 1 5 and 0 8 respectively figs 4c and d this means that s n ratios below 1 5 g s g n i e electron balanced conditions will be able to drive partial denitrification no3 no2 process in bt c the effect of nitrite on the sobf activity was evaluated with the results shown in fig 5 it is interesting to find that the denitritation rates step 1 in bt c are often higher than those in bt b the maximum fna levels in bt c occurred at the beginning of all tests with the values of 2 0 3 8 5 7 and 8 6 μg n l the denitritation rate in bt c4 was considerably lower than those in bt c2 and bt c3 which indicates that the denitritation could be hindered with a bioactivity reduction of 16 43 at the fna level of 8 6 μg n l this finding is in agreement with the inhibition simulations using both edwards type and aiba type models fig 3d showing ki 4 68 4 82 μg n l was slightly lower than the maximum fna level this result is also in line with the finding reported by qian et al 2016 in which an 81 decrease in denitritation activity was observed in a thiosulfate cultivated sulfur oxidizing bacterium when fna increased from 2 to 8 μg n l moreover the specific fss oxidation rates in bt c 326 426 mg s m2 h were close to those of bt b 332 402 mg s m2 h suggesting that fss oxidation was not significantly affected by nitrite or constrained by fna at the existing levels this was also verified by the result of inhibition simulations showing that the estimated inhibition coefficients 30 7 139 5 μg n l table s8 far exceeded the present maximum fna level 8 6 μg n l we can thus conclude that fna did not have any significant negative impact on the fss oxidation regardless of the electron acceptors however sulfate generation in step 1 completely ceased at the existing fna levels and the possible principle behind is discussed in section 3 5 in step 2 due to the oxidation of fss eq 1 fna rapidly decreased to a negligible level less than 0 5 μg n l within approximately 2 h along with the decrease in nitrite and the increase in ph value fig s6 therefore fna was not expected to inhibit either nitrite reduction or sulfur oxidation in this step the denitritation rates 8 22 mg n m2 h were also considerably decreased compared with the values 69 125 mg n m2 h obtained in step 1 table 3 which can be explained by the lower oxidative capacity of elemental sulfur 19 48 kj mol eq 2 than fss 26 68 kj mol eq 1 as the electron donor furthermore we found that the denitritation rates in step 2 were no longer higher than those in bt b which further demonstrates that denitritation is the rate limiting step for sobfs when bps0 is used as the electron donor in a nutshell denitrification including denitratation and denitritation can be influenced by the feeding nitrate or nitrite concentrations and inhibited by fna while fss oxidation cannot the obtained kinetics also reveal that sobfs prefer nitrite as the electron acceptor in the step 1 fss oxidation while sobfs prefer nitrate as electron acceptor in the step 2 bps0 oxidation these outcomes open the opportunity for designing and upgrading the biosystem based on the soad process 3 4 electron transfer and balance to consolidate the understanding of the biokinetics of sobfs the electron transfer and balance of all batch tests are conducted the electron transfer was assessed with a simplified denitrifying and sulfur oxidizing stoichiometry described by eqs 1 6 the electron acceptance capacities with respect to denitratation denitritation and denitrification were 2 3 and 5 mmol e 14 mg n respectively winkler et al 2015 similarly the electron donation capacities of fss to bps0 bps0 to so4 2 and fss to so4 2 were 2 6 and 8 mmol e 32 mg s respectively mora et al 2015 accordingly the specific rates of electron transfer including the electron donation from sulfur oxidation and electron acceptance by nitrogen reduction were calculated as i the specific electron acceptance rate mmol e m2 h the specific conversion rate of no3 to no2 mg n m2 h x 2 mmol e 14 mg n the specific conversion rate of no2 to n2 mg n m2 h x 3 mmol e 14 mg n the specific conversion rate of no3 to n2 mg n m2 h x 5 mmol e 14 mg n on the other hand ii the specific electron donation rate mmol e m2 h the specific conversion rate of fss to bps0 mg s m2 h x 2 mmol e 32 mg s the specific conversion rate of bps0 to so4 2 mg s m2 h x 6 mmol e 32 mg s the specific conversion rate of fss to so4 2 mg s m2 h x 8 mmol e 32 mg s the calculated results were shown in fig 6 we found the specific electron transfer rates in step 1 are two to ten times higher than those in step 2 this huge difference between the electron transfer rates in steps 1 and 2 reiterates the need to dualize the so ad process this two step concept can be applied in the optimization of processes such as those occurring in sequential reactors for achieving fss oxidation and bps0 oxidation separately as expected the electron donation rates were all slightly higher than the electron acceptance rates apart from those electrons used for catabolism the rest electrons are used for producing biomass in anabolism the yield coefficients derived from electron donation electron acceptance electron donation for the fss and bps0 oxidation are 0 049 0 136 g cod g cod yfss and 0 184 0 237 g cod g cod ybps respectively both of which fall in the reported ranges of 0 044 0 417 g cod g cod yfss and 0 108 0 390 g cod g cod ybps xu et al 2016 3 5 two sob groups in the moving bed biofilms from the perspective of molecular biology enzymatic sulfide oxidation can proceed via one of two distinct pathways the non alphaproteobacteria pathway and the alphaproteobacteria sox pathway shao et al 2010 the former is generally taken by thiobacillus dominated cultures in various types of soad biosystems wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 through the non alphaproteobacteria pathway two electrons are provided by sulfide to electron transport chain at the quinone level via the membrane bound sulfide quinone reductase sqr which is an essential flavoprotein for chemolithotrophic sob griesbeck et al 2000 the bps0 can be reductively activated and transported into the cytoplasm prior to further oxidation to sulfite and sulfate by other sulfur oxidizing enzymes ghosh and dam 2009 in this case biological sulfide oxidation occurs in two steps as illustrated in eq 1 and eq 2 in contrast sulfide and sulfur can also be oxidized through the α proteobacteria pathway governed by the conserved sox operon through which sulfide is directly converted into sulfate eq 3 without production of any sulfur intermediates as reviewed by ghosh and dam 2009 the sox enzyme system is the main sulfur oxidizing pathway of α proteobacteria e g paracoccus pantotrophus and p denitrificans watsuntorn et al 2019 these two physiologically diverse groups are tentatively classified as sobi and sobii from the results of bt a and bt b we found that sulfate was generated when fss was used in step 1 implying the existence of both alphaproteobacteria and non alphaproteobacteria pathways in the present study both sobi and sobii were enriched in this moving bed biofilm fig 1e which is in keeping with the kinetic results figs 2 and 4 moreover sulfate was not generated in step 1 in any cases of bt c indicating the absence of sobii bioactivity this outcome implies that sobii lack nitrite reductase and they were not metabolically active in bt c the speculated mechanism of soad in the present biosystem is summarized in fig 7 both sobi and sobii can use fss and bps0 as electron donor and nitrate as electron acceptor while the nitrite produced by sobii can be further incorporated and utilized by sobi a similar denitrification mechanism has also been proposed in a recent study for s0 driven denitrification chen et al 2018 however the competition for fss between the two sob groups has never been reported it is more valuable to the soad process for sobii to directly oxidize fss to sulfate 8 mol e transferred mol soxidized without going through the rate limiting bps0 oxidation process according to the results in fig 3a the ki of sobii 25 17 27 68 mg s l is far below that of sobi 71 04 84 71 mg s l table s7 indicating that sobii are more sensitive to fss than sobi this outcome suggests that a lower fss concentration in the influent would benefit sobii bioactivity and enhance the overall denitrification capacity to our best knowledge this study is the first to propose the existence of both competition and cooperation between two sob groups in the soad process based bioreactor this finding provides an alternative insight on soad biomass from the microbiological point of view and sheds light on the process optimization especially when dealing with biofilm reactors nevertheless the present experiment can only provide limited knowledge on the microbial characteristics of sobi and sobii further investigations are needed to flesh out the proposed mechanism and the sobii enrichment strategy 4 conclusions this paper presents an in depth study on sulfide oxidizing autotrophic denitrification in a moving bed biofilm reactor for mainstream wastewater treatment with a focus on the determination of the biofilm properties and kinetics the main findings are summarized as follows 1 elemental sulfur accumulated on the surface of a thin sulfur oxidizing moving bed biofilm with an average thickness of 160 μm this surface was dominated by highly diversified sob communities 2 the biofilm kinetics were well described by the two step sulfide oxidation concept the oxidation of sulfide and biologically produced sulfur denitrification processes and their interconnections were determined experimentally and stoichiometrically 3 a low sulfide concentration e g 40 mg s l is suggested to maintain a high treatment capacity for mainstream soad as sulfide consistently showed increasing inhibitory effects on the oxidation of sulfide s0 and denitrification 4 fna can inhibit denitritation at a concentration of 8 6 μg n l but it cannot inhibit the oxidation of sulfide s0 5 two physiologically diverse sob groups sobi and sobii are speculated with biological reaction experimental evidence and the mechanisms governing their competition and cooperation are proposed
