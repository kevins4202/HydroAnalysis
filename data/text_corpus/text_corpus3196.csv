study fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was applied to diagnose the aom diversity after algae removal by plasma oxidation and to recognize the macromolecular dbps in subsequent chlorination significant removal of aom released by m aeruginosa c raciborskii and a spiroies was achieved by plasma oxidation accompanied by decrease in the proportion of chno formulas and increase in cho formulas without plasma treatment chlorination generated approximately 2486 macromolecular carbonaceous dbps c dbps and 1984 nitrogenous dbps n dbps with c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx as the most abundant dbps the numbers of c dbps and n dbps decreased by 63 3 and 62 9 respectively if plasma treatment was applied prior to chlorination network computational analysis revealed that cl substitution was the main formation pathway of aom derived dbp formation rather than hocl addition the precursors of macromolecular dbps contained a characteristic atomic number of c

cancer diana et al 2019 liu et al 2020b compared to natural organic matter nom aom usually contains many organic nitrogen atoms which may consume chlorine to form organic chloramines in the chlorination process consequently the generation of organic chloramines leads to an overestimation of the effective chlorine during disinfection sheng et al 2021 removing aom from water before chlorination is an effective strategy to suppress dbps formation potential wang et al 2021 discharge plasma as an advanced oxidation technique has been widely applied in pollution control due to its strong oxidation capacity and environmental friendliness liu et al 2022 sun et al 2019 nisol et al 2019 previous studies proved that plasma oxidation successfully destroyed the structure and elemental composition of aom li et al 2021 one of our previous studies demonstrated that plasma oxidation realized rapid inactivation of cyanobacteria cells effective removal of cyanobacteria toxins and aom simultaneously leading to significant inhibition in traditional dbps formation wang et al 2021 in these previous studies aom properties were generally characterized using total organic carbon ultraviolet visible spectrum and three dimensional fluorescence spectrum 3d eem combined with parallel factor analysis eem parafac these spectral analytical techniques are unable to characterize the detailed elemental composition and structural characteristics of aom at the molecular level li et al 2017 tsai et al 2019 hua et al 2019 however aom is very complex with diverse molecular structures the lack of related information hinders the comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms for the dbps formation potentials during the chlorination process electrospray ionization coupled fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry technique which can identify and determine the unique molecular formulas of complex compounds roebuck et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 sun et al 2020 recently ft icr ms has been used to decipher the chemical characteristics of nom of different matrices at the molecular level reemtsma et al 2008 yuan et al 2017 bahureksa et al 2021 gao et al 2021 unknown macromolecular chlorine containing dbps derived from nom in drinking water were also identified by ft icr ms herzsprung et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2017a different from nom aom is characterized by high hydrophilicity abundant amino acids and proteins and high organic nitrogen contents fang et al 2010 gonsior et al 2019 dong et al 2021 particularly the chemical structures of aom are diverse because there are many different kinds of algae in natural water rousso et al 2020 thus it is presumed that dbps derived from aom are different from those derived from nom and there is a great opportunity for many macromolecular dbps defined as carbon atomic number 6 to be discovered to date there is still a knowledge gap regarding the correlations between aom chemical diversity and chlorinated macromolecular dbps formation in this study the molecular diversity of aom and chlorinated macromolecular dbps formation were investigated after algae laden water treatment by plasma oxidation firstly inactivation performances and aom degradation of three different cyanobacteria m aeruginosa c raciborskii and a spiroies and traditional dbps formation potentials were evaluated in the plasma process secondly the molecular diversity of aom with without plasma and chlorination treatment were diagnosed using ft icr ms finally the formation and numbers of macromolecular dbps were identified and links between macromolecular dbps and corresponding precursors during chlorination were visualized by network computational analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials microcystina aeruginosa m aeruginosa fachb 905 cylindrospermopsis racibprskii c raciborskii fachb 1503 and anabaena spiroies a spiroies fachb 709 were

the amount of chlorine naclo added in the dbps formation experiment was referred to a previous study bernat quesada et al 2020 when the dosage was set at 10 mg l 1 there was still residual chlorine after 24 h of reaction the mixture was placed in an incubator at 25 c in the dark wang et al 2021 after 24 h of incubation ascorbic acid was added to quench the residual oxidant and dbps were analyzed by gas chromatography nexis gc 2030 shimadu japan with an electron capture assay gc ecd fang et al 2010 the analytical procedures for trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans halogenated ketone hks and haloacetic acids haas are described in text s4 the cytotoxicity tests of the plasma treated algae laden water were performed using hepg2 cells based on a previous method hu et al 2018 as described in text s5 2 5 ft icr ms analysis before mass spectrometry analysis an established solid phase extraction spe procedure was used for desalting using the proprietary polymer agilent bond elut ppl resin gonsior et al 2019 as described in text s6 spe aom was obtained through this procedure the ft icr ms analysis of spe aom was performed using an electrospray ionization esi source in negative ionization mode on a 15t bruker apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics germany as described in text s7 more details on precise formula allocation and post calibration can be found elsewhere xiang et al 2020 in addition h c and o c ratios were used to draw van krevelen plots gonsior et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 and the stoichiometric ranges of the classifications for van krevelen are listed in table s1 parameters of aom molecules including aromaticity equivalent xc yassine et al 2014 double bond equivalent dbe carbon oxidation state cos nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc and modified aromatic index aimod zhang et al 2021 were used to reveal the detailed characteristics of aom profiles as described in text s8 four experimental groups were performed for ft icr ms analysis i aom without any treatment marked as ck ii aom with chlorine treatment marked as cl2 iii aom with plasma treatment marked as plasma and iv aom with plasma and chlorine treatment marked as plasma cl2 based on the ft icr ms analysis the possible transformation networks from precursors to dbps were calculated by functional network reconstruction and visualized by gephi software tziotis et al 2011 moritz et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 as described in text s9 2 6 statistical analysis each test was performed three times independently and each sample was measured in three replicates the data are expressed as the means with standard deviations a two tailed paired t test was used to determine the significance of the data at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of cyanobacteria fig 1 a depicts the inactivation rates of the three cyanobacteria cells under plasma treatment almost all the algae cells were inactivated after 6 min of plasma treatment interestingly the cell lysis rate of c raciborskii reached 100 within 4 min and a spiroies could be completely removed after 5 min of treatment while it took 6 min for m aeruginosa this difference was probably related to the different characteristics of these algae cells such as shape size and movement ability filamentous algae c raciborskii and a spiroies had relatively larger sizes and longer chain structures c raciborskii was generally 17 35 Î¼m in diameter and up to 1000 Î¼m in length lin et al 2010 gonzalez torres et al 2019 and thus it would have more chances to contact the reactive substances generated by the plasma m aeruginosa 3 7 Î¼m in diameter was elliptical and had a strong movement ability thus it might have fewer chances to react with the reactive substances takaara et al 2010 in addition removal performance energy consumption and operating cost on algae cell removal by different methods were compared in table s2 and text s1 compared with traditional algae removal techniques previously studied the discharge plasma treatment in this study had a relatively higher total operating cost than traditional methods such as chlorination and h2o2 but was comparable to those of kmno4 pac uv cl k2feo4 and kmno4 fe ii oxidation treatment ma et al 2012 qiao et al 2017 sun et al 2018 fan et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 li et al 2020 moreover the plasma oxidation treatment showed the highest algae cell removal efficiency in the shortest time among these methods and no chemicals were needed rapid inactivation and algae cell rupture could lead to aom release wang et al 2021 3d eem combined with parafac analysis was applied to characterize the structural characteristics of aom as shown in fig s3 four eem fluorescence components including chlorophyll c1 uvc humic like c2 tryptophan like c3 and uva humic like c4 were identified the maximum fluorescence intensities of these four components all dramatically decreased after 12 min of treatment fig 1b this suggested that aom was also decomposed by the plasma oxidation although it was released during the algae cell destruction wang et al 2021 the decomposition of aom was corroborated by the significant decrease in suva254 and increase in sr fig s4 these results indicated that plasma treatment destroyed the aromatic moieties of aom nisol et al 2019 only the components with chromogenic fluorescence groups in aom were recognized by the 3d eem li et al 2017 thus it did not fully describe the properties of aom 3 2 molecular diversities of aom after plasma treatment ft icr ms was applied to characterize the chemical diversity defined by all specified molecular formulas in aom reemtsma et al 2008 roebuck et al 2018 sun et al 2020 figs 2 and 3 depict the van krevelen diagrams of aom released by the three different algae due to plasma oxidation according to the formula allocation of the peaks s n 6 a large number of aom formulas were identified and cho and chno molecules were the dominant species the van krevelen diagrams corresponding to the major aom formulas were divided into seven regions table s1 yuan et al 2017 in general the main aom formulas generated by the three algae were located in regions 1 6 which corresponded to lipids aliphatic proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram like and tannins respectively different from nom there were negligible substances with concentrated aromatic structures region 7 in aom zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2017a in addition the h c values of most assigned formulas were larger than 1 36 table s3 indicating that aom did not contain a large number of aromatic groups gonsior et al 2019 as shown in fig 3a in the ck group the proportion of chno formulas in the aom of the three algae was the highest and followed the order of a spiroies 77 m aeruginosa 60 c raciborskii 55 compared with the ck group the proportion of chno formulas in the cl2 group increased by 8 20 which was accompanied by the distinct decrease in the total number of aom formulas especially for the cho formulas during the naclo chlorination process the oxidation of naclo or hclo can induce the cleavage of the aom structures into small molecular weight compounds meanwhile free chlorine reacts with primary amines with dissolved organic nitrogen in aom such as amines and amino acids oxidation by free chlorine would lead to formation of imines which are further hydrolyzed to aldehydes how et al 2017 these processes can lead to the reduction of formulas such as cho and chno zhang et al 2012 ruan et al 2021 for the plasma group the proportion of cho formulas increased by 11 23 while that of chno decreased by 19 21 compared with the ck this implies that the chno formulas were more liable to be destroyed and or converted to cho formulas during the plasma oxidation kalinski et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 for the major classes of formulas the proportions of lipids and lignins cram like decreased in the plasma group compared with the ck group fig 3b the lipids and lignins cram like compounds were divided into highly unsaturated and aliphatic compounds kalinski et al 2014 hua et al 2019 unsaturated and aliphatic compounds in aom were important precursors of n dbps and organic chloramine in the chlorination process sheng et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 moreover the percentage of carbohydrate compounds increased in the plasma group compared with the ck while that of lignin cram like compounds decreased these results further suggested that the lignin cram like compounds were oxidized resulting in ring opening and or amino groups being removed from the aliphatic compounds in aom molecules phungsai et al 2019 ruan et al 2021 in addition sheng et al 2021 reported that lignin cram like compounds were typical proteins polypeptides which were proven to be highly correlated with organic chloramine formation therefore plasma treatment decreased the content of lignin cram like compounds and helped to reduce the formation potential of n dbps and organic chloramines wang et al 2021 fig 4 depicts the changes in the relative abundance of the m z distribution and ox class species of aom compared with the ck group the relative abundance of aom with a molecular weight of 200 350 da decreased but those in a range of 350 700 da increased in the plasma group fig 4a c similarly for the ox class species the relative abundance of aom with 2 9 o atoms decreased but those with 10 16 o atoms increased in the plasma group fig 4d f zhu et al 2019 similar phenomena were also observed in the cl2 group and plasma cl2 group oxygen addition was a common process in advanced oxidation processes huang et al 2020 and a similar result was also observed in the ozonation of nom zhang et al 2021 the increased ox class species with 10 16 o atoms could be confirmed by the weighted average wa indexes of the aom molecular parameters the weighted mean carbon oxidation states coswa and ratios of o c increased in the plasma group but the equivalent double bond number dbewa decreased table s2 3 3 macromolecular dbps formation after algae treatment by the plasma the formation potentials of the conventional dbps were determined in subsequent chlorination quantifiable dbps thms haas hans and hks were detected in all aom samples and their contents finally decreased after 20 min of plasma treatment fig s5 before chlorination the cytotoxicity of the algae laden water samples after 20 min of the plasma treatment decreased compared with no plasma treatment 0 min fig s6 however after chlorination the cytotoxicity of algae laden water samples after plasma treatment significantly increased this indicated that some unknown chloro organic byproducts probably contribute to the toxic effects nom has previously been reported to react with chlorine to form aromatic non halogenated dbps which then further reacted with chlorine to form aromatic halo dbps and aliphatic halo dbps zhai and zhang 2011 jiang et al 2020 these aromatic halo dbps might dominate the developmental toxicity in chlorinated drinking water yang and zhang 2013 jiang et al 2017 han et al 2021 liu and zhang 2014 found that the developmental toxicity and growth inhibition effects of halogenated aromatic dbps were generally tens to hundreds of times higher than those of halogenated aliphatic dbps as for aom it was more likely to produce some n dbps because it was mainly characterized by fatty acids and some high strength nitrogen containing compounds gonsior et al 2019 n dbps were generally more toxic than their carbonaceous analogues richardson 2009 n dbps e g hans could inhibit the activity of glutathione s transferase and inhibit its detoxification function they could also cause oxidative stress oxidative damage to some organs and tissues and genotoxicity lipscomb et al 2008 however there is still a lack of research on the unknown polar halogenated macromolecular dbps after aom chlorination c dbps and n dbps derived from aom were diagnosed using ft icr ms as shown in fig s7 the numbers of chocl and chnocl derived from these three aom all significantly decreased in the plasma cl2 group compared with the cl2 group therefore the plasma treatment reduced the total number of macromolecular dbps this was also supported by the decrease in the weighted average values of modified aromaticity index aimod of dbps in the plasma cl2 group compared with those in the cl2 group table s3 the van krevelen diagrams of the macromolecular c dbps and n dbps containing 1 3 cl atoms are depicted in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in the cl2 group the numbers of c dbps with 2 cl atoms were 550 595 and 251 for m aeruginosa c racilborskii and a spiroides respectively which were the predominant dbps fig 5a c in the plasma cl2 group the numbers of c dbps with 2 cl atoms were still the highest but they decreased compared with those in the cl2 group fig 5d f furthermore the numbers of c dbps containing 1 3 cl atoms generally decreased in the plasma cl2 group in the cl2 group the relative intensities of c dbps with 3 cl atoms in the m aeruginosa c racilborskii and a spiroides samples were the highest marked as c10h11o10cl3 c11h13o8cl3 and c11h17o4cl3 respectively in the plasma cl2 group the relative intensities of c dbps with 1 cl atom in the three aom samples were the highest marked as c11h19o10cl c11h17o4cl c11h15o6cl and c11h17o7cl the main reason for these differences was probably that the plasma treatment changed the composition of the aom and partly mineralized 40 50 of doc removal which finally affected the types and relative contents of dbps zhang et al 2021 xiang et al reported that nom oxidation by uv h2o2 treatment led to the increase in the numbers of macromolecular dbps which was attributed to nearly unchanged doc content xiang et al 2020 similar to the c dbps the numbers of n dbps with 2 cl atoms were basically the highest in the cl2 group and plasma cl2 group fig 6 in the cl2 group the relative intensities of n dbps with 1 cl atom in the m aeruginosa and c racilborskii samples were the highest marked as c22h43no2cl and c30h15n2o19cl respectively but c11h14no8cl and c18h20n2o8cl in the m aeruginosa and c racilborskii samples were predominant in the plasma cl2 group respectively compared with the cl2 group the numbers of c atoms in the most abundant n dbps in the plasma cl2 group decreased which were consistent with the changes in the average molecular weight in table s3 longer c chain structures were oxidized and destroyed into shorter c chains in the oxidation treatment of chno molecular precursors phungsai et al 2019 a functional plot was used to visualize the c atomic number and aromatic equivalents xc of all dbps molecular formulas as shown in figs s8 and s9 the parameter xc represents the aromatic degree of compounds gonsior et al 2019 in the ck group the xc values of cho and chno molecules in the three aom samples were basically 1 7 2 8 after plasma and or chlorination treatment the xc values and relative intensities of the compounds were basically reduced indicating that the double bonds in aom molecules were destroyed active species may lead to cleavage of aromatic rings producing more hydroxylated carboxylic acids and unsaturated aliphatic compounds higuchi 2004 cl species could react with some aom to change the c atomic skeleton and led to the saturation of molecular formulas yassine et al 2014 this could also be confirmed by the increased coswa values after chlorination in table s3 fig s10 depicts the relationships between the double bond equivalent dbe of the aom molecular formulas and dbps after plasma and or chlorination treatment the dbe values and abundance of aom molecular formulas decreased this further demonstrated that the carbon double bonds in aom molecules were broken moritz et al 2017 wang et al 2021 due to the presence of unsaturated carbonyl groups the addition of oxygen atoms during the oxidation process could also reduce the number and relative abundance of c c bonds zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2017b explored the correlations of macromolecular dbps with tcm dcaa and tcaa and found that unsaturated compounds with high o c ratio and low h c ratio of oxygen rich molecules were significantly correlated with the formation of tcm dcaa and tcaa p 0 05 polycyclic aromatic compounds polyphenols phenols and unsaturated aliphatic compounds rich in oxygen containing functional groups contributed significantly to the formation of tcm dcaa and tcaa during chlorination wang et al 2017b zhai and zhang 2011 reported that some macromolecular dbps such as halogenated benzoquinones could be decomposed to low molecular dbps including haas and thms during the chlorination reaction in addition compounds with high o c and dbe among aom precursor molecules were more likely to generate n dbp including dcan and tcnm wu et al 2022 these indicated that the formation potentials of quantifiable dbps such as haas and thms were closely related to the element compositions and specific structures of the precursors at the molecular levels in this study dbe values were significantly reduced after plasma treatment further proving the decrease in the concentrations of the 10 quantifiable dbps detected after 20 min of plasma treatment 3 4 network computational analysis of macromolecular dbps understanding the molecular characteristics of dbps favors tracing their presumed precursors through well known chlorination pathways such as electrophilic substitution by replacing the h atom with a cl atom the molecular characteristics of the electrophilic substitution type hypothetical precursors could be obtained via network computing tziotis et al 2011 moritz et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 considering the highest abundance of c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx mass difference network analysis was conducted and the results are shown in figs 7 and s11 the detailed c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx formulas are listed in tables s4 and s5 theoretical masses of all cho and chno formulas were considered as the reference masses in the network computational analysis method nodes represent experimental m z values and edges connections within the network represent precise mass differences zhang et al 2021 electrophilic substitution and hocl addition were considered in the reaction processes when the mass difference between them was equal to the theoretical mass of hocl 51 9715927 amu and clh 1 electrophilic substitution of chlorine 33 961028 amu the edge and node were connected xiang et al 2020 after considering the mass differences of o 15 9949146 amu h2 2 0156501 amu hocl and clh 1 the number of c11hnomclx generated from c11hnom in the cl2 group was 107 and it was 55 in the plasma cl2 group fig 7a and 7c similarly the numbers of c18hnnmozclx generated from c18hnnmoz were 179 and 81 in the cl2 group and plasma cl2 group respectively fig 7b and 7d in addition c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx mass difference networks were more chaotic in the cl2 group while they were more orderly in the plasma cl2 group and the dbps generation paths were clearer koch and dittmar 2006 ruf et al 2017 surprisingly formulas with o atoms less than 3 or greater than 14 were rarely associated with the formation of c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx tables s3 and s4 these results indicated that the potential dbp precursors in aom may have a suitable o c ratio to further confirm this hypothesis a comprehensive analysis of the elemental composition of dbps precursors of three different cyanobacteria was performed the numbers and ratios of dbps that could match the precursors based on the above two chlorination pathways chlorine substitution and hocl addition are shown in table s6 most dbps with matched precursors 72 86 were derived from the chlorine substitution pathway while only 51 75 were derived via the hocl addition pathway these results were consistent with previous studies in which dbps formation derived from the chlorination of dissolved organic matter was mainly through chlorine substitution rather than hocl addition gonsior et al 2019 according to the mass difference analysis the precursors of dbps contained a certain atomic number of c and o 7 c 18 3 o 11 xiang et al 2020 reported that the nom responsible for the formation of dbps generally had 6 12 o atoms these results suggested that the macromolecular dbps derived from aom were distinctly different from those produced from nom the van krevelen diagrams of c dbps precursors and n dbps precursors in the above two chlorination pathways are shown in figs 8 s12 and s13 the precursor formulas of c dbps and n dbps in a spiroides mainly existed in the following regions aliphatic proteins carbohydrates lignins cram like compounds and tannins as labeled by the oval areas in fig 8 the same phenomenon was also observed in m aeruginosa and c racilborskii figs s12 and s13 wang et al 2017a reported that the chemical composition of traditional dbp such as thm dcaa and tcaa precursors had a characteristic 0 4 o c 0 8 and 0 5 h c 1 0 xiang et al 2020 found that the o c and h c in the nom precursors of macromolecular dbps were in a range of 0 5 o c 0 8 and 0 5 h c 1 2 respectively in our study the aom precursors were about 0 4 o c 0 9 and 1 0 h c 1 6 table s7 in addition 0 1 n c 0 3 in the aom precursors was significantly higher than 0 01 n c 0 04 in nom kurek et al 2020 3 5 environmental implications for water treatment the frequent occurrence of water bloom and the associated aom in water source cannot be ignored for drinking safety although previous studies have shown that approximately 600 halogenated dbps have been identified by gc ms richardson et al 2007 the previous methods were generally not suitable for the detection of some highly polar compounds our results showed that esi ft icr ms was beneficial to reveal the changes of aom before and after chlorination at the molecular levels enhanced the in depth understanding of aom diversity and identified a large number of new dbps that were significantly different from the known small molecular dbps in drinking water therefore the present esi ft icr ms analysis enriched the cognition of dbps from algae although structural information on these new chlorine containing byproducts is still difficult to obtain this esi ft icr ms is a powerful tool for detecting electrospray ionizable chlorine containing compounds in complex mixtures zhang et al 2014 in addition a large number of n dbps produced by chlorination of aom will inevitably exhibit high toxic risks thus threatening the safety of drinking water supply therefore it is important to determine the potential toxicities of these identified macromolecules n dbps a comprehensive toxicity assessment system based on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of n dbps should be established to evaluate the production and toxicity effects in future 4 conclusions increasing the aom content in source water poses a serious challenge to the drinking water supply understanding the chemical diversity of aom and unknown macromolecular dbps formulas is critical for ensuring drinking water safety this study found that the diversity of cho molecular formulas increased after algae laden water treatment by plasma oxidation but that of chno decreased more importantly the plasma treatment significantly reduced the numbers of macromolecular dbps 912 c dbps and 736 n dbps were still detected and c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx were the most abundant substitution of one or more cl atoms was predicted to be the main pathways for macromolecular dbps formulas in general the plasma treatment is an alternative option to control the formulas of macromolecular dbps from aom although more than 60 of c dbps and n dbps in the three different aom samples were removed by the plasma treatment unlike nom the content of n dbps from aom was higher than that from nom due to the high content of aliphatic protein compounds resulting in still high toxicity after plasma cl2 treatment future studies should be conducted to evaluate the toxic effects of the new macromolecular dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

2020a unfortunately disinfection byproducts dbps may be generated from cyanobacterial cells and or aom in drinking water chlorination disinfection fang et al 2010 which are suspected to cause bladder cancer diana et al 2019 liu et al 2020b compared to natural organic matter nom aom usually contains many organic nitrogen atoms which may consume chlorine to form organic chloramines in the chlorination process consequently the generation of organic chloramines leads to an overestimation of the effective chlorine during disinfection sheng et al 2021 removing aom from water before chlorination is an effective strategy to suppress dbps formation potential wang et al 2021 discharge plasma as an advanced oxidation technique has been widely applied in pollution control due to its strong oxidation capacity and environmental friendliness liu et al 2022 sun et al 2019 nisol et al 2019 previous studies proved that plasma oxidation successfully destroyed the structure and elemental composition of aom li et al 2021 one of our previous studies demonstrated that plasma oxidation realized rapid inactivation of cyanobacteria cells effective removal of cyanobacteria toxins and aom simultaneously leading to significant inhibition in traditional dbps formation wang et al 2021 in these previous studies aom properties were generally characterized using total organic carbon ultraviolet visible spectrum and three dimensional fluorescence spectrum 3d eem combined with parallel factor analysis eem parafac these spectral analytical techniques are unable to characterize the detailed elemental composition and structural characteristics of aom at the molecular level li et al 2017 tsai et al 2019 hua et al 2019 however aom is very complex with diverse molecular structures the lack of related information hinders the comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms for the dbps formation potentials during the chlorination process electrospray ionization coupled fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry technique which can identify and determine the unique molecular formulas of complex compounds roebuck et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 sun et al 2020 recently ft icr ms has been used to decipher the chemical characteristics of nom of different matrices at the molecular level reemtsma et al 2008 yuan et al 2017 bahureksa et al 2021 gao et al 2021 unknown macromolecular chlorine containing dbps derived from nom in drinking water were also identified by ft icr ms herzsprung et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2017a different from nom aom is characterized by high hydrophilicity abundant amino acids and proteins and high organic nitrogen contents fang et al 2010 gonsior et al 2019 dong et al 2021 particularly the chemical structures of aom are diverse because there are many different kinds of algae in natural water rousso et al 2020 thus it is presumed that dbps derived from aom are different from those derived from nom and there is a great opportunity for many macromolecular dbps defined as carbon atomic number 6 to be discovered to date there is still a knowledge gap regarding the correlations between aom chemical diversity and chlorinated macromolecular dbps formation in this study the molecular diversity of aom and chlorinated macromolecular dbps formation were investigated after algae laden water treatment by plasma oxidation firstly inactivation performances and aom degradation of three different cyanobacteria m aeruginosa c raciborskii and a spiroies and traditional dbps formation potentials were evaluated in the plasma process secondly the molecular diversity of aom with without plasma and chlorination treatment were diagnosed using ft icr ms finally the formation and numbers of macromolecular dbps were identified and links between macromolecular dbps and corresponding precursors during chlorination were visualized by network computational analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials microcystina aeruginosa m aeruginosa fachb 905 cylindrospermopsis racibprskii c raciborskii fachb 1503 and anabaena spiroies a spiroies fachb 709 were

algal cells removal and total operating cost were also calculated in text s1 2 3 algae cell detection and parafac analysis after the plasma treatment water samples were collected for residual cell

the amount of chlorine naclo added in the dbps formation experiment was referred to a previous study bernat quesada et al 2020 when the dosage was set at 10 mg l 1 there was still residual chlorine after 24 h of reaction the mixture was placed in an incubator at 25 c in the dark wang et al 2021 after 24 h of incubation ascorbic acid was added to quench the residual oxidant and dbps were analyzed

and haloacetic acids haas are described in text s4 the cytotoxicity tests of the plasma treated algae laden water were performed using hepg2 cells based on a previous method hu et al 2018 as described in text s5 2 5 ft icr ms analysis before mass spectrometry analysis an established solid phase extraction spe procedure was used for desalting using the proprietary polymer agilent bond elut ppl resin gonsior et al 2019 as described in text s6 spe aom was obtained through this procedure the ft icr ms analysis of spe aom was performed using an electrospray ionization esi source in negative ionization mode on a 15t bruker apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics germany as described in text s7 more details on precise formula allocation and post calibration can be found elsewhere xiang et al 2020 in addition h c and o c ratios were used to draw van krevelen plots gonsior et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 and the stoichiometric ranges of the classifications for van krevelen are listed in table s1 parameters of aom molecules including aromaticity equivalent xc yassine et al 2014 double bond equivalent dbe carbon oxidation state cos nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc and modified aromatic index aimod zhang et al 2021 were used to reveal the detailed characteristics of aom profiles as described in text s8 four experimental groups were performed for ft icr ms analysis i aom without any treatment marked as ck ii aom with chlorine treatment marked as cl2 iii aom with plasma treatment marked as plasma and iv aom with plasma and chlorine treatment marked as plasma cl2 based on the ft icr ms analysis the possible transformation networks from precursors to dbps were calculated by functional network reconstruction and visualized by gephi software tziotis et al 2011 moritz et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 as described in text s9 2 6 statistical analysis each test was performed three times independently and each sample was measured in three replicates the data are expressed as the means with standard deviations a two tailed paired t test was used to determine the significance of the data at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of cyanobacteria fig 1 a depicts the inactivation rates of the three cyanobacteria cells under plasma treatment almost all the algae cells were inactivated after 6 min of plasma treatment interestingly the cell lysis rate of c raciborskii reached 100 within 4 min and a spiroies could be completely removed after 5 min of treatment while it took 6 min for m aeruginosa this difference was probably related to the different characteristics of these algae cells such as shape size and movement ability filamentous algae c raciborskii and a spiroies had relatively larger sizes and longer chain structures c raciborskii was generally 17 35 Î¼m in diameter and up to 1000 Î¼m in length lin et al 2010 gonzalez torres et al 2019 and thus it would have more chances to contact the reactive substances generated by the plasma m aeruginosa 3 7 Î¼m in diameter was elliptical and had a strong movement ability thus it might have fewer chances to react with the reactive substances takaara et al 2010 in addition removal performance energy consumption and operating cost on algae cell removal by different methods were compared in table s2 and text s1 compared with traditional algae removal techniques previously studied the discharge plasma treatment in this study had a relatively higher total operating cost than traditional methods such as chlorination and h2o2 but was comparable to those of kmno4 pac uv cl k2feo4 and kmno4 fe ii oxidation treatment ma et al 2012 qiao et al 2017 sun et al 2018 fan et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 li et al 2020 moreover the plasma oxidation treatment showed the highest algae cell removal efficiency in the shortest time among these methods and no chemicals were needed rapid inactivation and algae cell rupture could lead to aom release wang et al 2021 3d eem combined with parafac analysis was applied to characterize the structural characteristics of aom as shown in fig s3 four eem fluorescence components including chlorophyll c1 uvc humic like c2 tryptophan like c3 and uva humic like c4 were identified the maximum fluorescence intensities of these four components all dramatically decreased after 12 min of treatment fig 1b this suggested that aom was also decomposed by the plasma oxidation although it was released during the algae cell destruction wang et al 2021 the decomposition of aom was corroborated by the significant decrease in suva254 and increase in sr fig s4 these results indicated that plasma treatment destroyed the aromatic moieties of aom nisol et al 2019 only the components with chromogenic fluorescence groups in aom were recognized by the 3d eem li et al 2017 thus it did not fully describe the properties of aom 3 2 molecular diversities of aom after plasma treatment ft icr ms was applied to characterize the chemical diversity defined by all specified molecular formulas in aom reemtsma et al 2008 roebuck et al 2018 sun et al 2020 figs 2 and 3 depict the van krevelen diagrams of aom released by the three different algae due to plasma oxidation according to the formula allocation of the peaks s n 6 a large number of aom formulas were identified and cho and chno molecules were the dominant species the van krevelen diagrams corresponding to the major aom formulas were divided into seven regions table s1 yuan et al 2017 in general the main aom formulas generated by the three algae were located in regions 1 6 which corresponded to lipids aliphatic proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram like and tannins respectively different from nom there were negligible substances with concentrated aromatic structures region 7 in aom zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2017a in addition the h c values of most assigned formulas were larger than 1 36 table s3 indicating that aom did not contain a large number of aromatic groups gonsior et al 2019 as shown in fig 3a in the ck group the proportion of chno formulas in the aom of the three algae was the highest and followed the order of a spiroies 77 m aeruginosa 60 c raciborskii 55 compared with the ck group the proportion of chno formulas in the cl2 group increased by 8 20 which was accompanied by the distinct decrease in the total number of aom formulas especially for the cho formulas during the naclo chlorination process the oxidation of naclo or hclo can induce the cleavage of the aom structures into small molecular weight compounds meanwhile free chlorine reacts with primary amines with dissolved organic nitrogen in aom such as amines and amino acids oxidation by free chlorine would lead to formation of imines which are further hydrolyzed to aldehydes how et al 2017 these processes can lead to the reduction of formulas such as cho and chno zhang et al 2012 ruan et al 2021 for the plasma group the proportion of cho formulas increased by 11 23 while that of chno decreased by 19 21 compared with the ck this implies that the chno formulas were more liable to be destroyed and or converted to cho formulas during the plasma oxidation kalinski et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 for the major classes of formulas the proportions of lipids and lignins cram like decreased in the plasma group compared with the ck group fig 3b the lipids and lignins cram like compounds were divided into highly unsaturated and aliphatic compounds kalinski et al 2014 hua et al 2019 unsaturated and aliphatic compounds in aom were important precursors of n dbps and organic chloramine in the chlorination process sheng et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 moreover the percentage of carbohydrate compounds increased in the plasma group compared with the ck while that of lignin cram like compounds decreased these results further suggested that the lignin cram like compounds were oxidized resulting in ring opening and or amino groups being removed from the aliphatic compounds in aom molecules phungsai et al 2019 ruan et al 2021 in addition sheng et al 2021 reported that lignin cram like compounds were typical proteins polypeptides which were proven to be highly correlated with organic chloramine formation therefore plasma treatment decreased the content of lignin cram like compounds and helped to reduce the formation potential of n dbps and organic chloramines wang et al 2021 fig 4 depicts the changes in the relative abundance of the m z distribution and ox class species of aom compared with the ck group the relative abundance of aom with a molecular weight of 200 350 da decreased but those in a range of 350 700 da increased in the plasma group fig 4a c similarly for the ox class species the relative abundance of aom with 2 9 o atoms decreased but those with 10 16 o atoms increased in the plasma group fig 4d f zhu et al 2019 similar phenomena were also observed in the cl2 group and plasma cl2 group oxygen addition was a common process in advanced oxidation processes huang et al 2020 and a similar result was also observed in the ozonation of nom zhang et al 2021 the increased ox class species with 10 16 o atoms could be confirmed by the weighted average wa indexes of the aom molecular parameters the weighted mean carbon oxidation states coswa and ratios of o c increased in the plasma group but the equivalent double bond number dbewa decreased table s2 3 3 macromolecular dbps formation after algae treatment by the plasma the formation potentials of the conventional dbps were determined in subsequent chlorination quantifiable dbps thms haas hans and hks were detected in all aom samples and their contents finally decreased after 20 min of plasma treatment fig s5 before chlorination the cytotoxicity of the algae laden water samples after 20 min of the plasma treatment decreased compared with no plasma treatment 0 min fig s6 however after chlorination the cytotoxicity of algae laden water samples after plasma treatment significantly increased this indicated that some unknown chloro organic byproducts probably contribute to the toxic effects nom has previously been reported to react with chlorine to form aromatic non halogenated dbps which then further reacted with chlorine to form aromatic halo dbps and aliphatic halo dbps zhai and zhang 2011 jiang et al 2020 these aromatic halo dbps might dominate the developmental toxicity in chlorinated drinking water yang and zhang 2013 jiang et al 2017 han et al 2021 liu and zhang 2014 found that the developmental toxicity and growth inhibition effects of halogenated aromatic dbps were generally tens to hundreds of times higher than those of halogenated aliphatic dbps as for aom it was more likely to produce some n dbps because it was mainly characterized by fatty acids and some high strength nitrogen containing compounds gonsior et al 2019 n dbps were generally more toxic than their carbonaceous analogues richardson 2009 n dbps e g hans could inhibit the activity of glutathione s transferase and inhibit its detoxification function they could also cause oxidative stress oxidative damage to some organs and tissues and genotoxicity lipscomb et al 2008 however there is still a lack of research on the unknown polar halogenated macromolecular dbps after aom chlorination c dbps and n dbps derived from aom were diagnosed using ft icr ms as shown in fig s7 the numbers of chocl and chnocl derived from these three aom all significantly decreased in the plasma cl2 group compared with the cl2 group therefore the plasma treatment reduced the total number of macromolecular dbps this was also supported by the decrease in the weighted average values of modified aromaticity index aimod of dbps in the plasma cl2 group compared with those in the cl2 group table s3 the van krevelen diagrams of the macromolecular c dbps and n dbps containing 1 3 cl atoms are depicted in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in the cl2 group the numbers of c dbps with 2 cl atoms were 550 595 and 251 for m aeruginosa c racilborskii and a spiroides respectively which were the predominant dbps fig 5a c in the plasma cl2 group the numbers of c dbps with 2 cl atoms were still the highest but they decreased compared with those in the cl2 group fig 5d f furthermore the numbers of c dbps containing 1 3 cl atoms generally decreased in the plasma cl2 group in the cl2 group the relative intensities of c dbps with 3 cl atoms in the m aeruginosa c racilborskii and a spiroides samples were the highest marked as c10h11o10cl3 c11h13o8cl3 and c11h17o4cl3 respectively in the plasma cl2 group the relative intensities of c dbps with 1 cl atom in the three aom samples were the highest marked as c11h19o10cl c11h17o4cl c11h15o6cl and c11h17o7cl the main reason for these differences was probably that the plasma treatment changed the composition of the aom and partly mineralized 40 50 of doc removal which finally affected the types and relative contents of dbps zhang et al 2021 xiang et al reported that nom oxidation by uv h2o2 treatment led to the increase in the numbers of macromolecular dbps which was attributed to nearly unchanged doc content xiang et al 2020 similar to the c dbps the numbers of n dbps with 2 cl atoms were basically the highest in the cl2 group and plasma cl2 group fig 6 in the cl2 group the relative intensities of n dbps with 1 cl atom in the m aeruginosa and c racilborskii samples were the highest marked as c22h43no2cl and c30h15n2o19cl respectively but c11h14no8cl and c18h20n2o8cl in the m aeruginosa and c racilborskii samples were predominant in the plasma cl2 group respectively compared with the cl2 group the numbers of c atoms in the most abundant n dbps in the plasma cl2 group decreased which were consistent with the changes in the average molecular weight in table s3 longer c chain structures were oxidized and destroyed into shorter c chains in the oxidation treatment of chno molecular precursors phungsai et al 2019 a functional plot was used to visualize the c atomic number and aromatic equivalents xc of all dbps molecular formulas as shown in figs s8 and s9 the parameter xc represents the aromatic degree of compounds gonsior et al 2019 in the ck group the xc values of cho and chno molecules in the three aom samples were basically 1 7 2 8 after plasma and or chlorination treatment the xc values and relative intensities of the compounds were basically reduced indicating that the double bonds in aom molecules were destroyed active species may lead to cleavage of aromatic rings producing more hydroxylated carboxylic acids and unsaturated aliphatic compounds higuchi 2004 cl species could react with some aom to change the c atomic skeleton and led to the saturation of molecular formulas yassine et al 2014 this could also be confirmed by the increased coswa values after chlorination in table s3 fig s10 depicts the relationships between the double bond equivalent dbe of the aom molecular formulas and dbps after plasma and or chlorination treatment the dbe values and abundance of aom molecular formulas decreased this further demonstrated that the carbon double bonds in aom molecules were broken moritz et al 2017 wang et al 2021 due to the presence of unsaturated carbonyl groups the addition of oxygen atoms during the oxidation process could also reduce the number and relative abundance of c c bonds zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2017b explored the correlations of macromolecular dbps with tcm dcaa and tcaa and found that unsaturated compounds with high o c ratio and low h c ratio of oxygen rich molecules were significantly correlated with the formation of tcm dcaa and tcaa p 0 05 polycyclic aromatic compounds polyphenols phenols and unsaturated aliphatic compounds rich in oxygen containing functional groups contributed significantly to the formation of tcm dcaa and tcaa during chlorination wang et al 2017b zhai and zhang 2011 reported that some macromolecular dbps such as halogenated benzoquinones could be decomposed to low molecular dbps including haas and thms during the chlorination reaction in addition compounds with high o c and dbe among aom precursor molecules were more likely to generate n dbp including dcan and tcnm wu et al 2022 these indicated that the formation potentials of quantifiable dbps such as haas and thms were closely related to the element compositions and specific structures of the precursors at the molecular levels in this study dbe values were significantly reduced after plasma treatment further proving the decrease in the concentrations of the 10 quantifiable dbps detected after 20 min of plasma treatment 3 4 network computational analysis of macromolecular dbps understanding the molecular characteristics of dbps favors tracing their presumed precursors through well known chlorination pathways such as electrophilic substitution by replacing the h atom with a cl atom the molecular characteristics of the electrophilic substitution type hypothetical precursors could be obtained via network computing tziotis et al 2011 moritz et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 considering the highest abundance of c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx mass difference network analysis was conducted and the results are shown in figs 7 and s11 the detailed c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx formulas are listed in tables s4 and s5 theoretical masses of all cho and chno formulas were considered as the reference masses in the network computational analysis method nodes represent experimental m z values and edges connections within the network represent precise mass differences zhang et al 2021 electrophilic substitution and hocl addition were considered in the reaction processes when the mass difference between them was equal to the theoretical mass of hocl 51 9715927 amu and clh 1 electrophilic substitution of chlorine 33 961028 amu the edge and node were connected xiang et al 2020 after considering the mass differences of o 15 9949146 amu h2 2 0156501 amu hocl and clh 1 the number of c11hnomclx generated from c11hnom in the cl2 group was 107 and it was 55 in the plasma cl2 group fig 7a and 7c similarly the numbers of c18hnnmozclx generated from c18hnnmoz were 179 and 81 in the cl2 group and plasma cl2 group respectively fig 7b and 7d in addition c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx mass difference networks were more chaotic in the cl2 group while they were more orderly in the plasma cl2 group and the dbps generation paths were clearer koch and dittmar 2006 ruf et al 2017 surprisingly formulas with o atoms less than 3 or greater than 14 were rarely associated with the formation of c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx tables s3 and s4 these results indicated that the potential dbp precursors in aom may have a suitable o c ratio to further confirm this hypothesis a comprehensive analysis of the elemental composition of dbps precursors of three different cyanobacteria was performed the numbers and ratios of dbps that could match the precursors based on the above two chlorination pathways chlorine substitution and hocl addition are shown in table s6 most dbps with matched precursors 72 86 were derived from the chlorine substitution pathway while only 51 75 were derived via the hocl addition pathway these results were consistent with previous studies in which dbps formation derived from the chlorination of dissolved organic matter was mainly through chlorine substitution rather than hocl addition gonsior et al 2019 according to the mass difference analysis the precursors of dbps contained a certain atomic number of c and o 7 c 18 3 o 11 xiang et al 2020 reported that the nom responsible for the formation of dbps generally had 6 12 o atoms these results suggested that the macromolecular dbps derived from aom were distinctly different from those produced from nom the van krevelen diagrams of c dbps precursors and n dbps precursors in the above two chlorination pathways are shown in figs 8 s12 and s13 the precursor formulas of c dbps and n dbps in a spiroides mainly existed in the following regions aliphatic proteins carbohydrates lignins cram like compounds and tannins as labeled by the oval areas in fig 8 the same phenomenon was also observed in m aeruginosa and c racilborskii figs s12 and s13 wang et al 2017a reported that the chemical composition of traditional dbp such as thm dcaa and tcaa precursors had a characteristic 0 4 o c 0 8 and 0 5 h c 1 0 xiang et al 2020 found that the o c and h c in the nom precursors of macromolecular dbps were in a range of 0 5 o c 0 8 and 0 5 h c 1 2 respectively in our study the aom precursors were about 0 4 o c 0 9 and 1 0 h c 1 6 table s7 in addition 0 1 n c 0 3 in the aom precursors was significantly higher than 0 01 n c 0 04 in nom kurek et al 2020 3 5 environmental implications for water treatment the frequent occurrence of water bloom and the associated aom in water source cannot be ignored for drinking safety although previous studies have shown that approximately 600 halogenated dbps have been identified by gc ms richardson et al 2007 the previous methods were generally not suitable for the detection of some highly polar compounds our results showed that esi ft icr ms was beneficial to reveal the changes of aom before and after chlorination at the molecular levels enhanced the in depth understanding of aom diversity and identified a large number of new dbps that were significantly different from the known small molecular dbps in drinking water therefore the present esi ft icr ms analysis enriched the cognition of dbps from algae although structural information on these new chlorine containing byproducts is still difficult to obtain this esi ft icr ms is a powerful tool for detecting electrospray ionizable chlorine containing compounds in complex mixtures zhang et al 2014 in addition a large number of n dbps produced by chlorination of aom will inevitably exhibit high toxic risks thus threatening the safety of drinking water supply therefore it is important to determine the potential toxicities of these identified macromolecules n dbps a comprehensive toxicity assessment system based on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of n dbps should be established to evaluate the production and toxicity effects in future 4 conclusions increasing the aom content in source water poses a serious challenge to the drinking water supply understanding the chemical diversity of aom and unknown macromolecular dbps formulas is critical for ensuring drinking water safety this study found that the diversity of cho molecular formulas increased after algae laden water treatment by plasma oxidation but that of chno decreased more importantly the plasma treatment significantly reduced the numbers of macromolecular dbps 912 c dbps and 736 n dbps were still detected and c11hnomclx and c18hnnmozclx were the most abundant substitution of one or more cl atoms was predicted to be the main pathways for macromolecular dbps formulas in general the plasma treatment is an alternative option to control the formulas of macromolecular dbps from aom although more than 60 of c dbps and n dbps in the three different aom samples were removed by the plasma treatment unlike nom the content of n dbps from aom was higher than that from nom due to the high content of aliphatic protein compounds resulting in still high toxicity after plasma cl2 treatment future studies should be conducted to evaluate the toxic effects of the new macromolecular dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15981,chloronitrobenzenes cnbs are typical refractory aromatic pollutants the reduction products of cnbs often possess higher toxicity and the electron withdrawing substituent groups are detrimental to the ring opening during the oxidation treatment leading to ineffective removal of cnbs by either reduction or oxidation technology herein we demonstrate a controllable reduction oxidation coupling roc process composed of zero valent iron zvi and h2o2 for the effective removal of cnbs from both water and soil in water zvi first reduced p cnb into 4 chloronitrosobenzene and 4 chloroaniline intermediates which were then suffered from the subsequent oxidative ring opening by oh generated from the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 by controlling the addition time of h2o2 the final mineralization rate of p cnb reached 6 6 10 1 h 1 about 74 times that of oxidation alone 9 0 10 3 h 1 more importantly this controllable roc process was also applicable for the site remediation of cnbs contaminated soil by either ex situ treatment or in situ injection and respectively decreased the concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb from 1105 980 and 94 mg kg to 3 1 and 1mg kg meeting the remediation goals p cnb 32 35 mg kg o cnb and m cnb 1 98 mg kg these laboratory and field trial results reveal that this controllable roc strategy is very promising for the treatment of electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reduction oxidation coupling zero valent iron h2o2 chloronitrobenzenes environmental remediation 1 introduction chloronitrobenzenes cnbs as fundamental chemical intermediates during the production of dyes corrosion inhibitors pesticides and drugs have aroused severe environment and health concerns due to their high toxicity mutagenicity and potential carcinogenicity jones et al 2006 luan et al 2015 guo et al 2005 jiang et al 2016 hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation processes are often used to remediate cnbs contamination because of its high redox potential e0 2 7 ev yuan et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 ma et al 2021 nevertheless oh alone cannot efficiently degrade these refractory aromatic pollutants because the electron withdrawing nitro and chlorine groups can weaken the electron cloud density around aromatic ring which is detrimental to the oxidative ring opening by electrophilic attack of oh shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 although the nitro and chlorine groups of cnbs are easily attacked by reductive species e g electron reactive hydrogen h to generate chloroanilines can and or aniline an products these aniline products are more toxic than the parent compounds suggesting that the reduction process alone could not remove cnbs safely lacorte et al 2000 agrawal et al 1995 zhu et al 2012 given that reduction process might break the barriers electron withdrawing groups in oxidative ring opening coupling reduction and oxidation processes sheds light on efficient cnbs remediation mantha et al 2002 generally reduction and oxidation reactions can take place at the same time in many advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis and electrochemical technology by simultaneously generating reductive species electron and h etc and oxidative species hole and oh etc zhang et al 2019 2021 sun et al 2012 ma et al 2021a b unfortunately these reduction and oxidation reactions are not easily controlled to achieve effective coupling of reduction and oxidation processes for pollutant removal and environmental remediation especially in real environments with complicated media zhang et al 2021 tang et al 2021 yu et al 2021 2022 therefore it is of great significance to develop controllable reduction oxidation coupling roc processes for the treatment of electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminates in this study we demonstrate that the combination of zero valent iron and h2o2 zvi h2o2 delivers a controllable roc process by simply tuning the addition time of h2o2 this zvi h2o2 based roc process was employed to remove p cnb from water and remediate cnbs contaminated soil either by ex situ treatment and in situ injection the controllable roc mechanism and the p cnb mineralization pathway in the zvi h2o2 process were investigated in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials zvi 100 mesh 4

technology co ltd tianjin china 1 mol l of naoh and h2so4 aqueous solutions were utilized to adjust the ph value of reaction solution 2 2 batch removal of p cnb from water the batch removal experiments of p cnb from water were performed in conical glass flasks typically 50 ml of p cnb aqueous solution 0 1 mmol l was mixed with 25 Î¼l h2o2 30 wt at initial ph 3 0 followed by adding 40 mg of zvi 0 716 mmol of fe to initiate the reaction in fenton process 40 mg zvi was replaced by 199 mg of feso4 7h2o 0 716 mmol of fe subsequently the conical flasks were quickly transferred into a shaker with a speed of 200 rpm min the solutions were sampled out at regular time intervals and filtered immediately through a 0 22 Î¼m nylon syringe filter to remove solid components then 0 1 ml of ethanol was added to 0 9 ml of filtered solution to prevent further oxidation reaction to tune the zvi h2o2 process for p cnb mineralization 25 Î¼l h2o2 30 wt was respectively added at 1 h 2 h and 3 h to trigger oxidation process after the addition of zvi the total reaction time was also set as 4 h 2 3 field trial of cnbs contaminated soil remediation for in situ remediation process 2 0 kg m3 of industrial zvi 617 t purchased from gongyi henan province china suspension was injected into specific depth of 5 m 7 m 9 m 11 m and 12 5 m by high pressure rotary jet equipment geoprobe to initiate zvi pre reduction process three days later 25 kg m3 of h2o2 27 277 t purchased from yinfei environmental protection technology co ltd china was injected into the same depth to trigger oxidation process the total remediation time was 6 days for ex situ remediation process the contaminated soil located in the depth of 3 m to 5 m was exacted by excavator subsequently 4 kg m3 industrial zvi was uniformly mixed with exacted soil to initiate zvi pre reduction process three days later 30 kg m3 h2o2 was added to trigger the oxidation process the total reaction time was also set as 6 days the concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb were detected by anhui sep analytical services co ltd the differences between zvi aladdin and zvi industrial such as the bet surface area particle size and fe 0 content were provided in fig s1 2 4 analytic methods the concentrations of p cnb p cnsb p can were measured using hplc lc 20at shimadzu japan text s1 the degradation intermediates of p cnb were

potential eh of soil was measured by inserting eh meter phs 3e inesa china 2 3 cm below the soil surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 construction of zvi h2o2 based roc process the prerequisite for constructing an efficient zvi h2o2 based roc process is to ensure that zvi is capable of reductively destroying the electron withdrawing groups of p cnb and efficiently activating h2o2 for the production of oh as shown in fig 1a 75 of p cnb was reductively removed by zvi within 4 h with p can as terminal products and p cnsb as a reductive intermediate fig s2 the sum of these three species p cnb p cnsb and p can gave a good mass balance of 87 confirming that p cnsb and p can were the major reductive species of p cnb in zvi reduction process subsequently the h2o2 activation ability of zvi was checked with epr with dmpo as the spin trapping agent the particular quartet lines with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the dmpo oh adduct zhou et al 2020 appeared in the epr spectra of zvi h2o2 process fig 1b suggesting that zvi could effectively activate h2o2 to produce oh to verify that the destruction of electron withdrawing nitro during reduction process can break the barriers of p cnb mineralization in the oh oxidation process we measured the mineralization rates of p cnb and its reductive products of p cnsb and p can during a traditional fenton fe2 h2o2 oxidation process for comparison fig 1c as expected the kinetic rates of oh oxidation for p cnsb and p can mineralization were respectively 4 5 10 3 min 1 and 6 9 10 3 min 1 about 7 and 10 times that of parent p cnb 6 8 10 4 min 1 these results revealed that the combination of zvi and h2o2 might offer an effective roc process fig 1d to check the ability of this zvi h2o2 based roc process to treat p cnb we thus compared the p cnb degradation and toc removal performances of zvi h2o2 with those of traditional fenton oxidation process as shown in fig 1e the fenton oxidation process removed 90 0 of p cnb in 4 h accompanying with a tiny mineralization ratio of 4 4 and the generation of many toxic intermediates such as 3 4 dichlorophenol 1 4 cyclohexanediol and 3 4 5 trichloro benzenediol fig s3 and table s1 impressively 99 9 of p cnb and 47 5 of toc were removed by the roc process the p cnb mineralization rate of roc process was 1 6 10 1 h 1 fig s4 over 17 times that 9 0 10 3 h 1 of fenton oxidation process alone to compare the contribution of oh to the toc removal of roc and fenton oxidation processes we defined Îµ oh as the removed amount of toc per molar oh g mol to represent the efficiency of oh in mineralizing pollutants according to the toc removal ratios and accumulative oh concentrations fig s5 the calculated Îµ oh of roc process was 3 02 g mol 9 2 times that 0 33 g mol of fenton oxidation process fig 1f obviously the pre reduction effect of zvi toward p cnb in roc process significantly improved its Îµ oh confirming that this zvi h2o2 based roc process was very promising for p cnb remediation 3 2 controllability of zvi h2o2 based roc process we checked the controllability of zvi h2o2 based roc process to couple zvi reduction and oh oxidation by tuning the addition time of h2o2 from 0 h to 3 h within the total reaction time of 4 h corresponding to roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes fig 2a the addition time of h2o2 could determine the pre reduction time of p cnb which might influence the Îµ oh of the following oxidation process thereby tuning the p cnb mineralization performance of roc processes although all the four roc processes of different h2o2 addition time could effectively remove p cnb within 4 h fig s6 their mineralization performances were significantly different and their toc removal ratios were respectively 47 5 86 2 68 7 and 50 0 for roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes fig 2b the p cnb mineralization kinetic rates of roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes were 6 6 10 1 h 1 5 7 10 1 h 1 and 6 3 10 1 h 1 which were respectively 4 1 3 6 and 3 9 times that of roc 0 1 6 10 1 h 1 fig s7 obviously tuning the addition time of h2o2 in zvi h2o2 roc process is very effective to adjust its performance for p cnb treatment although 32 0 of p cnb was pre reduced to p cnsb and p can in roc 1 process significantly lower than those in roc 2 50 0 and roc 3 65 5 processes its final p cnb mineralization efficiency 86 2 was much higher than those of roc 2 68 7 and roc 3 50 0 processes even though we extended the oxidation time of roc 2 and roc 3 processes from 2 h and 1 h to 3 h their mineralization ratios only increased from 68 7 to 72 7 for roc 2 process and from 50 0 to 56 0 for roc 3 process ruling out that different oxidation time accounted for their different final mineralization efficiencies fig s8 regarding that the production of oh in oxidation process is crucial for the final mineralization performance of different roc processes we employed the hydroxylation of ba to p hba as a probe reaction to quantify their accumulative oh concentrations which were about 1 1 1 8 1 3 and 0 9 mmol l for roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes fig 2c respectively accordingly the Îµ oh of roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 were respectively 3 0 3 5 3 9 and 4 0 g mol which were positively correlated with their pre reduction time r2 0 96 fig s9 these results highlighted that altering h2o2 addition time in zvi h2o2 roc processes could simultaneously tune the oh production and the Îµ oh to effectively couple zvi reduction and oh oxidation for highly efficient p cnb treatment this conclusion could be further evidenced by the higher mineralization performance and Îµ oh of roc 1 process for the nb and 4 cp removal than that of fenton and uncontrolled roc processes fig s10 3 3 controllable reduction oxidation coupling mechanism of zvi h2o2 to clarify the controllable reduction oxidation coupling mechanism of zvi h2o2 process we further checked the influence of h2o2 addition time on the oh production in detail the addition of bpy a strong chelating agent for fe ii inhibited the production of oh completely figs s11 and s12 confirming that fe ii was responsible for the conversion of h2o2 to oh cheng et al 2016 li et al 2021 therefore the controllable oh production of roc process might be associated with the tunable generation of fe ii sem images revealed that the surface of zvi was stepwise coated by the corrosion products fig 3a d which were identified as magnetite and lepidocrocite by xrd patterns fig s13 obviously the accumulation of these iron hydr oxides on zvi surface would inevitably inhibit the fe ii generation from the iron core he et al 2016 hu et al 2019 regarding that both surface bound and dissolved fe ii could activate h2o2 for the production of oh ai et al 2013 yoon et al 2016 we first performed high resolution hr fe 2p xps spectra of zvi to probe surface bound fe ii after deconvolution the peaks located at 710 4 ev and 723 9 ev were assigned to surface bound fe ii fan et al 2013 shen et al 2016 through the calculation of integral areas the molar ratios of surface bound fe ii fetotal on the surface of zvi were 39 9 68 2 61 9 and 56 9 for the pre reduction time of 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 h respectively fig 3e h the temporal concentration of surface fe ii and dissolved fe ii with different pre reduction time followed the order of 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h which agreed well with that of xps results these results strongly confirmed that tuning the addition time of h2o2 could optimize the fe ii concentration to promote the h2o2 activation performance of zvi correspondingly the h2o2 decomposition rate constants in roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes were 2 4 h 1 3 4 h 1 2 6 h 1 and 2 2 h 1 fig s14 benefiting from the simultaneous enhancement of oh concentration and Îµ oh the roc 1 process exhibited the best performance on coupling zvi reduction and oh oxidation to treat p cnb moreover by monitoring the temporal concentration of surface and dissolved fe ii we concluded that surface fe ii was the major reactive species for h2o2 activation especially in alkaline conditions fig s15 3 4 p cnb mineralization pathway to decode the mineralization pathway of p cnb in the roc 1 process scheme 1 we performed gc ms to further identify the intermediates at the pre reduction stage 1 h and the subsequent oxidation stage 3 h four reductive intermediates including p cnsb 4 chlorophenylhydroxylamine 4 4 dichloroazoxybenzene and p can were detected at the reduction stage of roc 1 process fig s16 obviously the electron withdrawing nitro group was stepwise transformed into electron donating amido one improving the electron cloud density of benzene ring to thereby break the barriers in oxidative ring opening by oh the subsequent h2o2 addition triggered the generation of oh from the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 to preferentially attack the reduction products p cnsb and p can for their ring opening producing 4 chlorophenol n hexylic acid oxalic acid in sequence fig s17 which were then completely mineralized as cl no3 co2 and h2o fig s18 3 5 the influence of initial ph and h2o2 dosage on controllable roc process the ph tolerance of controllable roc process is a critical concern for practical application along with ph increase from 3 to 9 the p cnb mineralization gradually decreased from 86 2 to 34 9 for the roc 1 process fig s19 accompanied with the mineralization rate constants 4 0 3 8 2 4 and 2 1 times that of corresponding roc 0 process at initial ph of 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 respectively these results confirmed that the controllable roc process could promote p cnb mineralization under different ph conditions besides initial ph the h2o2 dosage was also an important parameter associated with the application of controllable roc process as shown in fig s20 the h2o2 dosage increased from 1 mmol l to 5 mmol l would improve the mineralization performance of roc 1 process toward p cnb however the excess h2o2 dosage of 7 mmol l and 9 mmol l decreased the performance of roc 1 process toward p cnb even though more oh was generated in cases of 7 mmol l and 9 mmol l than that in 5 mmol l both the efficiency of oh and the production of oh determined the p cnb mineralization performance of roc process the excess h2o2 dosage did not influence the p cnb pre reduction process from 0 h to 1 h of zvi but h2o2 would compete the electrons released from zvi inhibiting the reduction performance of zvi toward p cnb during reduction oxidation process from 1 h to 4 h 3 6 field trial of cnbs contaminated soil remediation inspired by the excellent p cnb removal performance of zvi h2o2 based roc process in water we applied this technology to remediate real chloronitrobenzenes contaminated soil the contaminated site was located at bengbu city anhui province china near the huai river fig 4 a to acquire remediation engineering data we collected contaminated soil from the worst contaminated area 3 5 m which was labeled as black square in fig 4a the ph of the soil was 8 02 the collected contaminated soil was first treated with a controllable roc process in laboratory fig s21 and text s8 after 3 days of pre reduction and 3 days of subsequent reduction oxidation the concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb decreased from 5590 2 to 0 8 mg kg 17 4 to 0 2 mg kg and 2145 6 to 0 8 mg kg fig 4b respectively as expected all the cnbs concentrations of treated soil were below the remediation goals p cnb 32 35 mg l m cnb and o cnb 1 98 mg l in contrast after the 6 days treatment of the uncontrolled counterpart process of simultaneous zvi and h2o2 addition without pre reduction the final concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb were respectively 121 7 3 2 and 16 6 mg kg much higher than those of controllable roc process and the remediation goals of p cnb and m cnb fig s22 for comparison we also treated the contaminated soil with traditional persulfate sodium hydroxide ps naoh oxidation process and found the final concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb in ps naoh treated soil were 1054 7 8 2 and 566 5 mg kg far exceeding the remediation goals although the reagents cost 65 4 t of ps naoh process was 3 3 times that 19 7 t of zvi h2o2 based roc process table s2 obviously the great balance between reactivity and cost endows zvi h2o2 based roc technology high potential for the real site remediation to decode removal pathway of cnbs in real soil by the controllable roc process we detected the temporal concentration of p can a typical reductive intermediate of p cnb the zvi h2o2 3 3 day process first reduced p cnb as destabilized p can from 44 8 mg kg to 1605 mg kg and then degraded it from 1605 5 mg kg to 0 4 mg kg in the following oxidation process from 3 day to 6 day fig 4c obviously surface fe ii dissolved fe ii was not monitored could activate h2o2 for oh generation figs s23 and 4d thereby constructing a oxidative condition for pollutants degradation fig 4e as shown in fig 4f the toc of soil in zvi h2o2 3 3 day process decreased from 59 9 g kg to 39 3 g kg the removal of toc was much higher than that of zvi h2o2 0 6 day process from 62 0 g kg to 55 6 g kg these results validated the controllable roc process could efficiently treat cnbs contamination both in aqueous solution and soil it is pivotal to use a simple indicator to control the addition time of h2o2 during controllable roc process being implemented in real scenarios as shown in fig 3e i the highest fe ii concentration corresponded to the addition time of h2o2 of the optimized roc process roc 1 in aqueous reaction to validate that fe ii is capable of indexing the addition time of h2o2 in real soil remediation we detected temporal fe ii concentration including surface fe ii and dissolved fe ii of zvi soil process as shown in fig 4g dissolved fe ii was not detected and the surface fe ii concentration reached a balance point at 3 day correspondingly zvi h2o2 3 3 day process was the only one that could decrease all cnbs below the rgs both aqueous solution and soil scenarios indicated that fe ii is capable of indexing the addition time of h2o2 in controllable roc process moreover the controllable zvi h2o2 process did not disturb the local environment in real scenario as shown in fig 4h and i the contents of ps fe ii limonite and hematite in remediated soil were significantly higher than that of untreated soil 18 4 4 1 and 0 table s3 indicating that zvi could transform into ps fe ii limonite and hematite during soil remediation yu et al 2019 chen et al 2017 afterward we develop an in situ injection zvi h2o2 based roc technology for real site remediation first industrial zvi suspension was injected into the sites with specific depth of 5 m 7 m 9 m 11 m and 12 5 m by a high pressure rotary jet equipment geoprobe fig 5a to initiate zvi pre reduction process figs s24 and s25 after 3 days of reduction we triggered the oxidation process by injecting h2o2 27 into the sites of the same depth as those of injected zvi suspension after another 3 days of subsequent oxidation the concentrations of p cnb at sites of 5 m 7 m 9 m 11 m and 12 5 m decreased from 1105 4 to 92 6 mg kg 31 3 to 21 4 mg kg 609 7 to 18 3 mg kg 8 5 to 3 2 mg kg and 0 6 to 0 2 mg kg fig 5b respectively apart from the site of 5 m the p cnb concentration of all other sites were below the remediation goals similar results were obtained for the remediation of o cnb and m cnb fig s26 subsequently we adopted ex situ treatment technology to remediate the exceptional site of 5 m fig 5c after another turn of 3 days of reduction and 3 days of subsequent oxidation the concentrations of p cnb 165 3 mg kg o cnb 212 6 mg kg and m cnb 6 4 mg kg at the exceptional site of 5 m were respectively decreased to 2 8 1 1 and 0 2 mg kg far lower than the remediation goals fig 5d this successful field trial reveals this controllable zvi h2o2 based roc technology can treat electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminated soil by either ex situ treatment or in situ remediation fig 5e and f 4 conclusion in this study we have shown that the combination of zvi and h2o2 delivers a roc process for effective cnbs remediation an important significance of this study is to provide a fundamental view to understand recent advances in the excellent remediation performance of zvi based oxidation process zvi h2o2 zvi o2 and zvi ps etc for electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminates cnbs nitrobenzene and p chlorophenol etc li and zhu 2014 le et al 2011 qin et al 2021 kang et al 2019 our results also show that the performance of zvi h2o2 based roc process is controlled by the addition time of h2o2 understanding the importance of h2o2 addition time on the reduction process and oh production is critical for effectively coupling zvi reduction and oh oxidation the controllability of zvi h2o2 based roc process is vital to realize the real field remediation with higher efficiency and lower reagent dosage benefiting from the excellent reactivity toward p cnb easy to operation and low cost this controllable roc technology is highly promising for site remediation of electron

15981,chloronitrobenzenes cnbs are typical refractory aromatic pollutants the reduction products of cnbs often possess higher toxicity and the electron withdrawing substituent groups are detrimental to the ring opening during the oxidation treatment leading to ineffective removal of cnbs by either reduction or oxidation technology herein we demonstrate a controllable reduction oxidation coupling roc process composed of zero valent iron zvi and h2o2 for the effective removal of cnbs from both water and soil in water zvi first reduced p cnb into 4 chloronitrosobenzene and 4 chloroaniline intermediates which were then suffered from the subsequent oxidative ring opening by oh generated from the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 by controlling the addition time of h2o2 the final mineralization rate of p cnb reached 6 6 10 1 h 1 about 74 times that of oxidation alone 9 0 10 3 h 1 more importantly this controllable roc process was also applicable for the site remediation of cnbs contaminated soil by either ex situ treatment or in situ injection and respectively decreased the concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb from 1105 980 and 94 mg kg to 3 1 and 1mg kg meeting the remediation goals p cnb 32 35 mg kg o cnb and m cnb 1 98 mg kg these laboratory and field trial results reveal that this controllable roc strategy is very promising for the treatment of electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reduction oxidation coupling zero valent iron h2o2 chloronitrobenzenes environmental remediation 1 introduction chloronitrobenzenes cnbs as fundamental chemical intermediates during the production of dyes corrosion inhibitors pesticides and drugs have aroused severe environment and health concerns due to their high toxicity mutagenicity and potential carcinogenicity jones et al 2006 luan et al 2015 guo et al 2005 jiang et al 2016 hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation processes are often used to remediate cnbs contamination because of its high redox potential e0 2 7 ev yuan et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 ma et al 2021 nevertheless oh alone cannot efficiently degrade these refractory aromatic pollutants because the electron withdrawing nitro and chlorine groups can weaken the electron cloud density around aromatic ring which is detrimental to the oxidative ring opening by electrophilic attack of oh shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 although the nitro and chlorine groups of cnbs are easily attacked by reductive species e g electron reactive hydrogen h to generate chloroanilines can and or aniline an products these aniline products are more toxic than the parent compounds suggesting that the reduction process alone could not remove cnbs safely lacorte et al 2000 agrawal et al 1995 zhu et al 2012 given that reduction process might break the barriers electron withdrawing groups in oxidative ring opening coupling reduction and oxidation processes sheds light on efficient cnbs remediation mantha et al 2002 generally reduction and oxidation reactions can take place at the same time in many advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis and electrochemical technology by simultaneously generating reductive species electron and h etc and oxidative species hole and oh etc zhang et al 2019 2021 sun et al 2012 ma et al 2021a b unfortunately these reduction and oxidation reactions are not easily controlled to achieve effective coupling of reduction and oxidation processes for pollutant removal and environmental remediation especially in real environments with complicated media zhang et al 2021 tang et al 2021 yu et al 2021 2022 therefore it is of great significance to develop controllable reduction oxidation coupling roc processes for the treatment of electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminates in this study we demonstrate that the combination of zero valent iron and h2o2 zvi h2o2 delivers a controllable roc process by simply tuning the addition time of h2o2 this zvi h2o2 based roc process was employed to remove p cnb from water and remediate cnbs contaminated soil either by ex situ treatment and in situ

cnb p cnsb and p can gave a good mass balance of 87 confirming that p cnsb and p can were the major reductive species of p cnb in zvi reduction process subsequently the h2o2 activation ability of zvi was checked with epr with dmpo as the spin trapping agent the particular quartet lines with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the dmpo oh adduct zhou et al 2020 appeared in the epr spectra of zvi h2o2 process fig 1b suggesting that zvi could effectively activate h2o2 to produce oh to verify that the destruction of electron withdrawing nitro during reduction process can break the barriers of p cnb mineralization in the oh oxidation process we measured the mineralization rates of p cnb and its reductive products of p cnsb and p can during a traditional fenton fe2 h2o2 oxidation process for comparison fig 1c as expected the kinetic rates of oh oxidation for p cnsb and p can mineralization were respectively 4 5 10 3 min 1 and 6 9 10 3 min 1 about 7 and 10 times that of parent p cnb 6 8 10 4 min 1 these results revealed that the combination of zvi and h2o2 might offer an effective roc process fig 1d to check the ability of this zvi h2o2 based roc process to treat p cnb we thus compared the p cnb degradation and toc removal performances of zvi h2o2 with those of traditional fenton oxidation process as shown in fig 1e the fenton oxidation process removed 90 0 of p cnb in 4 h accompanying with a tiny mineralization ratio of 4 4 and the generation of many toxic intermediates such as 3 4 dichlorophenol 1 4 cyclohexanediol and 3 4 5 trichloro benzenediol fig s3 and table s1 impressively 99 9 of p cnb and 47 5 of toc were removed by the roc process the p cnb mineralization rate of roc process was 1 6 10 1 h 1 fig s4 over 17 times that 9 0 10 3 h 1 of fenton oxidation process alone to compare the contribution of oh to the toc removal of roc and fenton oxidation processes we defined Îµ oh as the removed amount of toc per molar oh g mol to represent the efficiency of oh in mineralizing pollutants according to the toc removal ratios and accumulative oh concentrations fig s5 the calculated Îµ oh of roc process was 3 02 g mol 9 2 times that 0 33 g mol of fenton oxidation process fig 1f obviously the pre reduction effect of zvi toward p cnb in roc process significantly improved its Îµ oh confirming that this zvi h2o2 based roc process was very promising for p cnb remediation 3 2 controllability of zvi h2o2 based roc process we checked the controllability of zvi h2o2 based roc process to couple zvi reduction and oh oxidation by tuning the addition time of h2o2 from 0 h to 3 h within the total reaction time of 4 h corresponding to roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes fig 2a the addition time of h2o2 could determine the pre reduction time of p cnb which might influence the Îµ oh of the following oxidation process thereby tuning the p cnb mineralization performance of roc processes although all the four roc processes of different h2o2 addition time could effectively remove p cnb within 4 h fig s6 their mineralization performances were significantly different and their toc removal ratios were respectively 47 5 86 2 68 7 and 50 0 for roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes fig 2b the p cnb mineralization kinetic rates of roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes were 6 6 10 1 h 1 5 7 10 1 h 1 and 6 3 10 1 h 1 which were respectively 4 1 3 6 and 3 9 times that of roc 0 1 6 10 1 h 1 fig s7 obviously tuning the addition time of h2o2 in zvi h2o2 roc process is very effective to adjust its performance for p cnb treatment although 32 0 of p cnb was pre reduced to p cnsb and p can in roc 1 process significantly lower than those in roc 2 50 0 and roc 3 65 5 processes its final p cnb mineralization efficiency 86 2 was much higher than those of roc 2 68 7 and roc 3 50 0 processes even though we extended the oxidation time of roc 2 and roc 3 processes from 2 h and 1 h to 3 h their mineralization ratios only increased from 68 7 to 72 7 for roc 2 process and from 50 0 to 56 0 for roc 3 process ruling out that different oxidation time accounted for their different final mineralization efficiencies fig s8 regarding that the production of oh in oxidation process is crucial for the final mineralization performance of different roc processes we employed the hydroxylation of ba to p hba as a probe reaction to quantify their accumulative oh concentrations which were about 1 1 1 8 1 3 and 0 9 mmol l for roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes fig 2c respectively accordingly the Îµ oh of roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 were respectively 3 0 3 5 3 9 and 4 0 g mol which were positively correlated with their pre reduction time r2 0 96 fig s9 these results highlighted that altering h2o2 addition time in zvi h2o2 roc processes could simultaneously tune the oh production and the Îµ oh to effectively couple zvi reduction and oh oxidation for highly efficient p cnb treatment this conclusion could be further evidenced by the higher mineralization performance and Îµ oh of roc 1 process for the nb and 4 cp removal than that of fenton and uncontrolled roc processes fig s10 3 3 controllable reduction oxidation coupling mechanism of zvi h2o2 to clarify the controllable reduction oxidation coupling mechanism of zvi h2o2 process we further checked the influence of h2o2 addition time on the oh production in detail the addition of bpy a strong chelating agent for fe ii inhibited the production of oh completely figs s11 and s12 confirming that fe ii was responsible for the conversion of h2o2 to oh cheng et al 2016 li et al 2021 therefore the controllable oh production of roc process might be associated with the tunable generation of fe ii sem images revealed that the surface of zvi was stepwise coated by the corrosion products fig 3a d which were identified as magnetite and lepidocrocite by xrd patterns fig s13 obviously the accumulation of these iron hydr oxides on zvi surface would inevitably inhibit the fe ii generation from the iron core he et al 2016 hu et al 2019 regarding that both surface bound and dissolved fe ii could activate h2o2 for the production of oh ai et al 2013 yoon et al 2016 we first performed high resolution hr fe 2p xps spectra of zvi to probe surface bound fe ii after deconvolution the peaks located at 710 4 ev and 723 9 ev were assigned to surface bound fe ii fan et al 2013 shen et al 2016 through the calculation of integral areas the molar ratios of surface bound fe ii fetotal on the surface of zvi were 39 9 68 2 61 9 and 56 9 for the pre reduction time of 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 h respectively fig 3e h the temporal concentration of surface fe ii and dissolved fe ii with different pre reduction time followed the order of 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h which agreed well with that of xps results these results strongly confirmed that tuning the addition time of h2o2 could optimize the fe ii concentration to promote the h2o2 activation performance of zvi correspondingly the h2o2 decomposition rate constants in roc 0 roc 1 roc 2 and roc 3 processes were 2 4 h 1 3 4 h 1 2 6 h 1 and 2 2 h 1 fig s14 benefiting from the simultaneous enhancement of oh concentration and Îµ oh the roc 1 process exhibited the best performance on coupling zvi reduction and oh oxidation to treat p cnb moreover by monitoring the temporal concentration of surface and dissolved fe ii we concluded that surface fe ii was the major reactive species for h2o2 activation especially in alkaline conditions fig s15 3 4 p cnb mineralization pathway to decode the mineralization pathway of p cnb in the roc 1 process scheme 1 we performed gc ms to further identify the intermediates at the pre reduction stage 1 h and the subsequent oxidation stage 3 h four reductive intermediates including p cnsb 4 chlorophenylhydroxylamine 4 4 dichloroazoxybenzene and p can were detected at the reduction stage of roc 1 process fig s16 obviously the electron withdrawing nitro group was stepwise transformed into electron donating amido one improving the electron cloud density of benzene ring to thereby break the barriers in oxidative ring opening by oh the subsequent h2o2 addition triggered the generation of oh from the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 to preferentially attack the reduction products p cnsb and p can for their ring opening producing 4 chlorophenol n hexylic acid oxalic acid in sequence fig s17 which were then completely mineralized as cl no3 co2 and h2o fig s18 3 5 the influence of initial ph and h2o2 dosage on controllable roc process the ph tolerance of controllable roc process is a critical concern for practical application along with ph increase from 3 to 9 the p cnb mineralization gradually decreased from 86 2 to 34 9 for the roc 1 process fig s19 accompanied with the mineralization rate constants 4 0 3 8 2 4 and 2 1 times that of corresponding roc 0 process at initial ph of 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 respectively these results confirmed that the controllable roc process could promote p cnb mineralization under different ph conditions besides initial ph the h2o2 dosage was also an important parameter associated with the application of controllable roc process as shown in fig s20 the h2o2 dosage increased from 1 mmol l to 5 mmol l would improve the mineralization performance of roc 1 process toward p cnb however the excess h2o2 dosage of 7 mmol l and 9 mmol l decreased the performance of roc 1 process toward p cnb even though more oh was generated in cases of 7 mmol l and 9 mmol l than that in 5 mmol l both the efficiency of oh and the production of oh determined the p cnb mineralization performance of roc process the excess h2o2 dosage did not influence the p cnb pre reduction process from 0 h to 1 h of zvi but h2o2 would compete the electrons released from zvi inhibiting the reduction performance of zvi toward p cnb during reduction oxidation process from 1 h to 4 h 3 6 field trial of cnbs contaminated soil remediation inspired by the excellent p cnb removal performance of zvi h2o2 based roc process in water we applied this technology to remediate real chloronitrobenzenes contaminated soil the contaminated site was located at bengbu city anhui province china near the huai river fig 4 a to acquire remediation engineering data we collected contaminated soil from the worst contaminated area 3 5 m which was labeled as black square in fig 4a the ph of the soil was 8 02 the collected contaminated soil was first treated with a controllable roc process in laboratory fig s21 and text s8 after 3 days of pre reduction and 3 days of subsequent reduction oxidation the concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb decreased from 5590 2 to 0 8 mg kg 17 4 to 0 2 mg kg and 2145 6 to 0 8 mg kg fig 4b respectively as expected all the cnbs concentrations of treated soil were below the remediation goals p cnb 32 35 mg l m cnb and o cnb 1 98 mg l in contrast after the 6 days treatment of the uncontrolled counterpart process of simultaneous zvi and h2o2 addition without pre reduction the final concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb were respectively 121 7 3 2 and 16 6 mg kg much higher than those of controllable roc process and the remediation goals of p cnb and m cnb fig s22 for comparison we also treated the contaminated soil with traditional persulfate sodium hydroxide ps naoh oxidation process and found the final concentrations of p cnb m cnb and o cnb in ps naoh treated soil were 1054 7 8 2 and 566 5 mg kg far exceeding the remediation goals although the reagents cost 65 4 t of ps naoh process was 3 3 times that 19 7 t of zvi h2o2 based roc process table s2 obviously the great balance between reactivity and cost endows zvi h2o2 based roc technology high potential for the real site remediation to decode removal pathway of cnbs in real soil by the controllable roc process we detected the temporal concentration of p can a typical reductive intermediate of p cnb the zvi h2o2 3 3 day process first reduced p cnb as destabilized p can from 44 8 mg kg to 1605 mg kg and then degraded it from 1605 5 mg kg to 0 4 mg kg in the following oxidation process from 3 day to 6 day fig 4c obviously surface fe ii dissolved fe ii was not monitored could activate h2o2 for oh generation figs s23 and 4d thereby constructing a oxidative condition for pollutants degradation fig 4e as shown in fig 4f the toc of soil in zvi h2o2 3 3 day process decreased from 59 9 g kg to 39 3 g kg the removal of toc was much higher than that of zvi h2o2 0 6 day process from 62 0 g kg to 55 6 g kg these results validated the controllable roc process could efficiently treat cnbs contamination both in aqueous solution and soil it is pivotal to use a simple indicator to control the addition time of h2o2 during controllable roc process being implemented in real scenarios as shown in fig 3e i the highest fe ii concentration corresponded to the addition time of h2o2 of the optimized roc process roc 1 in aqueous reaction to validate that fe ii is capable of indexing the addition time of h2o2 in real soil remediation we detected temporal fe ii concentration including surface fe ii and dissolved fe ii of zvi soil process as shown in fig 4g dissolved fe ii was not detected and the surface fe ii concentration reached a balance point at 3 day correspondingly zvi h2o2 3 3 day process was the only one that could decrease all cnbs below the rgs both aqueous solution and soil scenarios indicated that fe ii is capable of indexing the addition time of h2o2 in controllable roc process moreover the controllable zvi h2o2 process did not disturb the local environment in real scenario as shown in fig 4h and i the contents of ps fe ii limonite and hematite in remediated soil were significantly higher than that of untreated soil 18 4 4 1 and 0 table s3 indicating that zvi could transform into ps fe ii limonite and hematite during soil remediation yu et al 2019 chen et al 2017 afterward we develop an in situ injection zvi h2o2 based roc technology for real site remediation first industrial zvi suspension was injected into the sites with specific depth of 5 m 7 m 9 m 11 m and 12 5 m by a high pressure rotary jet equipment geoprobe fig 5a to initiate zvi pre reduction process figs s24 and s25 after 3 days of reduction we triggered the oxidation process by injecting h2o2 27 into the sites of the same depth as those of injected zvi suspension after another 3 days of subsequent oxidation the concentrations of p cnb at sites of 5 m 7 m 9 m 11 m and 12 5 m decreased from 1105 4 to 92 6 mg kg 31 3 to 21 4 mg kg 609 7 to 18 3 mg kg 8 5 to 3 2 mg kg and 0 6 to 0 2 mg kg fig 5b respectively apart from the site of 5 m the p cnb concentration of all other sites were below the remediation goals similar results were obtained for the remediation of o cnb and m cnb fig s26 subsequently we adopted ex situ treatment technology to remediate the exceptional site of 5 m fig 5c after another turn of 3 days of reduction and 3 days of subsequent oxidation the concentrations of p cnb 165 3 mg kg o cnb 212 6 mg kg and m cnb 6 4 mg kg at the exceptional site of 5 m were respectively decreased to 2 8 1 1 and 0 2 mg kg far lower than the remediation goals fig 5d this successful field trial reveals this controllable zvi h2o2 based roc technology can treat electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminated soil by either ex situ treatment or in situ remediation fig 5e and f 4 conclusion in this study we have shown that the combination of zvi and h2o2 delivers a roc process for effective cnbs remediation an important significance of this study is to provide a fundamental view to understand recent advances in the excellent remediation performance of zvi based oxidation process zvi h2o2 zvi o2 and zvi ps etc for electron withdrawing groups substituted aromatic contaminates cnbs nitrobenzene and p chlorophenol etc li and zhu 2014 le et al 2011 qin et al 2021 kang et al 2019 our results also show that the performance of zvi h2o2 based roc process is controlled by the addition time of h2o2 understanding the importance of h2o2 addition time on the reduction process and oh production is critical for effectively coupling zvi reduction and oh oxidation the controllability of zvi h2o2 based roc process is vital to realize the real field remediation with higher efficiency and lower reagent dosage benefiting from the excellent reactivity toward p cnb easy to operation and low cost this controllable roc technology is highly promising for site remediation of electron

15982,tetracycline tc has been frequently detected in various environments thus promoting the occurrence of resistance in bacterial populations in this study a suite of soybean straw biochars ssbs were fabricated under different pyrolysis temperatures 600 1000 c which were utilized as peroxydisulfate ps activators for tc degradation and tc resistant escherichia coli e coli disinfection the purification effect of ssbs ps systems manifested obvious positive dependence on pyrolysis temperature of ssbs with ssb1000 ps system obtained the superior tc degradation e coli disinfection and coexisting tc and e coli elimination capacity the leakage of intracellular dna and the degradation of total dna and extracellular dna was revealed no matter in alone e coli or combined pollution which can also be supported by the gradual ruptured bacterial morphology and attenuated internal components it can be found that tc adsorption in ssbs played a significant role on tc degradation while the electrostatic repulsion always existed between e coli and ssb1000 furthermore a battery of solid evidences collectively demonstrated the significant different purification mechanism of tc and e coli the tc degradation was achieved dominantly by surface bound radicals while bactericidal activity should be attributed to free so4 in bulk solutions in contrast to other ssbs the largest mesopore volumes highest c o content lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance and strongest electron donating capacity explained the outperformed catalytic performance of ssb1000 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline degradation antibiotic resistance bacteria disinfection biochar persulfate 1 introduction the abuse of antibiotics can vastly promote the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args which thereby significantly enrich the resistance in bacterial populations hong et al 2018 tan and shuai 2015 disturbingly args can persist in the environment and be distributed via horizontal gene transfer of mobile genetic elements mges to other pathogens and even can be incorporated into crops christou et al 2017 wang and chen 2020 which can result in the emergence of superbugs with multidrug resistance widely disseminating in ecosystems and posing a colossal threat to human singh et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop effective technologies to remove antibiotics and arb contaminations from wastewater before their discharge into the environment persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops that can generate diverse reactive oxygen species ros with strong oxidizing capacity have been widely adopted to degrade antibiotic pollutants exhibiting satisfactory performance miklos et al 2018 pan et al 2021 ps aops due to the high disinfection efficiency on viable pathogens and removal of args as well as adequate disinfection approach to alleviating bacterial resistance risks have constantly been clarified liu et al 2022 found that sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron and peroxymonosulfate pms system effectively inactivated both e coli dh5Î± and pseudomonas hls 6 within 15 min and reached 1 52 1 79 and 1 56 log removal effect of intracellular args sul1 inti1 and teta respectively moreover the three dimensional electrode galvanic cell enhanced fe ii ps system could achieve 7 88 log removal of antibiotic resistant e coli carries multiple args zhang et al 2019 the above outcomes suggest that ps aops hold great promise to be an alternative to the conventional disinfection processes regarding the coexisting emergence of antibiotics and arb args their simultaneous removal should be focused on and there are rare investigations conducted on the elimination of these coexisting target pollutants therein photo driven aops have been reported to effectively remove organics and arb args ahmed et al 2021 zhong et al 2022 as far as we know few studies have been conducted on eliminating coexisting antibiotics and bacteria resistant to these antibiotics by ps aops rodriguez chueca et al 2019 reported that uv c activated pms exhibited a satisfying removal performance for removing antibiotics above 90 with 0 22 log args removal in wwtp however the high energy consumption and inferior effect of args degradation by uv c activated ps aops restricted their large scale application when heterogeneous activators were introduced gao et al 2021 discovered that with the aid of visible light carbon defects g c3n4 ps system could not only remove total antibiotics but also achieve 6 3 log e coli and 6 8 log enterococcus faecalis inactivation effect as well as 2 5 log teta 2 8 log inti1 and 2 6 log 16s rrna reduction rates therefore heterogeneous activators may be an optimal candidate for ps activation to eliminate antibiotics and arb and args simultaneously although the respective elimination effect had been demonstrated by these above reports considering the distinct characters of antibiotics existing in dissolved state with molecular dimension of nano level while arb existing in suspended state with cell size of micro level it is reasonably speculated that a disparate antibiotic degradation and arb disinfection mechanism existed during the process of heterogeneous ps activation due to its well known various pathways including free radicals surface bound radicals sbrs 1o2 and mediated electron transfer in this work soybean straw was pyrolyzed at different temperatures from 600 to 1000 c to prepare a series of ssbs for activating ps to degrade tc and disinfected e coli containing the tc resistance gene tetb simultaneously the effects of different activators and ps systems on tc removal and arb inactivation were studied the underlying mechanism of tc removal by the ssb1000 ps system was disclosed via various methods including x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps tests quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments to verify the evolutionary process of arb scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were employed to assess the lethal efficiency cellular structure and morphology the potential mechanism of tc removal and e coli inactivation by ps aops was further explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents detailed information for all chemicals and reagents used was provided in table s1 2 2 preparation of ssbs the soybean glycine max straw biomass without roots was collected from a cropland in a suburb of yuanyang china 113 40 42 e 34 47 55 n it was washed 3 times and then dried for 6 h at 105 c after cooling the biomass was ground and sieved the powdered straw 60 mesh was pyrolyzed at five predetermined temperatures 600 700 800 900 and 1000 c under n2 atmosphere at a rate of 5 c min 1 and hold for 2 h the obtained black powders were ground and denoted as ssb600 ssb700 ssb800 ssb900 and ssb1000 respectively the characterization details of the samples were provided in text s1 2 3 tc removal experiment the tc removal experiment by the ssbs ps systems was conducted in a 50 ml beaker under natural light conditions in a water bath at 25 c with continuous magnetic stirring dalong ms h proa china for a typical experiment 6 mm ps and 1 g l 1 ssbs were added simultaneously into a suspension containing 20 mg l 1 tc to trigger the reaction at each time interval 0 1 2 4 6 8 10 and 15 min 1 ml aqueous solution was mixed with isovolumic absolute methanol meoh and filtered through 0 22 Î¼m filter and then the residual tc was detected by high performance liquid chromatography see text s2 for details as contrasts the removal effects of alone ps and alone ssbs were also tested the experiments were carried out in triplicate in addition the radical species in ssb1000 ps system were identified by adding different quenching agents while an epr spectrometer was used to recognize the generated reactive oxygen species ros see text s3 for details the intermediate analyses were conducted using a mass spectrometer and the details for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms method were described in si text s4 2 4 disinfection assay tc resistance e coli containing tetb purchased from bena culture collection xl1 blue 353805 was selected as the target arb the culture of e coli was illustrated in text s5 the bactericidal assays were maintained at 25 c without ph adjusting under magnetic stirring for an individual bactericidal experiment a 30 ml suspended mixture in a 50 ml beaker included 107 cfu ml 1 cell suspension then 6 mm ps and 1 g l 1 ssbs was added to trigger the reaction a mixture of 1 ml was pipetted out at a scheduled interval 0 45 90 135 180 min and the bacteria concentrations were determined by the standard plate count method lb agar plates 37 c for 24 h simultaneously the disinfection systems including alone ps and alone ssbs were conducted as contrasts respectively in addition a disinfection assay for the inactivation of bacteria in the co contaminated environment was conducted specifically the simultaneous elimination reaction was carried out under the coexisting of 20 mg l 1 tc with e coli 107 cfu ml 1 and the tc removal efficiency was measured as described in section 2 3 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the changes of target genes including 16s rrna tetb and integron inti1 were detected by qpcr as illustrated in text s6 and cell morphology and integrity analyses were described in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ssbs tem analyses figs 1 a b and s1 revealed the amorphous nature of the carbon phase specifically ssbs were featured with abundant micropore and mesopore structures and with the thermolysis temperature raising from 600 to 800 c the layer structure of ssbs became thinner and more micropores emerged with the further increase of carbonization temperature over 900 c the thinner layer structure collapsed resulting in the stacking of the lamellar structure in addition tem elemental mapping images revealed that carbon c oxygen o and nitrogen n were uniformly distributed on the surface of ssb1000 fig 1b the structures of ssbs were also furnished by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms simultaneously iv type isotherms with h4 hysteresis loop were observed fig 1c which was in accordance with the existence of micropores and mesoporous in the ssbs moreover the pore size distribution curves further manifested the hierarchical porous structures of ssbs fig 1d it could be clearly observed that the pore volume increased as the thermolysis temperature enhanced from 600 to 800 c while decreased when the temperature increased continuously the changes of specific pore structure parameters were listed in table s3 consistent with the tem observations all the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area sbet total pore volumes vtot and micropore volumes vmic of ssbs showed similar trends with elevated pyrolysis temperature and ssb800 exhibited the highest values it has been reported that higher pyrolysis temperature might induce the growth and shape regularization of the impurities however due to collapsing of micropores sbet decreased when pyrolysis temperature reached 900 c brown et al 2006 intriguingly the mesopore volumes vmes showed a positive correlation to the pyrolysis temperatures and ssb1000 harvested the largest vmes which could not only facilitate the adsorption of organics but also be conducive to exposing more active sites for surface catalytic reactions further creating beneficial conditions for ps activation tian et al 2020 two obvious peaks 2Î¸ at 23 and 43 in x ray powder diffractometer xrd patterns of ssbs fig 1e could be ascribed to the 002 and 100 planes of amorphous and crystalline carbons respectively zhu et al 2018 and the broadness of these reflections indicated the disordered amorphous property of ssbs several unexpected peaks at 29 39 and 48 were ascribed to the crystalline minerals of calcite jcpds 05 0586 that were derived from impurities in soybean straw biomass ye et al 2020 yuan et al 2011 the carbon structural characteristics of ssbs were further demonstrated by raman spectroscopy fig 1f the spectra of ssbs exhibited two main bands roughly at 1350 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 which were corresponded respectively to the defect sites or disordered sp2 hybridized carbons d band and the crystalline graphite structure in porous carbon g band herein id ig values can unveil the proportion of defects and disordered structures of carbon materials it could be seen that id ig value increased from 0 86 to 1 04 with the annealing temperature increased from 600 to 800 c implying that the formation of vast pores during the annealing process which were consistent with the tendency of sbet and vtot fu et al 2019 when pyrolysis temperature reached 900 c due to the cleavage of chemical bonds and simultaneous reconstruction of carbon substrate the reduction of structural disorder and higher graphitization were induced resulting in a lower id ig value as continuous rising annealing temperature to 1000 c the collapse and reconstruction of carbon substrate resulted in increased id ig value to 1 00 suggesting more defects with the disordered edge were formed on the carbon substrate hu et al 2017 the surface chemical compositions of ssbs were analyzed by xps indicating that ssbs were comprised of c n and o elements table s4 the c 1s spectra of all activators could be split into three peaks at 284 8 285 7 and 288 8 ev which were assigned to c c c c c o c n and c o groups respectively ho et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 600 to 1000 c it showed a decrease in the contents of c c c c from 56 79 to 40 70 conversely the c o content showed a remarkable improvement from 6 21 to 17 83 with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 1000 c due to the promoted transformation from unstable c o at higher temperature shao et al 2018 and the electron rich c o as a lewis basic site could perform as active sites for ps activation with ros generation chen et al 2018 3 2 activation performance of ssbs 3 2 1 elimination of tetracycline as shown in fig 2 a in the only presence of ssbs the dramatic reduction of tc concentrations within 1 min was mainly ascribed to its adsorption by ssbs the tc adsorption performance of ssbs within 15 min ranged from 30 88 to 46 36 and exhibited a positive dependence on the pyrolysis temperature the adsorption efficiency of biochar is dependent on its surface characteristics and active sorption sites inyang and dickenson 2015 it has been illustrated that most pristine biochars derived from straws exhibited limited adsorption performance with an adsorption capacity of 22 7 38 0 mg g 1 for tc while the adsorption capacity of modified biochar can reach 82 6 584 2 mg g 1 xiang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 consequently the ssb1000 prepared here with adsorption capacity 9 4 mg g 1 had no advantage compared with those biochar specially designed for adsorption a positive linear correlation r2 0 972 was established between the adsorption quantity q mg g 1 and vmes suggesting that the mesopores structure played a crucial role fig 8a as shown in fig 2b the oxidation effect of tc by alone ps was 9 56 within 15 min suggesting the inferior tc degradation capacity of ps itself with the coexistence of ps and ssbs the tc removal showed obvious enhancement compared with alone ssbs and alone ps treatment which should be ascribed to the ps activation by ssbs producing reactive oxidative species the ssb1000 could completely remove tc within 15 min showing the best performance the highest q of ssb1000 could cause the most contact probability between tc ssb1000 complex and s2o8 2 no matter by collision and adsorption the correlation coefficients r2 were 0 966 and 0 928 for q versus the observed reaction rate constant kobs for tc removal and vmes versus kobs respectively fig s2 based on the above results it can be concluded that tc adsorption on ssbs played a significant role on its degradation and thus a hypothesis that the degradation processes occurred mainly on the surface of activators was proposed 3 2 2 efficiency of bacterial inactivation as shown in fig 2c and d either the alone ssbs or the ps could hardly inactivate e coli with the coexistence of ps and ssbs ssb1000 ps system showed the best sterilization performance and entirely deactivated bacteria 7 4 log cfu ml 1 was achieved within 180 min both ssb900 ps and ssb800 ps systems performed moderate inactivation effects with 5 9 and 5 5 log cfu ml 1 of deactivated bacteria respectively however ssb700 ps and ssb600 ps systems merely eliminated about 0 3 log cfu ml 1 within the same period these obvious enhanced disinfection performance of ssbs 700 c and ps systems originated from the significant ps activation capacity of these ssbs generating reactive oxidative species to describe quantitatively the inactivation rate a multitarget bacterial disinfection model was established wordofa et al 2017 the calculated inactivation rate constant ke increased rapidly with the annealing temperature the ssb1000 ps system obtained an impressive ke value 0 088 min 1 outperforming the other four ssbs ps systems table s5 the above results manifested that ssbs fabricated at higher temperature exhibited better bactericidal activity in presence of ps the ph value of ssb1000 ps degradation system exhibited obvious decrease from 6 69 to 3 35 within 180 min and the zeta potential of e coli was measured to be 20 mv to 10 mv under this ph range as shown in fig s3b the zeta potential of ssb1000 solution with ph from 10 to 2 also showed negative zeta potential based on above results the electrostatic repulsion between e coli and ssb1000 always existed during the whole bactericidal process therefore the bactericidal effect of ssb1000 ps might mainly be originated from the reactive oxidative species in the bulk solution which was quite different from the tc degradation occurred on the surface of ssb1000 the removal rate of total dna within 180 min was approximately 73 81 fig s4a meanwhile the rapid release of dna was observed during the disinfection process 0 45 min indicating the occurrence of cell damage and dna leakage in the first 135 min the dna leakage rate exceeded its elimination rate by ssb1000 ps system and led to the increase of extracellular dna concentration subsequently since most cells were inactivated within 135 min dna leakage was no longer sustained and residual dna concentration decreased over time suggesting the oxidative damage to genetic material by ros which was also consistent with the inactivation effect the above results indicated that ssb1000 ps system could effectively degrade dna and the produced ros can oxidize the extracellular dna or enter the cell to oxidize the intracellular dna previous studies had concluded that bacterial cell integrity destruction and dna damage play critical roles in removing args from wastewater ma et al 2019 therefore to illustrate whether the ssb1000 ps system could remove args and mges efficiently the concentrations of 16s rrna typical antibiotic gene tetb and mges integron inti1 were determined the removal efficiencies of 16s rrna tetb and inti1 by ssb1000 ps system were 99 76 99 63 and 82 33 within 180 min respectively figs 2d and s5a the correlation analysis of tetb and 16s rrna genes copy number showed high relevancy with r2 of 0 993 fig s5b indicating that the decrease in the concentration of e coli could be mainly responsible for the elimination of tetb as shown in fig s5c inti1 which is closely related to the transmission potential of args exhibited inferior relevancy with 16s rrna r2 0 771 possibly because it was more resistant to ros 3 2 3 simultaneous elimination efficiency of tc and e coli as shown in fig 2e among all ssbs ps systems ssb1000 ps system exhibited the best tc degradation capacity with k obs 0 626 min 1 and bactericidal performance achieving 5 5 log cfu ml 1 of inactivated e coli under combined pollution simultaneously ssb1000 ps system exhibited a decent total dna 63 11 and intracellular dna 76 97 removal effect when tc and e coli coexisting fig s4b while the elimination results were deteriorated compared with alone e coli inactivation and the leakage of dna was declined as well within 45 min this phenomenon could be attributable to the coexisted tc as a competitor with e coli for ros and or the adsorption of tc on the surface of activator masking the active sites as figs 2f and s5a shown the removal efficiencies of 16s rrna tetb and inti1 were 99 54 99 11 and 84 42 under the condition of co contaminations respectively there was a satisfying linear relationship between tetb and 16s rrna genes copy number r2 0 994 fig s5b reflecting the close relationship between the damage of e coli and the decrease of tetb gene concentration overall the ssb1000 ps system held the potential to damage the dna structural integrity accompanied by the decrease of tetb and inti1 which could be employed to reduce args in co contaminations 3 3 identification of key ros according to the results of chronoamperometry measurements fig s6a a strong current jump can be observed with the injection of ps which was due to the electron transfer between ssb1000 and ps causing the generation of abundant radicals subsequently either the addition of tc or e coli triggered a much weaker current response illustrating that a very limited current transfer between pollutants and ssb1000 in addition the linear sweep voltammetry spectra fig s6b showed that a remarkable current enhancement in presence of ps while the current density exhibited no obvious increase after the addition of tc or e coli further demonstrating that ssb1000 can activate ps directly without the presence of pollutants collectively the above results manifested preliminarily that radical pathway should be predominate the target pollutants elimination rather than the electron transfer pathway mediated by ssb1000 and ps complex yun et al 2017 with the addition of 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a trapping agent for so4 and oh in ssb1000 ps system epr results showed that weak so4 and oh signals could be observed when only ps existed fig 3 a the signal intensity of oh was higher than that of so4 which was likely due to the quick transformation of so4 to oh wu et al 2020 the addition of ssb1000 to ps solution led to characteristic signals of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidone 2 oxyl dmpox with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 which may be due to the further oxidation of dmpo oh by so4 and oh in bulk solution chu et al 2021 and the peak intensity decreased slightly with the presence of tc indicating that the free so4 and oh played little role on the oxidation of tc when the solvent in dmpo trapping system was replaced by meoh to detect o2 a 6 fold characteristic peak of dmpo o2 was monitored fig 3b in presence of tc the signal showed no obvious attenuation suggesting the minor contribution of o2 to tc degradation furthermore 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was used as a trapping agent for 1o2 the signal was silent after the addition of temp demonstrating the absence of 1o2 herein different trapping agents were added into the ssb1000 ps system to further confirm the contribution of individual ros to tc degradation chen et al 2018 ethanol etoh and isopropyl alcohol ipa were applied to distinguish the contribution of the so4 oh and oh respectively both the addition of etoh and ipa had no obvious inhibition effect on tc removal indicating the minor contribution of free radicals in bulk solution to the tc degradation fig 3c tc removal was significantly inhibited when the solvent of ssb1000 ps system was replaced by pure etoh indicating that the surface bound so4 oh may dominate tc oxidation process fu et al 2019 in presence of l histidine l his tc removal was hardly influenced reconfirming the negligible contribution of 1o2 in tc elimination potassium perchlorate kclo4 was utilized to identify the contribution of electron transfer pathway mediated by outer sphere activator ps complexes the addition of kclo4 slightly suppressed the proceeding of tc removal suggesting the dispensable roles of mediated electron transfer pathway the surface bound so4 oh sbrs produced and confined on the surface of activators had limited space for activity and could only react with the tc adsorbed on the surface or in the solution around it feng et al 2017 you et al 2020 phenol can be employed as a quencher of sbrs because of its relatively hydrophobic nature making it preferably approach the activator surface and thus quenching the sbrs ye et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 as shown in fig 3c the presence of 150 mm phenol resulted in a 47 10 drop in tc removal it was confirmed that the sbrs were the primary ros in the ssb1000 ps system and tc oxidation should occur on the activator surface likewise meoh ipa p benzoquinone p bq and l his were applied as scavengers to identify the specific contribution of various ros to the bactericidal process as shown in fig 3d the addition of ipa and l his had no distinct inhibitory impact on the bacterial inactivation efficacy inferring that oh and 1o2 were not the main species in the inactivation process notably the addition of meoh tremendously inhibited the cell inactivation efficiency with the ke reduced from 0 0875 min 1 to 0 0056 min 1 moreover the addition of p bq reduced the bactericidal performance with 1 58 log cfu ml 1 of survivors suggesting that o2 also participated in the disinfection with secondary contribution in contrast to so4 from fig 3a and b dmpox and dmpo o2 signals of ssb1000 ps system dropped sharply in the presence of e coli reconfirming the involvement of free ros including so4 and o2 in the disinfection process furthermore with the coexistence of tc and e coli the signal of dmpox damped in comparison to that of alone e coli treatment indicating more consumption of free radicals under the condition of combined pollution compared with that of alone disinfection treatment there was no evident change of dmpo o2 signal in presence of both pollutants this observation reconfirmed o2 for tc degradation was dispensable but contributing to the e coli inactivation 3 4 mechanism exploration 3 4 1 the possible mechanism of tc removal the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and xps of fresh and used ssb1000 was investigated to obtain insights on the key functional groups and the changes of chemical element states involved in the degradation and bactericidal processes from the ftir spectra in fig 4 a the peak at 1420 cm 1 ascribed to c o stretching of ketones of ssb1000 was observed this peak vanished in the spectrum of used ssb1000 indicating that the c o groups were involved in the reaction the peak of aromatic conjugated c o c c 1640 cm 1 appeared remarkable after tc degradation reaction kim et al 2020 which could be attributed to the carbonyl groups in the rings of degradation intermediates and products and a new peak around 591 cm 1 appeared after reaction which was assigned to the s o of sulfate ion for the fresh used and regenerated ssb1000 the individual content of different c species was showed in table s4 compared with that of the fresh ssb1000 fig 4b the c o species in first used ssb1000 exhibited an obvious decrease 2 53 furthermore when the second used ssb1000 was subjected to anneal at 1000 c the content of c o species recovered and even surpassed that of the fresh one as reported the c o groups can act as lewis basic sites that realize ps activation through the scission of o o bond by electron transfer chen et al 2018 leading to tc degradation therefore the c o groups in ssb1000 was speculated to be the active sites for ps activation in contrast to that of c o species an opposing change role of c o c n species can be observed it was speculated that the adsorption of degradation intermediates on the surface of ssb1000 was accounted for this enhancement and the annealing destroyed the absorbed intermediates thereby causing its decrease the oxidized intermediates can occlude the active sites on the surface of ssb1000 or act as a competitor for the newborn sbrs in the next cycle the above results also explained aptly the sharp reduced tc degradation capacity of used ssb1000 and even much better performance of regenerated ssb1000 than the fresh one fig 4c for ssb1000 ps system the mineralization of tc was determined by toc analyzer and the results illustrated that nearly 41 22 of organic contaminants were mineralized into carbon dioxide and water after 15 min oxidized products of tc in were further identified by lc ms spectra table s6 and the possible degradation pathways of tc were proposed in fig 5 in the primary degradation pathway the tc organic fragment m z 445 was transformed into fragments p1 m z 461 by the addition of a hydroxyl group on the phenol group of tc molecule and then p2 would be generated by the hydrogen abstraction of p1 various demethylated by products were often observed in the process of tc degradation due to the low bond energy of n c in pathway ii tc underwent the n demethylation to form p3 with m z 431 p3 was fragmented into p4 by deamidation p5 by ring opening and dealcoholization and p6 by deacetylation in sequence in pathway iii p7 m z 477 was a hydroxylation product of tc liu et al 2021 then p7 proceeded with the demethylation deamidation hydroxylation carbon chain scission produces p4 with the further attacks of radicals the cyclic hydrocarbon structure was opened to produce p8 m z 338 the intermediate products were further converted into inorganic mineral by cleavage of carbon ring and fragmentation eventually these small molecules may be further mineralized into co2 and h2o the toxicity assessment of tc and its degradation products indicated that the overall toxicity of the degradation products except p3 was reduced compared with tc text s8 fig s7 3 4 2 the possible mechanism of e coli inactivation ftir spectra analysis was employed to further explore the mechanism of e coli inactivation fig 4a the c o groups in fresh ssb1000 almost disappeared after e coli disinfection the new peaks that appeared around 1540 cm 1 and 1650 cm 1 in used ssb1000 could be ascribed to the amide i and amide ii bands o c n of proteins or peptides meanwhile the appearance of p o peak roughly at 1241 cm 1 might be attributed to the surface adsorption of p o groups from symmetric stretching of phospholipids dna and rna zhang et al 2019 overall the ftir analysis results indicated that c o groups in ssb1000 were the key reactive sites for bactericidal activity and ssb1000 ps system might not only damage the cell membrane but also incur the leakage of cell inclusions the two dimensional correlation spectroscopic 2d cos analysis of ftir spectrum for fresh and used ssb1000 fig 6 showed two obvious peaks at 1420 cm 1 ketone c o stretching and 1060 cm 1 aliphatic c o c o c stretching according to noda s rule the preferential active sites of ssb1000 followed the order c o c o c o c confirming that the c o groups were crucial in ps activation for both tc degradation and e coli disinfection from xps analyses in fig 4b the c o content of 17 83 in fresh ssb1000 decreased to 10 10 in used ssb1000 it could be found that the n content in ssb1000 increased sharply from 1 56 to 4 79 after reaction more importantly a new peak around 400 1 ev was observed in the n 1s spectra of e 1st which could be assigned to the protein n li et al 2020 table s4 this phenomenon suggested that the leaked proteins were adsorbed on surface of ssb1000 masking the active sites which can rationalize the reduced disinfection effect of used ssb1000 in addition the n content in e rc decreased sharply to 1 41 with the disappearance of protein n suggesting that the active sites of used ssb1000 were well recovered by annealing leading to complete bacteria cells inactivation in 135 min fig 4d remarkably a good correlation r2 0 999 was observed between c o contents and ke values fig s8a indicating the involvement of c o groups in the disinfection process which was consistent with that of tc degradation sem observation of the cell damage process showed that e coli cells were intact with smooth membranes and well preserved rod shape at 0 min fig 7 a however many irregular shrunken cells can be observed within 45 135 min treatment which was ascribed to the oxidative attack from free radicals fig s9a c with the extension of reaction time to 180 min e coli cell membranes became rough with irregular shrunk and showed a disordered morphology in fig 7c implying that the cell membranes had been destroyed tem images in fig 7b showed the integral structure of untreated cells after 180 min of disinfection fig 7d the e coli cell structure was severely damaged and the color contrast of cell membrane was obviously declined in comparison with the live e coli and the cytoplasm was ruptured these results suggested that cells were ruptured by ros which could also be verified by the efflux of intracellular k and ca2 fig s10 as shown in fig 7e h the release of intracellular organic matter iom and extracellular organic matter eom during bacterial inactivation were characterized by the three dimensional fluorescence spectra there were three distinct regions marked as regions i ii and iii which were assigned to simple aromatic proteins fulvic acid like materials and soluble microbial byproduct like materials respectively chen et al 2003 the simple aromatic proteins and fulvic acid like organics in the eom of treated sample decreased obviously compared with the control which could be attributed to high adsorption and degradation capacity of ssb1000 ps simultaneously the colors of i and iii regions in the iom of treated sample became lighter indicating that the intracellular proteinoids and microbial by products produced by cells were degraded by ros this complete damage could be supported by the result of the bacterial regrowth activity experiment showing that no e coli resurgence was observed fig s9e 3 4 3 the explanation of best ps activation performance of ssb1000 from table s3 the vmes of different activators increased gradually with the elevation of pyrolysis temperature among which ssb1000 obtained the largest value a satisfactory positive correlation has been established between vmes and kobs ke r2 0 928 0 936 fig s11 therefore the magnitude of vmes had a significant influence on the ps activation capacity of ssbs regardless of degrading tc or inactivating e coli which was attributed to the promoted transfer of reactants and products more exposed reactive sites in the ssbs and thereby more generated surface bounded or free radical in presence of more mesopores therefore the above analysis gave reasonable interpretation for the best performance of ssb1000 from the perspective of structural property as shown in fig 8 b the c o content of different ssbs increased with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature with ssb1000 possessing the largest value furthermore a positive relationship was revealed between c o content and kobs ke with r2 of 0 987 0 781 figs 8b and s8b the above results explained the best ps activation performance of ssb1000 with the highest c o content in terms of the key chemical functional group duan et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 according to nyquist plots and fitting results of different activators in fig 8c it could be found that the higher annealing temperature would trigger lower charge transfer resistance rct a negative linear correlation r2 0 896 0 955 can be established between rct and kobs ke fig 8d the ssb1000 with the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance can be conducive to the electron transfer from c o reactive sites to s2o8 2 causing the high efficient break of peroxy bond and thereby producing more radicals the above analysis deciphered the superior ps activation capacity of ssb1000 from the point of interfacial electrical conductivity furthermore the high negative relevance can also be found between rct values and vmes c o contents with r2 value of 0 993 0 825 fig s12 this phenomenon indicated that the interfacial electron transfer capacity of ssbs was significantly influenced by the mesopores volume and c o content it was concluded that more mesopores could be favorable for the substances transfer and c o as the electron donating group could provide electron for interfacial transfer during the redox reaction duan et al 2016 as can be seen from fig 8e and f ssb1000 possessed the highest electron donating capacity edc and the edc of different ssbs was significantly positively correlated with its c o content r2 0 924 therefore ssb1000 with the highest vmes and c o content displayed the lowest interfacial electron transfer resistance and highest edc which significantly improved the electron transfer from activator to ps molecular resulting in the efficient break of peroxy bond and thereby the generation of ros for tc and e coli removal as depicted in fig s13a the impressive capabilities of ssb1000 ps system in removing different organics contaminants could be found with removal efficiencies of 95 64 99 29 75 80 and 98 36 for phenol bisphenol a bpa ciprofloxacin cpfx and sulfadiazine sdz in 15 min respectively in addition the practicability of ssb1000 ps system was demonstrated with the complete removal of tc in the realistic water matrixes details shown in table s7 and fig s13b the above results illustrated that ssb1000 and ps system can be used as an alternative and green wastewater remediation method 4 conclusions this study showed that the ps activation performance of ssbs for decontaminating tc arb and args increased with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature the lc ms spectra result indicated that tc was transformed to products with much less toxicity through three possible pathways including hydroxylation ring cleavage and n demethylation the disinfection process was visualized by tem and sem and further reflected by three dimensional fluorescence spectrum indicating that the cell membrane was attacked and ruptured by ros with degradation of intracellular proteinoids and microbial by products it was revealed that the tc degradation was mainly related to sbrs while quite differently free so4 was crucial for e coli inactivation additionally c o was found to be the key active site for ps activation based on the xps and ftir results there were remarkable positive correlations between vmes and kobs ke and significant negative correlations between rct and kobs ke as well as an extraordinary positive correlation between edc and c o contents therefore sc1000 with the highest vmes and c o content displayed the lowest interfacial electron transfer resistance and highest edc thus causing the efficient break of the peroxy bond and the generation of ros for tc and e coli removal these results in this work were expected to provide advanced information not only on the approach to establish structure activity relationship of pristine biochar activators but also on the strategy of simultaneous eliminating antibiotic arb and args by ps aops in waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15982,tetracycline tc has been frequently detected in various environments thus promoting the occurrence of resistance in bacterial populations in this study a suite of soybean straw biochars ssbs were fabricated under different pyrolysis temperatures 600 1000 c which were utilized as peroxydisulfate ps activators for tc degradation and tc resistant escherichia coli e coli disinfection the purification effect of ssbs ps systems manifested obvious positive dependence on pyrolysis temperature of ssbs with ssb1000 ps system obtained the superior tc degradation e coli disinfection and coexisting tc and e coli elimination capacity the leakage of intracellular dna and the degradation of total dna and extracellular dna was revealed no matter in alone e coli or combined pollution which can also be supported by the gradual ruptured bacterial morphology and attenuated internal components it can be found that tc adsorption in ssbs played a significant role on tc degradation while the electrostatic repulsion always existed between e coli and ssb1000 furthermore a battery of solid evidences collectively demonstrated the significant different purification mechanism of tc and e coli the tc degradation was achieved dominantly by surface bound radicals while bactericidal activity should be attributed to free so4 in bulk solutions in contrast to other ssbs the largest mesopore volumes highest c o content lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance and strongest electron donating capacity explained the outperformed catalytic performance of ssb1000 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline degradation antibiotic resistance bacteria disinfection biochar persulfate 1 introduction the abuse of antibiotics can vastly promote the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args which thereby significantly enrich the resistance in bacterial populations hong et al 2018 tan and shuai 2015 disturbingly args can persist in the environment and be distributed via horizontal gene transfer of mobile genetic elements mges to other pathogens and even can be incorporated into crops christou et al 2017 wang and chen 2020 which can result in the emergence of superbugs with multidrug resistance widely disseminating in ecosystems and posing a colossal threat to human singh et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop effective technologies to remove antibiotics and arb contaminations from wastewater before their discharge into the environment persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops that can generate diverse reactive oxygen species ros with strong oxidizing capacity have been widely adopted to degrade antibiotic pollutants exhibiting satisfactory performance miklos et al 2018 pan et al 2021 ps aops due to the high disinfection efficiency on viable pathogens and removal of args as well as adequate disinfection approach to alleviating bacterial resistance risks have constantly been clarified liu et al 2022 found that sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron and peroxymonosulfate pms system effectively inactivated both e coli dh5Î± and pseudomonas hls 6 within 15 min and reached 1 52 1 79 and 1 56 log removal effect of intracellular args sul1 inti1 and teta respectively moreover the three dimensional electrode galvanic cell enhanced fe ii ps system could achieve 7 88 log removal of antibiotic resistant e coli carries multiple args zhang et al 2019 the above outcomes suggest that ps aops hold great promise to be an alternative to the conventional disinfection processes regarding the coexisting emergence of antibiotics and arb args their simultaneous removal should be focused on and there are rare investigations conducted on the elimination of these coexisting target pollutants therein photo driven aops have been reported to effectively remove organics and arb args ahmed et al 2021 zhong et al 2022 as far as we know few studies have been conducted on eliminating coexisting antibiotics and bacteria resistant to these antibiotics by ps aops rodriguez chueca et al 2019 reported that uv c activated pms exhibited a satisfying removal performance for removing antibiotics above 90 with 0 22 log args removal in wwtp however the high energy consumption and inferior effect of args degradation by uv c activated ps aops restricted their large scale application when heterogeneous activators were introduced gao et al 2021 discovered that with the aid of visible light carbon defects g c3n4 ps system could not only remove total antibiotics but also achieve 6 3 log e coli and 6 8 log enterococcus faecalis inactivation effect as well as 2 5 log teta 2 8 log inti1 and 2 6 log 16s rrna reduction rates therefore heterogeneous activators may be an optimal candidate for ps activation to eliminate antibiotics and arb and args simultaneously although the respective elimination effect had been demonstrated by these above reports considering the distinct characters of antibiotics existing in dissolved state with molecular dimension of nano level while arb existing in suspended state with cell size of micro level it is reasonably speculated that a disparate antibiotic degradation and arb disinfection mechanism existed during the process of heterogeneous ps activation due to its well known various pathways including free radicals surface bound radicals sbrs 1o2 and mediated electron transfer in this work soybean straw was pyrolyzed at different temperatures from 600 to 1000 c to prepare a series of ssbs for activating ps to degrade tc and disinfected e coli containing the tc resistance gene tetb simultaneously the effects of different activators and ps systems on tc removal and arb inactivation were studied the underlying mechanism of tc removal by the ssb1000 ps system was disclosed via various methods including x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps tests quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments to verify the evolutionary process of arb scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were employed to assess the lethal efficiency cellular structure and morphology the potential mechanism of tc removal and e coli inactivation by ps aops was further explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents detailed information for all chemicals and reagents used was provided in table s1 2 2 preparation of ssbs the soybean glycine max straw biomass without roots was collected from a cropland in a suburb of yuanyang china 113 40 42 e 34 47 55 n it was washed 3 times and then dried for 6 h at 105 c after cooling the biomass was ground and sieved the powdered straw 60 mesh was pyrolyzed at five predetermined temperatures 600 700 800 900 and 1000 c under n2 atmosphere at a rate of 5 c min 1 and hold for 2 h the obtained black powders were ground and denoted as ssb600 ssb700 ssb800 ssb900 and ssb1000 respectively the characterization details of the samples were provided in text s1 2 3 tc removal experiment the tc removal experiment by the ssbs ps systems was conducted in a 50 ml beaker under natural light conditions in a water bath at 25 c with continuous magnetic stirring dalong ms h proa china for a typical experiment 6 mm ps and 1 g l 1 ssbs were added simultaneously into a suspension containing 20 mg l 1 tc to trigger the reaction at each time interval 0 1 2 4 6 8 10 and 15 min 1 ml aqueous solution was mixed with isovolumic absolute methanol meoh and filtered through 0 22 Î¼m filter and then the residual tc was detected by high performance liquid chromatography see text s2 for details as contrasts the removal effects of alone ps and alone ssbs were also tested the experiments were carried out in triplicate in addition the radical species in ssb1000 ps system were identified by adding different quenching agents while an epr spectrometer was used to recognize the generated reactive oxygen species ros see text s3 for details the intermediate analyses were conducted using a mass spectrometer and the details for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms method were described in si text s4 2 4 disinfection assay tc resistance e coli containing tetb purchased from bena culture collection xl1 blue 353805 was selected as the target arb the culture of e coli was illustrated in text s5 the bactericidal assays were maintained at 25 c without ph adjusting under magnetic stirring for an individual bactericidal experiment a 30 ml suspended mixture in a 50 ml beaker included 107 cfu ml 1 cell suspension then 6 mm ps and 1 g l 1 ssbs was added to trigger the reaction a mixture of 1 ml was pipetted out at a scheduled interval 0 45 90 135 180 min and the bacteria concentrations were determined by the standard plate count method lb agar plates 37 c for 24 h simultaneously the disinfection systems including alone ps and alone ssbs were conducted as contrasts respectively in addition a disinfection assay for the inactivation of bacteria in the co contaminated environment was conducted specifically the simultaneous elimination reaction was carried out under the coexisting of 20 mg l 1 tc with e coli 107 cfu ml 1 and the tc removal efficiency was measured as described in section 2 3 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the changes of target genes including 16s rrna tetb and integron inti1 were detected by qpcr as illustrated in text s6 and cell morphology and integrity analyses were described in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ssbs tem analyses figs 1 a b and s1 revealed the amorphous nature of the carbon phase specifically ssbs were featured with abundant micropore and mesopore structures and with the thermolysis temperature raising from 600 to 800 c the layer structure of ssbs became thinner and more micropores emerged with the further increase of carbonization temperature over 900 c the thinner layer structure collapsed resulting in the stacking of the lamellar structure in addition tem elemental mapping images revealed that carbon c oxygen o and nitrogen n were uniformly distributed on the surface of ssb1000 fig 1b the structures of ssbs were also furnished by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms simultaneously iv type isotherms with h4 hysteresis loop were observed fig 1c which was in accordance with the existence of micropores and mesoporous in the ssbs moreover the pore size distribution curves further manifested the hierarchical porous structures of ssbs fig 1d it could be clearly observed that the pore volume increased as the thermolysis temperature enhanced from 600 to 800 c while decreased when the temperature increased continuously the changes of specific pore structure parameters were listed in table s3 consistent with the tem observations all the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area sbet total pore volumes vtot and micropore volumes vmic of ssbs showed similar trends with elevated pyrolysis temperature and ssb800 exhibited the highest values it has been reported that higher pyrolysis temperature might induce the growth and shape regularization of the impurities however due to collapsing of micropores sbet decreased when pyrolysis temperature reached 900 c brown et al 2006 intriguingly the mesopore volumes vmes showed a positive correlation to the pyrolysis temperatures and ssb1000 harvested the largest vmes which could not only facilitate the adsorption of organics but also be conducive to exposing more active sites for surface catalytic reactions further creating beneficial conditions for ps activation tian et al 2020 two obvious peaks 2Î¸ at 23 and 43 in x ray powder diffractometer xrd patterns of ssbs fig 1e could be ascribed to the 002 and 100 planes of amorphous and crystalline carbons respectively zhu et al 2018 and the broadness of these reflections indicated the disordered amorphous property of ssbs several unexpected peaks at 29 39 and 48 were ascribed to the crystalline minerals of calcite jcpds 05 0586 that were derived from impurities in soybean straw biomass ye et al 2020 yuan et al 2011 the carbon structural characteristics of ssbs were further demonstrated by raman spectroscopy fig 1f the spectra of ssbs exhibited two main bands roughly at 1350 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 which were corresponded respectively to the defect sites or disordered sp2 hybridized carbons d band and the crystalline graphite structure in porous carbon g band herein id ig values can unveil the proportion of defects and disordered structures of carbon materials it could be seen that id ig value increased from 0 86 to 1 04 with the annealing temperature increased from 600 to 800 c implying that the formation of vast pores during the annealing process which were consistent with the tendency of sbet and vtot fu et al 2019 when pyrolysis temperature reached 900 c due to the cleavage of chemical bonds and simultaneous reconstruction of carbon substrate the reduction of structural disorder and higher graphitization were induced resulting in a lower id ig value as continuous rising annealing temperature to 1000 c the collapse and reconstruction of carbon substrate resulted in increased id ig value to 1 00 suggesting more defects with the disordered edge were formed on the carbon substrate hu et al 2017 the surface chemical compositions of ssbs were analyzed by xps indicating that ssbs were comprised of c n and o elements table s4 the c 1s spectra of all activators could be split into three peaks at 284 8 285 7 and 288 8 ev which were assigned to c c c c c o c n and c o groups respectively ho et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 600 to 1000 c it showed a decrease in the contents of c c c c from 56 79 to 40 70 conversely the c o content showed a remarkable improvement from 6 21 to 17 83 with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 1000 c due to the promoted transformation from unstable c o at higher temperature shao et al 2018 and the electron rich c o as a lewis basic site could perform as active sites for ps activation with ros generation chen et al 2018 3 2 activation performance of ssbs 3 2 1 elimination of tetracycline as shown in fig 2 a in the only presence of ssbs the dramatic reduction of tc concentrations within 1 min was mainly ascribed to its adsorption by ssbs the tc adsorption performance of ssbs within 15 min ranged from 30 88 to 46 36 and exhibited a positive dependence on the pyrolysis temperature the adsorption efficiency of biochar is dependent on its surface characteristics and active sorption sites inyang and dickenson 2015 it has been illustrated that most pristine biochars derived from straws exhibited limited adsorption performance with an adsorption capacity of 22 7 38 0 mg g 1 for tc while the adsorption capacity of modified biochar can reach 82 6 584 2 mg g 1 xiang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 consequently the ssb1000 prepared here with adsorption capacity 9 4 mg g 1 had no advantage compared with those biochar specially designed for adsorption a positive linear correlation r2 0 972 was established between the adsorption quantity q mg g 1 and vmes suggesting that the mesopores structure played a crucial role fig 8a as shown in fig 2b the oxidation effect of tc by alone ps was 9 56 within 15 min suggesting the inferior tc degradation capacity of ps itself with the coexistence of ps and ssbs the tc removal showed obvious enhancement compared with alone ssbs and alone ps treatment which should be ascribed to the ps activation by ssbs producing reactive oxidative species the ssb1000 could completely remove tc within 15 min showing the best performance the highest q of ssb1000 could cause the most contact probability between tc ssb1000 complex and s2o8 2 no matter by collision and adsorption the correlation coefficients r2 were 0 966 and 0 928 for q versus the observed reaction rate constant kobs for tc removal and vmes versus kobs respectively fig s2 based on the above results it can be concluded that tc adsorption on ssbs played a significant role on its degradation and thus a hypothesis that the degradation processes occurred mainly on the surface of activators was proposed 3 2 2 efficiency of bacterial inactivation as shown in fig 2c and d either the alone ssbs or the ps could hardly inactivate e coli with the coexistence of ps and ssbs ssb1000 ps system showed the best sterilization performance and entirely deactivated bacteria 7 4 log cfu ml 1 was achieved within 180 min both ssb900 ps and ssb800 ps systems performed moderate inactivation effects with 5 9 and 5 5 log cfu ml 1 of deactivated bacteria respectively however ssb700 ps and ssb600 ps systems merely eliminated about 0 3 log cfu ml 1 within the same period these obvious enhanced disinfection performance of ssbs 700 c and ps systems originated from the significant ps activation capacity of these ssbs generating reactive oxidative species to describe quantitatively the inactivation rate a multitarget bacterial disinfection model was established wordofa et al 2017 the calculated inactivation rate constant ke increased rapidly with the annealing temperature the ssb1000 ps system obtained an impressive ke value 0 088 min 1 outperforming the other four ssbs ps systems table s5 the above results manifested that ssbs fabricated at higher temperature exhibited better bactericidal activity in presence of ps the ph value of ssb1000 ps degradation system exhibited obvious decrease from 6 69 to 3 35 within 180 min and the zeta potential of e coli was measured to be 20 mv to 10 mv under this ph range as shown in fig s3b the zeta potential of ssb1000 solution with ph from 10 to 2 also showed negative zeta potential based on above results the electrostatic repulsion between e coli and ssb1000 always existed during the whole bactericidal process therefore the bactericidal effect of ssb1000 ps might mainly be originated from the reactive oxidative species in the bulk solution which was quite different from the tc degradation occurred on the surface of ssb1000 the removal rate of total dna within 180 min was approximately 73 81 fig s4a meanwhile the rapid release of dna was observed during the disinfection process 0 45 min indicating the occurrence of cell damage and dna leakage in the first 135 min the dna leakage rate exceeded its elimination rate by ssb1000 ps system and led to the increase of extracellular dna concentration subsequently since most cells were inactivated within 135 min dna leakage was no longer sustained and residual dna concentration decreased over time suggesting the oxidative damage to genetic material by ros which was also consistent with the inactivation effect the above results indicated that ssb1000 ps system could effectively degrade dna and the produced ros can oxidize the extracellular dna or enter the cell to oxidize the intracellular dna previous studies had concluded that bacterial cell integrity destruction and dna damage play critical roles in removing args from wastewater ma et al 2019 therefore to illustrate whether the ssb1000 ps system could remove args and mges efficiently the concentrations of 16s rrna typical antibiotic gene tetb and mges integron inti1 were determined the removal efficiencies of 16s rrna tetb and inti1 by ssb1000 ps system were 99 76 99 63 and 82 33 within 180 min respectively figs 2d and s5a the correlation analysis of tetb and 16s rrna genes copy number showed high relevancy with r2 of 0 993 fig s5b indicating that the decrease in the concentration of e coli could be mainly responsible for the elimination of tetb as shown in fig s5c inti1 which is closely related to the transmission potential of args exhibited inferior relevancy with 16s rrna r2 0 771 possibly because it was more resistant to ros 3 2 3 simultaneous elimination efficiency of tc and e coli as shown in fig 2e among all ssbs ps systems ssb1000 ps system exhibited the best tc degradation capacity with k obs 0 626 min 1 and bactericidal performance achieving 5 5 log cfu ml 1 of inactivated e coli under combined pollution simultaneously ssb1000 ps system exhibited a decent total dna 63 11 and intracellular dna 76 97 removal effect when tc and e coli coexisting fig s4b while the elimination results were deteriorated compared with alone e coli inactivation and the leakage of dna was declined as well within 45 min this phenomenon could be attributable to the coexisted tc as a competitor with e coli for ros and or the adsorption of tc on the surface of activator masking the active sites as figs 2f and s5a shown the removal efficiencies of 16s rrna tetb and inti1 were 99 54 99 11 and 84 42 under the condition of co contaminations respectively there was a satisfying linear relationship between tetb and 16s rrna genes copy number r2 0 994 fig s5b reflecting the close relationship between the damage of e coli and the decrease of tetb gene concentration overall the ssb1000 ps system held the potential to damage the dna structural integrity accompanied by the decrease of tetb and inti1 which could be employed to reduce args in co contaminations 3 3 identification of key ros according to the results of chronoamperometry measurements fig s6a a strong current jump can be observed with the injection of ps which was due to the electron transfer between ssb1000 and ps causing the generation of abundant radicals subsequently either the addition of tc or e coli triggered a much weaker current response illustrating that a very limited current transfer between pollutants and ssb1000 in addition the linear sweep voltammetry spectra fig s6b showed that a remarkable current enhancement in presence of ps while the current density exhibited no obvious increase after the addition of tc or e coli further demonstrating that ssb1000 can activate ps directly without the presence of pollutants collectively the above results manifested preliminarily that radical pathway should be predominate the target pollutants elimination rather than the electron transfer pathway mediated by ssb1000 and ps complex yun et al 2017 with the addition of 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a trapping agent for so4 and oh in ssb1000 ps system epr results showed that weak so4 and oh signals could be observed when only ps existed fig 3 a the signal intensity of oh was higher than that of so4 which was likely due to the quick transformation of so4 to oh wu et al 2020 the addition of ssb1000 to ps solution led to characteristic signals of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidone 2 oxyl dmpox with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 which may be due to the further oxidation of dmpo oh by so4 and oh in bulk solution chu et al 2021 and the peak intensity decreased slightly with the presence of tc indicating that the free so4 and oh played little role on the oxidation of tc when the solvent in dmpo trapping system was replaced by meoh to detect o2 a 6 fold characteristic peak of dmpo o2 was monitored fig 3b in presence of tc the signal showed no obvious attenuation suggesting the minor contribution of o2 to tc degradation furthermore 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was used as a trapping agent for 1o2 the signal was silent after the addition of temp demonstrating the absence of 1o2 herein different trapping agents were added into the ssb1000 ps system to further confirm the contribution of individual ros to tc degradation chen et al 2018 ethanol etoh and isopropyl alcohol ipa were applied to distinguish the contribution of the so4 oh and oh respectively both the addition of etoh and ipa had no obvious inhibition effect on tc removal indicating the minor contribution of free radicals in bulk solution to the tc degradation fig 3c tc removal was significantly inhibited when the solvent of ssb1000 ps system was replaced by pure etoh indicating that the surface bound so4 oh may dominate tc oxidation process fu et al 2019 in presence of l histidine l his tc removal was hardly influenced reconfirming the negligible contribution of 1o2 in tc elimination potassium perchlorate kclo4 was utilized to identify the contribution of electron transfer pathway mediated by outer sphere activator ps complexes the addition of kclo4 slightly suppressed the proceeding of tc removal suggesting the dispensable roles of mediated electron transfer pathway the surface bound so4 oh sbrs produced and confined on the surface of activators had limited space for activity and could only react with the tc adsorbed on the surface or in the solution around it feng et al 2017 you et al 2020 phenol can be employed as a quencher of sbrs because of its relatively hydrophobic nature making it preferably approach the activator surface and thus quenching the sbrs ye et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 as shown in fig 3c the presence of 150 mm phenol resulted in a 47 10 drop in tc removal it was confirmed that the sbrs were the primary ros in the ssb1000 ps system and tc oxidation should occur on the activator surface likewise meoh ipa p benzoquinone p bq and l his were applied as scavengers to identify the specific contribution of various ros to the bactericidal process as shown in fig 3d the addition of ipa and l his had no distinct inhibitory impact on the bacterial inactivation efficacy inferring that oh and 1o2 were not the main species in the inactivation process notably the addition of meoh tremendously inhibited the cell inactivation efficiency with the ke reduced from 0 0875 min 1 to 0 0056 min 1 moreover the addition of p bq reduced the bactericidal performance with 1 58 log cfu ml 1 of survivors suggesting that o2 also participated in the disinfection with secondary contribution in contrast to so4 from fig 3a and b dmpox and dmpo o2 signals of ssb1000 ps system dropped sharply in the presence of e coli reconfirming the involvement of free ros including so4 and o2 in the disinfection process furthermore with the coexistence of tc and e coli the signal of dmpox damped in comparison to that of alone e coli treatment indicating more consumption of free radicals under the condition of combined pollution compared with that of alone disinfection treatment there was no evident change of dmpo o2 signal in presence of both pollutants this observation reconfirmed o2 for tc degradation was dispensable but contributing to the e coli inactivation 3 4 mechanism exploration 3 4 1 the possible mechanism of tc removal the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and xps of fresh and used ssb1000 was investigated to obtain insights on the key functional groups and the changes of chemical element states involved in the degradation and bactericidal processes from the ftir spectra in fig 4 a the peak at 1420 cm 1 ascribed to c o stretching of ketones of ssb1000 was observed this peak vanished in the spectrum of used ssb1000 indicating that the c o groups were involved in the reaction the peak of aromatic conjugated c o c c 1640 cm 1 appeared remarkable after tc degradation reaction kim et al 2020 which could be attributed to the carbonyl groups in the rings of degradation intermediates and products and a new peak around 591 cm 1 appeared after reaction which was assigned to the s o of sulfate ion for the fresh used and regenerated ssb1000 the individual content of different c species was showed in table s4 compared with that of the fresh ssb1000 fig 4b the c o species in first used ssb1000 exhibited an obvious decrease 2 53 furthermore when the second used ssb1000 was subjected to anneal at 1000 c the content of c o species recovered and even surpassed that of the fresh one as reported the c o groups can act as lewis basic sites that realize ps activation through the scission of o o bond by electron transfer chen et al 2018 leading to tc degradation therefore the c o groups in ssb1000 was speculated to be the active sites for ps activation in contrast to that of c o species an opposing change role of c o c n species can be observed it was speculated that the adsorption of degradation intermediates on the surface of ssb1000 was accounted for this enhancement and the annealing destroyed the absorbed intermediates thereby causing its decrease the oxidized intermediates can occlude the active sites on the surface of ssb1000 or act as a competitor for the newborn sbrs in the next cycle the above results also explained aptly the sharp reduced tc degradation capacity of used ssb1000 and even much better performance of regenerated ssb1000 than the fresh one fig 4c for ssb1000 ps system the mineralization of tc was determined by toc analyzer and the results illustrated that nearly 41 22 of organic contaminants were mineralized into carbon dioxide and water after 15 min oxidized products of tc in were further identified by lc ms spectra table s6 and the possible degradation pathways of tc were proposed in fig 5 in the primary degradation pathway the tc organic fragment m z 445 was transformed into fragments p1 m z 461 by the addition of a hydroxyl group on the phenol group of tc molecule and then p2 would be generated by the hydrogen abstraction of p1 various demethylated by products were often observed in the process of tc degradation due to the low bond energy of n c in pathway ii tc underwent the n demethylation to form p3 with m z 431 p3 was fragmented into p4 by deamidation p5 by ring opening and dealcoholization and p6 by deacetylation in sequence in pathway iii p7 m z 477 was a hydroxylation product of tc liu et al 2021 then p7 proceeded with the demethylation deamidation hydroxylation carbon chain scission produces p4 with the further attacks of radicals the cyclic hydrocarbon structure was opened to produce p8 m z 338 the intermediate products were further converted into inorganic mineral by cleavage of carbon ring and fragmentation eventually these small molecules may be further mineralized into co2 and h2o the toxicity assessment of tc and its degradation products indicated that the overall toxicity of the degradation products except p3 was reduced compared with tc text s8 fig s7 3 4 2 the possible mechanism of e coli inactivation ftir spectra analysis was employed to further explore the mechanism of e coli inactivation fig 4a the c o groups in fresh ssb1000 almost disappeared after e coli disinfection the new peaks that appeared around 1540 cm 1 and 1650 cm 1 in used ssb1000 could be ascribed to the amide i and amide ii bands o c n of proteins or peptides meanwhile the appearance of p o peak roughly at 1241 cm 1 might be attributed to the surface adsorption of p o groups from symmetric stretching of phospholipids dna and rna zhang et al 2019 overall the ftir analysis results indicated that c o groups in ssb1000 were the key reactive sites for bactericidal activity and ssb1000 ps system might not only damage the cell membrane but also incur the leakage of cell inclusions the two dimensional correlation spectroscopic 2d cos analysis of ftir spectrum for fresh and used ssb1000 fig 6 showed two obvious peaks at 1420 cm 1 ketone c o stretching and 1060 cm 1 aliphatic c o c o c stretching according to noda s rule the preferential active sites of ssb1000 followed the order c o c o c o c confirming that the c o groups were crucial in ps activation for both tc degradation and e coli disinfection from xps analyses in fig 4b the c o content of 17 83 in fresh ssb1000 decreased to 10 10 in used ssb1000 it could be found that the n content in ssb1000 increased sharply from 1 56 to 4 79 after reaction more importantly a new peak around 400 1 ev was observed in the n 1s spectra of e 1st which could be assigned to the protein n li et al 2020 table s4 this phenomenon suggested that the leaked proteins were adsorbed on surface of ssb1000 masking the active sites which can rationalize the reduced disinfection effect of used ssb1000 in addition the n content in e rc decreased sharply to 1 41 with the disappearance of protein n suggesting that the active sites of used ssb1000 were well recovered by annealing leading to complete bacteria cells inactivation in 135 min fig 4d remarkably a good correlation r2 0 999 was observed between c o contents and ke values fig s8a indicating the involvement of c o groups in the disinfection process which was consistent with that of tc degradation sem observation of the cell damage process showed that e coli cells were intact with smooth membranes and well preserved rod shape at 0 min fig 7 a however many irregular shrunken cells can be observed within 45 135 min treatment which was ascribed to the oxidative attack from free radicals fig s9a c with the extension of reaction time to 180 min e coli cell membranes became rough with irregular shrunk and showed a disordered morphology in fig 7c implying that the cell membranes had been destroyed tem images in fig 7b showed the integral structure of untreated cells after 180 min of disinfection fig 7d the e coli cell structure was severely damaged and the color contrast of cell membrane was obviously declined in comparison with the live e coli and the cytoplasm was ruptured these results suggested that cells were ruptured by ros which could also be verified by the efflux of intracellular k and ca2 fig s10 as shown in fig 7e h the release of intracellular organic matter iom and extracellular organic matter eom during bacterial inactivation were characterized by the three dimensional fluorescence spectra there were three distinct regions marked as regions i ii and iii which were assigned to simple aromatic proteins fulvic acid like materials and soluble microbial byproduct like materials respectively chen et al 2003 the simple aromatic proteins and fulvic acid like organics in the eom of treated sample decreased obviously compared with the control which could be attributed to high adsorption and degradation capacity of ssb1000 ps simultaneously the colors of i and iii regions in the iom of treated sample became lighter indicating that the intracellular proteinoids and microbial by products produced by cells were degraded by ros this complete damage could be supported by the result of the bacterial regrowth activity experiment showing that no e coli resurgence was observed fig s9e 3 4 3 the explanation of best ps activation performance of ssb1000 from table s3 the vmes of different activators increased gradually with the elevation of pyrolysis temperature among which ssb1000 obtained the largest value a satisfactory positive correlation has been established between vmes and kobs ke r2 0 928 0 936 fig s11 therefore the magnitude of vmes had a significant influence on the ps activation capacity of ssbs regardless of degrading tc or inactivating e coli which was attributed to the promoted transfer of reactants and products more exposed reactive sites in the ssbs and thereby more generated surface bounded or free radical in presence of more mesopores therefore the above analysis gave reasonable interpretation for the best performance of ssb1000 from the perspective of structural property as shown in fig 8 b the c o content of different ssbs increased with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature with ssb1000 possessing the largest value furthermore a positive relationship was revealed between c o content and kobs ke with r2 of 0 987 0 781 figs 8b and s8b the above results explained the best ps activation performance of ssb1000 with the highest c o content in terms of the key chemical functional group duan et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 according to nyquist plots and fitting results of different activators in fig 8c it could be found that the higher annealing temperature would trigger lower charge transfer resistance rct a negative linear correlation r2 0 896 0 955 can be established between rct and kobs ke fig 8d the ssb1000 with the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance can be conducive to the electron transfer from c o reactive sites to s2o8 2 causing the high efficient break of peroxy bond and thereby producing more radicals the above analysis deciphered the superior ps activation capacity of ssb1000 from the point of interfacial electrical conductivity furthermore the high negative relevance can also be found between rct values and vmes c o contents with r2 value of 0 993 0 825 fig s12 this phenomenon indicated that the interfacial electron transfer capacity of ssbs was significantly influenced by the mesopores volume and c o content it was concluded that more mesopores could be favorable for the substances transfer and c o as the electron donating group could provide electron for interfacial transfer during the redox reaction duan et al 2016 as can be seen from fig 8e and f ssb1000 possessed the highest electron donating capacity edc and the edc of different ssbs was significantly positively correlated with its c o content r2 0 924 therefore ssb1000 with the highest vmes and c o content displayed the lowest interfacial electron transfer resistance and highest edc which significantly improved the electron transfer from activator to ps molecular resulting in the efficient break of peroxy bond and thereby the generation of ros for tc and e coli removal as depicted in fig s13a the impressive capabilities of ssb1000 ps system in removing different organics contaminants could be found with removal efficiencies of 95 64 99 29 75 80 and 98 36 for phenol bisphenol a bpa ciprofloxacin cpfx and sulfadiazine sdz in 15 min respectively in addition the practicability of ssb1000 ps system was demonstrated with the complete removal of tc in the realistic water matrixes details shown in table s7 and fig s13b the above results illustrated that ssb1000 and ps system can be used as an alternative and green wastewater remediation method 4 conclusions this study showed that the ps activation performance of ssbs for decontaminating tc arb and args increased with the enhancement of pyrolysis temperature the lc ms spectra result indicated that tc was transformed to products with much less toxicity through three possible pathways including hydroxylation ring cleavage and n demethylation the disinfection process was visualized by tem and sem and further reflected by three dimensional fluorescence spectrum indicating that the cell membrane was attacked and ruptured by ros with degradation of intracellular proteinoids and microbial by products it was revealed that the tc degradation was mainly related to sbrs while quite differently free so4 was crucial for e coli inactivation additionally c o was found to be the key active site for ps activation based on the xps and ftir results there were remarkable positive correlations between vmes and kobs ke and significant negative correlations between rct and kobs ke as well as an extraordinary positive correlation between edc and c o contents therefore sc1000 with the highest vmes and c o content displayed the lowest interfacial electron transfer resistance and highest edc thus causing the efficient break of the peroxy bond and the generation of ros for tc and e coli removal these results in this work were expected to provide advanced information not only on the approach to establish structure activity relationship of pristine biochar activators but also on the strategy of simultaneous eliminating antibiotic arb and args by ps aops in waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15983,foaming is a key issue that threatens the efficient and stable operation of the anaerobic digestion process this study introduced three disturbances to induce foaming and explored the responses of physicochemical parameters microbial communities and metabolites to reveal the foaming mechanism under the three disturbance conditions extracellular polymeric substances eps related parameters are significantly positively correlated with foam height and eps may cause foam by lowering the surface tension microorganisms that are more tolerant to high acid or high ammonia stress environments were identified after foaming and they could resist the stress environment by producing more eps the up regulated expression of sphingomyelin or ceramide was discovered after foaming involved in the signal molecular transduction process of cell apoptosis or necrosis which might be related to eps production pantothenic acid involved in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathways was down regulated expression after foaming which might be related to the hindered degradation of eps the response of multi scale parameters in the foaming process shows that eps is the key factor in foaming events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion extracellular polymeric substances foaming metabolomics surface active substance 1 introduction with the rapid development of the social economy the global annual food waste fw production is proliferating expected to surge to 2 5 billion tons by 2025 kazemi shariat panahi et al 2022 anaerobic digestion ad of fw is not only harmless to the environment and achieves waste minimization but also produces energy consequently the ad of fw technology has grown extensively in recent years with worldwide attention and policy support wu et al 2021 however foaming is a common operational problem in ad systems jiang et al 2021 foam formation is more frequent when the substrate contains fw in germany 10 5 of the 3 100 ad plants of various substrates had experienced foaming problems when the scope of the survey was narrowed to ad plants whose substrates included fw it was found that the foaming proportion increased greatly moeller and gÃ¶rsch 2015 in denmark 94 of ad plants processing fw experienced foaming events kougias et al 2014a foaming causes a reduction in the working volume of the digester decreasing biogas production and organic matter removal efficiency leading to substantial economic losses moreover mixing devices and outlet pipes become blocked resulting in an uneven distribution of substrates and microorganisms in the reactor increasing the operation difficulty and the environmental and safety risks such as biogas slurry overflow and reactor explosions yang et al 2021 because foaming is a common phenomenon that can severely damage the ad process foaming is bound to become a critical bottleneck restricting ad technology application for fw exploration of the foaming mechanism of the food waste ad system can support the development of targeted defoaming strategies and ensure the reactor s efficient operation recently collivignarelli et al 2020a and yang et al 2021 reviewed the causes of foaming and given the complexity of substrates inoculums operating conditions and microbial communities diversity and functional redundancy there is no universally recognized foaming mechanism from the perspective of process parameters state parameters or microbial communities essentially ad foaming refers to the phenomenon that the biogas generation in the reactor or gas introduced from pneumatic mixing which cannot be discharged smoothly from the liquid phase forming a dispersed system in the liquid that eventually accumulates on its surface and forms a stable mucus layer conventional foaming or fills the entire reactor rapid volume expansion yang et al 2021 the main reason gas is not discharged smoothly from the liquid phase is that bubbles can be captured and aligned by surfactant biosurfactant with hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends at the gas liquid interface therefore forming a buffer layer lamellae with sufficient mechanical strength prevents them from bursting yang et al 2021 thus a large amount of surfactant or biosurfactant in the liquid phase is considered a prerequisite for foaming kong et al 2019 the surfactants biosurfactants in the ad reactor in addition to part of the substrate or the intermediate metabolites produced during the substrate degradation are mainly derived from extracellular polymeric substances eps eps are ubiquitous in various ad systems produced by microorganisms during adsorption organic matter metabolism and cell lysis collivignarelli et al 2020b eps functions include adhesion to cell surfaces formation of a protective barrier that provides resistance to the harsh environment adsorption of exogenous organic compounds for nutrients storage and exogenous macromolecules digestion for nutrient acquisition laspidou and rittmann 2002 thus eps form and composition change significantly with environmental disturbances yang et al 2021 yang et al 2016 protein pn and polysaccharides ps are eps primary components zhang et al 2016 these substances often contain hydrophilic head groups or hydrophobic tail groups resulting in eps having amphipathicity further contributing to ad foam generation salati et al 2011 a few researchers observed the correlation between eps and foam previously kamali et al 2019 found that soluble pn and ps in eps are related to foam collivignarelli et al 2017 found that soluble eps especially soluble pn may contribute to foam formation however these studies primarily focused on the correlation between a particular type of eps and foam under specific disturbance conditions few studies have examined the contribution of eps to foaming under various disturbance conditions further the production and degradation of eps are mainly regulated by microbial metabolism recently the development of molecular biology gave birth to metabolomics technology which focuses on the endogenous metabolites of organisms the overall changes in the endogenous metabolites of an organism are the ultimate manifestation of the related gene and enzymes expression changes liu et al 2022 at present metabolomics technology has made progress in many fields for example in the medical field it allows for identifying the differentially expressed metabolites in healthy versus diseased people tracing the differential metabolic pathways and identifying potential biomarkers indicating the extent of the disease shen et al 2020 revealed characteristic metabolite changes in the sera of severe coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 patients which might be used as blood biomarkers for severity evaluation in environmental risk assessment this technology has been applied to explore the metabolic profiles of organisms after exposure to environmental pollutants heavy metals persistent organic pollutants pesticides microplastics revealing the internal mechanism of toxicological effects and broadening the scope of environmental assessment indicators liu et al 2022 in recent years the application of metabolomics technology in complex ad systems has become possible de vrieze et al 2021 however the metabolites response during the foaming process the correlation between these responses and eps production and degradation and the correlation with foaming have not been reported since metabolites are the final manifestation of the disturbed organism they are micro level responses of the organism moreover microorganisms are the subject of metabolic pathways and the succession of their communities also causes changes in physicochemical parameters from the macroscopic level of the system therefore this study aims to reveal the foaming mechanism by combining the results of multiple scale responses of physicochemical parameters microbial communities and metabolites in the foaming

induction fig 1 shows the foaming induced by three environmental disturbances the ol reactor induces foam by gradually increasing the load when the load is increased to 4 5 gvs l 1 d 1 50d a stable brown yellow foam appears which is 75 mm high and cannot be eliminated by physical methods such as stirring at 51d the foam height increased to 150 mm the foam height continued to increase to 300 mm with subsequent load reduction to 2 5 or 0 gvs l 1 d 1 the as reactor induces foam by introducing peptone to increase the concentration of ammonia nitrogen when the tan concentration is higher than 3000 mg l 1 at 61d a dark black unstable foam with a height of 150 mm appears and lasts for 5 days and then it drops to 75 mm the increasing fat content induces foam in the ls reactor at 62d the fat content ranged between 9 and 20 and a brown yellow lasting stable foam with a height of 75 mm appears the surface of the foam layer is covered with a layer of orange yellow grease the foam height rose to 150 mm at 67d and 300 mm at 72d 3 2 response of physicochemical parameters the changes in the physicochemical parameters of the three reactors at different stages are shown in table 2 and the changes in the physicochemical parameters with the running time are shown in si fig s1 to fig s3 3 2 1 methane performance table 2 shows that the average methane yield of ol and ls reactors at stage ii increased slightly during the foaming induction process compared to stage i however in stage iii the average methane yield of the ol as and ls reactors decreased by 47 77 and 16 respectively compared with stage i thus foaming is accompanied by a decrease in the methane production efficiency of the system on different levels this is consistent with the previous study he et al 2017 kong et al 2019 notably the methane yield of the ls reactor was 0 51 lch4 gvsfed 1 at the initial stage of foaming meaning that the methane production efficiency did not decrease si table s2 it suggests that some reactors will encounter foam even when there is no abnormality in methane production but if allowed to develop will cause severe gas production decline so the foaming phenomenon is worthy of attention 3 2 2 liquid phase parameters during the foaming induction process the ph of the ol and ls reactors continued to decrease consistent with the apparent accumulation of vfa and the gradual decrease of ta in the two reactors in contrast the ph of the peptone containing as reactor remains above 7 peptone can be hydrolyzed into ammonia nitrogen to supplement the system s alkalinity and improve the buffering capacity of the system although the upward trend of tan in the three reactors is consistent with the increase in foaming the tan of the as reactor is 3 times higher than the other two reactors starting at stage ii and the difference in fan is more significant table 2 in any case this shows that ph does not have a consistent response during the foaming induction process under different disturbance conditions vfa is a foaming characteristic parameter identified by many researchers for example he et al 2017 found that vfa has the greatest impact on foaming in the food waste ad system in batch and semi continuous operation modes kong et al 2019 pointed out that the large accumulation of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids and their isomers induced foaming in the ad system while processing the organic fraction of municipal solid waste in this study tvfa acetate propionate butyrate and valerate showed an upward trend in the foaming process moreover acetate and propionate have the largest increase before and after foaming in the three reactors this may be because the acetoclastic methanogens activity is most susceptible to disturbance by unfavorable environments while the gibbs free energy of propionic acid is higher and its degradation is the most difficult among many vfas wu et al 2021 although the concentration of various acids in different reactors at the time of foaming and the growth rate before and after foaming are not consistent the changing trend of vfa is consistent with the foaming 3 2 3 foaming specific parameters the surface tensions of the three reactors were continuously reduced during the foaming induction process surface tension is a comprehensive manifestation of surface active substances in the digestate it has been reported that the lower the surface tension the easier it is to foam yang et al 2021 in contrast the viscosity increases with the foaming induction process in the ol and ls reactors studies have shown that increased viscosity will increase the bubble holdup rate and aid the system s foaming yang et al 2021 however in the as reactor the viscosity continued to decrease in the foaming induction stage stage ii which may be related to the foaming induction method of the reactor to ensure the ammonia stress disturbance in the as reactor this study increased the peptone content in the feed of the reactor at the same time to avoid the introduction of other disturbances the organic loading did not change since the peptone volume is much smaller than the grfw volume under the same vs more water is needed to reach the designed feed volume during the experiment to ensure a consistent hydraulic retention time so the ts during the foaming induction phase of the reactor continues to decrease and the lower ts may result in a lower viscosity markis et al 2016 nevertheless this shows no clear correspondence between changes in viscosity and foaming because eps is the primary source of biosurfactants in the system they may also contribute significantly to foaming this study further explored the response of eps in the foaming induction process teps in the three reactors increased during the foaming induction process furthermore different eps forms s eps lb eps and tb eps and compositions ps and pn also increased si fig s1 to fig s3 specifically in terms of eps form s eps showed the highest proportion and lb eps was the smallest in all three reactors s eps is distributed in the liquid phase and can directly adhere to the surface of bubbles to prevent the lamellae from rupturing contributing to foam formation it originates from the metabolism of substrates and the release of inner cell material after cellular aging and death yang et al 2016 the methane yield of the three reactors in stage ii was not significantly different from those in stage i or only slightly decreased less than 15 decrease indicating that the microorganisms did not decay in a large amount so the sharp rise in s eps may be a manifestation of active substrate metabolism in stage iii the methane yield in all reactors dropped significantly combined with the ph drop of the ol and ls reactors and the fan rise of the as reactor it is speculated that the continuous increase of s eps is caused by the release of inner cell material from the cell rupture of sensitive microorganisms under the stress of these inhibitors both tb eps and lb eps are bound eps referring to the inner layer which tightly and stably bound to the cell surface and loose and dispersible slime layer respectively wang et al 2017 they are either secreted by microorganisms or generated via the cell adsorption and conversion of organic components wu et al 2020 studies have shown that the microorganisms in the sludge will be stimulated to secrete more bound eps and the cells will capture these eps as their survival substrate under unfavorable conditions wang et al 2018 the ph decreased in the ol and ls reactors and the fan increased in the as reactor because of such unfavorable conditions lb eps and tb eps continue to rise during the foaming induction process accumulating around the flocs conducive to the trapping of bubbles wang et al 2017 however its proportion was lower than that of tb eps possibly due to the stirring effect which could rapidly shear off the produced lb eps wu et al 2020 in terms of eps composition the proportion of pn was always higher than 80 pn itself contains a hydrophobic cavity when the vital activities of cells are affected the hydrophobic cavity can prevent the infiltration of inhibitors such as acetic acid this may result from microorganisms actively adapting to the harsh environment yang et al 2016 in other words the higher pn content may result from microorganisms actively adapting to poor environments moreover the pn components distributed in the bound eps are generally negatively charged the charge repulsive potential may alienate the eps flocs and cells and the increase in pn results in the fragmentation and floatation of microbial aggregates conducive to the trapping of bubbles wu et al 2020 3 2 4 spearman correlation analysis to further clarify the significant physicochemical parameters in response to foaming a spearman correlation analysis of vfa tan fan eps surface tension and foam height was performed the results are shown in fig 2 the parameters that are significantly related to the foam height in the three reactors are not equal indicating that the causes of foaming in different systems may not be the same however it is worth noting that foam height in the three reactors significantly positively correlated with s eps tb eps and teps and significantly negatively correlated with surface tension in addition most eps related parameters s eps tb eps and teps are significantly related to surface tension indicating that eps may contribute to foaming by reducing surface tension further analysis demonstrates that vfa related parameters were significantly positively correlated with foam height in ol and ls reactors but not in as reactors fan was significantly positively correlated with foam in the as reactor but not in ol or ls reactors nevertheless they are also significantly positively correlated with the eps related parameters of their respective reactors implying that their rise may stimulate the microbial secretion of eps to withstand harsh environments that is the physicochemical parameters are significantly related to the foam height and their correlations indicate that the mutual eps related in three reactors may be the key factor for foaming 3 3 response of microbial community the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to screen out microorganisms whose relative abundance during stage iii was significantly higher than during stage i relative abundance 0 5 see si fig s4 in general the two common filamentous bacteria gordonia spp and microthrix spp in the sludge ad system were undetected in the three reactors yang et al 2021 nor the differential microorganisms that has up regulated before and after foaming coexisting in the three reactors however using spearman correlation analysis see fig 3 it was found that most microorganisms were significantly correlated with different physicochemical parameters only the identifiable microorganisms are concerned specifically streptococcus succinivibrio christensenellaceae r 7 group and clostridium sensu stricto 1 were significantly positively correlated with eps related parameters in the ol reactor indicating that these microorganisms may directly contribute to eps accumulation among them streptococcus was also identified as a foaming microorganism in a reactor using feces and gelatin or feces and glucose as substrates and kougias et al 2014b suggested that it could secrete surface active substances to stabilize foam concurrently these microorganisms were also significantly positively correlated with vfa indicating higher tolerance to highly acidic environments similarly aminobacterium ebm 39 dmer64 desulfomicrobium and anaerovorax in the as reactor were also significantly positively correlated with eps indicating that they may directly contribute to eps accumulation concomitantly they were also significantly positively correlated with vfa or fan indicating that they are tolerant to highly acidic or ammonia stress environments succinivibrio clostridium sensu stricto 1 candidatus caldatribacterium aminomonas endomicrobium prevotella and methanospirillum in the ls reactor were significantly positively correlated with eps and they may directly contribute to eps accumulation at the same time they were significantly positively correlated with vfa and similarly to ol reactors they are more resistant to high acid environments combined with the analysis in section 3 2 under high acid or high ammonia stress environment these tolerant microorganisms may release more inner cell matter to form s eps or secrete bound eps to resist the adverse environment caused by inhibitory factors to maintain cell function in general there were no differential microorganisms that had up regulated before and after foaming coexisting in the three reactors however microorganisms with significant differences observed in those three reactors were positively correlated with eps and also with vfa or fan thus these microorganisms may be more resistant to stress conditions due to their ability to secrete eps to withstand harsh environments because of this the increase in their relative abundance could also contribute to the reduction of surface tension the analysis in section 3 1 shows that most eps have a significant negative correlation with surface tension leading to foaming 3 4 response of metabolites untargeted metabolomics was used for the samples in the stable stage i and foaming stages stage iii of the three reactors a total of 11342 and 12084 mass spectra peaks were detected in the positive ion and negative ion modes corresponding to 635 and 363 metabolites respectively the results of the principal component analysis show that the distinction between different groups is significant indicating that the metabolism between different groups is significantly different fig 4 a the student s t test was applied for discriminating the samples from ol and ct as and ct ls and ct to identify the differential metabolites respectively setting the variable importance 1 p 0 05 fold change thresholds value 1 or 1 according to the classification on the superclass level in the human metabolome database hmdb database fig 4b most of the differential metabolites in the three reactors belong to lipids and lipid like molecules organic acids and derivatives organoheterocyclic compounds and organic oxygen compounds the cumulative proportion exceeds 60 3 4 1 key metabolites and metabolic pathways since surface active substances are a prerequisite for foaming metabolites with up regulation of relative expression abundance and surface activity may contribute to foaming directly therefore combined with the description of the compound function in the hmdb database these metabolites were screened out as key metabolites and their possible sources and metabolic pathways are discussed there are 47 21 and 58 surface active metabolites with up regulated expression after foaming in the ol as and ls reactors respectively their names hmdb classifications and the variable importance vip values are shown in si fig s5 it can be seen from fig s5 that most of these key metabolites are lipids and lipid like molecules in the superclass classification level of the hmdb database there are 42 21 and 56 metabolisms in the ol as and ls reactors respectively the proportions are 89 100 and 97 respectively they can be further divided into prenol lipids fatty acyls glycerophospholipids sphingolipids steroids and steroid derivatives and glycerolipids in the class classification level of the hmdb database prenol lipids are all terpenoids including monoterpenoids sesquiterpenoids diterpenoids terpene glycosides and triterpenoids previously researchers have also detected them in the ad system and they may originate from the fruit peel kunacheva et al 2020 fatty acyls including fatty alcohols fatty amides and fatty acyl glycosides may be intermediate products of the fatty acid oxidation process mehrer et al 2018 glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids the main components of bacterial cell membranes can regulate intracellular signaling pathways wang et al 2021 steroids and steroid derivatives are primarily secondary metabolites of plants glycerolipids are all diacylglycerols which are endogenous intermediate products of fat metabolism yang et al 2015 these key metabolites were annotated in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database to clarify their physiological and biochemical functions further three metabolites of linoleic acid the kegg compound id is c01595 sm d18 0 14 1 9z oh c00550 and gymnodimine c20025 were retrieved in the ol reactor only cer d18 1 14 0 c13916 was retrieved in the as reactor seven metabolites of sm d18 0 14 1 9z oh c00550 cer d18 1 14 0 c13916 linoleic acid c01595 eicosadienoic acid c16525 24 hydroxycholesterol c13550 12s hht c20388 and gymnodimine c20025 were retrieved in the ls reactor it is worth noting that sm sphingomyelin or cer ceramide was found in all three reactors fig 5 sphingomyelin is the main component of cell membranes composed of phosphorylcholine or phosphorylethanolamine connected to the c 1 hydroxyl group of ceramides taniguchi and okazaki 2021 ceramide one of the by products of sphingomyelin hydrolysis is also an important cell signaling molecule taniguchi and okazaki 2021 it can induce cell apoptosis or necroptosis through the sphingolipid signaling pathway map04071 or necroptosis map04217 the expression of sphingomyelin ceramide is significantly up regulated that is the signal molecules or precursors that regulate cell apoptosis or necrosis are increased which accelerates the rupture of cells within the system causing the release of a large number of intermediate metabolites with surface active substances such as lipids and lipid like molecules these intermediate metabolites can be further hydrolyzed into s eps and can also be further utilized by microorganisms to form bound eps which may increase eps and induce foaming linoleic acid and gymnodimine are present in both ol and ls reactors the kegg metabolic pathways involved in linoleic acid include linoleic acid metabolism map00591 biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids map01040 and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites map01060 in these pathways the metabolites of synthetic linoleic acid did not increase and the metabolites of linoleic acid degradation did not increase it is speculated that the activity of the metabolic pathway of linoleic acid has not changed and it may be that the amount of cell degrading linoleic acid has decreased leading to the accumulation of linoleic acid gymnodimine is an organoheterocyclic compound however its metabolic pathway is not annotated in the kegg database gymnodimine is a lipophilic toxin produced by the marine dinoflagellates karenia selliformis and alexandrium ostenfeldii harju et al 2016 it may enter food through the food chain and access the anaerobic digestion system with daily feeding and gradually accumulate which is not necessarily related to foaming eicosadienoic acid 24 hydroxycholesterol and 12s hht are only present in the ls reactor eicosadienoic acid is involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids map01040 24 hydroxycholesterol is a synthetic precursor in primary bile acid biosynthesis map00120 and can participate in the formation of cell membranes 12s hht is a fatty acid and there is no report on its source and function information previously 3 4 2 differential metabolic pathways metabolites with significant differences in expression can be enriched in differential metabolic pathways which may affect the production or degradation of surface active substances indirectly the differential metabolic pathways were determined by kegg topology analysis the enrichment background is all metabolites in the kegg database and the topology method is relative betweenness centrality there are 11 12 and 8 pathways with impact values higher than 0 1 in ol as and ls reactors respectively fig 6 the first categories of these pathways all belong to metabolism and the pathways with the highest proportion belong to the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites in the second category the others belong to amino acid metabolism lipid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism metabolism of cofactors and vitamins nucleotide metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pantothenate and coa biosynthesis belonging to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins coexist in the three reactors the expression of pantothenic acid is down regulated in the pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathway pantothenic acid is an intermediate necessary for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the fatty acid synthesis of steroids ismail et al 2020 the tricarboxylic acid cycle is the main terminal pathway of protein fat and carbohydrates down regulation of pantothenic acid expression may limit the degradation of intermediate metabolites the intermediate metabolites include many lipids or lipid like molecules identified in section 3 4 1 and eps with hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties their limited degradation may indirectly contribute to foaming in addition other metabolic pathways focus more on the metabolism of a specific type of substance and its contribution to foaming may mainly focus on the direct accumulation of one or several surface active metabolites on this metabolic pathway the related content has been discussed in section 3 4 1 3 5 foaming mechanism analysis from multi scale as shown in fig 7 the response of the three scale parameters during the foaming process shows that in terms of physicochemical parameters under the three disturbance conditions the eps related parameters were highly correlated with foam height most of the eps related parameters are significantly negatively correlated with surface tension indicating that they may cause foaming by reducing surface tension in terms of the microbial community microorganisms with significant differences that have up regulated before and after foaming are identified under the three disturbances conditions some microorganisms may secrete more eps to resist the harsh environment to maintain cell function in terms of metabolites many up regulated and surface active metabolites were identified in the three reactors among which sphingomyelin or ceramide is an important signal molecule or precursor of cell apoptosis or necrosis pathway the up regulation of their expression may promote cell rupture to produce more eps the significant down regulation of pantothenic acid expression in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathway after foaming in all three reactors may also imply that the degradation of eps is limited in summary the foaming mechanism was revealed from multiple scales and demonstrates the critical role of eps during ad foaming the eps characteristic functional groups or cross linked structures that cause foaming and their changes in the foaming process and the law of reduction remain to be elucidated thus follow up research should aim to a more specific and systematic study of the foaming characteristics of different forms of eps this may help to build a new perspective on foaming early warning and targeted defoaming strategies 4 conclusions eps related parameters are positively correlated with foaming height under three disturbance conditions and they may contribute to foaming by lowering surface tension microbial community shift would occur under stress conditions caused by environmental disturbances furthermore the highly tolerant microorganisms could resist the stress environment by producing more eps contributing to foaming under the three environmental disturbances most of the up regulated and surface active metabolites are lipid or lipid like molecules among which sphingomyelin and ceramide are involved in the signal molecular transduction process related to cell apoptosis or necrosis and might be involved in the accumulation of eps pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathway is enriched under the three disturbance conditions and the expression of pantothenic acid is significantly down regulated which may be related to the hindered degradation of eps the response of multi scale parameters in the foaming process indicates that eps is the key factor causing foam author contributions all authors contributed to the structure and writing of the article declaration of competing

15983,foaming is a key issue that threatens the efficient and stable operation of the anaerobic digestion process this study introduced three disturbances to induce foaming and explored the responses of physicochemical parameters microbial communities and metabolites to reveal the foaming mechanism under the three disturbance conditions extracellular polymeric substances eps related parameters are significantly positively correlated with foam height and eps may cause foam by lowering the surface tension microorganisms that are more tolerant to high acid or high ammonia stress environments were identified after foaming and they could resist the stress environment by producing more eps the up regulated expression of sphingomyelin or ceramide was discovered after foaming involved in the signal molecular transduction process of cell apoptosis or necrosis which might be related to eps production pantothenic acid involved in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathways was down regulated expression after foaming which might be related to the hindered degradation of eps the response of multi scale parameters in the foaming process shows that eps is the key factor in foaming events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion extracellular polymeric substances foaming metabolomics surface active substance 1 introduction with the rapid development of the social economy the global annual food waste fw production is proliferating expected to surge to 2 5 billion tons by 2025 kazemi shariat panahi et al 2022 anaerobic digestion ad of fw is not only harmless to the environment and achieves waste minimization but also produces energy consequently the ad of fw technology has grown extensively in recent years with worldwide attention and policy support wu et al 2021 however foaming is a common operational problem in ad systems jiang et al 2021 foam formation is more frequent when the substrate contains fw in germany 10 5 of the 3 100 ad plants of various substrates had experienced foaming problems when the scope of the survey was narrowed to ad plants whose substrates included fw it was found that the foaming proportion increased greatly moeller and gÃ¶rsch 2015 in denmark 94 of ad plants processing fw experienced foaming events kougias et al 2014a foaming causes a reduction in the working volume of the digester decreasing biogas production and organic matter removal efficiency leading to substantial economic losses moreover mixing devices and outlet pipes become blocked resulting in an uneven distribution of substrates and microorganisms in the reactor increasing the operation difficulty and the environmental and safety risks such as biogas slurry overflow and reactor explosions yang et al 2021 because foaming is a common phenomenon that can severely damage the ad process foaming is bound to become a critical bottleneck restricting ad technology application for fw exploration of the foaming mechanism of the food waste ad system can support the development of targeted defoaming strategies and ensure the reactor s efficient operation recently collivignarelli et al 2020a and yang et al 2021 reviewed the causes of foaming and given the complexity of substrates inoculums operating conditions and microbial communities diversity and functional redundancy there is no universally recognized foaming mechanism from the perspective of process parameters state parameters or microbial communities essentially ad foaming refers to the phenomenon that the biogas generation in the reactor or gas introduced from pneumatic mixing which cannot be discharged smoothly from the liquid phase forming a dispersed system in the liquid that eventually accumulates on its surface and forms a stable mucus layer conventional foaming or fills the entire reactor rapid volume expansion yang et al 2021 the main reason gas is not discharged smoothly from the liquid phase is that bubbles can be captured and aligned by surfactant biosurfactant with hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends at the gas liquid interface therefore forming a buffer layer lamellae with sufficient mechanical strength prevents them from bursting yang et al 2021 thus a large amount of surfactant or biosurfactant in the liquid phase is considered a prerequisite for foaming kong et al 2019 the surfactants biosurfactants in the ad reactor in addition to part of the substrate or the intermediate metabolites produced during the substrate degradation are mainly derived from extracellular polymeric substances eps eps are ubiquitous in various ad systems produced by microorganisms during adsorption organic matter metabolism and cell lysis collivignarelli et al 2020b eps functions include adhesion to cell surfaces formation of a protective barrier that provides resistance to the harsh environment adsorption of exogenous organic compounds for nutrients storage and exogenous macromolecules digestion for nutrient acquisition laspidou and rittmann 2002 thus eps form and composition change significantly with environmental disturbances yang et al 2021 yang et al 2016 protein pn and polysaccharides ps are eps primary components zhang et al 2016 these substances often contain hydrophilic head groups or hydrophobic tail groups resulting in eps having amphipathicity further contributing to ad foam generation salati et al 2011 a few researchers observed the correlation between eps and foam previously kamali et al 2019 found that soluble pn and ps in eps are related to foam collivignarelli et al 2017 found that soluble eps especially soluble pn may contribute to foam formation however these studies primarily focused on the correlation between a particular type of eps and foam under specific disturbance conditions few studies have examined the contribution of eps to foaming under various disturbance conditions further the production and degradation of eps are mainly regulated by microbial metabolism recently the development of molecular biology gave birth to metabolomics technology which focuses on the endogenous metabolites of organisms the overall changes in the endogenous metabolites of an organism are the ultimate manifestation of the related gene and enzymes expression changes liu et al 2022 at present metabolomics technology has made progress in many fields for example in the medical field it allows for identifying the differentially expressed metabolites in healthy versus diseased people tracing the differential metabolic pathways and identifying potential biomarkers indicating the extent of the disease shen et al 2020 revealed characteristic metabolite changes in the sera of severe coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 patients which might be used as blood biomarkers for severity evaluation in environmental risk assessment this technology has been applied to explore the metabolic profiles of organisms after exposure to environmental pollutants heavy metals persistent organic pollutants pesticides microplastics revealing the internal mechanism of toxicological effects and broadening the scope of environmental assessment indicators liu et al 2022 in recent years the application of metabolomics technology in complex ad systems has become possible de vrieze et al 2021 however the metabolites response during the foaming process the correlation between these responses and eps production and degradation and the correlation with foaming have not been reported since metabolites are the final manifestation of the disturbed organism they are micro level responses of the organism moreover microorganisms are the subject of metabolic pathways and the succession of their communities also causes changes in physicochemical parameters from the macroscopic level of the system therefore this study aims to reveal the foaming mechanism by combining the results of multiple scale responses of physicochemical parameters microbial communities and metabolites in the foaming process the remainder of the paper is structured as follows the experimental setup is shown in section 2 the response of physicochemical parameters is analyzed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the characteristic microorganisms are analyzed in section 3 3 the characteristic metabolites and metabolic pathways are analyzed in section 3 4 and the foaming mechanism based on the above results is

induction fig 1 shows the foaming induced by three environmental disturbances the ol reactor induces foam by gradually increasing the load when the load is increased to 4 5 gvs l 1 d 1 50d a stable brown yellow foam appears which is 75 mm high and cannot be eliminated by physical methods such as stirring at 51d the foam height increased to 150 mm the foam height continued to increase to 300 mm with subsequent load reduction to 2 5 or 0 gvs l 1 d 1 the as reactor induces foam by introducing peptone to increase the concentration of ammonia nitrogen when the tan concentration is higher than 3000 mg l 1 at 61d a dark black unstable foam with a height of 150 mm appears and lasts for 5 days and then it drops to 75 mm the increasing fat content induces foam in the ls reactor at 62d the fat content ranged between 9 and 20 and a brown yellow lasting stable foam with a height of 75 mm appears the surface of the foam layer is covered with a layer of orange yellow grease the foam height rose to 150 mm at 67d and 300 mm at 72d 3 2 response of physicochemical parameters the changes in the physicochemical parameters of the three reactors at different stages are shown in table 2 and the changes in the physicochemical parameters with the running time are shown in si fig s1 to fig s3 3 2 1 methane performance table 2 shows that the average methane yield of ol and ls reactors at stage ii increased slightly during the foaming induction process compared to stage i however in stage iii the average methane yield of the ol as and ls reactors decreased by 47 77 and 16 respectively compared with stage i thus foaming is accompanied by a decrease in the methane production efficiency of the system on different levels this is consistent with the previous study he et al 2017 kong et al 2019 notably the methane yield of the ls reactor was 0 51 lch4 gvsfed 1 at the initial stage of foaming meaning that the methane production efficiency did not decrease si table s2 it suggests that some reactors will encounter foam even when there is no abnormality in methane production but if allowed to develop will cause severe gas production decline so the foaming phenomenon is worthy of attention 3 2 2 liquid phase parameters during the foaming induction process the ph of the ol and ls reactors continued to decrease consistent with the apparent accumulation of vfa and the gradual decrease of ta in the two reactors in contrast the ph of the peptone containing as reactor remains above 7 peptone can be hydrolyzed into ammonia nitrogen to supplement the system s alkalinity and improve the buffering capacity of the system although the upward trend of tan in the three reactors is consistent with the increase in foaming the tan of the as reactor is 3 times higher than the other two reactors starting at stage ii and the difference in fan is more significant table 2 in any case this shows that ph does not have a consistent response during the foaming induction process under different disturbance conditions vfa is a foaming characteristic parameter identified by many researchers for example he et al 2017 found that vfa has the greatest impact on foaming in the food waste ad system in batch and semi continuous operation modes kong et al 2019 pointed out that the large accumulation of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids and their isomers induced foaming in the ad system while processing the organic fraction of municipal solid waste in this study tvfa acetate propionate butyrate and valerate showed an upward trend in the foaming process moreover acetate and propionate have the largest increase before and after foaming in the three reactors this may be because the acetoclastic methanogens activity is most susceptible to disturbance by unfavorable environments while the gibbs free energy of propionic acid is higher and its degradation is the most difficult among many vfas wu et al 2021 although the concentration of various acids in different reactors at the time of foaming and the growth rate before and after foaming are not consistent the changing trend of vfa is consistent with the foaming 3 2 3 foaming specific parameters the surface tensions of the three reactors were continuously reduced during the foaming induction process surface tension is a comprehensive manifestation of surface active substances in the digestate it has been reported that the lower the surface tension the easier it is to foam yang et al 2021 in contrast the viscosity increases with the foaming induction process in the ol and ls reactors studies have shown that increased viscosity will increase the bubble holdup rate and aid the system s foaming yang et al 2021 however in the as reactor the viscosity continued to decrease in the foaming induction stage stage ii which may be related to the foaming induction method of the reactor to ensure the ammonia stress disturbance in the as reactor this study increased the peptone content in the feed of the reactor at the same time to avoid the introduction of other disturbances the organic loading did not change since the peptone volume is much smaller than the grfw volume under the same vs more water is needed to reach the designed feed volume during the experiment to ensure a consistent hydraulic retention time so the ts during the foaming induction phase of the reactor continues to decrease and the lower ts may result in a lower viscosity markis et al 2016 nevertheless this shows no clear correspondence between changes in viscosity and foaming because eps is the primary source of biosurfactants in the system they may also contribute significantly to foaming this study further explored the response of eps in the foaming induction process teps in the three reactors increased during the foaming induction process furthermore different eps forms s eps lb eps and tb eps and compositions ps and pn also increased si fig s1 to fig s3 specifically in terms of eps form s eps showed the highest proportion and lb eps was the smallest in all three reactors s eps is distributed in the liquid phase and can directly adhere to the surface of bubbles to prevent the lamellae from rupturing contributing to foam formation it originates from the metabolism of substrates and the release of inner cell material after cellular aging and death yang et al 2016 the methane yield of the three reactors in stage ii was not significantly different from those in stage i or only slightly decreased less than 15 decrease indicating that the microorganisms did not decay in a large amount so the sharp rise in s eps may be a manifestation of active substrate metabolism in stage iii the methane yield in all reactors dropped significantly combined with the ph drop of the ol and ls reactors and the fan rise of the as reactor it is speculated that the continuous increase of s eps is caused by the release of inner cell material from the cell rupture of sensitive microorganisms under the stress of these inhibitors both tb eps and lb eps are bound eps referring to the inner layer which tightly and stably bound to the cell surface and loose and dispersible slime layer respectively wang et al 2017 they are either secreted by microorganisms or generated via the cell adsorption and conversion of organic components wu et al 2020 studies have shown that the microorganisms in the sludge will be stimulated to secrete more bound eps and the cells will capture these eps as their survival substrate under unfavorable conditions wang et al 2018 the ph decreased in the ol and ls reactors and the fan increased in the as reactor because of such unfavorable conditions lb eps and tb eps continue to rise during the foaming induction process accumulating around the flocs conducive to the trapping of bubbles wang et al 2017 however its proportion was lower than that of tb eps possibly due to the stirring effect which could rapidly shear off the produced lb eps wu et al 2020 in terms of eps composition the proportion of pn was always higher than 80 pn itself contains a hydrophobic cavity when the vital activities of cells are affected the hydrophobic cavity can prevent the infiltration of inhibitors such as acetic acid this may result from microorganisms actively adapting to the harsh environment yang et al 2016 in other words the higher pn content may result from microorganisms actively adapting to poor environments moreover the pn components distributed in the bound eps are generally negatively charged the charge repulsive potential may alienate the eps flocs and cells and the increase in pn results in the fragmentation and floatation of microbial aggregates conducive to the trapping of bubbles wu et al 2020 3 2 4 spearman correlation analysis to further clarify the significant physicochemical parameters in response to foaming a spearman correlation analysis of vfa tan fan eps surface tension and foam height was performed the results are shown in fig 2 the parameters that are significantly related to the foam height in the three reactors are not equal indicating that the causes of foaming in different systems may not be the same however it is worth noting that foam height in the three reactors significantly positively correlated with s eps tb eps and teps and significantly negatively correlated with surface tension in addition most eps related parameters s eps tb eps and teps are significantly related to surface tension indicating that eps may contribute to foaming by reducing surface tension further analysis demonstrates that vfa related parameters were significantly positively correlated with foam height in ol and ls reactors but not in as reactors fan was significantly positively correlated with foam in the as reactor but not in ol or ls reactors nevertheless they are also significantly positively correlated with the eps related parameters of their respective reactors implying that their rise may stimulate the microbial secretion of eps to withstand harsh environments that is the physicochemical parameters are significantly related to the foam height and their correlations indicate that the mutual eps related in three reactors may be the key factor for foaming 3 3 response of microbial community the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to screen out microorganisms whose relative abundance during stage iii was significantly higher than during stage i relative abundance 0 5 see si fig s4 in general the two common filamentous bacteria gordonia spp and microthrix spp in the sludge ad system were undetected in the three reactors yang et al 2021 nor the differential microorganisms that has up regulated before and after foaming coexisting in the three reactors however using spearman correlation analysis see fig 3 it was found that most microorganisms were significantly correlated with different physicochemical parameters only the identifiable microorganisms are concerned specifically streptococcus succinivibrio christensenellaceae r 7 group and clostridium sensu stricto 1 were significantly positively correlated with eps related parameters in the ol reactor indicating that these microorganisms may directly contribute to eps accumulation among them streptococcus was also identified as a foaming microorganism in a reactor using feces and gelatin or feces and glucose as substrates and kougias et al 2014b suggested that it could secrete surface active substances to stabilize foam concurrently these microorganisms were also significantly positively correlated with vfa indicating higher tolerance to highly acidic environments similarly aminobacterium ebm 39 dmer64 desulfomicrobium and anaerovorax in the as reactor were also significantly positively correlated with eps indicating that they may directly contribute to eps accumulation concomitantly they were also significantly positively correlated with vfa or fan indicating that they are tolerant to highly acidic or ammonia stress environments succinivibrio clostridium sensu stricto 1 candidatus caldatribacterium aminomonas endomicrobium prevotella and methanospirillum in the ls reactor were significantly positively correlated with eps and they may directly contribute to eps accumulation at the same time they were significantly positively correlated with vfa and similarly to ol reactors they are more resistant to high acid environments combined with the analysis in section 3 2 under high acid or high ammonia stress environment these tolerant microorganisms may release more inner cell matter to form s eps or secrete bound eps to resist the adverse environment caused by inhibitory factors to maintain cell function in general there were no differential microorganisms that had up regulated before and after foaming coexisting in the three reactors however microorganisms with significant differences observed in those three reactors were positively correlated with eps and also with vfa or fan thus these microorganisms may be more resistant to stress conditions due to their ability to secrete eps to withstand harsh environments because of this the increase in their relative abundance could also contribute to the reduction of surface tension the analysis in section 3 1 shows that most eps have a significant negative correlation with surface tension leading to foaming 3 4 response of metabolites untargeted metabolomics was used for the samples in the stable stage i and foaming stages stage iii of the three reactors a total of 11342 and 12084 mass spectra peaks were detected in the positive ion and negative ion modes corresponding to 635 and 363 metabolites respectively the results of the principal component analysis show that the distinction between different groups is significant indicating that the metabolism between different groups is significantly different fig 4 a the student s t test was applied for discriminating the samples from ol and ct as and ct ls and ct to identify the differential metabolites respectively setting the variable importance 1 p 0 05 fold change thresholds value 1 or 1 according to the classification on the superclass level in the human metabolome database hmdb database fig 4b most of the differential metabolites in the three reactors belong to lipids and lipid like molecules organic acids and derivatives organoheterocyclic compounds and organic oxygen compounds the cumulative proportion exceeds 60 3 4 1 key metabolites and metabolic pathways since surface active substances are a prerequisite for foaming metabolites with up regulation of relative expression abundance and surface activity may contribute to foaming directly therefore combined with the description of the compound function in the hmdb database these metabolites were screened out as key metabolites and their possible sources and metabolic pathways are discussed there are 47 21 and 58 surface active metabolites with up regulated expression after foaming in the ol as and ls reactors respectively their names hmdb classifications and the variable importance vip values are shown in si fig s5 it can be seen from fig s5 that most of these key metabolites are lipids and lipid like molecules in the superclass classification level of the hmdb database there are 42 21 and 56 metabolisms in the ol as and ls reactors respectively the proportions are 89 100 and 97 respectively they can be further divided into prenol lipids fatty acyls glycerophospholipids sphingolipids steroids and steroid derivatives and glycerolipids in the class classification level of the hmdb database prenol lipids are all terpenoids including monoterpenoids sesquiterpenoids diterpenoids terpene glycosides and triterpenoids previously researchers have also detected them in the ad system and they may originate from the fruit peel kunacheva et al 2020 fatty acyls including fatty alcohols fatty amides and fatty acyl glycosides may be intermediate products of the fatty acid oxidation process mehrer et al 2018 glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids the main components of bacterial cell membranes can regulate intracellular signaling pathways wang et al 2021 steroids and steroid derivatives are primarily secondary metabolites of plants glycerolipids are all diacylglycerols which are endogenous intermediate products of fat metabolism yang et al 2015 these key metabolites were annotated in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database to clarify their physiological and biochemical functions further three metabolites of linoleic acid the kegg compound id is c01595 sm d18 0 14 1 9z oh c00550 and gymnodimine c20025 were retrieved in the ol reactor only cer d18 1 14 0 c13916 was retrieved in the as reactor seven metabolites of sm d18 0 14 1 9z oh c00550 cer d18 1 14 0 c13916 linoleic acid c01595 eicosadienoic acid c16525 24 hydroxycholesterol c13550 12s hht c20388 and gymnodimine c20025 were retrieved in the ls reactor it is worth noting that sm sphingomyelin or cer ceramide was found in all three reactors fig 5 sphingomyelin is the main component of cell membranes composed of phosphorylcholine or phosphorylethanolamine connected to the c 1 hydroxyl group of ceramides taniguchi and okazaki 2021 ceramide one of the by products of sphingomyelin hydrolysis is also an important cell signaling molecule taniguchi and okazaki 2021 it can induce cell apoptosis or necroptosis through the sphingolipid signaling pathway map04071 or necroptosis map04217 the expression of sphingomyelin ceramide is significantly up regulated that is the signal molecules or precursors that regulate cell apoptosis or necrosis are increased which accelerates the rupture of cells within the system causing the release of a large number of intermediate metabolites with surface active substances such as lipids and lipid like molecules these intermediate metabolites can be further hydrolyzed into s eps and can also be further utilized by microorganisms to form bound eps which may increase eps and induce foaming linoleic acid and gymnodimine are present in both ol and ls reactors the kegg metabolic pathways involved in linoleic acid include linoleic acid metabolism map00591 biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids map01040 and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites map01060 in these pathways the metabolites of synthetic linoleic acid did not increase and the metabolites of linoleic acid degradation did not increase it is speculated that the activity of the metabolic pathway of linoleic acid has not changed and it may be that the amount of cell degrading linoleic acid has decreased leading to the accumulation of linoleic acid gymnodimine is an organoheterocyclic compound however its metabolic pathway is not annotated in the kegg database gymnodimine is a lipophilic toxin produced by the marine dinoflagellates karenia selliformis and alexandrium ostenfeldii harju et al 2016 it may enter food through the food chain and access the anaerobic digestion system with daily feeding and gradually accumulate which is not necessarily related to foaming eicosadienoic acid 24 hydroxycholesterol and 12s hht are only present in the ls reactor eicosadienoic acid is involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids map01040 24 hydroxycholesterol is a synthetic precursor in primary bile acid biosynthesis map00120 and can participate in the formation of cell membranes 12s hht is a fatty acid and there is no report on its source and function information previously 3 4 2 differential metabolic pathways metabolites with significant differences in expression can be enriched in differential metabolic pathways which may affect the production or degradation of surface active substances indirectly the differential metabolic pathways were determined by kegg topology analysis the enrichment background is all metabolites in the kegg database and the topology method is relative betweenness centrality there are 11 12 and 8 pathways with impact values higher than 0 1 in ol as and ls reactors respectively fig 6 the first categories of these pathways all belong to metabolism and the pathways with the highest proportion belong to the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites in the second category the others belong to amino acid metabolism lipid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism metabolism of cofactors and vitamins nucleotide metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pantothenate and coa biosynthesis belonging to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins coexist in the three reactors the expression of pantothenic acid is down regulated in the pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathway pantothenic acid is an intermediate necessary for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the fatty acid synthesis of steroids ismail et al 2020 the tricarboxylic acid cycle is the main terminal pathway of protein fat and carbohydrates down regulation of pantothenic acid expression may limit the degradation of intermediate metabolites the intermediate metabolites include many lipids or lipid like molecules identified in section 3 4 1 and eps with hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties their limited degradation may indirectly contribute to foaming in addition other metabolic pathways focus more on the metabolism of a specific type of substance and its contribution to foaming may mainly focus on the direct accumulation of one or several surface active metabolites on this metabolic pathway the related content has been discussed in section 3 4 1 3 5 foaming mechanism analysis from multi scale as shown in fig 7 the response of the three scale parameters during the foaming process shows that in terms of physicochemical parameters under the three disturbance conditions the eps related parameters were highly correlated with foam height most of the eps related parameters are significantly negatively correlated with surface tension indicating that they may cause foaming by reducing surface tension in terms of the microbial community microorganisms with significant differences that have up regulated before and after foaming are identified under the three disturbances conditions some microorganisms may secrete more eps to resist the harsh environment to maintain cell function in terms of metabolites many up regulated and surface active metabolites were identified in the three reactors among which sphingomyelin or ceramide is an important signal molecule or precursor of cell apoptosis or necrosis pathway the up regulation of their expression may promote cell rupture to produce more eps the significant down regulation of pantothenic acid expression in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathway after foaming in all three reactors may also imply that the degradation of eps is limited in summary the foaming mechanism was revealed from multiple scales and demonstrates the critical role of eps during ad foaming the eps characteristic functional groups or cross linked structures that cause foaming and their changes in the foaming process and the law of reduction remain to be elucidated thus follow up research should aim to a more specific and systematic study of the foaming characteristics of different forms of eps this may help to build a new perspective on foaming early warning and targeted defoaming strategies 4 conclusions eps related parameters are positively correlated with foaming height under three disturbance conditions and they may contribute to foaming by lowering surface tension microbial community shift would occur under stress conditions caused by environmental disturbances furthermore the highly tolerant microorganisms could resist the stress environment by producing more eps contributing to foaming under the three environmental disturbances most of the up regulated and surface active metabolites are lipid or lipid like molecules among which sphingomyelin and ceramide are involved in the signal molecular transduction process related to cell apoptosis or necrosis and might be involved in the accumulation of eps pantothenate and coa biosynthesis pathway is enriched under the three disturbance conditions and the expression of pantothenic acid is significantly down regulated which may be related to the hindered degradation of eps the response of multi scale parameters in the foaming process indicates that eps is the key factor causing foam author contributions all authors contributed to the structure and writing of the article declaration of competing

15984,removal of planktivorous fish is used extensively in northern temperate lakes to reduce phytoplankton abundance via enhanced zooplankton grazing however whether this method would work also in large subtropical highland lakes to alleviate cyanobacterial blooms is unknown we conducted a one year pilot in situ experiment where we removed a substantial biomass of fish in a fenced in area followed by a 3 year whole lake experiment where the dominant fish species japanese smelt was removed in lake erhai in southwest china the fencing experiments showed that between july and november when the biomass of the removed stock reached 4 g m2 the zooplankton biomass inside the fence increased significantly compared to a control fence in the full lake experiment we found that sustained removal of japanese smelt led to an increase in the biomass of cladocerans daphnia spp but especially of bosmina spp and a significant decrease in the biomass of cyanobacteria and chlorophyta additionally a marked increase in the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass as well as an increase in the body size of cladocerans emphasising the importance of enhanced top down control for mitigating cyanobacterial blooms following extensive fish removal our results reveal that removal of small fish here japanese smelt can lead to a reduction of the phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass through a trophic cascade in highland deep subtropical lakes thus fish removal may be a feasible additional restoration tool to external nutrient loading reduction in such lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomanipulation trophic cascades japanese smelt blue green algae blooms subtropical lake 1 introduction the frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in lakes is increasing globally due to progressive eutrophication o neil et al 2012 these cyanobacterial blooms have numerous negative effects including higher water turbidity svirÄev et al 2014 rosinska et al 2017 reduced fish production carstensen et al 2014 disappearance of submerged macrophytes he et al 2014 li et al 2021 and significant declines in biodiversity amorim and moura 2021 cyanobacterial blooms and poor water clarity are frequently observed in shallow lakes with high nutrient concentrations chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 the primary aim of lake restoration is to eradicate blooms particularly those caused by potentially toxic cyanobacteria qin et al 2015 to prevent lake deterioration researchers worldwide have explored methods to control cyanobacteria blooms and one of these methods is biomanipulation shapiro et al 1975 used to speed up recovery of eutrophic lakes following an external nutrient loading reduction jeppesen et al 2012 biomanipulation typically with focus on removal of zooplanktivorous fish or in a few cases on introduction of piscivorous fish is used to augment grazing on phytoplankton via enhanced zooplankton abundance today biomanipulation is a commonly applied tool to shift eutrophic temperate lakes from a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton to a more transparent state dominated by submerged macrophytes mcqueen et al 1986 sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2008 and it has been used extensively and with success in small and shallow lakes in northern temperate europe sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 however its long term success is uncertain removal of a high proportion of planktivorous fish for 1 2 years has been recommended to avoid regrowth of the original plant population and to stimulate the growth of young specimens hansson et al 1998 jeppesen et al 2012 whether the biomanipulation techniques used in northern temperate lakes can be successfully applied to warm lakes as well is debatable lazzaro 1997 jeppesen et al 2005b as there are several important differences in fish assemblage structure between warm i e tropical subtropical and mediterranean cold and temperate zones jeppesen et al 2010 meerhoff et al 2012 in warm lakes the structure of fish assemblages is typically more complex than in temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2012 omnivorous fish are dominant which makes the nutrient cycling in the water column more diverse mcintyre et al 2008 munshaw et al 2013 moreover the top down control of piscivorous fish is weaker in warm lakes than in temperate lakes as shown in studies of large number of subtropical lakes gelÃ³s et al 2010 but as for temperate lakes studies in sub tropical and mediterranean lakes show that a reduction of nutrient loads can improve the ecological status by diminishing the phytoplankton biomass and increasing the water clarity jeppesen et al 2005a coveney et al 2005 romo et al 2005 beklioglu and tan 2008 it is debated how filter feeding fish affect the plankton community as the effect depends on fish size and stocking density food availability and ecological conditions spataru and gophen 1985 costa pierce 1992 and stocking may lead to ecological degradation lin et al 2014 mao et al 2020 nevertheless in chinese sub tropical eutrophic lakes and reservoirs stocking of silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix has remained widely used in an attempt to control cyanobacterial blooms zhang et al 2006 guo et al 2015 but see mao et al 2020 before the 1950s lake erhai maintained a structure characterised by primarily indigenous fish species with dominance of species such as schizothorax taliensis wu and wang 1999 the lake fisheries production was low on average 450 t a year at a time when the lake was well endowed with biological resources and available spare ecological niches planktivorous fish bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp have been introduced and studied in 13 lakes on the yunnan guizhou plateau xie and chen 2001 including the highland lake erhai starting in the 1950s with the aim of increasing fish production after the 1980s the introduction of icefish neosalanx taihuensis led to a significant reduction of zooplankton abundance in the lake lin et al 2013 around 2010 he planktivorous japanese smelt first appeared in the lake and became the dominant fish after 2016 yin et al 2021 in recent decades lake erhai has been detrimentally affected by the introduction of planktivorous fish and eutrophication jiang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 and there are currently no significant positive effects of stocking silver and bighead carp in the lake yi et al 2016 yang et al 2019 in studies of shallow subtropical lakes removal of fish typically has no effect on the zooplankton due to the rapid reproduction of dominant and dense omnivorous fish liu et al 2018 moreover fish predation on zooplankton is generally less strong in deep lakes than in shallow lakes jeppesen et al 1997 thus relatively deep subtropical highland lakes such as lake erhai may show fish removal effects that are more similar to the responses of temperate lakes than to those of lowland subtropical shallow lakes firstly lake erhai has a lower annual average temperature than is typical for subtropical lakes secondly small planktivorous fish are abundant in the lake yin et al 2021 with daphnia spp being the predominant zooplankton species in winter and spring while small cladocerans and copepods are the dominant species in summer and autumn yang et al 2014 accordingly removal of planktivorous fish may potentially be an effective way to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms via a trophic cascade through an increase in large bodied zooplankton we conducted an in situ fence 0 35 km2 biomanipulation experiment in lake erhai that involved removal of zooplanktivorous fish experimental period april 2018 may 2019 followed by whole lake 250 km2 experiments experimental period pre biomanipulation december 2017 april 2019 during biomanipulation may 2019 november 2020 where the quantity of fish removed was based on the results of the fencing experiments we hypothesised that removal of planktivorous fish would strongly affect the zooplankton and phytoplankton community via a trophic cascade summarised in fig 1 therefore the main objectives of the current study were 1 to propose a suitable model for the removal of planktivorous fish in lake erhai 2 to assess the effectiveness of fish removal for alleviating cyanobacterial blooms and 3 to provide lake management and decision makers with effective solutions for lake restoration 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake erhai is a highland lake 25Âº36 25Âº58 n 100Âº06 100Âº18 e altitude 1974 m located in yunnan province southwest china fig 2 the lake has a surface area of 252 km2 and a volume of 2 959 109 m3 the lake is situated in a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 15 0 c and it has an average depth of 10 5 m and a maximum depth of 20 9 m the lake has experienced severe eutrophication in recent decades with frequent cyanobacterial blooms chen et al 2018 the lake has shifted from an oligotrophic to a meso eutrophic state with current tn values ranging from 0 39 to 0 60 mg l and tp values from 0 004 to 0 028 mg l yu et al 2014 over the past 60 years lake erhai has experienced multiple anthropogenic disturbances of which the introduction of non native fish for aquaculture as well as eutrophication are the most evident wu and wang 1999 fei 2012 lin et al 2012 following the establishment of non native species and the decline or disappearance of native species the main fish harvested in the lake gradually shifted from medium sized native fish to small non native fish tang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 around 2010 japanese smelt a small zooplanktivorous fish was first detected in the lake subsequently the species quickly established a large population and after 2017 it became the dominant fish species with an annual catch of nearly 3000 t accounting to around 30 of the total catch table 1 yin et al 2021 the most common zooplankton taxa in the lake are daphnia spp small cladocerans such as bosmina longirostris ceriodaphnia quadrangula and chydorus sphaericus and the main copepods are nauplii and advanced stages of cyclopoid copepods the dominant submerged macrophytes are potamogeton maackianus and vallisneria natans the phytoplankton is dominated by cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta 2 2 biomanipulation measures we conducted a one year april 2018 may 2019 fish removal experiment in a fenced in area area i 0 35 km2 with another area area ii acting as control with no treatment fig 2 prior to the start of the experiment no fence separated area i from area ii we sampled and analysed the plankton and water quality in both areas and found similar nutrient levels and chlorophyll a concentrations subsequently we constructed fences in area i and ii the material used for the area ii fence was single layer vinyl mesh mesh size 3 5 cm and double layered mesh window screen mesh mesh size 0 500 mm for the inner layer for area i meaning that the fish in area i and area ii could not enter each other fig 2 fish were removed twice monthly in area i with large draw nets from the beginning of june 2018 a total of 2 36 tons of fish were removed including 68 japanese

removed were mainly japanese smelt and the july november fish removal significantly contributed to the increase of the zooplankton population see below consequently we undertook a full scale removal of japanese smelt in the lake pre biomanipulation december 2017 april 2019 and during biomanipulation may 2019 november 2020 a total of 2829 tons 113 kg ha of japanese smelt were removed by approximately 1000 fishing vessels per day from may 2019 repeated fish removed using gillnets mesh size 1 5 2 2 cm designed particularly to japanese smelt capture 2 3 sample collection three sampling sites n1 n2 n3 were established in area i and three s1 s2 s3 in area ii integrated water and plankton samples were collected monthly from two experimental areas starting in april 2018 integrated water samples from each site at the upper e g 0 5 m below the surface middle midway between the surface and the bottom and lower i e 0 5 m above the sediment surface parts of the water column were collected by a 5 l modified patalas bottle sampler followed by immediate analysis of physico chemical parameters and plankton communities total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chl a of each sample were determined in the laboratory according to the methods of huang et al 1999 secchi depth sd was measured with a black and white secchi disk 20 cm in diameter in situ to determine the transparency of the water a total of nine sampling sites e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7 e8 e9 were established for the whole lake experiment and plankton samples were taken monthly starting in december 2017 with samples were collected in the same way as for the fencing experiment fig 2 a 1 litre sample of water was preserved with lugol s reagent and concentrated to 50 ml for phytoplankton analysis after settling for 48 h huang et al 1999 colonies or filamentous algal cells were separated using an ultrasonicator jy88 ii scientiz ningbo zhejiang china the phytoplankton in a 0 1 ml sample was then counted using a regular olympus microscope olympus tokyo japan at 400x magnification and converted to biomass based on the cell size of the different phytoplankton taxa the phytoplankton was taxonomically identified according to hu and wei hu and wei 2006 ten l water samples of crustaceans were filtered through a 25 69 Î¼m plankton net and preserved in 5 formalin for further analysis huang et al 1999 all individuals were counted and identified and at least 30 individuals of each species were measured at 40 magnification under a regular olympus microscope olympus tokyo japan chiang and du 1979 sheng

analysis for the analyses of the whole lake data set we used the following two periods pre japanese smelt removal december 2017 april 2019 and during the removal of japanese smelt may 2019 november 2020 to identify the impact of top down effects of fish predation we used biological indicators indicative of food web interactions jeppesen et al 2003 jackson et al 2007 the ratio of the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio was used as indicator of the grazing pressure of zooplankton on phytoplankton jeppesen et al 2003 significant differences in plankton densities and biomass between three years within a season separately were calculated using one way analysis of variance test anova whereas these significant differences were presented as different lower case letters p 0 05 as fish removal was conducted from july to november in one year and as lake erhai is vulnerable to eruptions of algal blooms after july we analysed annual variations in the biomass and density of phytoplankton from july to november we used anova to reveal differences in the biomass and density of cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta as well as in zooplankton biomass and density in july november each year before and during the removal of japanese smelt significance was set at p 0 05 all comparisons were performed using r 4 0 3 r development core team 2020 3 results 3 1 fencing experiments the effects of fish removal in the fencing experiment on zooplankton and water physicochemical variables are shown in fig 3 the proportion of japanese smelt removed in terms of biomass and abundance were 68 and 40 respectively the removal of fish between july and november 4 g m2 in total significantly increased the zooplankton density and biomass inside compared to outside the fence p 0 05 fig 3a 3d however no significant changes were found in the water quality variables tn tp chl a water transparency p 0 05 likely due to water movement between the fences fig 3e 3h furthermore the biomass of bosmina spp and copepods showed a large increase between 18 jul and 18 nov following the fish removal compared to the control fig 4 a 4d a minor increase in daphnia spp biomass was also observed fig 4a 4d these results encouraged us to do a whole lake experiment focusing on removal of the dominant japanese smelt 3 2 large scale lake experiments 3 2 1 variations in zooplankton and phytoplankton on a seasonal scale the percentage biomass of cladocerans showed an increasing trend after the removal of japanese smelt fig 5 particularly the biomass percentage of daphnia spp and bosmina spp bacillariophyta and other phytoplankton taxa tended to reach a higher biomass contribution after the fish removal at the expense of cyanobacteria and chlorophyta especially during periods of increased daphnia spp abundance the densities of cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta showed a significant decrease in all four seasons after the fish removal as well as a decline of other phytoplankton taxa in autumn and spring p 0 05 fig 6 a 6d after the fish removal the phytoplankton biomass declined in autumn and winter particularly for cyanobacteria and chlorophyta p 0 05 similarly the biomass of bacillariophyta and other phytoplankton taxa decreased markedly during summer p 0 05 fig 6e 6h on the contrary the biomass of bacillariophyta increased considerably in winter and spring following the removal of japanese smelt p 0 05 there was a marked seasonal increase in cladoceran biomass following the biomanipulation in particular the biomass of daphnia spp increased significantly in autumn and winter p 0 05 the biomass of bosmina spp also increased markedly in summer and autumn while the biomass of copepods decreased significantly in summer p 0 05 fig 7 a 7d the average body mass of daphnia spp increased markedly in winter after the fish removal and bosmina spp increased distinctly in all four seasons the average body mass of other cladocerans showed a considerable increase in spring autumn and winter while body mass of copepods decreased significantly in spring and summer fig 7e 7h 3 2 2 impact of fish removal on phytoplankton and zooplankton july november our main focus was on the period july november where cyanobacteria typically are most abundant in this period the biomass of cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta decreased progressively and significantly p 0 001 during the biomanipulation while the response of the other taxa was weak fig 8 a 8d as for zooplankton the biomass of bosmina spp increased considerably p 0 001 and the biomass of daphnia spp increased slightly while other cladocerans did not show any significant changes fig 9 a 9c the biomass of copepods declined markedly after the fish removal p 0 05 fig 9d the average body mass of cladocerans increased significantly p 0 001 after the fish removal fig 10 a while the average body mass of copepods decreased p 0 001 fig 10b the increase in zooplankton to phytoplankton ratios indicates enhanced grazing on phytoplankton our results showed a significant increase in the biomass ratio of cladocerans relative to cyanobacteria p 0 001 after the fish removal as well as a pronounced increase in the ratio of copepods to cyanobacteria p 0 05 fig 11 a 11b additionally the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass was higher after the removal of fish p 0 001 fig 11c 4 discussion we used large fenced in areas to test the effect of fish removal on zooplankton followed by a whole lake fish removal in lake erhai to assess the effectiveness of fish removal in controlling or mitigating algae blooms our results in the fenced in areas suggested that removal of japanese smelt from july to december could increase the biomass of zooplankton although it did not have any cascading effect likely due to water exchange with the controls the whole lake massive removal of japanese smelt also resulted in increased zooplankton biomass and less phytoplankton notably of cyanophytes furthermore the change in the biomass ratio of zooplankton daphnia spp bosmina spp and copepods to phytoplankton cyanobacteria indicated a significant increase in the zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton following the fish removal the biomass of daphnia spp showed an increasing trend in winter and autumn compared to before removal during the period from october of the current year to may of the following year daphnia had a short window of opportunity lin et al 2013 yang et al 2014 gong 2020 before the fish predation increase due to fish recruitment and higher temperatures as seen in other subtropical and warm temperate lakes romo et al 2005 however several other cladocerans exhibited statistically significant increases in summer during the fish removal notably bosmina which can be attributed to the reduced fish predation dodson 1974 bosmina can take advantage of the absence of the superior competitor daphnia demott and kerfoot 1982 urabe 1990 it is also well documented that large zooplanktivorous fish selectively prey on larger more visible genera e g daphnia spp while relatively small species e g bosmina spp are vulnerable to attack and selective predation by small zooplanktivorous fish and macroinvertebrate predators brooks and dodson 1965 such as japanese smelt cyclopoid copepods are thought to be comparatively less affected by fish predation as they to some extent due to their swimming behaviour can avoid predation while calanoid copepods are often more susceptible to fish predation leibold 1991 min et al 2021 we found a reduction in the biomass of cyclopoid copepods likely because of competition with cladocerans and calanoid copepods brooks and dodson 1965 it is well known that zooplanktivorous fish influence the abundance of phytoplankton biomass in lakes by altering the zooplankton grazing in north temperate lakes zooplankton reduced the phytoplankton biomass after a biomanipulation that led to increase in body size of cladocerans and higher zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio hansson et al 1998 jeppesen et al 2004 sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2008 2012 and particularly cyanobacteria was affected sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 we also found that the whole lake fish removal was accompanied by a reduction in the biomass of cyanobacteria as well as of chlorophyta our results are more similar to those found in studies of northern temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2007 than to results from subtropical shallow lakes liu et al 2018 likely due to lower temperatures in this highland lake as well as its large depth as for temperature behrens and lafferty 2007 suggest that a warming climate may lead to changes in the diet of fish resulting in increased consumption and assimilation of plant matter in the present study planktivorous fish dominated the highland lakes while omnivorous and bottom feeding fish often dominate the lowland lakes wang et al 2021 as for depth unlike the situation in shallow lakes in deep lakes zooplankton may in part avoid fish predation by daytime vertical migration to deeper parts of the lakes gliwicz 1986 5 conclusions biomanipulation i e the removal of a substantial amount of planktivorous japanese smelt was carried out to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic highland lake in a subtropical china the fish removal led to 1 a substantial shift in the zooplankton community with dominance of daphnia spp in autumn and winter and bosmina spp in summer and autumn 2 a decrease in the biomass percentage of copepods and 3 a significant increase in the zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio and body size of cladocerans followed by a reduction of cyanobacteria and chlorophyta biomass our study was of short term duration however and the longevity of the biomanipulation and whether a continuous strong fishing effort is needed to maintain or further strengthen top down effects warrant further studies attention should also be paid to the need for removing large bodied benthi planktivorous fish our result provides the first evidence that fish removal may be a feasible additional restoration tool to external nutrient loading reduction in subtropical although more work is needed the elucidate the long term effects and to optimize the method author contribution longgen guo made contributions to the design of the work chengjie yin

15984,removal of planktivorous fish is used extensively in northern temperate lakes to reduce phytoplankton abundance via enhanced zooplankton grazing however whether this method would work also in large subtropical highland lakes to alleviate cyanobacterial blooms is unknown we conducted a one year pilot in situ experiment where we removed a substantial biomass of fish in a fenced in area followed by a 3 year whole lake experiment where the dominant fish species japanese smelt was removed in lake erhai in southwest china the fencing experiments showed that between july and november when the biomass of the removed stock reached 4 g m2 the zooplankton biomass inside the fence increased significantly compared to a control fence in the full lake experiment we found that sustained removal of japanese smelt led to an increase in the biomass of cladocerans daphnia spp but especially of bosmina spp and a significant decrease in the biomass of cyanobacteria and chlorophyta additionally a marked increase in the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass as well as an increase in the body size of cladocerans emphasising the importance of enhanced top down control for mitigating cyanobacterial blooms following extensive fish removal our results reveal that removal of small fish here japanese smelt can lead to a reduction of the phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass through a trophic cascade in highland deep subtropical lakes thus fish removal may be a feasible additional restoration tool to external nutrient loading reduction in such lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomanipulation trophic cascades japanese smelt blue green algae blooms subtropical lake 1 introduction the frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in lakes is increasing globally due to progressive eutrophication o neil et al 2012 these cyanobacterial blooms have numerous negative effects including higher water turbidity svirÄev et al 2014 rosinska et al 2017 reduced fish production carstensen et al 2014 disappearance of submerged macrophytes he et al 2014 li et al 2021 and significant declines in biodiversity amorim and moura 2021 cyanobacterial blooms and poor water clarity are frequently observed in shallow lakes with high nutrient concentrations chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 the primary aim of lake restoration is to eradicate blooms particularly those caused by potentially toxic cyanobacteria qin et al 2015 to prevent lake deterioration researchers worldwide have explored methods to control cyanobacteria blooms and one of these methods is biomanipulation shapiro et al 1975 used to speed up recovery of eutrophic lakes following an external nutrient loading reduction jeppesen et al 2012 biomanipulation typically with focus on removal of zooplanktivorous fish or in a few cases on introduction of piscivorous fish is used to augment grazing on phytoplankton via enhanced zooplankton abundance today biomanipulation is a commonly applied tool to shift eutrophic temperate lakes from a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton to a more transparent state dominated by submerged macrophytes mcqueen et al 1986 sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2008 and it has been used extensively and with success in small and shallow lakes in northern temperate europe sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 however its long term success is uncertain removal of a high proportion of planktivorous fish for 1 2 years has been recommended to avoid regrowth of the original plant population and to stimulate the growth of young specimens hansson et al 1998 jeppesen et al 2012 whether the biomanipulation techniques used in northern temperate lakes can be successfully applied to warm lakes as well is debatable lazzaro 1997 jeppesen et al 2005b as there are several important differences in fish assemblage structure between warm i e tropical subtropical and mediterranean cold and temperate zones jeppesen et al 2010 meerhoff et al 2012 in warm lakes the structure of fish assemblages is typically more complex than in temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2012 omnivorous fish are dominant which makes the nutrient cycling in the water column more diverse mcintyre et al 2008 munshaw et al 2013 moreover the top down control of piscivorous fish is weaker in warm lakes than in temperate lakes as shown in studies of large number of subtropical lakes gelÃ³s et al 2010 but as for temperate lakes studies in sub tropical and mediterranean lakes show that a reduction of nutrient loads can improve the ecological status by diminishing the phytoplankton biomass and increasing the water clarity jeppesen et al 2005a coveney et al 2005 romo et al 2005 beklioglu and tan 2008 it is debated how filter feeding fish affect the plankton community as the effect depends on fish size and stocking density food availability and ecological conditions spataru and gophen 1985 costa pierce 1992 and stocking may lead to ecological degradation lin et al 2014 mao et al 2020 nevertheless in chinese sub tropical eutrophic lakes and reservoirs stocking of silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix has remained widely used in an attempt to control cyanobacterial blooms zhang et al 2006 guo et al 2015 but see mao et al 2020 before the 1950s lake erhai maintained a structure characterised by primarily indigenous fish species with dominance of species such as schizothorax taliensis wu and wang 1999 the lake fisheries production was low on average 450 t a year at a time when the lake was well endowed with biological resources and available spare ecological niches planktivorous fish bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp have been introduced and studied in 13 lakes on the yunnan guizhou plateau xie and chen 2001 including the highland lake erhai starting in the 1950s with the aim of increasing fish production after the 1980s the introduction of icefish neosalanx taihuensis led to a significant reduction of zooplankton abundance in the lake lin et al 2013 around 2010 he planktivorous japanese smelt first appeared in the lake and became the dominant fish after 2016 yin et al 2021 in recent decades lake erhai has been detrimentally affected by the introduction of planktivorous fish and eutrophication jiang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 and there are currently no significant positive effects of stocking silver and bighead carp in the lake yi et al 2016 yang et al 2019 in studies of shallow subtropical lakes removal of fish typically has no effect on the zooplankton due to the rapid reproduction of dominant and dense omnivorous fish liu et al 2018 moreover fish predation on zooplankton is generally less strong in deep lakes than in shallow lakes jeppesen et al 1997 thus relatively deep subtropical highland lakes such as lake erhai may show fish removal effects that are more similar to the responses of temperate lakes than to those of lowland subtropical shallow lakes firstly lake erhai has a lower annual average temperature than is typical for subtropical lakes secondly small planktivorous fish are abundant in the lake yin et al 2021 with daphnia spp being the predominant zooplankton species in winter and spring while small cladocerans and copepods are the dominant species in summer and autumn yang et al 2014 accordingly removal of planktivorous fish may potentially be an effective way to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms via a trophic cascade through an increase in large bodied zooplankton we conducted an in situ fence 0 35 km2 biomanipulation experiment in lake erhai that involved removal of zooplanktivorous fish experimental period april 2018 may 2019 followed by whole lake 250 km2 experiments experimental period pre biomanipulation december 2017 april 2019 during biomanipulation may 2019 november 2020 where the quantity of fish removed was based on the results of the fencing experiments we hypothesised that removal of planktivorous fish would strongly affect the zooplankton and phytoplankton community via a trophic cascade summarised in fig 1 therefore the main objectives of the current study were 1 to propose a suitable model for the removal of planktivorous fish in lake erhai 2 to assess the effectiveness of fish removal for alleviating cyanobacterial blooms and 3 to provide lake management and decision makers with effective solutions for lake restoration 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake erhai is a highland lake 25Âº36 25Âº58 n 100Âº06 100Âº18 e altitude 1974 m located in yunnan province southwest china fig 2 the lake has a surface area of 252 km2 and a volume of 2 959 109 m3 the lake is situated in a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 15 0 c and it has an average depth of 10 5 m and a maximum depth of 20 9 m the lake has experienced severe eutrophication in recent decades with frequent cyanobacterial blooms chen et al 2018 the lake has shifted from an oligotrophic to a meso eutrophic state with current tn values ranging from 0 39 to 0 60 mg l and tp values from 0 004 to 0 028 mg l yu et al 2014 over the past 60 years lake erhai has experienced multiple anthropogenic disturbances of which the introduction of non native fish for aquaculture as well as eutrophication are the most evident wu and wang 1999 fei 2012 lin et al 2012 following the establishment of non native species and the decline or disappearance of native species the main fish harvested in the lake gradually shifted from medium sized native fish to small non native fish tang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 around 2010 japanese smelt a small zooplanktivorous fish was first detected in the lake subsequently the species quickly established a large population and after 2017 it became the dominant fish species with an annual catch of nearly 3000 t accounting to around 30 of the total catch table 1 yin et al 2021 the most common zooplankton taxa in the lake are daphnia spp small cladocerans such as bosmina longirostris ceriodaphnia quadrangula and chydorus sphaericus and the main copepods are nauplii and advanced stages of cyclopoid copepods the dominant submerged macrophytes are potamogeton maackianus and vallisneria natans the phytoplankton is dominated by cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta 2 2 biomanipulation measures we conducted a one year april 2018 may 2019 fish removal experiment in a fenced in area area i 0 35 km2 with another area area ii acting as control with no treatment fig 2 prior to the start of the experiment no fence separated area i from area ii we sampled and analysed the plankton and water quality in both areas and found similar nutrient levels and chlorophyll a concentrations subsequently we constructed fences in area i and ii the material used for the area ii fence was single layer vinyl mesh mesh size 3 5 cm and double layered mesh window screen mesh mesh size 0 500 mm for the inner layer for area i meaning that the fish in area i and

current year to may of the following year daphnia had a short window of opportunity lin et al 2013 yang et al 2014 gong 2020 before the fish predation increase due to fish recruitment and higher temperatures as seen in other subtropical and warm temperate lakes romo et al 2005 however several other cladocerans exhibited statistically significant increases in summer during the fish removal notably bosmina which can be attributed to the reduced fish predation dodson 1974 bosmina can take advantage of the absence of the superior competitor daphnia demott and kerfoot 1982 urabe 1990 it is also well documented that large zooplanktivorous fish selectively prey on larger more visible genera e g daphnia spp while relatively small species e g bosmina spp are vulnerable to attack and selective predation by small zooplanktivorous fish and macroinvertebrate predators brooks and dodson 1965 such as japanese smelt cyclopoid copepods are thought to be comparatively less affected by fish predation as they to some extent due to their swimming behaviour can avoid predation while calanoid copepods are often more susceptible to fish predation leibold 1991 min et al 2021 we found a reduction in the biomass of cyclopoid copepods likely because of competition with cladocerans and calanoid copepods brooks and dodson 1965 it is well known that zooplanktivorous fish influence the abundance of phytoplankton biomass in lakes by altering the zooplankton grazing in north temperate lakes zooplankton reduced the phytoplankton biomass after a biomanipulation that led to increase in body size of cladocerans and higher zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio hansson et al 1998 jeppesen et al 2004 sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2008 2012 and particularly cyanobacteria was affected sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 we also found that the whole lake fish removal was accompanied by a reduction in the biomass of cyanobacteria as well as of chlorophyta our results are more similar to those found in studies of northern temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2007 than to results from subtropical shallow lakes liu et al 2018 likely due to lower temperatures in this highland lake as well as its large depth as for temperature behrens and lafferty 2007 suggest that a warming climate may lead to changes in the diet of fish resulting in increased consumption and assimilation of plant matter in the present study planktivorous fish dominated the highland lakes while omnivorous and bottom feeding fish often dominate the lowland lakes wang et al 2021 as for depth unlike the situation in shallow lakes in deep lakes zooplankton may in part avoid fish predation by daytime vertical migration to deeper parts of the lakes gliwicz 1986 5 conclusions biomanipulation i e the removal of a substantial amount of planktivorous japanese smelt was carried out to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic highland lake in a subtropical china the fish removal led to 1 a substantial shift in the zooplankton community with dominance of daphnia spp in autumn and winter and bosmina spp in summer and autumn 2 a decrease in the biomass percentage of copepods and 3 a significant increase in the zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio and body size of cladocerans followed by a reduction of cyanobacteria and chlorophyta biomass our study was of short term duration however and the longevity of the biomanipulation and whether a continuous strong fishing effort is needed to maintain or further strengthen top down effects warrant further studies attention should also be paid to the need for removing large bodied benthi planktivorous fish our result provides the first evidence that fish removal may be a feasible additional restoration tool to external nutrient loading reduction in subtropical although more work is needed the elucidate the long term effects and to optimize the method author contribution longgen guo made contributions to the design of the work chengjie yin
