2710,to effectively alleviate ice jam flood disasters it is necessary to carry out hazard assessments and predictions of ice jam flooding influenced by the operational scheme of a reservoir however traditional hydrologic flood routing techniques cannot effectively address the huge uncertainties caused by the many factors that lead to ice jam flooding in this paper a hazard assessment system for regulating flood discharge schemes is developed it is composed of a machine learning ml model long short term memory lstm and a river ice dynamic model rivice within a probabilistic method the modelling system is to aid in the challenge of predicting ice jam flooding downstream of reservoirs the lstm model forecasts the downstream flow under the operational discharge scheme and combined with the rivice model the backwater level profile of ice jams can be forecasted furthermore a set of backwater level profiles can be provided by probabilistic modelling and the probability of ice jam flood inundation can be calculated by comparing backwater levels with the elevation of the river bank this information can be used to warn of the hazard induced by operational discharges to better aid in the preparedness and mitigation of ice jam floods this system was tested successfully for the ice cover breakup period in the spring of 2008 and 2018 along the sanhuhekou bend reach of the yellow river in china keywords hazard assessment and prediction ice jam flooding downstream of reservoirs rivice lstm probabilistic modelling approach data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers in regions with high latitudes and extremely cold climates are often threatened by ice jams and their resulting flooding beltaos 1983 carr and vuyovich 2014 chang et al 2016a ice jams are irregular transient events that vary greatly with hydrologic hydraulic and ice conditions along the river lindenschmidt 2019 due to the chaotic nature of river ice jam formation the prediction of ice jam flood water levels is more challenging than for open water floods lindenschmidt et al 2019 slight changes in discharge ice jamming locations and initial water levels at the time of jamming can lead to different backwater level profiles of the ice jam flood water depths can far transcend open water depths for an equivalent flow lindenschmidt et al 2019 yu et al 2019 this means that small flows can cause extremely dangerous flood water levels during the ice cover breakup in the spring making it particularly important to predict and warn of the hazard of ice jam flooding in regulated rivers reservoir operation is the primary means of changing flow regimes for example a flow of more than 4000 m3 s at peace point is a necessary condition for ice jam flooding in the peace athabasca delta pad in alberta canada beltaos 2003 the w a c bennett dam on the peace river in canada regulates the outflow during the breakup periods reducing the frequency of ice jam flooding in the pad beltaos and peters 2020 another notable case is the yellow river in which there are 29 reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yellow river reservoirs operate not only to provide water and power but also to control ice jam floods especially in regards to preventing ice jam floods the operation of reservoirs ensures steady flow during the freeze up period and reduced flow during the breakup period chang et al 2016b in particular through sensitivity analysis xü et al 2021 concluded that the backwater level caused by ice jamming was the most sensitive to the flow it can be seen that reservoir regulation is the main means of changing natural flow regimes which can play an important role in ice jam flood prevention and control even after the construction and during the operation of reservoirs ice jam floods still cause serious economic losses and human casualties based on 2017 costing estimates the financial cost ensued by freezing rivers in north america was estimated at around us 300 million per year das and lindenschmidt 2020 a single event can also result in hundreds of millions of dollars in flooding damages in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray alberta canada ice jam flooding in 2020 caused the evacuation of about 13 000 people and more than half a billion dollars in insured damages das and lindenschmidt 2021 when discussing flooding caused by river ice jams the ning meng reach of the yellow river in china cannot be ignored for instance from 1991 to 2010 there have been 36 local ice jam disasters five of them resulting in breaches of the levees in the ning meng reach shi 2013 however in many countries prone to ice jams detailed records of ice jam damage are not available but the hazards are not negligible up to now the reasonable formulation of a reservoir operation scheme to reduce the hazard of ice jam flooding is still the concern of many communities considering the effects of reservoir operation it is challenging to predict the severity of downstream ice jam flooding for the following two reasons one reason is that hydrological models have difficulty to predict downstream flow in the upstream catchments regulated by reservoirs this is because considering the regulation of reservoirs in river systems is a major challenge in hydrological modeling applications especially during flood events when reservoirs dramatically change the natural flow regime another reason is that the process from ice cover breakup to ice jamming is nonlinear and nonstationary resulting from the interaction of a large number of hydraulic and hydrometeorological factors das et al 2020 lindenschmidt et al 2019 the ml model is a powerful mathematical tool which consists of many nonlinear computing modules with strong fault tolerance it has strong robustness to noisy data incorrect or abnormal data interferes with data analysis and can imitate a human thinking mode inductive reasoning to approximate multivariate nonlinear relationships between multiple variables for instance under the premise of not explicitly formulating physical relationships several ml models e g lstm artificial neural network random forest and support vector machine have been effectively applied in widespread hydrological agricultural and meteorological fields in applications such as drought assessment deo and şahin 2015 pariset et al 1966a flood forecasting kratzert et al 2018 madaeni et al 2021 song et al 2019 and crop yield prediction chlingaryan et al 2018 inspired by ml s excellent data based learning ability and potential to maximize the value of reservoir discharge this study introduced a specific ml model lstm to simulate river flow during reservoir operation research on the mechanism of ice jams began in the 1960s and was based on the steady state theory of ice pariset et al 1966b with the development of computing technology several numerical models can simulate dynamic process of river ice such as the one dimensional models rivjam beltaos 1993 ricen shen et al 1995 icejam healy and hicks 1999 river1d andrishak and hicks 2008 yrdim fu et al 2014 and rivice lindenschmidt 2017 and the two dimensional models dynaice shen et al 2000 and crissp2d liu et al 2021 for the yellow river yrdim has shown good results in the simulation of flow and ice regime during the freeze up period in the ning meng reach fu et al 2014 and rivice has successfully simulated the typical ice jam flooding events during the breakup period in the sanhuhekou bend reach xü et al 2021 however previous studies focused on deterministic simulations of ice jam floods without considering the chaotic nature of reservoir effects in order to consider the uncertainty in predictor variables frequency distribution fd analyses of variables is often carried out in hydrologic forecasting yu et al 2019 extended the copula method to ice flood probability prediction under nonstationary conditions hydrological process simulations can describe the relevant causal effects of inputs and outcomes while probabilistic prediction methods cannot such causality requires simulation of deterministic models in addition the hydrological processes in the simulation are actually deterministic processes obtained from nondeterministic inputs and river ice processes are no exception therefore a new approach is promising which places a deterministic river ice model in the monte carlo analysis moca method which has been successfully applied for prediction lindenschmidt et al 2019 climate response and flow regulation effect simulations rokaya et al 2019 of ice jam flooding this is a probabilistic modelling method based on physical models which is easily extended to study new ice jam flooding problems the moca method allows many simulations to be performed each with different parameter settings and boundary conditions drawn from a range of values of fds inspired by this method our study extended this probabilistic modeling method combined with a river ice model and ml model to predict ice jam flooding in a regulated river for informing reservoir operation this article is organized as follows in the second section the ice jam flooding regime in the yellow river basin and meteorological datasets are introduced the third section introduces our integrated probabilistic approach and evaluation metrics used to evaluate the lstm model the fourth section presents the results of constructing and operating the hazard assessment system for ice jam flooding which are subsequently discussed in the fifth section and summarized in the sixth section 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the 795 000 square kilometer area of the yellow river basin 96 119 n 32 42 e is located in the northern part of china with a length of about 1900 km from east to west and a length of about 1100 km from north to south fig 1 a the yellow river basin has great differences in landform among the various regions with numerous mountains including a large elevation difference between east and west winds from the northwest dominate across the basin in winter and the climate is dry and cold the annual minimum of daily minimum air temperature is generally below 0 c in the upper yellow river basin the daily air temperature stays below 0 c for 4 5 months and the annual minimum of daily minimum air temperature is 52 3 c generally most reaches of the yellow river are frozen in winter in the middle and upper ning meng reach of the yellow river the river gradient is gentle with a low flow velocity in a northerly direction the latitude difference from south to north is large hence the narrower downstream area freezes earlier and breaks up later than the southern upstream area fig 1 a high water discharges from the upstream reservoirs during breakup can lead to early ice jamming in the sharp meanders and narrow channels potentially leading to sharp rises in water levels in flood prone reaches which can seriously threaten the safety of levees and even breach them therefore the bayangaole sanhuhekou reach belonging to the ning meng reach of the yellow river is prone to ice jam floods this study was carried out along the yellow river from the bayangaole gauging station to the sanhuhekou gauging station sgs with a length of about 200 km fig 1 b it is worth noting that the bayangaole gauging station is located not far downstream of the sanshenggong reservoir sr and its records are regarded as the reservoir outflow the reach with a sharp bend at the sgs fig 1 c is downstream of the sr besides this reach has a small slope and a downstream bridge affecting its hydraulic regime according to statistics collected from 1990 to 2019 ice jam floods occurred more than 30 times in the inner mongolia reach of the yellow river including 5 times near the sgs zhao 2019 the most serious ice jam flood occurred in march 2008 when an ice jam formed at the sgs and caused a dike to breach resulting in flooding and leading to economic losses of about rmb 700 million fu et al 2014 the sanhuhekou bend reach fig 1 c is a key reach of ice jam flooding control with the operational scheme of the upstream sr discharge having particular importance and serves as a target portion of the yellow river to analyze the effect of the sr s operation scheme on resisting the ice jam floods 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 daily observation dataset of china s meteorological elements dodcme the dodcme comes from more than 2 400 meteorological stations in china this dataset includes atmospheric pressure air temperature precipitation evaporation relative humidity wind direction and speed sunshine duration and ground temperature at 0 cm nine of those stations are located in the study area fig 1 b and provide meteorological variables air temperature and precipitation data to train the lstm model data were downloaded from the following website https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 230 2 2 2 thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge tigge is a global research project undertaken by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf this project aims to gather the global ensemble forecast products with a unified format grib format of meteorological element data from 10 numerical prediction centers around the world and form a super ensemble forecast system to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts of 1 to 15 days forecast products provided by tigge have been widely used to drive flood forecasting with good results he et al 2010 pappenberger et al 2008 ye et al 2016 in the arid and semi arid areas of china in which our study area is located the forecast product from the ecmwf model is the most accurate when compared to other forecast products such as from the jma japan meteorological agency kma korea meteorological administration and ukmo united kingdom meteorological office models through the tigge data center he et al 2022 the emergency command structure in china requires a 3 day flood prediction period in this paper the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts model in tigge was used to provide precipitation and air temperature data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 a forecast duration of three days and a time step of one day the data were downloaded from the following website https apps ecmwf int datasets data tigge levtype 3dsfc type 3dcf 2 2 3 landsat data in this study images from two sensors of the landsat series of satellites were used etm landsat 7 and oli landsat 8 landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites were launched on 15 april 1999 and 11 february 2013 respectively the goal of landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites is to provide continuous images of the earth s surface for a variety of earth science applications that are suitable for time series processing analysis due to the failure of the etm sensor in may 2003 the later landsat 7 images had quality problems with missing bands the landsat images used in this study are from google earth engine gee https earthengine google com platform with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 d because of its high spatial resolution 30 m landsat images are often used to monitor river ice and map the extent of river ice for example sakai et al 2015 used landsat imagery to monitor the spatial and temporal extent of spring ice floods in the lena river in siberia in particular xiao et al 2020 used landsat images from 1984 to 2018 to reveal the extent historical change characteristics and future change trend of global river ice 2 2 4 channel cross section and width we have survey data for one cross section located at 8 km and 15 river widths data along the bend reach fig 1 c the average slope of the sanhuhekou reach is 0 00011 according to the width and cross section shape the geomorphology of the 10 km reach was constructed by interpolation using the slope 0 00011 the thalweg is extracted from the constructed river geomorphology accordingly the obtained river storage capacity is close to the actual value which is an important index of river flow capacity the average slope is very small and the error between the thalweg and the actual situation has very little effect on the river storage capacity the topographic data of the river channel were used in the rivice model to construct the sanhuhekou reach 3 methodology fig 2 shows an integrated hazard assessment system for ice jam flooding that can be used to guide the operation of the reservoir this system is composed of two models input data sources outputs from each model and their interrelationships next we mainly discuss the construction of each individual model and probabilistic modelling method 3 1 lstm the lstm model is an artificial neural network method used to identify patterns in sequential data its original form was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lstm network structure is similar to rnn which consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer as well as the weight parameters and functions of these layers however the biggest difference between the rnn model and the lstm model is that units in the hidden layer of the latter have the ability to selectively learn and forget or retain information with corresponding weight parameters and functions graves et al 2013 this is the basis for the lstm model to take into account both long term dependence and short term memory of time series data after all the weights of the lstm model are initialized the neural network receives the input value and propagates forward to calculate the output value for the phase from hidden layer to output layer the error gradient between the actual and predicted outputs is fed back to the selected optimizer the optimizer optimizes weights based on the principle of minimizing prediction error in the whole operation process the weight will be calculated repeatedly in each iteration to continuously reduce the prediction error the choice of optimizer belongs to the hyperparameter of machine model construction in addition the size of units in the hidden layer and the number of samples processed by each iteration of the neural network are also worth noting the setting of the above super parameters will significantly affect the performance of prediction which can be determined by the trial and error method in the model training and verification stages fang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 our lstm model not only takes meteorological data as input data but also takes the reservoir outflow as input data as a model based on data training the lstm model has a demonstrated ability to explore complex and nonlinear relationships among data in particular the lstm model can easily simulate the storage effect of the basin and learn the relationship between rainfall runoff kratzert et al 2018 based on the demonstrated learning ability of the lstm model the lstm model is applied as a modeling method to predict downstream flow of the reservoir with input data the lstm model we used here consists of an input layer a hidden layer with three units and an output layer in our model the input layer has five inputs namely the daily outflow do of the sr i e the daily runoff of the bayangaole gauging station the daily precipitation dp and daily air temperature dat in the study area i e the mean daily rainfall and daily temperature from nine meteorological stations day of year doy and the daily runoff dr of the sgs the latter is not only one of the five inputs but also the only output as detailed in table 1 to sensibly simulate the storage effect in hydrological modeling and predict river flow snow accumulation and soil moisture content need to be dynamical variables for this reason it is necessary to set appropriate time steps of input and output data table 1 in addition we adopted the following training process to ensure the robustness of the model firstly observation data from 2006 to 2017 were divided data from 2006 to 2011 are used for training data from 2012 to 2014 were used for validation of the model and data from 2015 to 2017 were used for testing next all input data was converted to a set of normalized values between 0 and 1 according to the loss values of the training period and the verification period the hyperparameters of the model were manually adjusted to avoid overfitting finally the 3 day forecast meteorological variables were used as input in the calibrated lstm model to obtain 3 day flow forecasts 3 2 rivice in this paper rivice an open source numerical model developed and released by environment and climate change canada eccc was used to deterministically simulate the backwater level caused by ice jamming lindenschmidt 2019 rivice is a loosely coupled model of the ice and the hydraulics that allows hydraulic and ice dynamic processes to be calculated separately because it does not require complex simultaneous solutions of ice and hydraulic equations firstly the flow water level and flow velocity are calculated in the hydraulic process and then the volume thickness and position changes of river ice are calculated based on these results then the state of ice at this moment is considered in the hydraulic calculation at the next time step and the calculation is repeated in accordance with this process the implicit finite difference scheme is used to solve saint venant equations for hydraulic processes and an algebraic equation is used to calculate the river ice dynamic processes eccc 2013 this makes the model highly efficient and greatly reduces the time cost of hundreds of simulations extensive descriptions of the model are provided in lindenschmidt 2017 and eccc 2013 the parameters and boundary conditions used in the key river ice processes that are relevant to this study are shown in fig 3 the following provides a brief description the initial downstream ice cover in rivice has an average thickness h and a lodgement cross section x vice as a boundary condition restricts the dynamic simulation of ice jam formation the upstream boundary supplies the volume of inflowing ice vice per time step with thickness st and porosity ps which is transported downstream at the mean flow velocity and arrested by the leading edge of the intact ice cover with thickness ft and porosity pc when the incoming ice reaches the leading edge of the intact ice cover retraction of the ice jam occurs which thicken the ice jam through shoving and telescoping the summation of external forces acting on the ice jam include the hydrodynamic thrust on the leading edge of the ice cover ft the hydraulic drag on the bottom of the ice jam fd the ice cover s weight in the slope direction fw the frictional force of the intact ice cover against the river banks ff and the internal resistive force vertically along the thickness of the ice cover fi ff and fi are parameterized by k1tan and k2 respectively the retraction continuously thickens the ice jam until ft fd fw ff fi excessive thickening can lead to ice jam flooding therefore the calculation of the force applied to the ice jam is very important more details on the equations related to retraction are presented in the appendix forces applied to ice jam ver and vdep are the threshold values of mean flow velocity flow erodes the ice from the bottom of the ice jam and carries it downstream when the mean flow velocity exceeds ver if the mean flow velocity drops below vdep deposition of ice on the bottom of the ice jam will occur the hydraulic roughness of the river bed and the ice are important parameters of simulating flow and ice regime river bed roughness is constant and denoted by manning s coefficient nbed ice underside roughness is a function of the ice cover s thickness and parameterized by the nezhikhovskiy coefficient n8m upstream flow qus and downstream water level wds are important hydrodynamic boundary conditions in combination with fig 3 and the brief description it is possible to explain how parameters and boundary conditions are incorporated in ice jam flood simulations furthermore various inputs of parameters and boundary conditions are required to setup the rivice model and are classified and summarized in table 5 in this study we chose a time step of 30 s and then adjusted and validated the model parameters according to the physical mechanism of the model 3 3 probabilistic modelling method moca is a statistical method used to predict an outcome when randomness is present in the input variables the core of moca is random sampling values from fds are randomly selected and used as input of the model for simulation this process is repeated hundreds of times and hundreds of results are provided then these results are analyzed and utilized to obtain a probability distribution the use of fds rather than single values of parameters and boundary conditions can better solve the uncertainty in predicting input variables and reflect the chaotic nature of different ice jam conditions by employing the moca method the probabilistic behavior of the rivice model outputs i e ice jam flooding water levels was derived for different initial conditions that were randomly configurated this probabilistic modeling approach in this paper has been applied to the following two aspects the calibration of the boundary condition s fd and the probabilistic prediction lindenschmidt et al 2019 fds of rivice s 12 parameters and 3 boundary conditions fig 3 need to be established in our probabilistic modelling method a uniform distribution is mainly used for pdf s probability density function where prior knowledge is unavailable due to acquisition difficulty or lack of observation and a gumbel distribution is used for extreme data available to construct a pdf fds of the 9 parameters ps pc ver vdep k1tan k2 n8m nbed and x are constructed by uniform distribution upper and lower ranges which constrain the uniform distribution are based on available information from deterministic calibration and simulation results sgs records ice thickness at the beginning of breakup periods the fds of the remaining three parameters st ft and h relating to ice thickness are constructed by fitting the gumbel distribution according to the station ice thickness observation values one value per year for 16 years sgs records instantaneous maximum water discharge during the breakup periods and instantaneous water level at the beginning of breakup periods which respectively provide extreme values for the boundary conditions qus and wds the fds of qus and wds are constructed by fitting the gumbel distribution function according to their respective station observation values one value per year for 16 years more attention should be given to the distribution of boundary condition vice for which data are difficult to observe making it difficult to determine the volume of ice forming the ice jam in addition a uniform distribution would overestimate the frequency of the more extreme larger volume of incoming ice for the above reasons an initial fd of vice was estimated assuming a gumbel distribution whose distribution parameters location and scale were later refined through calibration a moca method is presented for the model calibration using fds of qus and wds as objective functions for the model we use fds as calibration targets rather than the traditional single value or time series such as water level or flow used for hydrologic and hydrological modeling the specific calibration process is as follows sixteen this number corresponds to the number of years used for the fds of boundary conditions simulations were run within the moca method using the estimated fd of vice and constructed fds as input the simulated water levels and flow at sgs were extracted from each simulation to construct the simulated fds of water level and flow and then compared with the observed fds of water level and flow if the simulated fds did not coincide with the observed fds the fd of vice was adjusted and the simulation was repeated 16 times this process was repeated until the simulated fds matched the observed fds well notably in order to predict the maximum water level when ice jam flooding would occur and better provide prediction results for flood control work the fds of observed water level and flow were constructed by fitting the gumbel distribution according to the instantaneous maximum water level and flow values recorded by the sgs during breakup periods for 16 years as the fd of vice was calibrated the probabilistic modeling method was completed then the river ice model could be run 100 times with each simulation randomly extracting a set of boundary conditions and parameter values from the established fds finally 100 simulation results were integrated to output the water level profile set of the whole reach from which the fds of water level could be calculated for each section of interest to obtain the probability of occurrence of exceeding a specific water level the probability information obtained by this probabilistic modelling method has been used for the subsequent ice jam flooding disaster and hazard quantification 3 4 evaluation metrics four different statistical evaluation indicators were applied mse mean squared error rbias relative bias r pearson correlation coefficient and nse nash sutcliffe evaluation among them mse is used as the effect evaluation of adjusting hyperparameters of the lstm model and r rbias and nse are used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the lstm model table 2 4 results 4 1 hazard assessment system setup 4 1 1 lstm validation and testing in the process of lstm model construction the weight parameters of the model are automatically updated by the optimizer and the setting of the super parameters has a significant impact on the performance of the model which is manually set in this study the goal of model training is to minimize loss value as shown in fig 4 with the increase of epochs the loss values of training data and validation data gradually decreased and tended to be stable indicating that the training process was satisfactory table 3 lists the search space and optimization results for hyperparameters as a result the adam optimizer is adopted the number of units in the hidden layer is 3 and the number of samples processed by the neural network in each iteration is 50 fig 5 shows the validation and testing results of the lstm model the results show that the simulated flow is in good agreement with the measured flow at the sanhuhekou gauging station the rbias r and nse values are 1 16 0 99 and 0 96 in the validation phase and the rbias r and nse values are 0 79 0 97 and 0 95 in the testing phase even though the test data is greatly different from the validation data the model still shows good simulation accuracy during the test period therefore in general we obtain a well trained model with high prediction accuracy compared with fig 5 table 4 also shows the simulation effect of flow and extreme flow during the ice flood season the evaluation metrics r and nse were analyzed although the simulation effect of flooding in the ice flood season is lower than that of the year the simulation effect of extreme flow in the ice flood season is excellent an extreme flow forecast is the key point in disaster warning it is worth noting that the simulation accuracy of extreme flow is the highest in the testing phase with an r value of 0 98 and an nse value of 0 97 the results of rbias show that the lstm model provides unbiased simulation for extreme flow in the ice flood season during the validation and testing phases rbias is 2 26 and 1 05 respectively with more years of data available we might be able to train a better lstm model 4 1 2 rivice setup and calibration the processes of the ice cover breaking an ice jam forming and the ice jam progressing downstream during the breakup period is highly uncertain as a result it has been a great challenge in this study to simulate backwater levels caused by such complex processes since river ice modelling could not accurately capture such a process of complex change with only a set of parameters the flooding process in the breakup period of 2009 was selected in this study to illustrate the feasibility of rivice s simulation of ice jam backwater levels see calibration in table 5 fig 6 shows that the simulated backwater level profile of the 2009 ice jam event along the sanhuhekou bend reach is consistent with the observed ice water levels in addition the water level of ice jam flooding is nearly 2 m higher than that of open water with the same flow indicating that ice jam flooding is extremely dangerous more detailed descriptions of the calibration of the rivice model adapted to the 2008 2010 ice jam flooding events in the yellow river are provided elsewhere see xü et al 2021 4 1 3 probabilistic modelling method construction according to the deterministic calibration results and the user manual s recommendations for the rivice model the fds of 9 parameters ps pc ver vdep k1tan k2 n8m nbed and x with unknown prior pdf can be constructed by uniform distribution and the upper and lower limits of uniform distribution are shown based on the ice regime observation data of 16 years the location parameter μ 0 2 and the scale parameter α 0 1 of the gumbel distribution are calculated and the three parameters st ft and h adopt this fd see table 5 for details the calibration process of the fd of boundary condition vice is shown in fig 7 the fds of boundary conditions qus and wds are gumbel distributions a and b in fig 7 with the location parameter μ 649 90 1018 59 and scale parameter α 266 30 0 60 sixteen groups of values were randomly selected from the fds of determined parameters and boundary conditions and the assumed boundary condition vice fig 7 c as the input for the rivice model for 16 moca simulations from which flow and water level at the sgs were extracted plotting positions and fds theoretical curves were calculated to be compared with observed fds after repeated comparisons with assumed location and scale parameters μ 40 00 α 18 00 simulated fds matched the observed fds reasonably well d and e in fig 7 in order to reduce contingency in the calibration of vice fds the 16 moca simulations were repeated 22 times depending on requirements using the calibrated vice distributions to provide two envelopes of simulated fds ensuring that the observed fds ran approximately along the medians of the envelopes f and g in fig 7 so far we have completed the construction of the probabilistic modeling method and the detailed fds are shown in table 5 4 2 real time hazard assessment operations after calibrating the fds of vice the probabilistic modelling was completed when the ice jam front is approaching the flood hazard prone area information such as operational discharge scheme water level and ice condition should be collected with more information becoming available the range of the model s future boundary conditions can be predicted according to the constrained range of boundary conditions the probabilistic modelling method can be used for ice jam flooding prediction lindenschmidt 2019 in the springs of 2008 and 2018 two ice jam flooding hazard assessments were conducted on the sanhuhekou bend reach along the yellow river to show how the forecasting framework was implemented during the hazard assessment periods 13 23 march 2008 and 9 16 march 2018 fig 11 the 2008 ice jam flood was the most costly in nearly 50 years but the 2018 ice jam flood caused no disaster in addition an example using actual data is provided below fig 10 to show the forecasting operation 4 2 1 lstm 3 day flow forecasts tigge provides a 3 day forecast of meteorological element data this prediction enables the lstm model to be used to predict flows at the bend reach of the sanhuhekou regulated by the sr according to the daily updated forecast of meteorological data combined with the operational discharge scheme of the sr the lstm model was driven to obtain 1 day flow forecasts in our study 3 day flow forecasts are required the 1 day flow forecast could be used as the input to the lstm model for a rolling forecast to obtain the 3 day flow forecast this process of 3 day flow forecasting begins before the breakup period and continues until the end of breakup period fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the six and nine 3 day flow forecasts in 2008 and 2018 have reasonable trends and accuracy providing reliable forecast information for the probabilistic modeling method the maximum and minimum values of the fd range of qus were established for flow prediction for the next three days fig 10 a from which the random values of qus used in moca simulations were extracted fig 10 a if the original discharge scheme of the reservoir has a high hazard of causing disastrous ice jam flooding the scheme can be adjusted in time for flow prediction 4 2 2 downstream water level for each hazard assessment the downstream water level at the beginning of the forecast period needs to be acquired this value determines the lower limit of the wds fd range fig 10 b from which the random values of wds used in moca simulation are extracted fig 10 e the upper limit of the wds fd is not set in order to provide a more conservative assessment of ice jam flood hazard 4 2 3 volume of incoming ice estimation landsat 7 and landsat 8 provided by the gee platform was used to monitor the extent of the ice cover if the ice cover along the upper reach of the sgs was still basically intact fig 10 c the full fd of vice was adopted fig 10 f was used for monte carlo simulations if the ice cover was partially broken to form open water only the portion of the ice cover in the upper reach of the sanhuhekou was considered this ratio corresponds to a maximum value in the fd of vice and monte carlo simulations use only random values within the range up to the maximum value of vice landsat 7 and landsat 8 were used to provide monitoring of river ice extent in 2008 and 2018 respectively the missing bands in landsat 7 image are evenly distributed and accounted for by a small proportion fig 9 a therefore although landsat 7 images have the problem of missing bands it is feasible to use them for visual identification to monitor the extent of river ice visual recognition from landsat 7 and landsat 8 images on 6 march 2008 and 10 march 2018 showed that the ice cover extending approximately 100 km upstream of the sanhuhekou reach was basically intact fig 9 according to the gauging station records the sanhuhekou reach began to break up on 16 march 2008 and 12 march 2018 respectively so it was reasonable to use vice s full fd in 2008 and 2018 on 21 march 2008 and 14 march 2018 there was no more ice flow in the sanhuhekou reach so no further prediction was required 4 2 4 probability of flood inundation once the fd ranges of qus wds and vice were established moca simulations were carried out and a set of 100 ice jamming water level profiles was obtained fig 10 g the water levels of the sgs were extracted from the set and a histogram of simulated water levels was constructed fig 10 h in this study the water level at the sgs was extracted because the location of the water level near the village could provide a more representative flood hazard assessment effective hazard assessment was performed by comparing simulated water levels with the bank elevation which was 1020 86 m serious inundation occurs when water levels exceed elevation of the river bank in this study the probability of inundation is defined as the proportion of simulated water levels exceeding the elevation of the river bank 1020 86 m in monte carlo simulations expressed as a percentage taking an actual operation as an example 12 14 march 2018 the prediction range of the boundary distribution for the next 3 days was updated every day the operation example was on 10 march and 100 ice jam water level profiles were generated the flood stages of the sgs extracted from the profiles were converted into flood inundation probabilities as shown in fig 10 h the probability of inundation by ice jam flooding at the sgs was 5 12 14 march 2018 to summarize fig 10 shows the steps taken for forecast 13 12 14 march 2018 with real data above all the lstm model predicted flow using 3 day forecast meteorological data from tigge and the operational discharge scheme of the sr fig 10 a the fd of qus is constrained by the minimum and maximum of the 3 day predicted flow sequence fig 10 d moca simulations only extract random values from the minimum maximum range the observed water level of the sgs at the beginning of prediction 10 march fig 10 b generated the lower limit of the wds fd range in rivice fig 10 e the downstream water level was randomly selected from a distribution greater than the lower limit in the moca simulations satellite images were used to determine ice coverage along the upper reach of the sanhuhekou bend reach fig 10 c in this example the ice cover was still intact so the full fd of vice was used in the moca simulations fig 10 f moca simulations resulted in n n 100 in the example water level profiles fig 10 g the extracted water levels at the sgs in each profile were taken to calculate the number of flood inundating events m extracted water levels higher than 1020 86 m that occurred at the sanhuhekou bend reach in n simulations and the probability of flood inundation was p p m n fig 10 h the real time ice jam flood hazard assessment was carried out in 2008 and 2018 and the fifteen 3 day forecasts are shown in fig 11 from forecast 1 to 9 of the 2008 breakup season the sgs had a high severity of inundation in particular forecasts 5 to 9 had a 100 probability of inundation for forecasts 10 to 15 of the 2018 breakup season the probability of flood inundation was no more than 5 thus there was no significant hazard of inundation at the sgs 5 discussion 5 1 verification of hazard assessment in 2008 after the low air temperatures during the freeze up period there was a sharp warming of the air during the breakup period the discharge from sr was reduced from 10 to 23 march however the flow of sgs was still more than 1100 m3 s at the end of the breakup period which led to conditions that produced ice jam flooding resulting in the dike breach in the sanhuhekou reach lei and gao 2011 as shown in fig 8 the lstm model s prediction at the end of the breakup period i e the maximum flow in forecast 9 is consistent with the record from 18 to 21 march the observed water levels exceeded 1020 86 m fig 12 a the probability of inundation from prediction 5 to prediction 9 was 100 which was consistent with the observed water levels the prediction period of forecast 4 is from 16 march to 18 march fig 8 a although the probability of inundation was not 100 the 83 probability of inundation was also satisfactory in most breakup periods ice jams formed in the reach between sgs and yilihuanghe bridge causing water levels to rise in the sanhuhekou bend reach leading to potential flooding however the observed water levels of the sgs were constantly decreasing in the prediction period fig 12 b because the temperature in the freeze up period of 2018 was significantly lower and the temperature rose rapidly during the river s ice cover breakup period the potential hazard of ice jam flooding was increased the disaster prevention department was responsible for reservoir regulation and reduced the downstream flow of the bayangaole sanhuhekou reach chen et al 2020 the hazard assessment of ice jam flooding at the sgs was successful although the occurrence of ice jamming at the sanhuhekou reach was different from a typical situation in the past as shown in fig 11 the inundation probability is no more than 5 which is consistent with the observed water levels far lower than 1020 86 m fig 12 b in addition the flow predicted by the lstm model during the breakup season was consistent with the downward trend of observed flow fig 8 b 5 2 3 day discharge scheme adjustment after assessing the operational discharge scheme of the sr in the breakup seasons of 2008 and 2018 we found that inundation was certain to occur in 2008 and that the scheme needed to be adjusted it should be noted that once the original operation scheme of the reservoir is adjusted the observed water level and flow downstream after adjustment cannot be used for prediction therefore we cannot carry out more than one forecast as shown in fig 11 in practice it is also the case that only one forecast for the next three days can be made a high probability of inundation 85 had been predicted since forecast 1 of 13 15 march 2008 we will discuss the effect of adjusting the original scheme of 13 15 march 2008 the adjusted schemes 1 to 3 are reduced by 150 m3 s in turn on the basis of the original scheme table 6 to explore the effect of the 3 day adjusted scheme on reducing the ice jam flood hazard the lstm model was driven to obtain three adjusted flow forecasts of 13 15 march 2008 according to the three adjusted schemes table 6 the lstm model learns the lag time of water flow propagation well the reservoir discharge on 13 march 2008 was significantly reduced but the predicted flow at the sanhuhukou gauging station on that day was reduced by less than 10 m3 s the reservoir s regulatory role became more pronounced from 13 to 15 march and the flow of the adjusted forecast 3 on the last day was only 275 02 m3 s in the moca simulations the adjusted 3 day forecasts provided the fd ranges of qus under different adjusted schemes the observed water level at the beginning of the forecast period on 12 march 2008 could still provide an upper limit of the wds distribution and the full fd of vice was still adopted according to the landsat 7 image on 6 march 2008 moca simulations were performed to obtain three sets of 100 ice jamming water level profiles under different adjusted fd ranges of boundary conditions the real time ice jam flood hazard assessment was operated by comparing simulated water levels with the bank elevation at the sgs 1020 86 m and the results of the simulated water levels at the sgs were extracted from the sets fig 13 from adjusted forecast 1 to 3 of 15 march 2008 the sgs still has a high severity of inundation about 70 but it is lower than the 85 probability of inundation in the original scheme with the reservoir discharge continuing to decline by 150 m3 s both adjusted scheme 2 and 3 have a 69 inundation probability compared with adjusted scheme 1 which is only 1 lower it means that the channel s current flow capacity at that time was close to 488 08 m3 s so the predicted decrease in flow would not result in a significant reduction in the probability of inundation this hazard assessment shows that when ice jam flood hazard is extremely serious it is not enough to effectively reduce its hazard only through flow control of three days and enough lead time should be reserved for adjusting the operational discharge scheme of the reservoir the effect of adjusting the reservoir operation scheme for only three days is limited but the effect of adjusting the reservoir operation scheme for longer periods is expected to be significant 5 3 uncertainties in the volume of incoming ice estimation for vice quantification this paper used landsat 7 and landsat 8 high spatial resolution 30 m remote sensing imagery to estimate river ice coverage due to the temporal resolution 16 d of landsat 8 images this data cannot be used to completely monitor river ice coverage before and after the breakup period thus during the hazard assessment period 8 d and 11 d only one landsat image provided the ice coverage ratio of the river fig 9 this means that the full fd of vice was used during the hazard assessment period resulting in a conservative hazard assessment prediction that overestimated the hazard of ice jam flooding therefore this study ignores the change in the ice coverage ratio over time during the hazard assessment period resulting in the uncertainty in vice s estimation due to the relatively narrow width of river ice medium spatial resolution 0 25 1 km and high temporal resolution 0 5 2 d sensors such as avhrr and modis are not effective in river ice monitoring at present there is no technology development and integration specifically for river ice remote sensing so many combined remote sensing applications are actually in the primary stage of remote sensing applications in the future multi sensor monitoring could improve time resolution and effectively reduce missing data li et al 2019 and landsat could be used in conjunction with other satellites such as sentinel 5 4 application and prospects of the lstm model in this paper the lstm model was used to predict the flow at the sgs fig 8 and a reasonable hazard assessment and prediction of ice jam flooding was obtained fig 11 the bayangaole sanhuhekou reach is affected not only by reservoir regulation but also by river ice the unpredictability of human factors and the complex physical mechanism make it difficult for hydrological models to predict the flow of the sanhuhekou ml models are suitable for scenarios that require a lot of executions regardless of physical mechanisms e g real time modelling sensitivity uncertainty analysis and optimization the lstm model was used in this study for real time flow prediction based on the operational discharge scheme and forecasts of meteorological data the lstm model has strong adaptability and can be updated with an increase in measured data since the updating process of the lstm model of redividing measured data is required for training the new model in addition the lstm model can also simulate summer rainstorm floods well fig 5 however a hydrological model with only one set of parameters cannot simultaneously simulate summer flooding without river ice and spring flooding with river ice more research is needed to further explore the potential of lstm models for hydrological forecasting 6 conclusion flood events near the sanhuhekou reach of the yellow river occur frequently and the controlled operation of the sr in the upper reach of the yellow river plays an important role in the prevention and control of disastrous flooding real time hazard assessment of the operational discharge scheme is necessary so that the scheme can be adjusted in time to reduce the hazard of ice jam flooding based on the above research results our real time hazard assessment system was successfully applied to ice jam flooding prediction and hazard assessment of the sanhuhekou bend reach regulated by the sr in spring 2008 and 2018 providing a new means of preventing and controlling ice jam flooding disasters then we tried to adjust the original 3 day discharge scheme of the reservoir to reduce the hazard of ice jam flooding and the inundation probability was only reduced from 85 to 69 the results show that the adjustment effect of 3 day discharge scheme is limited and the adjustment period of the scheme needs to be extended to obtain the expected effect since the adjusted scheme changes the hydraulic conditions historical water level and flow cannot be used to update the fd ranges of boundary conditions for the next forecast of the ice jam flood inundation probability thus increasing the adjustment period more than one forecast as shown in fig 11 is feasible in practical hazard assessment but not when using historical data an inundation hazard map is an effective tool for informing people about the potential hazards of the river adjacent zones due to the lack of accurate high resolution dem data an inundation hazard map could not be produced in this paper future work should also include flood inundation hazard maps for each forecast scenario since river ice coverage changes continuously during the breakup period vice is still the most uncertain boundary condition in the probabilistic modelling method as the consequences of underestimating the hazard of ice jam flooding are costly the absence of river ice monitoring images means that the amount of river ice melting over time can be missed however overestimating hazard can lead managers to take unnecessary actions with the development of multi source remote sensing imagery data fusion technology it will be helpful to obtain daily river ice monitoring satellite images with high spatial resolution this will improve the accuracy of ice jam flooding

2710,to effectively alleviate ice jam flood disasters it is necessary to carry out hazard assessments and predictions of ice jam flooding influenced by the operational scheme of a reservoir however traditional hydrologic flood routing techniques cannot effectively address the huge uncertainties caused by the many factors that lead to ice jam flooding in this paper a hazard assessment system for regulating flood discharge schemes is developed it is composed of a machine learning ml model long short term memory lstm and a river ice dynamic model rivice within a probabilistic method the modelling system is to aid in the challenge of predicting ice jam flooding downstream of reservoirs the lstm model forecasts the downstream flow under the operational discharge scheme and combined with the rivice model the backwater level profile of ice jams can be forecasted furthermore a set of backwater level profiles can be provided by probabilistic modelling and the probability of ice jam flood inundation can be calculated by comparing backwater levels with the elevation of the river bank this information can be used to warn of the hazard induced by operational discharges to better aid in the preparedness and mitigation of ice jam floods this system was tested successfully for the ice cover breakup period in the spring of 2008 and 2018 along the sanhuhekou bend reach of the yellow river in china keywords hazard assessment and prediction ice jam flooding downstream of reservoirs rivice lstm probabilistic modelling approach data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers in regions with high latitudes and extremely cold climates are often threatened by ice jams and their resulting flooding beltaos 1983 carr and vuyovich 2014 chang et al 2016a ice jams are irregular transient events that vary greatly with hydrologic hydraulic and ice conditions along the river lindenschmidt 2019 due to the chaotic nature of river ice jam formation the prediction of ice jam flood water levels is more challenging than for open water floods lindenschmidt et al 2019 slight changes in discharge ice jamming locations and initial water levels at the time of jamming can lead to different backwater level profiles of the ice jam flood water depths can far transcend open water depths for an equivalent flow lindenschmidt et al 2019 yu et al 2019 this means that small flows can cause extremely dangerous flood water levels during the ice cover breakup in the spring making it particularly important to predict and warn of the hazard of ice jam flooding in regulated rivers reservoir operation is the primary means of changing flow regimes for example a flow of more than 4000 m3 s at peace point is a necessary condition for ice jam flooding in the peace athabasca delta pad in alberta canada beltaos 2003 the w a c bennett dam on the peace river in canada regulates the outflow during the breakup periods reducing the frequency of ice jam flooding in the pad beltaos and peters 2020 another notable case is the yellow river in which there are 29 reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yellow river reservoirs operate not only to provide water and power but also to control ice jam floods especially in regards to preventing ice jam floods the operation of reservoirs ensures steady flow during the freeze up period and reduced flow during the breakup period chang et al 2016b in particular through sensitivity analysis xü et al 2021 concluded that the backwater level caused by ice jamming was the most sensitive to the flow it can be seen that reservoir regulation is the main means of changing natural flow regimes which can play an important role in ice jam flood prevention and control even after the construction and during the operation of reservoirs ice jam floods still cause serious economic losses and human casualties based on 2017 costing estimates the financial cost ensued by freezing rivers in north america was estimated at around us 300 million per year das and lindenschmidt 2020 a single event can also result in hundreds of millions of dollars in flooding damages in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray alberta canada ice jam flooding in 2020 caused the evacuation of about 13 000 people and more than half a billion dollars in insured damages das and lindenschmidt 2021 when discussing flooding caused by river ice jams the ning meng reach of the yellow river in china cannot be ignored for instance from 1991 to 2010 there have been 36 local ice jam disasters five of them resulting in breaches of the levees in the ning meng reach shi 2013 however in many countries prone to ice jams detailed records of ice jam damage are not available but the hazards are not negligible up to now the reasonable formulation of a reservoir operation scheme to reduce the hazard of ice jam flooding is still the concern of many communities considering the effects of reservoir operation it is challenging to predict the severity of downstream ice jam flooding for the following two reasons one reason is that hydrological models have difficulty to predict downstream flow in the upstream catchments regulated by reservoirs this is because considering the regulation of reservoirs in river systems is a major challenge in hydrological modeling applications especially during flood events when reservoirs dramatically change the natural flow regime another reason is that the process from ice cover breakup to ice jamming is nonlinear and nonstationary resulting from the interaction of a large number of hydraulic and hydrometeorological factors das et al 2020 lindenschmidt et al 2019 the ml model is a powerful mathematical tool which consists of many nonlinear computing modules with strong fault tolerance it has strong robustness to noisy data incorrect or abnormal data interferes with data analysis and can imitate a human thinking mode inductive reasoning to approximate multivariate nonlinear relationships between multiple variables for instance under the premise of not explicitly formulating physical relationships several ml models e g lstm artificial neural network random forest and support vector machine have been effectively applied in widespread hydrological agricultural and meteorological fields in applications such as drought assessment deo and şahin 2015 pariset et al 1966a flood forecasting kratzert et al 2018 madaeni et al 2021 song et al 2019 and crop yield prediction chlingaryan et al 2018 inspired by ml s excellent data based learning ability and potential to maximize the value of reservoir discharge this study introduced a specific ml model lstm to simulate river flow during reservoir operation research on the mechanism of ice jams began in the 1960s and was based on the steady state theory of ice pariset et al 1966b with the development of computing technology several numerical models can simulate dynamic process of river ice such as the one dimensional models rivjam beltaos 1993 ricen shen et al 1995 icejam healy and hicks 1999 river1d andrishak and hicks 2008 yrdim fu et al 2014 and rivice lindenschmidt 2017 and the two dimensional models dynaice shen et al 2000 and crissp2d liu et al 2021 for the yellow river yrdim has shown good results in the simulation of flow and ice regime during the freeze up period in the ning meng reach fu et al 2014 and rivice has successfully simulated the typical ice jam flooding events during the breakup period in the sanhuhekou bend reach xü et al 2021 however previous studies focused on deterministic simulations of ice jam floods without considering the chaotic nature of reservoir effects in order to consider the uncertainty in predictor variables frequency distribution fd analyses of variables is often carried out in hydrologic forecasting yu et al 2019 extended the copula method to ice flood probability prediction under nonstationary conditions hydrological process simulations can describe the relevant causal effects of inputs and outcomes while probabilistic prediction methods cannot such causality requires simulation of deterministic models in addition the hydrological processes in the simulation are actually deterministic processes obtained from nondeterministic inputs and river ice processes are no exception therefore a new approach is promising which places a deterministic river ice model in the monte carlo analysis moca method which has been successfully applied for prediction lindenschmidt et al 2019 climate response and flow regulation effect simulations rokaya et al 2019 of ice jam flooding this is a probabilistic modelling method based on physical models which is easily extended to study new ice jam flooding problems the moca method allows many simulations to be performed each with different parameter settings and boundary conditions drawn from a range of values of fds inspired by this method our study extended this probabilistic modeling method combined with a river ice model and ml model to predict ice jam flooding in a regulated river for informing reservoir operation this article is organized as follows in the second section the ice jam flooding regime in the yellow river basin and meteorological datasets are introduced the third section introduces our integrated probabilistic approach and evaluation metrics used to evaluate the lstm model the fourth section presents the results of constructing and operating the hazard assessment system for ice jam flooding which are subsequently discussed in the fifth section and summarized in the sixth section 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the 795 000 square kilometer area of the yellow river basin 96 119 n 32 42 e is located in the northern part of china with a length of about 1900 km from east to west and a length of about 1100 km from north to south fig 1 a the yellow river basin has great differences in landform among the various regions with numerous mountains including a large elevation difference between east and west winds from the northwest dominate across the basin in winter and the climate is dry and cold the annual minimum of daily minimum air temperature is generally below 0 c in the upper yellow river basin the daily air temperature stays below 0 c for 4 5 months and the annual minimum of daily minimum air temperature is 52 3 c generally most reaches of the yellow river are frozen in winter in the middle and upper ning meng reach of the yellow river the river gradient is gentle with a low flow velocity in a northerly direction the latitude difference from south to north is large hence the narrower downstream area freezes earlier and breaks up later than the southern upstream area fig 1 a high water discharges from the upstream reservoirs during breakup can lead to early ice jamming in the sharp meanders and narrow channels potentially leading to sharp rises in water levels in flood prone reaches which can seriously threaten the safety of levees and even breach them therefore the bayangaole sanhuhekou reach belonging to the ning meng reach of the yellow river is prone to ice jam floods this study was carried out along the yellow river from the bayangaole gauging station to the sanhuhekou gauging station sgs with a length of about 200 km fig 1 b it is worth noting that the bayangaole gauging station is located not far downstream of the sanshenggong reservoir sr and its records are regarded as the reservoir outflow the reach with a sharp bend at the sgs fig 1 c is downstream of the sr besides this reach has a small slope and a downstream bridge affecting its hydraulic regime according to statistics collected from 1990 to 2019 ice jam floods occurred more than 30 times in the inner mongolia reach of the yellow river including 5 times near the sgs zhao 2019 the most serious ice jam flood occurred in march 2008 when an ice jam formed at the sgs and caused a dike to breach resulting in flooding and leading to economic losses of about rmb 700 million fu et al 2014 the sanhuhekou bend reach fig 1 c is a key reach of ice jam flooding control with the operational scheme of the upstream sr discharge having particular importance and serves as a target portion of the yellow river to analyze the effect of the sr s operation scheme on resisting the ice jam floods 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 daily observation dataset of china s meteorological elements dodcme the dodcme comes from more than 2 400 meteorological stations in china this dataset includes atmospheric pressure air temperature precipitation evaporation relative humidity wind direction and speed sunshine duration and ground temperature at 0 cm nine of those stations are located in the study area fig 1 b and provide meteorological variables air temperature and precipitation data to train the lstm model data were downloaded from the following website https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 230 2 2 2 thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge tigge is a global research project undertaken by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf this project aims to gather the global ensemble forecast products with a unified format grib format of meteorological element data from 10 numerical prediction centers around the world and form a super ensemble forecast system to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts of 1 to 15 days forecast products provided by tigge have been widely used to drive flood forecasting with good results he et al 2010 pappenberger et al 2008 ye et al 2016 in the arid and semi arid areas of china in which our study area is located the forecast product from the ecmwf model is the most accurate when compared to other forecast products such as from the jma japan meteorological agency kma korea meteorological administration and ukmo united kingdom meteorological office models through the tigge data center he et al 2022 the emergency command structure in china requires a 3 day flood prediction period in this paper the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts model in tigge was used to provide precipitation and air temperature data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 a forecast duration of three days and a time step of one day the data were downloaded from the following website https apps ecmwf int datasets data tigge levtype 3dsfc type 3dcf 2 2 3 landsat data in this study images from two sensors of the landsat series of satellites were used etm landsat 7 and oli landsat 8 landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites were launched on 15 april 1999 and 11 february 2013 respectively the goal of landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellites is to provide continuous images of the earth s surface for a variety of earth science applications that are suitable for time series processing analysis due to the failure of the etm sensor in may 2003 the later landsat 7 images had quality problems with missing bands the landsat images used in this study are from google earth engine gee https earthengine google com platform with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 d because of its high spatial resolution 30 m landsat images are often used to monitor river ice and map the extent of river ice for example sakai et al 2015 used landsat imagery to monitor the spatial and temporal extent of spring ice floods in the lena river in siberia in particular xiao et al 2020 used landsat images from 1984 to 2018 to reveal the extent historical change characteristics and future change trend of global river ice 2 2 4 channel cross section and width we have survey data for one cross section located at 8 km and 15 river widths data along the bend reach fig 1 c the average slope of the sanhuhekou reach is 0 00011 according to the width and cross section shape the geomorphology of the 10 km reach was constructed by interpolation using the slope 0 00011 the thalweg is extracted from the constructed river geomorphology accordingly the obtained river storage capacity is close to the actual value which is an important index of river flow capacity the average slope is very small and the error between the thalweg and the actual situation has very little effect on the river storage capacity the topographic data of the river channel were used in the rivice model to construct the sanhuhekou reach 3 methodology fig 2 shows an integrated hazard assessment system for ice jam flooding that can be used to guide the operation of the reservoir this system is composed of two models input data sources outputs from each model and their interrelationships next we mainly discuss the construction of each individual model and probabilistic modelling method 3 1 lstm the lstm model is an artificial neural network method used to identify patterns in sequential data its original form was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lstm network structure is similar to rnn which consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer as well as the weight parameters and functions of these layers however the biggest difference between the rnn model and the lstm model is that units in the hidden layer of the latter have the ability to selectively learn and forget or retain information with corresponding weight parameters and functions graves et al 2013 this is the basis for the lstm model to take into account both long term dependence and short term memory of time series data after all the weights of the lstm model are initialized the neural network receives the input value and propagates forward to calculate the output value for the phase from hidden layer to output layer the error gradient between the actual and predicted outputs is fed back to the selected optimizer the optimizer optimizes weights based on the principle of minimizing prediction error in the whole operation process the weight will be calculated repeatedly in each iteration to continuously reduce the prediction error the choice of optimizer belongs to the hyperparameter of machine model construction in addition the size of units in the hidden layer and the number of samples processed by each iteration of the neural network are also worth noting the setting of the above super parameters will significantly affect the performance of prediction which can be determined by the trial and error method in the model training and verification stages fang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 our lstm model not only takes meteorological data as input data but also takes the reservoir outflow as input data as a model based on data training the lstm model has a demonstrated ability to explore complex and nonlinear relationships among data in particular the lstm model can easily simulate the storage effect of the basin and learn the relationship between rainfall runoff kratzert et al 2018 based on the demonstrated learning ability of the lstm model the lstm model is applied as a modeling method to predict downstream flow of the reservoir with input data the lstm model we used here consists of an input layer a hidden layer with three units and an output layer in our model the input layer has five inputs namely the daily outflow do of the sr i e the daily runoff of the bayangaole gauging station the daily precipitation dp and daily air temperature dat in the study area i e the mean daily rainfall and daily temperature from nine meteorological stations day of year doy and the daily runoff dr of the sgs the latter is not only one of the five inputs but also the only output as detailed in table 1 to sensibly simulate the storage effect in hydrological modeling and predict river flow snow accumulation and soil moisture content need to be dynamical variables for this reason it is necessary to set appropriate time steps of input and output data table 1 in addition we adopted the following training process to ensure the robustness of the model firstly observation data from 2006 to 2017 were divided data from 2006 to 2011 are used for training data from 2012 to 2014 were used for validation of the model and data from 2015 to 2017 were used for testing next all input data was converted to a set of normalized values between 0 and 1 according to the loss values of the training period and the verification period the hyperparameters of the model were manually adjusted to avoid overfitting finally the 3 day forecast meteorological variables were used as input in the calibrated lstm model to obtain 3 day flow forecasts 3 2 rivice in this paper rivice an open source numerical model developed and released by environment and climate change canada eccc was used to deterministically simulate the backwater level caused by ice jamming lindenschmidt 2019 rivice is a loosely coupled model of the ice and the hydraulics that allows hydraulic and ice dynamic processes to be calculated separately because it does not require complex simultaneous solutions of ice and hydraulic equations firstly the flow water level and flow velocity are calculated in the hydraulic process and then the volume thickness and position changes of river ice are calculated based on these results then the state of ice at this moment is considered in the hydraulic calculation at the next time step and the calculation is repeated in accordance with this process the implicit finite difference scheme is used to solve saint venant equations for hydraulic processes and an algebraic equation is used to calculate the river ice dynamic processes eccc 2013 this makes the model highly efficient and greatly reduces the time cost of hundreds of simulations extensive descriptions of the model are provided in lindenschmidt 2017 and eccc 2013 the parameters and boundary conditions used in the key river ice processes that are relevant to this study are shown in fig 3 the following provides a brief description the initial downstream ice cover in rivice has an average thickness h and a lodgement cross section x vice as a boundary condition restricts the dynamic simulation of ice jam formation the upstream boundary supplies the volume of inflowing ice vice per time step with thickness st and porosity ps which is transported downstream at the mean flow velocity and arrested by the leading edge of the intact ice cover with thickness ft and porosity pc when the incoming ice reaches the leading edge of the intact ice cover retraction of the ice jam occurs which thicken the ice jam through shoving and telescoping the summation of external forces acting on the ice jam include the hydrodynamic thrust on the leading edge of the ice cover ft the hydraulic drag on the bottom of the ice jam fd the ice cover s weight in the slope direction fw the frictional force of the intact ice cover against the river banks ff and the internal resistive force vertically along the thickness of the ice cover fi ff and fi are parameterized by k1tan and k2 respectively the retraction continuously thickens the ice jam until ft fd fw ff fi excessive thickening can lead to ice jam flooding therefore the calculation of the force applied to the ice jam is very important more details on the equations related to retraction are presented in the appendix forces applied to ice jam ver and vdep are the threshold values of mean flow velocity flow erodes the ice from the bottom of the ice jam and carries it downstream when the mean flow velocity exceeds ver if the mean flow velocity drops below vdep deposition of ice on the bottom of the ice jam will occur the hydraulic roughness of the river bed and the ice are important parameters of simulating flow and ice regime river bed roughness is constant and denoted by manning s coefficient nbed ice underside roughness is a function of the ice cover s thickness and parameterized by the nezhikhovskiy coefficient n8m upstream flow qus and downstream water level wds are important hydrodynamic boundary conditions in combination with fig 3 and the brief description it is possible to explain how parameters and boundary conditions are incorporated in ice jam flood simulations furthermore various inputs of parameters and boundary conditions are required to setup the rivice model and are classified and summarized in table 5 in this study we chose a time step of 30 s and then adjusted and validated the model parameters according to the physical mechanism of the model 3 3 probabilistic modelling method moca is a statistical method used to predict an outcome when randomness is present in the input variables the core of moca is random sampling values from fds are randomly selected and used as input of the model for simulation this process is repeated hundreds of times and hundreds of results are provided then these results are analyzed and utilized to obtain a probability distribution the use of fds rather than single values of parameters and boundary conditions can better solve the uncertainty in predicting input variables and reflect the chaotic nature of different ice jam conditions by employing the moca method the probabilistic behavior of the rivice model outputs i e ice jam flooding water levels was derived for different initial conditions that were randomly configurated this probabilistic modeling approach in this paper has been applied to the following two aspects the calibration of the boundary condition s fd and the probabilistic prediction lindenschmidt et al 2019 fds of rivice s 12 parameters and 3 boundary conditions fig 3 need to be established in our probabilistic modelling method a uniform distribution is mainly used for pdf s probability density function where prior knowledge is unavailable due to acquisition difficulty or lack of observation and a gumbel distribution is used for extreme data available to construct a pdf fds of the 9 parameters ps pc ver vdep k1tan k2 n8m nbed and x are constructed by uniform distribution upper and lower ranges which constrain the uniform distribution are based on available information from deterministic calibration and simulation results sgs records ice thickness at the beginning of breakup periods the fds of the remaining three parameters st ft and h relating to ice thickness are constructed by fitting the gumbel distribution according to the station ice thickness observation values one value per year for 16 years sgs records instantaneous maximum water discharge during the breakup periods and instantaneous water level at the beginning of breakup periods which respectively provide extreme values for the boundary conditions qus and wds the fds of qus and wds are constructed by fitting the gumbel distribution function according to their respective station observation values one value per year for 16 years more attention should be given to the distribution of boundary condition vice for which data are difficult to observe making it difficult to determine the volume of ice forming the ice jam in addition a uniform distribution would overestimate the frequency of the more extreme larger volume of incoming ice for the above reasons an initial fd of vice was estimated assuming a gumbel distribution whose distribution parameters location and scale were later refined through calibration a moca method is presented for the model calibration using fds of qus and wds as objective functions for the model we use fds as calibration targets rather than the traditional single value or time series such as water level or flow used for hydrologic and hydrological modeling the specific calibration process is as follows sixteen this number corresponds to the number of years used for the fds of boundary conditions simulations were run within the moca method using the estimated fd of vice and constructed fds as input the simulated water levels and flow at sgs were extracted from each simulation to construct the simulated fds of water level and flow and then compared with the observed fds of water level and flow if the simulated fds did not coincide with the observed fds the fd of vice was adjusted and the simulation was repeated 16 times this process was repeated until the simulated fds matched the observed fds well notably in order to predict the maximum water level when ice jam flooding would occur and better provide prediction results for flood control work the fds of observed water level and flow were constructed by fitting the gumbel distribution according to the instantaneous maximum water level and flow values recorded by the sgs during breakup periods for 16 years as the fd of vice was calibrated the probabilistic modeling method was completed then the river ice model could be run 100 times with each simulation randomly extracting a set of boundary conditions and parameter values from the established fds finally 100 simulation results were integrated to output the water level profile set of the whole reach from which the fds of water level could be calculated for each section of interest to obtain the probability of occurrence of exceeding a specific water level the probability information obtained by this probabilistic modelling method has been used for the subsequent ice jam flooding disaster and hazard quantification 3 4 evaluation metrics four different statistical evaluation indicators were applied mse mean squared error rbias relative bias r pearson correlation coefficient and nse nash sutcliffe evaluation among them mse is used as the effect evaluation of adjusting hyperparameters of the lstm model and r rbias and nse are used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the lstm model table 2 4 results 4 1 hazard assessment system setup 4 1 1 lstm validation and testing in the process of lstm model construction the weight parameters of the model are automatically updated by the optimizer and the setting of the super parameters has a significant impact on the performance of the model which is manually set in this study the goal of model training is to minimize loss value as shown in fig 4 with the increase of epochs the loss values of training data and validation data gradually decreased and tended to be stable indicating that the training process was satisfactory table 3 lists the search space and optimization results for hyperparameters as a result the adam optimizer is adopted the number of units in the hidden layer is 3 and the number of samples processed by the neural network in each iteration is 50 fig 5 shows the validation and testing results of the lstm model the results show that the simulated flow is in good agreement with the measured flow at the sanhuhekou gauging station the rbias r and nse values are 1 16 0 99 and 0 96 in the validation phase and the rbias r and nse values are 0 79 0 97 and 0 95 in the testing phase even though the test data is greatly different from the validation data the model still shows good simulation accuracy during the test period therefore in general we obtain a well trained model with high prediction accuracy compared with fig 5 table 4 also shows the simulation effect of flow and extreme flow during the ice flood season the evaluation metrics r and nse were analyzed although the simulation effect of flooding in the ice flood season is lower than that of the year the simulation effect of extreme flow in the ice flood season is excellent an extreme flow forecast is the key point in disaster warning it is worth noting that the simulation accuracy of extreme flow is the highest in the testing phase with an r value of 0 98 and an nse value of 0 97 the results of rbias show that the lstm model provides unbiased simulation for extreme flow in the ice flood season during the validation and testing phases rbias is 2 26 and 1 05 respectively with more years of data available we might be able to train a better lstm model 4 1 2 rivice setup and calibration the processes of the ice cover breaking an ice jam forming and the ice jam progressing downstream during the breakup period is highly uncertain as a result it has been a great challenge in this study to simulate backwater levels caused by such complex processes since river ice modelling could not accurately capture such a process of complex change with only a set of parameters the flooding process in the breakup period of 2009 was selected in this study to illustrate the feasibility of rivice s simulation of ice jam backwater levels see calibration in table 5 fig 6 shows that the simulated backwater level profile of the 2009 ice jam event along the sanhuhekou bend reach is consistent with the observed ice water levels in addition the water level of ice jam flooding is nearly 2 m higher than that of open water with the same flow indicating that ice jam flooding is extremely dangerous more detailed descriptions of the calibration of the rivice model adapted to the 2008 2010 ice jam flooding events in the yellow river are provided elsewhere see xü et al 2021 4 1 3 probabilistic modelling method construction according to the deterministic calibration results and the user manual s recommendations for the rivice model the fds of 9 parameters ps pc ver vdep k1tan k2 n8m nbed and x with unknown prior pdf can be constructed by uniform distribution and the upper and lower limits of uniform distribution are shown based on the ice regime observation data of 16 years the location parameter μ 0 2 and the scale parameter α 0 1 of the gumbel distribution are calculated and the three parameters st ft and h adopt this fd see table 5 for details the calibration process of the fd of boundary condition vice is shown in fig 7 the fds of boundary conditions qus and wds are gumbel distributions a and b in fig 7 with the location parameter μ 649 90 1018 59 and scale parameter α 266 30 0 60 sixteen groups of values were randomly selected from the fds of determined parameters and boundary conditions and the assumed boundary condition vice fig 7 c as the input for the rivice model for 16 moca simulations from which flow and water level at the sgs were extracted plotting positions and fds theoretical curves were calculated to be compared with observed fds after repeated comparisons with assumed location and scale parameters μ 40 00 α 18 00 simulated fds matched the observed fds reasonably well d and e in fig 7 in order to reduce contingency in the calibration of vice fds the 16 moca simulations were repeated 22 times depending on requirements using the calibrated vice distributions to provide two envelopes of simulated fds ensuring that the observed fds ran approximately along the medians of the envelopes f and g in fig 7 so far we have completed the construction of the probabilistic modeling method and the detailed fds are shown in table 5 4 2 real time hazard assessment operations after calibrating the fds of vice the probabilistic modelling was completed when the ice jam front is approaching the flood hazard prone area information such as operational discharge scheme water level and ice condition should be collected with more information becoming available the range of the model s future boundary conditions can be predicted according to the constrained range of boundary conditions the probabilistic modelling method can be used for ice jam flooding prediction lindenschmidt 2019 in the springs of 2008 and 2018 two ice jam flooding hazard assessments were conducted on the sanhuhekou bend reach along the yellow river to show how the forecasting framework was implemented during the hazard assessment periods 13 23 march 2008 and 9 16 march 2018 fig 11 the 2008 ice jam flood was the most costly in nearly 50 years but the 2018 ice jam flood caused no disaster in addition an example using actual data is provided below fig 10 to show the forecasting operation 4 2 1 lstm 3 day flow forecasts tigge provides a 3 day forecast of meteorological element data this prediction enables the lstm model to be used to predict flows at the bend reach of the sanhuhekou regulated by the sr according to the daily updated forecast of meteorological data combined with the operational discharge scheme of the sr the lstm model was driven to obtain 1 day flow forecasts in our study 3 day flow forecasts are required the 1 day flow forecast could be used as the input to the lstm model for a rolling forecast to obtain the 3 day flow forecast this process of 3 day flow forecasting begins before the breakup period and continues until the end of breakup period fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the six and nine 3 day flow forecasts in 2008 and 2018 have reasonable trends and accuracy providing reliable forecast information for the probabilistic modeling method the maximum and minimum values of the fd range of qus were established for flow prediction for the next three days fig 10 a from which the random values of qus used in moca simulations were extracted fig 10 a if the original discharge scheme of the reservoir has a high hazard of causing disastrous ice jam flooding the scheme can be adjusted in time for flow prediction 4 2 2 downstream water level for each hazard assessment the downstream water level at the beginning of the forecast period needs to be acquired this value determines the lower limit of the wds fd range fig 10 b from which the random values of wds used in moca simulation are extracted fig 10 e the upper limit of the wds fd is not set in order to provide a more conservative assessment of ice jam flood hazard 4 2 3 volume of incoming ice estimation landsat 7 and landsat 8 provided by the gee platform was used to monitor the extent of the ice cover if the ice cover along the upper reach of the sgs was still basically intact fig 10 c the full fd of vice was adopted fig 10 f was used for monte carlo simulations if the ice cover was partially broken to form open water only the portion of the ice cover in the upper reach of the sanhuhekou was considered this ratio corresponds to a maximum value in the fd of vice and monte carlo simulations use only random values within the range up to the maximum value of vice landsat 7 and landsat 8 were used to provide monitoring of river ice extent in 2008 and 2018 respectively the missing bands in landsat 7 image are evenly distributed and accounted for by a small proportion fig 9 a therefore although landsat 7 images have the problem of missing bands it is feasible to use them for visual identification to monitor the extent of river ice visual recognition from landsat 7 and landsat 8 images on 6 march 2008 and 10 march 2018 showed that the ice cover extending approximately 100 km upstream of the sanhuhekou reach was basically intact fig 9 according to the gauging station records the sanhuhekou reach began to break up on 16 march 2008 and 12 march 2018 respectively so it was reasonable to use vice s full fd in 2008 and 2018 on 21 march 2008 and 14 march 2018 there was no more ice flow in the sanhuhekou reach so no further prediction was required 4 2 4 probability of flood inundation once the fd ranges of qus wds and vice were established moca simulations were carried out and a set of 100 ice jamming water level profiles was obtained fig 10 g the water levels of the sgs were extracted from the set and a histogram of simulated water levels was constructed fig 10 h in this study the water level at the sgs was extracted because the location of the water level near the village could provide a more representative flood hazard assessment effective hazard assessment was performed by comparing simulated water levels with the bank elevation which was 1020 86 m serious inundation occurs when water levels exceed elevation of the river bank in this study the probability of inundation is defined as the proportion of simulated water levels exceeding the elevation of the river bank 1020 86 m in monte carlo simulations expressed as a percentage taking an actual operation as an example 12 14 march 2018 the prediction range of the boundary distribution for the next 3 days was updated every day the operation example was on 10 march and 100 ice jam water level profiles were generated the flood stages of the sgs extracted from the profiles were converted into flood inundation probabilities as shown in fig 10 h the probability of inundation by ice jam flooding at the sgs was 5 12 14 march 2018 to summarize fig 10 shows the steps taken for forecast 13 12 14 march 2018 with real data above all the lstm model predicted flow using 3 day forecast meteorological data from tigge and the operational discharge scheme of the sr fig 10 a the fd of qus is constrained by the minimum and maximum of the 3 day predicted flow sequence fig 10 d moca simulations only extract random values from the minimum maximum range the observed water level of the sgs at the beginning of prediction 10 march fig 10 b generated the lower limit of the wds fd range in rivice fig 10 e the downstream water level was randomly selected from a distribution greater than the lower limit in the moca simulations satellite images were used to determine ice coverage along the upper reach of the sanhuhekou bend reach fig 10 c in this example the ice cover was still intact so the full fd of vice was used in the moca simulations fig 10 f moca simulations resulted in n n 100 in the example water level profiles fig 10 g the extracted water levels at the sgs in each profile were taken to calculate the number of flood inundating events m extracted water levels higher than 1020 86 m that occurred at the sanhuhekou bend reach in n simulations and the probability of flood inundation was p p m n fig 10 h the real time ice jam flood hazard assessment was carried out in 2008 and 2018 and the fifteen 3 day forecasts are shown in fig 11 from forecast 1 to 9 of the 2008 breakup season the sgs had a high severity of inundation in particular forecasts 5 to 9 had a 100 probability of inundation for forecasts 10 to 15 of the 2018 breakup season the probability of flood inundation was no more than 5 thus there was no significant hazard of inundation at the sgs 5 discussion 5 1 verification of hazard assessment in 2008 after the low air temperatures during the freeze up period there was a sharp warming of the air during the breakup period the discharge from sr was reduced from 10 to 23 march however the flow of sgs was still more than 1100 m3 s at the end of the breakup period which led to conditions that produced ice jam flooding resulting in the dike breach in the sanhuhekou reach lei and gao 2011 as shown in fig 8 the lstm model s prediction at the end of the breakup period i e the maximum flow in forecast 9 is consistent with the record from 18 to 21 march the observed water levels exceeded 1020 86 m fig 12 a the probability of inundation from prediction 5 to prediction 9 was 100 which was consistent with the observed water levels the prediction period of forecast 4 is from 16 march to 18 march fig 8 a although the probability of inundation was not 100 the 83 probability of inundation was also satisfactory in most breakup periods ice jams formed in the reach between sgs and yilihuanghe bridge causing water levels to rise in the sanhuhekou bend reach leading to potential flooding however the observed water levels of the sgs were constantly decreasing in the prediction period fig 12 b because the temperature in the freeze up period of 2018 was significantly lower and the temperature rose rapidly during the river s ice cover breakup period the potential hazard of ice jam flooding was increased the disaster prevention department was responsible for reservoir regulation and reduced the downstream flow of the bayangaole sanhuhekou reach chen et al 2020 the hazard assessment of ice jam flooding at the sgs was successful although the occurrence of ice jamming at the sanhuhekou reach was different from a typical situation in the past as shown in fig 11 the inundation probability is no more than 5 which is consistent with the observed water levels far lower than 1020 86 m fig 12 b in addition the flow predicted by the lstm model during the breakup season was consistent with the downward trend of observed flow fig 8 b 5 2 3 day discharge scheme adjustment after assessing the operational discharge scheme of the sr in the breakup seasons of 2008 and 2018 we found that inundation was certain to occur in 2008 and that the scheme needed to be adjusted it should be noted that once the original operation scheme of the reservoir is adjusted the observed water level and flow downstream after adjustment cannot be used for prediction therefore we cannot carry out more than one forecast as shown in fig 11 in practice it is also the case that only one forecast for the next three days can be made a high probability of inundation 85 had been predicted since forecast 1 of 13 15 march 2008 we will discuss the effect of adjusting the original scheme of 13 15 march 2008 the adjusted schemes 1 to 3 are reduced by 150 m3 s in turn on the basis of the original scheme table 6 to explore the effect of the 3 day adjusted scheme on reducing the ice jam flood hazard the lstm model was driven to obtain three adjusted flow forecasts of 13 15 march 2008 according to the three adjusted schemes table 6 the lstm model learns the lag time of water flow propagation well the reservoir discharge on 13 march 2008 was significantly reduced but the predicted flow at the sanhuhukou gauging station on that day was reduced by less than 10 m3 s the reservoir s regulatory role became more pronounced from 13 to 15 march and the flow of the adjusted forecast 3 on the last day was only 275 02 m3 s in the moca simulations the adjusted 3 day forecasts provided the fd ranges of qus under different adjusted schemes the observed water level at the beginning of the forecast period on 12 march 2008 could still provide an upper limit of the wds distribution and the full fd of vice was still adopted according to the landsat 7 image on 6 march 2008 moca simulations were performed to obtain three sets of 100 ice jamming water level profiles under different adjusted fd ranges of boundary conditions the real time ice jam flood hazard assessment was operated by comparing simulated water levels with the bank elevation at the sgs 1020 86 m and the results of the simulated water levels at the sgs were extracted from the sets fig 13 from adjusted forecast 1 to 3 of 15 march 2008 the sgs still has a high severity of inundation about 70 but it is lower than the 85 probability of inundation in the original scheme with the reservoir discharge continuing to decline by 150 m3 s both adjusted scheme 2 and 3 have a 69 inundation probability compared with adjusted scheme 1 which is only 1 lower it means that the channel s current flow capacity at that time was close to 488 08 m3 s so the predicted decrease in flow would not result in a significant reduction in the probability of inundation this hazard assessment shows that when ice jam flood hazard is extremely serious it is not enough to effectively reduce its hazard only through flow control of three days and enough lead time should be reserved for adjusting the operational discharge scheme of the reservoir the effect of adjusting the reservoir operation scheme for only three days is limited but the effect of adjusting the reservoir operation scheme for longer periods is expected to be significant 5 3 uncertainties in the volume of incoming ice estimation for vice quantification this paper used landsat 7 and landsat 8 high spatial resolution 30 m remote sensing imagery to estimate river ice coverage due to the temporal resolution 16 d of landsat 8 images this data cannot be used to completely monitor river ice coverage before and after the breakup period thus during the hazard assessment period 8 d and 11 d only one landsat image provided the ice coverage ratio of the river fig 9 this means that the full fd of vice was used during the hazard assessment period resulting in a conservative hazard assessment prediction that overestimated the hazard of ice jam flooding therefore this study ignores the change in the ice coverage ratio over time during the hazard assessment period resulting in the uncertainty in vice s estimation due to the relatively narrow width of river ice medium spatial resolution 0 25 1 km and high temporal resolution 0 5 2 d sensors such as avhrr and modis are not effective in river ice monitoring at present there is no technology development and integration specifically for river ice remote sensing so many combined remote sensing applications are actually in the primary stage of remote sensing applications in the future multi sensor monitoring could improve time resolution and effectively reduce missing data li et al 2019 and landsat could be used in conjunction with other satellites such as sentinel 5 4 application and prospects of the lstm model in this paper the lstm model was used to predict the flow at the sgs fig 8 and a reasonable hazard assessment and prediction of ice jam flooding was obtained fig 11 the bayangaole sanhuhekou reach is affected not only by reservoir regulation but also by river ice the unpredictability of human factors and the complex physical mechanism make it difficult for hydrological models to predict the flow of the sanhuhekou ml models are suitable for scenarios that require a lot of executions regardless of physical mechanisms e g real time modelling sensitivity uncertainty analysis and optimization the lstm model was used in this study for real time flow prediction based on the operational discharge scheme and forecasts of meteorological data the lstm model has strong adaptability and can be updated with an increase in measured data since the updating process of the lstm model of redividing measured data is required for training the new model in addition the lstm model can also simulate summer rainstorm floods well fig 5 however a hydrological model with only one set of parameters cannot simultaneously simulate summer flooding without river ice and spring flooding with river ice more research is needed to further explore the potential of lstm models for hydrological forecasting 6 conclusion flood events near the sanhuhekou reach of the yellow river occur frequently and the controlled operation of the sr in the upper reach of the yellow river plays an important role in the prevention and control of disastrous flooding real time hazard assessment of the operational discharge scheme is necessary so that the scheme can be adjusted in time to reduce the hazard of ice jam flooding based on the above research results our real time hazard assessment system was successfully applied to ice jam flooding prediction and hazard assessment of the sanhuhekou bend reach regulated by the sr in spring 2008 and 2018 providing a new means of preventing and controlling ice jam flooding disasters then we tried to adjust the original 3 day discharge scheme of the reservoir to reduce the hazard of ice jam flooding and the inundation probability was only reduced from 85 to 69 the results show that the adjustment effect of 3 day discharge scheme is limited and the adjustment period of the scheme needs to be extended to obtain the expected effect since the adjusted scheme changes the hydraulic conditions historical water level and flow cannot be used to update the fd ranges of boundary conditions for the next forecast of the ice jam flood inundation probability thus increasing the adjustment period more than one forecast as shown in fig 11 is feasible in practical hazard assessment but not when using historical data an inundation hazard map is an effective tool for informing people about the potential hazards of the river adjacent zones due to the lack of accurate high resolution dem data an inundation hazard map could not be produced in this paper future work should also include flood inundation hazard maps for each forecast scenario since river ice coverage changes continuously during the breakup period vice is still the most uncertain boundary condition in the probabilistic modelling method as the consequences of underestimating the hazard of ice jam flooding are costly the absence of river ice monitoring images means that the amount of river ice melting over time can be missed however overestimating hazard can lead managers to take unnecessary actions with the development of multi source remote sensing imagery data fusion technology it will be helpful to obtain daily river ice monitoring satellite images with high spatial resolution this will improve the accuracy of ice jam flooding

data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydropower energy as a high quality efficient and pollution free clean energy is currently the world s largest clean energy on generation capacity whether we can make good use of hydropower energy has become the key to the development of global green energy this has also promoted the successive construction and operation of many large hydropower stations and reservoirs the construction and development of hydropower stations and reservoirs not only play a role in the optimization of energy structure but also is an important guarantee for the rational allocation and utilization of water resources flood mitigation and farmland irrigation in recent years with the successful completion and operation of large scale hydropower bases the hydropower energy network based on cascade reservoirs has been fully developed the scale of cascade reservoir systems has become increasingly large the hydraulic links between upstream and downstream have become increasingly complex the constraint restrictions have been further strengthened and because of these the complexity of hydropower systems has risen the joint dispatching of cascade reservoirs has become a high dimensional dynamic nonlinear multi variable strongly constrained optimization problem and the difficulty of the model solution has increased greatly ahmadianfar et al 2019 given this more and more optimization techniques are being applied to cascade reservoir scheduling modern optimization solution technology is mainly divided into two categories one is the traditional optimization method including large system decomposition and coordination method nonlinear programming linear programming dynamic programming tilmant et al 2002 etc for example zhang et al zhang et al 1981 carried out the earliest optimal dispatch research on cascade reservoirs in china constructed a cascade reservoirs scheduling model with zhexi reservoir and fengtan reservoir as the objects and based on the basic theory of large scale system decomposition and coordination method carried out the model solving and obtained a dispatching scheme with significant economic benefits dynamic programming is a mathematical method for the optimization of multistage decision processes jiang et al 2018a and is also a branch of operational research it converts multi stage problems into several single stage problems for solution jiang et al 2020 carried out the study of the year end drawdown level control mode of the cascade reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches of the yalong river basin used multi dimensional dynamic programming algorithms to optimize the solution and obtained a water level scheduling scheme with better economic and social benefits the other is the heuristic algorithm ya0 et al 2022 ji et al 2021 he et al 2019 peng et al 2019 niu et al 2019 natural heuristic algorithm is also known as the intelligent optimization algorithm swarm intelligence algorithm narang 2017 or meta heuristic algorithm etc and it is an optimization method with wide application range strong global optimization performance and good robustness which mainly simulates the foraging attacking defense behavior of animal groups such as fish swarms and bird swarms in nature it is a kind of evolutionary algorithm abstracted according to the behavior law of these groups and combined with modern computer technology and artificial intelligence technology li et al 2020 this type of algorithm is easy to understand and approach the human way of thinking and can get multiple solutions such as optimal and sub optimal solutions at the same time in solving combinatorial optimization problems guo et al 2010 pham et al 2021 now swarm intelligence algorithms have made substantial progress in process control shop floor dispatching forecasting machine learning engineering optimization power systems optimization and many other fields in the field of optimal scheduling of cascade reservoirs the group intelligent algorithm has attracted the attention of many hydropower dispatch researchers with its powerful optimization ability kiran et al 2022 jaafari et al 2022 tsipianitis and tsompanakis 2021 feng et al 2020a jiang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2007 taking the maximum peak reduction as the criterion and the possible minimum flood loss of the river basin as the target function established the flood control model of the optimal dispatching of cascade reservoirs proposed the pso dp hybrid solution algorithm and carried out simulation experiments on the four reservoirs which verified the efficiency of the algorithm and the rationality of the model liu et al 2008 pay attention to the medium and long term optimal scheduling of cascade reservoirs in the qingjiang river basin and established a medium and long term optimization scheduling model based on the relationship between the possible output and total output of the cascade reservoirs the decision making decomposition strategy and the joint scheduling rules and use the nsga ii multi objective genetic algorithm to optimize the solution and obtained a better joint scheduling chart of the cascade reservoirs after optimization xia et al 2019 established the ecological dispatch model of cascade reservoirs coupled with the classical simple method and the quantum particle swarm algorithm proposed a simple quantum particle swarm algorithm for model solving and obtained the optimal dispatch scheme indicating that the cascade reservoirs can supply more ecological water and protect the ecological safety of the watershed in general although the traditional optimization algorithm has a strong mathematical theoretical foundation with the increasingly large and complex problem of solving its application has also been limited by many restrictions and the application effect has gradually deteriorated as an emerging optimization mode the group intelligent optimization method has been applied to the optimization problem of cascade reservoirs on a large scale but there are still defects such as insufficient solution efficiency a wide variety of methods and unstable results therefore it is necessary and urgent to find a group intelligent optimization method that can be efficiently applied to the optimization model of cascade reservoirs given this based on the emerging collaborative search algorithm aim at the disadvantages of the collaborative search algorithm in solving complex optimization problems with high dimensional nonlinear constraint and multivariable coupling including insufficient disturbance optimization ability easy to fall into local optimization in the latter stage of iterative calculation and reduced global search ability this paper puts forward three improvement strategies that can effectively enhance the efficiency of algorithm optimization in terms of parameter randomization elite reinforcement learning and elite help learning and a new elite collaborative search algorithm is constructed and applied to the joint power generation dispatch of cascade reservoirs in the yalong river basin to improve the efficiency of water energy

scholars feng et al 2020b niu et al 2021 who are inspired by the current enterprise management its main content is to compare the problem to be optimized to the enterprise development process the individual as an employee of the enterprise and the performance of employees is dependent on the quality of solving the problem a part of the better individuals is chosen to form the management to determine the next action direction of the population by imitating the teamwork behavior of modern enterprises this algorithm uses three modern enterprise management methods to gradually find high quality solutions first using team communication methods to help employees obtain useful knowledge from leaders second encourage employees to reflect learn from experience and lessons and improve the comprehensive strength of employees third the team competition model is adopted to stimulate the enthusiasm of team members ensure that excellent talents do not flow out and the accumulation of leadership talents the detailed evolutionary formula is as follows 1 build up a team 15 x i j k ϕ x u x d i 1 i j 1 j k 1 where x i j k represents the position of the ith individual and the jth dimension at the kth iteration x u and x d represents the upper and lower limits of the position i is the populations number j is the dimension of the problem ϕ l u is the number of uniformly distributed random numbers over l u 2 team communication 16 u i j k 1 x i j k a i j k b i j k c i j k i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k 17 a i j k log 1 ϕ 0 1 gbest rn 1 j k x i j k 18 b i j k α ϕ 0 1 1 m m 1 m gbes t m j k x i j k 19 c i j k β ϕ 0 1 1 i i 1 i pbes t i j k x i j k where u i j k 1 is the position of the population at the k 1 th iteration a i j k is the randomly selected individual position b i j k is the stochastic average value of the individual optimal solution and c i j k is the global optimal solution gbest and pbest are the global and individual optimal position respectively m is the global optimal number of individuals rn1 is a random integer between 0 m α β are the learning coefficient 3 reflective learning 20 v i j k 1 r i j k 1 if u i j k 1 c j p i j k 1 if u i j k 1 c j 21 r

collaborative search algorithms the standard collaborative search algorithm has many advantages as the latest original algorithm published in the field of engineering however at the same time the algorithm shows insufficient perturbation optimization ability in complex optimization problems such as high dimensional nonlinear constraint and multivariable coupling and the individuals in the later stages are still prone to local optimization and reduced the global search ability these indicate that csa has a large room for improvement in the face of complex optimization problems through the study it is found that parameter randomization elite reinforcement learning and elite help learning are three improvement strategies that can effectively enhance the efficiency of algorithm optimization the schematic diagram of the ecsa algorithm is shown in fig 1 1 c j parameter randomization aiming at the problem that the c j parameter is fixed and the perturbation optimization ability is insufficient in the original csa algorithm this study finds that the parameter value can be improved which can increase the random perturbation ability of the parameter and effectively increase the optimization range of the algorithm as follows 25 c j x u x d rand where rand is a random number between 0 1 2 elite reinforcement learning an excellent leader is the soul of an enterprise he can lead the team in the right direction of development and give employees sufficient training and exercise in daily work to maintain the lasting vitality and execution of the team in the swarm intelligence algorithm there is a similar situation the individual optimal position can strengthen the local search ability of the population and the global optimal individual can lead the evolution direction of the population the random cross combination of the two and ordinary individuals can enhance the diversity of the algorithm prevent individuals from falling into the local optimal position prematurely and strengthen the late disturbance search ability of individuals the improved strategy randomly selects some individuals and randomly crosses with the global optimal position and individual optimal position the specific expression is as follows 26 x h i j k 1 pbest i j rand gbest j x r 2 j k 27 h randperm r 28 r p i 29 p a 1 k k a 2 where r is the number of individuals who perform random learning randperm r is a random reordering of r symbol is rounding up a decimal r2 is a random integer r2 1 r a1 and a2 are random factors 3 elite help learning there will be some employees who do not adapt to the development direction of the company and perform poorly in the early stage of entry this is when the best employees need to play a leading role drive the poor performers help them identify mistakes and get into the right pace of work by leading by example new employees can grow quickly in the organization and the model prevents the mistakes of individual employees from slowing down the growth of the entire company in the swarm intelligence algorithm there are also advantages and disadvantages for individuals in the current period combined with the behavior characteristics of cuckoos yang 2014 it is found that levi s random walk can play a positive feedback role in the calculation result of the difference between the poor individual and the global optimal individual the elite help learning strategy proposes the following two ideas 1 30 of the current poor individuals were selected to use the global optimal position and levy random walk for elite help learning and the same number of new individuals were obtained 2 through competition the individual with better fitness value is selected 3 select better individuals as part of the population to form a new population this strategy can enhance the global search ability of the algorithm and improve search efficiency the specific calculation formula of elite help learning is as follows 30 l i j k x i j k l 1 x i j k gbest levy γ 31 levy γ σ υ ν 1 β 32 σ γ 1 β sin π β 2 β γ β 2 2 β 1 2 1 β where l i j k is the position of the jth dimension of the ith individual in the kth iteration process β and l1 are the constant β 1 5 l1 0 001 γ is a gamma function νand υ are the random number that follows a normal distribution 3 3 calculation process of the elite collaborative search algorithm in the ecsa algorithm improving the randomness of the c j parameter can enhances the disturbance optimization ability of the algorithm the elite reinforcement learning strategy increases the search range of the algorithm which is conducive to the individual s ability to jump out of the inherent boundary in the later stage and expand the search range at the same time the elite help learning strategy introduces cuckoo s levi flight evolution strategy which can effectively improve the global search ability and improve the search efficiency of the algorithm the detailed calculation processes are shown in fig 2 4 case study 4 1 overview of the yalong river basin located in the western part of sichuan province china originating in yushu county qinghai province the yalong river is the largest tributary of the jinsha river with a basin area of nearly 130 000 km2 a total length of 1571 km of the main stream a natural drop of 3830 m an average annual flow of 1870 m3 s and an average annual runoff of 59 1 billion cubic meters the main stream of the yalong river is planned for 22 hydropower stations with an average annual power generation capacity of about 150 billion kwh after full completion and the total installed capacity can reach 31 85 million kw the yalong river basin is planned in three sections from top to bottom among them the upper reaches of the river from the xiayi temple to lianghekou are currently in the stage of the feasibility study the middle reaches of the river from lianghekou to kara planning 6 cascade power stations i e lianghekou yagen lenggu mengdigou yangfanggou and kara in september 2021 the first unit of the lianghekou power station start to produce electricity and it is the leading reservoir of the middle reaches the downstream section of the river from kara to jiangkou has been built and put into operation with five cascade power stations i e jinxi jindong guandi ertan and tongzilin in this paper the lianghekou power station and the five cascade power stations downstream are mainly studied as research objects as shown in fig 3 jiang et al 2019 its main characteristic parameters are shown in table 1 4 2 encoding policy and input data of model there are many decision variables that can be selected in the optimal scheduling of cascade reservoirs such as outflow reservoir volume forebay water level downstream water level etc as the most important variable of the power station the forebay water level can make the decision maker more intuitively feel the operation process of the reservoir reduce the calculation error and accurately obtain the information of all aspects of the hydropower station so the forebay water level of the power station is selected as the decision making variable in the optimization calculation and the coding form of the individual x is expressed as follows 33 x h 1 1 h 1 2 h 1 t h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 t h 3 1 h 3 2 h 3 t h n 1 h n 2 h n t in order to verify the engineering practicability and efficiency of the algorithm in the cascade reservoirs power generation scheduling and considering the collected data this paper takes the six power stations in the middle and lower reaches of the yalong river cascade reservoirs as the research object and selects six different typical runoff scenarios to calculate the runoff data of each scenario is shown in table 2 below because the inflow of jindong reservoir is the outflow of jinxi reservoir the interval flow of the jindong reservoir is zero 4 3 results and analysis to compare and analyze the application effect of the proposed method in cascade reservoirs power generation schedules five intelligent optimization algorithms i e ecsa csa pso ostadrahimi et al 2012 gwo dahmani and yebdri 2020 and woa donyaii et al 2020 are used to solve the model in this paper among them the maximum number of iterations of each algorithm is k 1000 and the population size is i 100 the remaining parameters are set according to the standard algorithm parameters considering the fluctuations in the calculation results of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm each algorithm runs independently 10 times under different input data and the average median optimal value worst value standard deviation and average calculation time are counted and the detailed statistical results are listed in table 3 the five methods were developed in the matlab language and executed on a personal computer with 8gb ram and 1 6ghz cpu as can be seen from table 3 the statistics of ecsa algorithm are mostly better than the rest of the algorithms under the six runoff scenarios taking the average power generation value of 10 independent runs as an example the ecsa algorithm increased by 39 6410 5138 and 2625 million kwh compared with the csa pso gwo and woa algorithms in the wet year in the normal year the ecsa algorithm increased by 32 4778 4153 and 2288 million kwh compared with the csa pso gwo and woa algorithms respectively in the dry year the ecsa algorithm has increased by 2 4947 4642 and 3992 million kwh compared with the csa pso gwo and woa algorithms respectively the above data shows that the ecsa algorithm has superior iterative optimization capability which can significantly improve the economic benefits of cascade power stations with power generation as the goal fig 4 shows the distributions of annual power generation results for the five algorithms in six runoff scenarios first of all it can befound from the figure that the ecsa and csa algorithms have very strong stability compared with the other four algorithms under six runoff scenarios showing the superiority of ecsa and csa algorithms over other four algorithms secondly in the local enlargement plot of the figure it can be seen that compared with csa the box of esca amplitude is narrower and the upper and lower shadows are more contracted and combined with the standard deviation size of the statistical results in table 3 it can be further proved that ecsa has stronger robustness than csa according to the analysis of the above statistical results it is proved that the three improvement strategies i e the randomization of median parameters elite reinforcement learning and elite help learning effectively enhance the optimization ability of local disturbance of the algorithm avoid the premature fall of individual extremum into local optimization and expand the global search scope of the algorithm this shows that the ecsa algorithm has strong engineering applicability in the power generation dispatch of cascade reservoirs which can improve the power generation efficiency of cascade power stations in river basins and better realize the optimal allocation of hydropower resources figs 5 and 6 show the operation process of the water level of each reservoir optimized by ecsa under the extra wet year and the dry year from the above two figures it can be known that the optimized water level process obtained by the ecsa algorithm can well meet the water level constraint requirements for the lianghekou jinxi and ertan hydropower stations with flood limit water level requirements they can also be prepared to vacate the storage capacity before the flood to meet the flood control requirements in the extra wet year the water is abundant and the operation space of the power station is large so the storage capacity can be effectively adjusted to complete the comprehensive utilization of water resources in the dry year there is little water coming and the availability of regulated water resources is limited so the power stations maintain high water head in all stagesto maximize the completion of the power generation task the water levels of the lianghekou jinxi and ertan power stations drop to the flood limit water level during the flood season and quickly rise to a high water level after the flood season to make full use of the power generation head the above analysis shows that after the optimization of ecsa the cascade power station can effectively use the water head benefits and compensation adjustment benefits brought by the cascade reservoirs and give full use to the rich hydraulic resources of the yalong river basin table 4 shows the water abandonment results of each method it can be found that the ecsa method can minimize the water abandonment figs 7 and 8 show the outflow process of each reservoir optimized by ecsa under the extra wet year and the dry year in the extra wet years water is abundant and through reasonable scheduling only a small amount of water abandonment will occur in some months for example through the operation optimization the lianghekou power station only has a small amount of water abandonment in may and june in dry year there is little water coming through reasonable scheduling the power station does not produce abandoned water and can meet the minimum ecological flow requirements of the downstream river the above analysis shows that after the optimization of ecsa the cascade reservoirs can effectively prevent the generation of water abandonment and fully ensure the supply of ecological flow of downstream rivers fig 9 shows the power generation of the extra wet year and the dry year in each power station and each month it can be found that there is a great difference in the total power generation of the cascade reservoirs in the two inflow years but generally speaking the power generation at the initial stage of dispatching is less with the rise of water level the power generation at the later stage is more which shows that the obtained dispatching scheme is in line with the actual production of the power station 4 4 limitation and future work in this paper three improvement strategies are used to increase the optimization ability of the new algorithm csa which increases the energy generation of cascade reservoirs but there are still some problems 1 although ecsa can meet the operation requirements of the system the time complexity of ecsa is still relatively large 2 the application effect of the algorithm still needs to be verified in peak regulating flood control and uncertainty model 3 ecological discharge is becoming more and more important for river channels which may change dynamically in the future the ecological discharge in this paper is constant thus the future work can be deepened from the following aspects 1 algorithm performance develop more effective strategies to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm feng et al 2020 2 model verification comprehensive verification is carried out on a variety of scheduling models such as flood control scheduling wang et al 2022 and it can also be studied on a multi objective model sun et al 2022 3 coupled runoff forecast and scheduling hydrological data are divided and decomposed into scenarios real time runoff forecast is completed by deep learning neural network model and real time scheduling is studied according to the predicted flow adaryani et al 2022 5 conclusions a new elite collaborative search algorithm coupled with three improvement strategies is proposed in this paper and a joint power generation dispatching model is constructed considering the limited water level in flood season the minimum ecological discharge and other constraints and aiming at the maximum total power generation of the cascade power station and based on the examples of 6 cascade power stations in the middle and lower reaches of the yalong river basin the model is solved by five algorithms i e ecsa csa pso gwo and woa based on the six typical features through the statistics and analysis of the optimization results the following conclusions are obtained 1 whether in the wet year or dry year ecsa and csa have absolute advantages over the other three algorithms ecsa can also produce certain power generation benefits based on csa taking the average power generation as an example in the wet year the ecsa algorithm compared with csa pso gwo and woa algorithm increased by 39 641 5138 and 2625 million kwh respectively in the dry year ecsa increased by 2 4947 4642 and 3992 million kwh compared with the rest of the algorithms which shows the superiority of ecsa in its solving capabilities and engineering applicability 2 in the six runoff scenarios the calculation results of ecsa and csa compared with other algorithms have been significantly improved and more efficient and stable calculation results have been obtained in the comparison of the box diagram of ecsa and csa it is found that the amplitude of esca box is narrower and the upper and lower shadow lines are more contracted combined with the standard deviation statistical results it can be proved that ecsa has stronger robustness than csa 3 the water level and outflow results obtained by the optimization calculation of ecsa can not only meet the constraint requirements of the cascade power stations but also make better use of the rich hydraulic resources of the yalong river basin giving full play to the regulation and compensation role of the cascade reservoirs and obtain a more efficient and reasonable power generation scheduling process 4 the three improvement strategies

4153 and 2288 million kwh respectively keywords joint power generation dispatching collaborative search algorithm elite reinforcement learning elite help learning yalong river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydropower energy as a high quality efficient and pollution free clean energy is currently the world s largest clean energy on generation capacity whether we can make good use of hydropower energy has become the key to the development of global green energy this has also promoted the successive construction and operation of many large hydropower stations and reservoirs the construction and development of hydropower stations and reservoirs not only play a role in the optimization of energy structure but also is an important guarantee for the rational allocation and utilization of water resources flood mitigation and farmland irrigation in recent years with the successful completion and operation of large scale hydropower bases the hydropower energy network based on cascade reservoirs has been fully developed the scale of cascade reservoir systems has become increasingly large the hydraulic links between upstream and downstream have become increasingly complex the constraint restrictions have been further strengthened and because of these the complexity of hydropower systems has risen the joint dispatching of cascade reservoirs has become a high dimensional dynamic nonlinear multi variable strongly constrained optimization problem and the difficulty of the model solution has increased greatly ahmadianfar et al 2019 given this more and more optimization techniques are being applied to cascade reservoir scheduling modern optimization solution technology is mainly divided into two categories one is the traditional optimization method including large system decomposition and coordination method nonlinear programming linear programming dynamic programming tilmant et al 2002 etc for example zhang et al zhang et al 1981 carried out the earliest optimal dispatch research on cascade reservoirs in china constructed a cascade reservoirs scheduling model with zhexi reservoir and fengtan reservoir as the objects and based on the basic theory of large scale system decomposition and coordination method carried out the model solving and obtained a dispatching scheme with significant economic benefits dynamic programming is a mathematical method for the optimization of multistage decision processes jiang et al 2018a and is also a branch of operational research it converts multi stage problems into several single stage problems for solution jiang et al 2020 carried out the study of the year end drawdown level control mode of the cascade reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches of the yalong river basin used multi dimensional dynamic programming algorithms to optimize the solution and obtained a water level scheduling scheme with better economic and social benefits the other is the heuristic algorithm ya0 et al 2022 ji et al 2021 he et al 2019 peng et al 2019 niu et al 2019 natural heuristic algorithm is also known as the intelligent optimization algorithm swarm intelligence algorithm narang 2017 or meta heuristic algorithm etc and it is an optimization method with wide application range strong global optimization performance and good robustness which mainly simulates the foraging attacking defense behavior of animal groups such as fish swarms and bird swarms in nature it is a kind of evolutionary algorithm abstracted according to the behavior law of these groups and combined with modern computer technology and artificial intelligence technology li et al 2020 this type of algorithm is easy to understand and approach the human way of thinking and can get multiple solutions such as optimal and sub optimal solutions at the same time in solving combinatorial optimization problems guo et al 2010 pham et al 2021 now swarm intelligence algorithms have made substantial progress in process control shop floor dispatching forecasting machine learning engineering optimization power systems optimization and many other fields in the field of optimal scheduling of cascade reservoirs the group intelligent algorithm has attracted the attention of many hydropower dispatch researchers with its powerful optimization ability kiran et al 2022 jaafari et al 2022 tsipianitis and tsompanakis 2021 feng et al 2020a jiang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2007 taking the maximum peak reduction as the criterion and the possible minimum flood loss of the river basin as the target function established the flood control model of the optimal dispatching of cascade reservoirs proposed the pso dp hybrid solution algorithm and carried out simulation experiments on the four reservoirs which verified the efficiency of the algorithm and the rationality of the model liu et al 2008 pay attention to the medium and long term optimal scheduling of cascade reservoirs in the qingjiang river basin and established a medium and long term optimization scheduling model based on the relationship between the possible output and total output of the cascade reservoirs the decision making decomposition strategy and the joint scheduling rules and use the nsga ii multi objective genetic algorithm to optimize the solution and obtained a better joint scheduling chart of the cascade reservoirs after optimization xia et al 2019 established the ecological dispatch model of cascade reservoirs coupled with the classical simple method and the quantum particle swarm algorithm proposed a simple quantum particle swarm algorithm for model solving and obtained the optimal dispatch scheme indicating that the cascade reservoirs can supply more ecological water and protect the ecological safety of the watershed in general although the traditional optimization algorithm has a strong mathematical theoretical foundation with the increasingly large and complex problem of solving its application has also been limited by many restrictions and the application effect has gradually deteriorated as an emerging optimization mode the group intelligent optimization method has been applied to the optimization problem of cascade reservoirs on a large scale but there are still defects such as insufficient solution efficiency a wide variety of methods and unstable results therefore it is necessary and urgent to find a group intelligent optimization method that can be efficiently applied to the optimization model of cascade reservoirs given this based on the emerging

scholars feng et al 2020b niu et al 2021 who are inspired by the current enterprise management its main content is to compare the problem to be optimized to the enterprise development process the individual as an employee of the enterprise and the performance of employees is dependent on the quality of solving the problem a part of the better individuals is chosen to form the management to determine the next action direction of the population by imitating the teamwork behavior of modern enterprises this algorithm uses three modern enterprise management methods to gradually find high quality solutions first using team communication methods to help employees obtain useful knowledge from leaders second encourage employees to reflect learn from experience and lessons and improve the comprehensive strength of employees third the team competition model is adopted to stimulate the enthusiasm of team members ensure that excellent talents do not flow out and the accumulation of leadership talents the detailed evolutionary formula is as follows 1 build up a team 15 x i j k ϕ x u x d i 1 i j 1 j k 1 where x i j k represents the position of the ith individual and the jth dimension at the kth iteration x u and x d represents the upper and lower limits of the position i is the populations number j is the dimension of the problem ϕ l u is the number of uniformly distributed random numbers over l u 2 team communication 16 u i j k 1 x i j k a i j k b i j k c i j k i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k 17 a i j k log 1 ϕ 0 1 gbest rn 1 j k x i j k 18 b i j k α ϕ 0 1 1 m m 1 m gbes

collaborative search algorithms the standard collaborative search algorithm has many advantages as the latest original algorithm published in the field of engineering however at the same time the algorithm shows insufficient perturbation optimization ability in complex optimization problems such as high dimensional nonlinear constraint and multivariable coupling and the individuals in the later stages are still prone to local optimization and reduced the global search ability these indicate that csa has a large room for improvement in the face of complex optimization problems through the study it is found that parameter randomization elite reinforcement learning and elite help learning are three improvement strategies that can effectively enhance the efficiency of algorithm optimization the schematic diagram of the ecsa algorithm is shown in fig 1 1 c j parameter randomization aiming at the problem that the c j parameter is fixed and the perturbation optimization ability is insufficient in the original csa algorithm this study finds that the parameter value can be improved which can increase the random perturbation ability of the parameter and effectively increase the optimization range of the algorithm as follows 25 c j x u x d rand where rand is a random number between 0 1 2 elite reinforcement learning an excellent leader is the soul of an enterprise he can lead the team in the right direction of development and give employees sufficient training and exercise in daily work to maintain the lasting vitality and execution of the team in the swarm intelligence algorithm there is a similar situation the individual optimal position can strengthen the local search ability of the population and the global optimal individual can lead the evolution direction of the population the random cross combination of the two and ordinary individuals can enhance the diversity of the algorithm prevent individuals from falling into the local optimal position prematurely and strengthen the late disturbance search ability of individuals the improved strategy randomly selects some individuals and randomly crosses with the global optimal position and individual optimal position the specific expression is as follows 26 x h i j k 1 pbest i j rand gbest j x r 2 j k 27 h randperm r 28 r p i 29 p a 1 k k a 2 where r is the number of individuals who perform random learning randperm r is a random reordering of r symbol is rounding up a decimal r2 is a random integer r2 1 r a1 and a2 are random factors 3 elite help learning there will be some employees who do not adapt to the development direction of the company and perform poorly in the early stage of entry this is when the best employees need to play a leading role drive the poor performers help them identify mistakes and get into the right pace of work by leading by example new employees can grow quickly in the organization and the model prevents the mistakes of individual employees from slowing down the growth of the entire company in the swarm intelligence algorithm there are also advantages and disadvantages for individuals in the current period combined with the behavior characteristics of cuckoos yang 2014 it is found that levi s random walk can play a positive feedback role in the calculation result of the difference between the poor individual and the global optimal individual the elite help learning strategy proposes the following two ideas 1 30 of the current poor individuals were selected to use the global optimal position and levy random walk for elite help learning and the same number of new individuals were obtained 2 through competition the individual with better fitness value is selected 3 select better individuals as part of the population to form a new population this strategy can enhance the global search ability of the algorithm and improve search efficiency the specific calculation formula of elite help learning is as follows 30 l i j k x i j k l 1 x i j k gbest levy γ 31 levy γ σ υ ν 1 β 32 σ γ 1 β sin π β 2 β γ β 2 2 β 1 2 1 β where l i j k is the position of the jth dimension of the ith individual in the kth iteration process β and l1 are the constant β 1 5 l1 0 001 γ is a gamma function νand υ are the random number that follows a normal distribution 3 3 calculation process of the elite collaborative search algorithm in the ecsa algorithm improving the randomness of the c j parameter can enhances the disturbance optimization ability of the algorithm the elite reinforcement learning strategy increases the search range of the algorithm which is conducive to the individual s ability to jump out of the inherent boundary in the later stage and expand the search range at the same time the elite help learning strategy introduces cuckoo s levi flight evolution strategy which can effectively improve the global search ability and improve the search efficiency of the algorithm the detailed calculation processes are shown in fig 2 4 case study 4 1 overview of the yalong river basin located in the western part of sichuan province china originating in yushu county qinghai province the yalong river is the largest tributary of the jinsha river with a basin area of nearly 130 000 km2 a total length of 1571 km of the main stream a natural drop of 3830 m an average annual flow of 1870 m3 s and an average annual runoff of 59 1 billion cubic meters the main stream of the yalong river is planned for 22 hydropower stations with an average annual power generation capacity of about 150 billion kwh after full completion and the total installed capacity can reach 31 85 million kw the yalong river basin is planned in three sections from top to bottom among them the upper reaches of the river from the xiayi temple to lianghekou are currently in the stage of the feasibility study the middle reaches of the river from lianghekou to kara planning 6 cascade power stations i e lianghekou yagen lenggu mengdigou yangfanggou and kara in september 2021 the first unit of the lianghekou power station start to produce electricity and it is the leading reservoir of the middle reaches the downstream section of the river from kara to jiangkou has been built and put into operation with five cascade power stations i e jinxi jindong guandi ertan and tongzilin in this paper the lianghekou power station and the five cascade power stations downstream are mainly studied as research objects as shown in fig 3 jiang et al 2019 its main characteristic parameters are shown in table 1 4 2 encoding policy and input data of model there are many decision variables that can be selected in the optimal scheduling of cascade reservoirs such as outflow reservoir volume forebay water level downstream water level etc as the most important variable of the power station the forebay water level can make the decision maker more intuitively feel the operation process of the reservoir reduce the calculation error and accurately obtain the information of all aspects of the hydropower station so the forebay water level of the power station is selected as the decision making variable in the optimization calculation and the coding form of the individual x is expressed as follows 33 x h 1 1 h 1 2 h 1 t h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 t h 3 1 h 3 2 h 3 t h n 1 h n 2 h n t in order to verify the engineering practicability and efficiency of the algorithm in the cascade reservoirs power generation scheduling and considering the collected data this paper takes the six power stations in the middle and lower reaches of the yalong river cascade reservoirs as the research object and selects six different typical runoff scenarios to calculate the runoff data of each scenario is shown in table 2 below because the inflow of jindong reservoir is the outflow of jinxi reservoir the interval flow of the jindong reservoir is zero 4 3 results and analysis to compare and analyze the application effect of the proposed method in cascade reservoirs power generation schedules five intelligent optimization algorithms i e ecsa csa pso ostadrahimi et al 2012 gwo dahmani and yebdri 2020 and woa donyaii et al 2020 are used to solve the model in this paper among them the maximum number of iterations of each algorithm is k 1000 and the population size is i 100 the remaining parameters are set according to the standard algorithm parameters considering the fluctuations in the calculation results of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm each algorithm runs independently 10 times under different input data and the average median optimal value worst value standard deviation and average calculation time are counted and the detailed statistical results are listed in table 3 the five methods were developed in the matlab language and executed on a personal computer with 8gb ram and 1 6ghz cpu as can be seen from table 3 the statistics of ecsa algorithm are mostly better than the rest of the algorithms under the six runoff scenarios taking the average power generation value of 10 independent runs as an example the ecsa algorithm increased by 39 6410 5138 and 2625 million kwh compared with the csa pso gwo and woa algorithms in the wet year in the normal year the ecsa algorithm increased by 32 4778 4153 and 2288 million kwh compared with the csa pso gwo and woa algorithms respectively in the dry year the ecsa algorithm has increased by 2 4947 4642 and 3992 million kwh compared with the csa pso gwo and woa algorithms respectively the above data shows that the ecsa algorithm has superior iterative optimization capability which can significantly improve the economic benefits of cascade power stations with power generation as the goal fig 4 shows the distributions of annual power generation results for the five algorithms in six runoff scenarios first of all it can befound from the figure that the ecsa and csa algorithms have very strong stability compared with the other four algorithms under six runoff scenarios showing the superiority of ecsa and csa algorithms over other four algorithms secondly in the local enlargement plot of the figure it can be seen that compared with csa the box of esca amplitude is narrower and the upper and lower shadows are more contracted and combined with the standard deviation size of the statistical results in table 3 it can be further proved that ecsa has stronger robustness than csa according to the analysis of the above statistical results it is proved that the three improvement strategies i e the randomization of median parameters elite reinforcement learning and elite help learning effectively enhance the optimization ability of local disturbance of the algorithm avoid the premature fall of individual extremum into local optimization and expand the global search scope of the algorithm this shows that the ecsa algorithm has strong engineering applicability in the power generation dispatch of cascade reservoirs which can improve the power generation efficiency of cascade power stations in river basins and better realize the optimal allocation of hydropower resources figs 5 and 6 show the operation process of the water level of each reservoir optimized by ecsa under the extra wet year and the dry year from the above two figures it can be known that the optimized water level process obtained by the ecsa algorithm can well meet the water level constraint requirements for the lianghekou jinxi and ertan hydropower stations with flood limit water level requirements they can also be prepared to vacate the storage capacity before the flood to meet the flood control requirements in the extra wet year the water is abundant and the operation space of the power station is large so the storage capacity can be effectively adjusted to complete the comprehensive utilization of water resources in the dry year there is little water coming and the availability of regulated water resources is limited so the power stations maintain high water head in all stagesto maximize the completion of the power generation task the water levels of the lianghekou jinxi and ertan power stations drop to the flood limit water level during the flood season and quickly rise to a high water level after the flood season to make full use of the power generation head the above analysis shows that after the optimization of ecsa the cascade power station can effectively use the water head benefits and compensation adjustment benefits brought by the cascade reservoirs and give full use to the rich hydraulic resources of the yalong river basin table 4 shows the water abandonment results of each method it can be found that the ecsa method can minimize the water abandonment figs 7 and 8 show the outflow process of each reservoir optimized by ecsa under the extra wet year and the dry year in the extra wet years water is abundant and through reasonable scheduling only a small amount of water abandonment will occur in some months for example through the operation optimization the lianghekou power station only has a small amount of water abandonment in may and june in dry year there is little water coming through reasonable scheduling the power station does not produce abandoned water and can meet the minimum ecological flow requirements of the downstream river the above analysis shows that after the optimization of ecsa the cascade reservoirs can effectively prevent the generation of water abandonment and fully ensure the supply of ecological flow of downstream rivers fig 9 shows the power generation of the extra wet year and the dry year in each power station and each month it can be found that there is a great difference in the total power generation of the cascade reservoirs in the two inflow years but generally speaking the power generation at the initial stage of dispatching is less with the rise of water level the power generation at the later stage is more which shows that the obtained dispatching scheme is in line with the actual production of the power station 4 4 limitation and future work in this paper three improvement strategies are used to increase the optimization ability of the new algorithm csa which increases the energy generation of cascade reservoirs but there are still some problems 1 although ecsa can meet the operation requirements of the system the time complexity of ecsa is still relatively large 2 the application effect of the algorithm still needs to be verified in peak regulating flood control and uncertainty model 3 ecological discharge is becoming more and more important for river channels which may change dynamically in the future the ecological discharge in this paper is constant thus the future work can be deepened from the following aspects 1 algorithm performance develop more effective strategies to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm feng et al 2020 2 model verification comprehensive verification is carried out on a variety of scheduling models such as flood control scheduling wang et al 2022 and it can also be studied on a multi objective model sun et al 2022 3 coupled runoff forecast and scheduling hydrological data are divided and decomposed into scenarios real time runoff forecast is completed by deep learning neural network model and real time scheduling is studied according to the predicted flow adaryani et al 2022 5 conclusions a new elite collaborative search algorithm coupled with three improvement strategies is proposed in this paper and a joint power generation dispatching model is constructed considering the limited water level in flood season the minimum ecological discharge and other constraints and aiming at the maximum total power generation of the cascade power station and based on the examples of 6 cascade power stations in the middle and lower reaches of the yalong river basin the model is solved by five algorithms i e ecsa csa pso gwo and woa based on the six typical features through the statistics and analysis of the optimization results the following conclusions are obtained 1 whether in the wet year or dry year ecsa and csa have absolute advantages over the other three algorithms ecsa can also produce certain power generation benefits based on csa taking the average power generation as an example in the wet year the ecsa algorithm compared with csa pso gwo and woa algorithm increased by 39 641 5138 and 2625 million kwh respectively in the dry year ecsa increased by 2 4947 4642 and 3992 million kwh compared with the rest of the algorithms which shows the superiority of ecsa in its solving capabilities and engineering applicability 2 in the six runoff scenarios the calculation results of ecsa and csa compared with other algorithms have been significantly improved and more efficient and stable calculation results have been obtained in the comparison of the box diagram of ecsa and csa it is found that the amplitude of esca box is narrower and the upper and lower shadow lines are more contracted combined with the standard deviation statistical results it can be proved that ecsa has stronger robustness than csa 3 the water level and outflow results obtained by the optimization calculation of ecsa can not only meet the constraint requirements of the cascade power stations but also make better use of the rich hydraulic resources of the yalong river basin giving full play to the regulation and compensation role of the cascade reservoirs and obtain a more efficient and reasonable power generation scheduling process 4 the three improvement strategies effectively enhance the local disturbance optimization ability of the algorithm avoid the individual extreme value falling into the local optimal trap prematurely and expand the global search range of

2712,one of the limitations of daily soil water index swi products obtained from satellite imagery is the low spatial resolution limiting their precise applications the purpose of this study was to present a machine learning based approach to improve the spatial resolution of the swi obtained from the advanced scatterometer ascat surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties environmental parameters maps of three field sites from the united states of america usa france and iran were prepared with a spatial resolution of 30 1000 and 10 000 m and their effects on swi were investigated a swi estimation model was constructed based on a random forest rf regression using effective environmental parameters and used to map swi at 1 000 and 30 m spatial resolutions the final swi map with an improved spatial resolution was prepared after applying a correction due to a residual error finally the efficiency of the proposed model was evaluated based on measured soil moisture sm data recorded at ground stations the results showed that land surface temperature had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of swi the impact of surface biophysical properties on the swi was greater than topographical and geographical properties the mean swi error in usa france and iran at spatial resolution of 10 000 improved 1000 m for warm season were 23 6 15 8 14 2 9 8 and 10 7 7 4 respectively these values for cold season were 27 9 17 2 15 3 13 2 and 15 5 8 8 respectively mean of r2 and rmse between measured sm values and swi 10 000 m 1000 m and 30 m were 0 13 0 43 and 0 73 and 17 6 12 1 and 7 2 respectively these values for cold season were 0 10 0 39 0 67 and 20 7 14 3 7 2 respectively the proposed machine learning based approach showed strong potential in improving the spatial resolution of swi and giving the opportunity for various precise applications keywords soil water index land surface temperature biophysical properties machine learning downscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable in water and energy cycle since it is affected by the physical processes of energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere as latent heat of evaporation and specific soil temperature aliyu kasim et al 2020 surface soil moisture ssm can be estimated from measurements taken by remote sensing sensors profile sm while equally important cannot be directly measured by remote sensing but must be modeled the soil water index swi product developed for near real time applications within the framework of the gmes project geoland2 aims to provide such a modeled profile estimate using satellite data as input it is produced from advanced scatterometer ascat ssm estimates using a two layer water balance model which describes the relationship between surface and profile sm as a function of time however the low spatial resolution of this product is an important challenge in its use in various applications the need for swi information and their spatial distribution especially high resolution maps at different scales and operational areas such as climate hydrology and agricultural management is increasing in fact understanding the nature of swi changes and their effective factors are essential to improve the efficiency and management of water resources cao et al 2021 garcia estringana et al 2013 information on the swi spatial variations at large scale improve soil classification system and soil research in general on the other hand these information enhance the quality of digital mapping and soil management while small and medium scale studies improve soil water use efficiency and enable accurate agricultural management camacho suarez et al 2015 swi is a highly dynamic property surface and environmental heterogeneity strongly affect the extent of this property fathololoumi et al 2021 rainfall and other climatic properties such as air temperature wind speed and intensity land cover land management surface biophysical properties such as greenness and impermeability surface topographic properties such as elevation slope aspect and local incidence angle soil characteristics such as texture organic matter and hydraulic conductivity also affect swi and its spatial and temporal variations bai et al 2020 cammalleri and vogt 2015 swi heterogeneity renders conventional ground measurement methods inefficient and incapable of determining swi at large scales cao et al 2021 furthermore ground moisture measurement is time consuming and costly and requires advanced facilities to record temporal and spatial changes which means this data is not available in all regions of the world due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of swi most of the estimation methods based on its terrestrial devices are specific to the study sites and cannot be generalized but with the advancement of remote sensing technology methods for determining swi at a large scale have been developed one of the limitations of daily swi products obtained from satellite imagery is the low spatial resolution of this data as a result it cannot be used for precise applications therefore improving the spatial resolution downscaling or transfer of information from low to high spatial resolution of these products is of great importance one of the strategies to improve the spatial resolution or downscaling swi satellite products is to use methods and models based on auxiliary information and parameters affecting swi for this purpose in previous studies researchers have used different downscaling algorithms including artificial intelligence machine learning such as random forest rf and cubist abbaszadeh et al 2019 fathololoumi et al 2022 and interpolation methods fathololoumi et al 2020 lv et al 2021 implemented a downscaling method using a neural network algorithm to increase the spatial resolution of swi data they used ascat smap amsr2 data as well as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images and some distance measurement indicators they demonstrated the ability of the neural network to increase the spatial resolution of swi hu et al 2020 used shortwave infrared swir and visible remote sensing data in order to reduce the smap ssm product resolution from 36 to 1 km they used a series of remote sensing indicators and topographic information as model input data the results of this study provided more detailed swi data than the initial to increase the spatial resolution of soil moisture active passive smap ssm zhao et al 2018 utilized modis images and rf method the results showed that their utilized method was successful in increasing the details of swi at smaller scales hao sun and cui 2021 evaluated the efficiency of using land surface temperature lst and land surface evaporative efficiency lsee obtained from modis images and geographical factors for improving smap ssm scale and reported the effectiveness of the combination of these properties they also showed that lst can be replaced by lsee when satellite images are not available in the presence of clouds the quality of the input data determines the results of swi downscaling accuracy previous studies have typically been based on inactive microwave radiometer data or active microwave radar for swi downscaling also the impact of different environmental parameters on swi is usually complex and nonlinear therefore to construct a model between swi and environmental parameters the use of nonlinear models can be more accurate than linear models in this study in addition to ascat data we used optical images with higher spatial resolution as well as the capabilities of the rf regression method in analyzing linear and nonlinear multivariate relationships in increasing the spatial resolution of swi maps the advantages of these algorithms are 1 simultaneous consideration of continuous and classified e g land use cover variables 2 unlimited addition or subtraction of parameters based on access to information and purpose 3 limited number of variables that must be defined by the user 4 automatic calculation of the importance and the degree of participation of variables in the final formed model and 5 establishment of a complex and non linear relationship between independent and dependent variables the purpose of this study was to present a machine learning based approach to improve the spatial resolution of the swi obtained from the ascat in this approach a new set of environmental parameters affecting swi including biophysical topographic and geographic characteristics is used in this regard biophysical composition index bci wetness topographic wetness index twi and solar incidence angle sia are used for the first time in this study as effective parameters improve the spatial resolution of the swi also in this study swi maps with a spatial resolution of 30 m were produced for the first time 2 study area

sm data recorded by ground stations at a depth of 5 cm were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in improving swi spatial resolution these data were downloaded from http nationalsoilmoisture com for the usa and https www geo tuwien ac at insitu for france 95 and 7 sm measuring stations were used for the study area in the usa and france respectively to evaluate the results of the improved spatial resolution of swi for iran the sm information recorded at the 15 ground stations was used fig 1c the location of the stations was determined by considering the heterogeneity of biophysical and topographical properties and land cover these stations are distributed within an area of approximately 5 km2 this data was recorded at the satellite overpass time volumetric sm was measured with an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m 3 at a depth of 5 cm by a portable sm measurement device model δt sm150 made by england 3 2 method to improve the spatial resolution of swi the conceptual model is presented in fig 2 in the first step maps of surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties with spatial resolution of 30 1000 and 10 000 m were prepared in the second step the effect of each surface properties on swi was investigated and an optimal model for swi estimation based on surface properties at a spatial resolution of 10 000 m was constructed based on a rf regression model to investigate the effect of each environmental parameter on swi modeling their degree of importance was calculated then by applying the model used in the previous step on the surface properties of 1 000 and 30 m initial swi maps with spatial resolution of 1 000 and 30 m were prepared then using the correction due to the residual error the swi map with the final improved spatial resolution was prepared in the final step the efficiency of the proposed model to improve the spatial resolution of swi was evaluated based on measured sm data recorded at ground stations 3 2 1 effective environmental parameters in general the heterogeneity of environmental parameters can lead to the spatial variability of sm but the effect of these parameters on sm is variable qiu et al 2001 seneviratne et al 2010 swi is a function of surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties therefore the spatial resolution of the swi can be improved by using these properties as auxiliary parameters with higher spatial resolution surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties maps were prepared with a spatial resolution of 30 1000 and 10 000 m surface biophysical properties lst affects swi by altering various components of the surface energy balance increasing the surface temperature reduces swi several researchers have shown that there is a strong relationship between lst and swi babaeian et al 2018 dai et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 details of lst calculations can be found in jiménez muñoz et al 2014 vegetation is one of the most important variables on swi the presence of vegetation on the land surface maintains moisture by absorbing water through the roots and by the cover of vegetation vegetation increases swi by affecting evapotranspiration as well as its role as a barrier against sunlight kurc and benton 2010 in this study ndvi was used to quantify vegetation status also the surface wetness index which is calculated based on the reflective bands and the tasseled cap transformation can indicate the surface moisture status eswar et al 2016 numerous studies have shown a relationship between swi and surface reflectance bablet et al 2018 kaleita et al 2005 as the swi increases the surface reflectance decreases due to the darkness in the soil in fact the brightness of the surface decreases with increasing swi in this study the albedo was used to investigate the relationship between swi and reflectivity the rate of this index is large in light surfaces dry soil and small in dark surfaces wet soil the albedo indicates the ability of a soil surface to reflect sunlight which is related to swi yang et al 2020 reported a significant negative linear relationship between surface albedo and swi the researchers results showed that shorter wave surface albedos were more sensitive to swi in sunlight park et al 2020 xiao and bowker 2020 in this study the data of landsat 8 and modis reflective bands were used to calculate the surface albedo bci was used to identify the surface biophysical condition and improve the separation between the impermeable surface and the bare soil this index was obtained by combining the parameters of brightness wetness and greenness obtained from tasseled cap transformation and was modeled in an integrated index of the surface biophysical condition the value of this index is between 1 and 1 deng and wu 2012 bci can be calculated by using equation 1 1 b c i h l 2 v h l 2 v where h is normalized tc1 the brightness component of the tasseled cap transformation or high albedo l is normalized tc3 the wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation or low albedo v is normalized tc2 the greenness component of the tasseled cap transformation or vegetation h v and l were calculated by using equations 2 3 and 4 respectively 2 h t c 1 t c 1 m i n t c 1 m a x t c 1 m i n 3 v t c 2 t c 2 m i n t c 2 m a x t c 2 m i n 4 l t c 3 t c 3 m i n t c 3 m a x t c 3 m i n where tcimax and tcimin are the maximum and minimum values of the ith tasseled cap transformation respectively surface topographic properties surface topography is one of the most effective variables affecting swi topography is the primary factor controlling the spatial variation of hydrological conditions that affect the swi spatial distribution and groundwater flow often follows the surface topography therefore topographic indices are used to study the swi spatial variation pattern raduła et al 2018 in this study elevation twi and sia were used as topographic indices increasing elevation decreases the air temperature decreases evapotranspiration and increases rainfall and consequently the amount of swi the relationship between elevation and swi is direct firozjaei et al 2020 kattel et al 2013 martínez murillo et al 2017 also by decreasing slia the amount of energy entering the surface increases and as a result the amount of swi decreases srivastava et al 2009 topographic wetness index twi is a broad index in hydrological analysis that describes the tendency of an area to accumulate water and can quantify the effect of topography on runoff production and it is defined as follows 5 twi l n sca tan φ where sca is the specific catchment area and φ is the slope angle geographical properties depending on the location of the point the amount of swi will be different because the geographical location affects the amount of received energy from the sun and factors related to solar energy such as number of hours of sunshine evapotranspiration climatic parameters air temperature and rainfall each of these parameters changes swi the latitude and longitude of the sm measurement station points were used to express their geographical location 3 2 2 downscaling model in the first step swi was modeled based on effective parameters with low spatial resolution 10 000 m equation 6 6 swi cmodel f effective p a r a m e t e r s c in equation 1 s w i c m o d e l is modeled swi at low spatial resolution based on surface properties f is a function of the model formed between swi and low spatial resolution affecting parameters rf was used to create a model between the surface properties and swi rf is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines a large set of decision trees to improve the accuracy of estimating a variable belgiu and drăguţ 2016 breiman 2001 shah et al 2019 to implement this algorithm two parameters including number of trees and number of attributes must be set the number of trees varied from 50 to 400 with step size 50 the number of attributes is equal to the number of environmental parameters the rmse value was calculated between the swi obtained from ascat and swi modeled by rf with a spatial resolution of 10 000 m in each step at each step the number of trees used in the rf model was changed the minimum value of rmse was used as a criterion to determine the optimal rf model for each of the study areas the usa france and iran 250 150 and 200 were determined as the optimal number of trees in the rf model respectively the degree of importance of each of the environmental parameters used in the rf model in the swi modeling process of each region was calculated using the varimp function in the second step the residual value due to different sources in swi modeling was calculated based on the surface properties at low spatial resolution for each case based on equation 7 7 ε s w i cmodel swi cobs swi cmodel where ε s w i c m o d e l is the residual value from different sources in swi modeling at low spatial resolution based on regression model s w i c o b s is the extracted swi from satellite products at low spatial resolution and s w i c m o d e l is the modeled swi at low spatial resolution based on the regression model the residual value was calculated on a low spatial resolution pixel scale the simple addition of the residual at a low spatial resolution pixel scale could introduce a block effect to the final estimates therefore in this study the impact of effective parameters neighborhood on the residual value at low spatial resolution was modeled using an rf regression then the residual effect on the modeled swi was applied at high spatial resolution considering the effective parameters neighborhood effect equation 8 the 3 3 moving window was used to calculate the effective parameters neighborhood effect at low and high spatial resolution 8 ε s w i fmodel f ε neffective p a r a m e t e r s f in equation 8 ε s w i f m o d e l is residual effect on the modeled swi at high

spatial resolution of 10 000 1000 and 30 m measured sm data recorded at ground stations was used firstly statistical parameters of downscaled swi in location of ground stations and measured sm were calculated and compared with each other then to determine the model prediction certainty in the study areas the error of swi at a spatial resolution of 10 000 and 1000 m in the location of ground stations were calculated equation 10 and compared with each other finally coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were calculated between downscaled swi and measured sm data

all considered environmental parameters including surface topographic biophysical and geographical properties had a significant impact on the spatial distribution of swi fig 3 however the degree of importance of each auxiliary parameter on the swi spatial variation was different also the importance of environmental parameters in swi modeling varied in different study areas in all three study areas lst and sia were the most important in swi modeling in warm and cold seasons respectively for warm season the importance of lst for the usa france and iran was 23 5 21 and 21 respectively after lst wetness was the second effective environmental parameter in swi modeling with a importance of 21 5 16 and 17 for the usa france and iran respectively latitude and longitude were the least important in swi modeling in the study areas the importance of lst ndvi and wetness variables was the highest for the usa and then iran and france while the importance of bci in france 14 was higher than iran 12 and the usa 11 among the surface biophysical properties albedo was the least important parameter in swi modeling the importance of sia and dem parameters in iran 11 and 9 was higher than for france 9 and 7 and the usa 8 and 6 among the topographic parameters the importance of sia on swi spatial distribution was greater than dem the average importance of biophysical topographic and geographical parameters in swi modeling was 14 8 and 2 respectively the spatial distribution of swi in the study areas was influenced more by biophysical parameters than topographic and geographical fig 3 for the cold season the effect of topographic parameters on the spatial distribution of swi was greater than biophysical and geographical parameters the importance of sia in swi modeling in the usa france and iran was 22 18 and 19 respectively among the biophysical parameters wetness was more important than others the significance of the latitude and longitude properties in swi modeling was almost equal fig 3 4 2 swi spatial resolution improvement swi spatial details in swi maps with improved spatial resolution 1000 m were better than swi maps at initial spatial resolution 10 000 m spatial patterns of areas with high swi such as agricultural and irrigated areas and low swi bare soil were more pronounced in maps with improved spatial resolution than in maps with initial spatial resolution swi maps 30 m for sub areas showed higher spatial details the spatial alignment of the 30 m swi maps and the false color composition fcc maps showed that the swi spatial variations were well modeled the swi pattern of farms was illustrated well in 30 m swi maps in the usa in france high elevation areas with dense vegetation had the highest swi values were shown on 30 m swi maps in red for the subarea located in iran the highest swi values were for the water areas and under the dam fig 4 the mean values of swi with initial improved spatial resolution for the study areas of the usa france and iran were 29 28 20 18 and 34 35 respectively the small difference between the mean value of initial and improved swi spatial resolutions indicated a high performance of the spatial resolution improvement model the average value of french swi was higher than iran and the usa swi standard deviation sd values with initial improved spatial resolution for the usa france and iran were 10 14 8 15 and 8 14 respectively for all three areas the sd of swi maps with improved spatial resolution was greater than swi maps with initial spatial resolution the difference between the sd values of the swi maps with the initial and improved spatial resolution indicated that the details heterogeneity and spatial variation of the swi with the improved spatial resolution were greater than that with the initial spatial resolution fig 4 the mean sd of swi of three subareas at spatial resolution of 10 000 1 000 and 30 m in warm cold season were 7 3 8 10 6 15 6 and 14 3 14 6 respectively with increasing spatial resolution to 30 m the sd of the modeled swi increased over the original higher sd indicated an increase in the display of spatial details in the swi status of the area the mean swi values for the three subareas located in the usa france and iran were similar to each other the largest difference between the mean swi in the initial and improved spatial resolution of 30 m was for the subarea located in france 4 in warm season and 5 in cold season table 1 4 3 accuracy assessment the statistical parameters of swi at a spatial resolution of 10 000 initial and 1 000 m downscaled in the location of ground stations and ground measured sm data for warm and cold seasons was showed in table 2 the results showed that the similarity of measured sm and modeled swi at 1000 m scale was more than 10 000 m the mean value of the swi of the three study areas with spatial resolution of 10 000 and 1000 m in the geographical location of the ground stations for the warm cold season was 35 9 48 5 and 31 1 42 1 respectively the mean value of ground measured sm was 20 1 29 1 so that its difference with the mean value of swi in the spatial resolution of 1000 m was less than 10000 m for the warm season the sd of the swi values of the usa france and iran with a spatial resolution of 10 000 1000 m in the geographic location of the ground stations was 8 0 13 5 8 9 13 8 and 7 1 9 0 respectively these values for the cold season were 7 3 10 5 6 8 12 9 and 6 9 7 9 respectively by improving the spatial resolution of swi from 10000 m to 1000 m the sd of swi values increased and became closer to the sd of ground measured sm it means that the proposed method for swi downscaling is able to increase the swi map s accuracy and improve its spatial resolution to determine the model prediction certainty in the study areas the error values were calculated table 3 this evaluation method shows how far the modeled values are from the measured values small error values indicated that the modeled values were equal or close to the measured values the mean swi error of the usa france and iran at spatial resolution of 10 000 1000 m in warm season were 23 6 15 8 14 2 9 8 and 10 7 7 4 respectively these values for the cold season were 27 9 17 2 15 3 13 2 and 15 5 8 8 respectively the highest and lowest residual values were in the usa and iran respectively in the usa and 10 000 m spatial resolution at least 20 sample points had more than 30 error values while no sample point had more than 30 error values for modeled swi in 1000 m special resolution in french and 10 000 m spatial resolution more than five sample points had more than 15 error value while the residual value of all sample points in 1000 m was less than 15 in iran the maximum error values in 10 000 and 1000 m spatial resolutions were 16 and 11 respectively for warm season r2 rmse between measured sm values recorded at ground stations and swi with initial spatial resolution 10 000 m for the study areas of the usa france and iran were 0 12 25 1 0 14 15 6 and 0 15 12 2 respectively table 4 by improving the spatial resolution of swi to 1 000 m the values of r2 rmse for different study areas improved and reached to 0 42 17 2 0 52 11 2 and 0 40 7 9 respectively the r2 rmse between measured sm values recorded at ground stations and swi with improved spatial resolution of 30 m in france and iran were 0 78 7 9 and 0 68 6 5 respectively for cold season mean of r2 and rmse between measured sm and modeled swi in 10 000 m 1000 m and 30 m spatial resolutions were 0 10 0 39 0 67 and 20 7 14 3 7 2 respectively the results showed that by improving the spatial resolution of the initial swi based on the proposed model the swi accuracy was increased significantly due to limited access to ground station sm data quantitative evaluation of the improved 30 m swi was not performed in the usa sub area 5 discussion daily swi products derived from satellite imagery face the challenge of low spatial resolution therefore improving the spatial resolution of daily swi products obtained from satellite images is important in this study for the first time the spatial resolution of swi obtained from the satellite with a spatial resolution of approximately 10 000 m has been improved to 30 m the results show the high accuracy of the proposed model to improve spatial resolution the downscaling method presented in this study was able to well monitor the spatial variations of swi at higher spatial resolution fig 4 table 2 3 and 4 these results were in line with the findings of senanayake et al 2021 who showed that downscaling algorithms constructed using in situ data and time series images of a grid surface model with a resolution of 25 km despite their different spatial resolution can well provide robust swi monitoring methods the downscaled swi in 30 m spatial resolution better presented the swi spatial variation than original swi data which is in line with the findings of fang et al 2018 the accuracy of improving the spatial resolution of swi is affected by considering effective environmental parameters each of the environmental parameters can have a specific and different effect on the spatial distribution of swi in this study the effect of biophysical topographic and geographical features on swi modeling was evaluated for warm season the highest and lowest impact of environmental parameters on swi are related to biophysical lst and geographical longitude properties respectively for the cold season in swi modeling the degree of importance of topographic properties were greater than biophysical and geographical properties in previous studies it was shown that lst was the most effective parameter on the spatial distribution of swi fathololoumi et al 2022 huang et al 2016 in humid climates the effect of surface biophysical properties on swi is greater than topographic properties however in areas with hot and dry climates and mountains the effect of surface topographic properties on swi can be greater than the surface biophysical properties vegetation and moisture status also have a significant effect on the spatial distribution of swi the effect of latitude and longitude on the spatial distribution of swi in large areas can be clearer in small area the impact of these parameters is low most previous studies have used only the surface biophysical properties in the process of improving the spatial resolution of swi in this study it was shown that the surface topographic and geographical properties can also have a high degree of importance in the spatial variation of swi several other environmental parameters can also affect the spatial distribution of swi one of the reasons for the differences in modeling accuracy in different study areas may be related to the effect of soil properties including soil texture various studies have shown that different soil textures depending on whether they are fine or coarse can affect soil water holding capacity gholami bidkhani and mobasheri 2018 other soil properties such as salinity organic matter saturated conductivity field capacity wilting point etc can also affect the accuracy of swi modeling results in different areas fathololoumi et al 2021 sadeghi et al 2017 but not only the map of these parameters is not available for different areas but ground measurement of these parameters at large scale is time consuming and costly the used environmental parameters map should be able to be obtained from remote sensing data or other sources on the other hand the reason for using environmental parameters such as greenness imperviousness elevation slope aspect etc is considering the effect of soil physical characteristics in the swi modeling process indirectly also the influence of climatic parameters such as wind speed precipitation and snow can affect the swi value of a particular geographical location therefore considering these parameters in the process of improving the swi spatial resolution is useful in future studies improving swi spatial resolution based on the type of composite data is divided into two categories 1 a combination of active and passive microwave data chen et al 2018 fang et al 2018 fang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 and 2 a combination of visible and infrared data and microwave fathololoumi et al 2022 filion et al 2016 the advantage of the combination of active and passive microwave data is low sensitivity to cloud cover duan et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 although the possibility of using a wide range of surface properties as effective parameters in the process of improving the swi spatial resolution is an advantage of the strategy of combining visible infrared and microwave data this strategy is highly sensitive to cloud cover in this study the strategy of combining visible infrared and microwave data was used common models for improving swi spatial resolution are based on regression algorithms neural networks or physical methods regression methods are easier to implement than other methods the regression methods used to improve the spatial resolution of swi in previous studies are classified into univariate and multivariate groups either linear or nonlinear previous studies have shown that the use of rf in modeling the spatial resolution of swi can be useful and efficient fathololoumi et al 2021 however the black box of this model is one of its limitations and weaknesses hence details of the relationship between swi and effective environmental parameters based on the rf algorithm are not available therefore it is not possible to physically analyze and understand the type of impact of each of the environmental parameters affecting swi based on this algorithm one of the challenges in swi downscaling studies is the limitation of access to sm data recorded at ground stations with suitable conditions in terms of density and spatial distribution to assess improved swi accuracy 6 conclusion swi is a key variable in the study of land atmosphere interactions and is of great importance in many land based studies including agriculture hydrology and environmental sciences however improving the spatial resolution of swi obtained from satellite images is required the results show that the effect of each of the surface biophysical and topographic properties on swi is different among the set of environmental parameters lst sia had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of swi in warm cold season the impact of biophysical properties on the spatial variation of swi was greater than topographic and geographical parameters in warm season however in cold season the topographic parameters degree of importance was greater than biophysical and geographical parameters the proposed machine learning based model to improve the spatial resolution of swi was highly efficient the accuracy of the proposed model in swi downscaling in the warm season is more than in the cold season by improving the spatial resolution of swi the spatial patterns of areas with high moisture content are well modeled however in swi data with initial spatial resolution it is impossible to detect these moisture spatial patterns it is suggested that in future studies some soil related properties be evaluated in the modeling to improve the spatial resolution of swi the use of local strategies in calibrating swi spatial resolution models can be very useful credit authorship contribution statement solmaz fathololoumi conceptualization data curation formal analysis

2712,one of the limitations of daily soil water index swi products obtained from satellite imagery is the low spatial resolution limiting their precise applications the purpose of this study was to present a machine learning based approach to improve the spatial resolution of the swi obtained from the advanced scatterometer ascat surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties environmental parameters maps of three field sites from the united states of america usa france and iran were prepared with a spatial resolution of 30 1000 and 10 000 m and their effects on swi were investigated a swi estimation model was constructed based on a random forest rf regression using effective environmental parameters and used to map swi at 1 000 and 30 m spatial resolutions the final swi map with an improved spatial resolution was prepared after applying a correction due to a residual error finally the efficiency of the proposed model was evaluated based on measured soil moisture sm data recorded at ground stations the results showed that land surface temperature had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of swi the impact of surface biophysical properties on the swi was greater than topographical and geographical properties the mean swi error in usa france and iran at spatial resolution of 10 000 improved 1000 m for warm season were 23 6 15 8 14 2 9 8 and 10 7 7 4 respectively these values for cold season were 27 9 17 2 15 3 13 2 and 15 5 8 8 respectively mean of r2 and rmse between measured sm values and swi 10 000 m 1000 m and 30 m were 0 13 0 43 and 0 73 and 17 6 12 1 and 7 2 respectively these values for cold season were 0 10 0 39 0 67 and 20 7 14 3 7 2 respectively the proposed machine learning based approach showed strong potential in improving the spatial resolution of swi and giving the opportunity for various precise applications keywords soil water index land surface temperature biophysical properties machine learning downscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable in water and energy cycle since it is affected by the physical processes of energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere as latent heat of evaporation and specific soil temperature aliyu kasim et al 2020 surface soil moisture ssm can be estimated from measurements taken by remote sensing sensors profile sm while equally important cannot be directly measured by remote sensing but must be modeled the soil water index swi product developed for near real time applications within the framework of the gmes project geoland2 aims to provide such a modeled profile estimate using satellite data as input it is produced from advanced scatterometer ascat ssm estimates using a two layer water balance model which describes the relationship between surface and profile sm as a function of time however the low spatial resolution of this product is an important challenge in its use in various applications the need for swi information and their spatial distribution especially high resolution maps at different scales and operational areas such as climate hydrology and agricultural management is increasing in fact understanding the nature of swi changes and their effective factors are essential to improve the efficiency and management of water resources cao et al 2021 garcia estringana et al 2013 information on the swi spatial variations at large scale improve soil classification system and soil research in general on the other hand these information enhance the quality of digital mapping and soil management while small and medium scale studies improve soil water use efficiency and enable accurate agricultural management camacho suarez et al 2015 swi is a highly dynamic property surface and environmental heterogeneity strongly affect the extent of this property fathololoumi et al 2021 rainfall and other climatic properties such as air temperature wind speed and intensity land cover land management surface biophysical properties such as greenness and impermeability surface topographic properties such as elevation slope aspect and local incidence angle soil characteristics such as texture organic matter and hydraulic conductivity also affect swi and its spatial and temporal variations bai et al 2020 cammalleri and vogt 2015 swi heterogeneity renders conventional ground measurement methods inefficient and incapable of determining swi at large scales cao et al 2021 furthermore ground moisture measurement is time consuming and costly and requires advanced facilities to record temporal and spatial changes which means this data is not available in all regions of the world due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of swi most of the estimation methods based on its terrestrial devices are specific to the study sites and cannot be generalized but with the advancement of remote sensing technology methods for determining swi at a large scale have been developed one of the limitations of daily swi products obtained from satellite imagery is the low spatial resolution of this data as a result it cannot be used for precise applications therefore improving the spatial resolution downscaling or transfer of information from low to high spatial resolution of these products is of great importance one of the strategies to improve the spatial resolution or downscaling swi satellite products is to use methods and models based on auxiliary information and parameters affecting swi for this purpose in previous studies researchers have used different downscaling algorithms including artificial intelligence machine learning such as random forest rf and cubist abbaszadeh et al 2019 fathololoumi et al 2022 and interpolation methods fathololoumi et al 2020 lv et al 2021 implemented a downscaling method using a neural network algorithm to increase the spatial resolution of swi data they used ascat smap amsr2 data as well as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images and some distance measurement indicators they demonstrated the ability of the neural network to increase the spatial resolution of swi hu et al 2020 used shortwave infrared swir and visible remote sensing data in order to reduce the smap ssm product resolution from 36 to 1 km they used a series of remote sensing indicators and topographic information as model input data the results of this study provided more detailed swi data than the initial to increase the spatial resolution of soil moisture active passive smap ssm zhao et al 2018 utilized modis images and rf method the results showed that their utilized method was successful in increasing the details of swi at smaller scales hao sun and cui 2021 evaluated the efficiency of using land surface temperature lst and land surface evaporative efficiency lsee obtained from modis images and geographical factors for improving smap ssm scale and reported the effectiveness of the combination of these properties they also showed that lst can be replaced by lsee when satellite images are not available in the presence of clouds the quality of the input data determines the results of swi downscaling accuracy previous studies have typically been based on inactive microwave radiometer data or active microwave radar for swi downscaling also the impact of different environmental parameters on swi is usually complex and nonlinear therefore to construct a model between swi and environmental parameters the use of nonlinear models can be more accurate than linear models in this study in addition to ascat data we used optical images with higher spatial resolution as well as the capabilities of the rf regression method in analyzing linear and nonlinear multivariate relationships in increasing the spatial resolution of swi maps the advantages of these algorithms are 1 simultaneous consideration of continuous and classified e g land use cover variables 2 unlimited

present a machine learning based approach to improve the spatial resolution of the swi obtained from the ascat in this approach a new set of environmental parameters affecting swi including biophysical topographic and geographic characteristics is used in this regard biophysical composition index bci wetness topographic wetness index twi and solar incidence angle sia are used for the first time in this study as effective parameters improve the spatial resolution of the swi also in this study swi maps with a spatial resolution of 30 m were produced for the first time 2 study area to evaluate the proposed method for improving the spatial resolution of swi from 10 000 m to 1000 m three regions in the united states of america usa 111 w and 36 5 n france 3 e and 45 n and iran 47 e and 37 n with an approximate area of 387 000 105 000 and 70 000 km2 were selected in this study criteria for selecting the study areas were 1 land cover diversity 2 geographical and topographic

forests in france it was mainly covered with forest and in iran it was crop lands and lands covered by herbaceous vegetation fig 1 to evaluate the efficiency of the model for swi downscaling at 30 m spatial resolution sub areas were selected in each study area the area of the sub regions in the usa france and iran was 1 500 1 750 and 25 000 km2 respectively 3 data and method 3 1 data remote sensing data daily swi data from ascat satellite images with a spatial resolution of about 10 000 m are available at https land copernicus eu global products swi since january 2015 a two layer water balance model is used to prepare this data paulik et al 2014 paulik et al 2012 the accuracy of this data is evaluated based on the international soil moisture network ismn in previous studies it was shown that this data can be useful for monitoring agricultural productivity forestry and ecosystem health swi data for the study areas usa france and iran for 2021 were downloaded the warm season includes the days of spring and summer and the cold season includes the days of autumn fall and winter different dates were chosen for the warm and cold seasons in each region table a1 landsat 8 and modis cloud free satellite images were used to model the surface biophysical properties modis imagery with 36 spectral bands at daily temporal resolution were downloaded from https search earthdata nasa gov the resolution of its thermal bands is 1 000 m and its reflective bands resolution are 250 and 500 m the spatial resolution of the modis reflective bands was converted to 1 000 m and then the surface biophysical properties were extracted mod11a1 product was used to model the land surface temperature lst wan 2006 also surface biophysical properties maps with spatial resolution of 10 000 m were prepared by upscaling of the surface biophysical properties maps with 1000 m spatial resolution obtained from the modis reflective bands and modis products landsat 8 images was used to model the surface biophysical properties with a spatial resolution of 30 m geometric and atmospheric corrections of these images have been done by the provider organization these images were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov alos world 3d with a spatial resolution of 30 m was used to model the surface topographic properties this data was downloaded from the https www eorc jaxa jp alos website also surface topographic property maps with spatial resolution of 1 000 and 10 000 m were prepared by upscaling of the initial maps 30 m ground station observations sm data recorded by ground stations at a depth of 5 cm were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in improving swi spatial resolution these data were downloaded from http nationalsoilmoisture com for the usa and https www geo tuwien ac at insitu for france 95 and 7 sm measuring stations were used for the study area in the usa and france respectively to evaluate the results of the improved spatial resolution of swi for iran the sm information recorded at the 15 ground stations was used fig 1c the location of the stations was determined by considering the heterogeneity of biophysical and topographical properties and land cover these stations are distributed within an area of approximately 5 km2 this data was recorded at the satellite overpass time volumetric sm was measured with an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m 3 at a depth of 5 cm by a portable sm measurement device model δt sm150 made by england 3 2 method to improve the spatial resolution of swi the conceptual model is presented in fig 2 in the first step maps of surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties with spatial resolution of 30 1000 and 10 000 m were prepared in the second step the effect of each surface properties on swi was investigated and an optimal model for swi estimation based on surface properties at a spatial resolution of 10 000 m was constructed based on a rf regression model to investigate the effect of each environmental parameter on swi modeling their degree of importance was calculated then by applying the model used in the previous step on the surface properties of 1 000 and 30 m initial swi maps with spatial resolution of 1 000 and 30 m were prepared then using the correction due to the residual error the swi map with the final improved spatial resolution was prepared in the final step the efficiency of the proposed model to improve the spatial resolution of swi was evaluated based on measured sm data recorded at ground stations 3 2 1 effective environmental parameters in general the heterogeneity of environmental parameters can lead to the spatial variability of sm but the effect of these parameters on sm is variable qiu et al 2001 seneviratne et al 2010 swi is a function of surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties therefore the spatial resolution of the swi can be improved by using these properties as auxiliary parameters with higher spatial resolution surface biophysical topographic and geographical properties maps were prepared with a spatial resolution of 30 1000 and 10 000 m surface biophysical properties lst affects swi by altering various components of the surface energy balance increasing the surface temperature reduces swi several researchers have shown that there is a strong relationship between lst and swi babaeian et al 2018 dai et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 details of lst calculations can be found in jiménez muñoz et al 2014 vegetation is one of the most important variables on swi the presence of vegetation on the land surface maintains moisture by absorbing water through the roots and by the cover of vegetation vegetation increases swi by affecting evapotranspiration as well as its role as a barrier against sunlight kurc and benton 2010 in this study ndvi was used to quantify vegetation status also the surface wetness index which is calculated based on the reflective bands and the tasseled cap transformation can indicate the surface moisture status eswar et al 2016 numerous studies have shown a relationship between swi and surface reflectance bablet et al 2018 kaleita et al 2005 as the swi increases the surface reflectance decreases due to the darkness in the soil in fact the brightness of the surface decreases with increasing swi in this study the albedo was used to investigate the relationship between swi and reflectivity the rate of this index is large in light surfaces dry soil and small in dark surfaces wet soil the albedo indicates the ability of a soil surface to reflect sunlight which is related to swi yang et al 2020 reported a significant negative linear relationship between surface albedo and swi the researchers results showed that shorter wave surface albedos were more sensitive to swi in sunlight park et al 2020 xiao and bowker 2020 in this study the data of landsat 8 and modis reflective bands were used to calculate the surface albedo bci was used to identify the surface biophysical condition and improve the separation between the impermeable surface and the bare soil this index was obtained by combining the parameters of brightness wetness and greenness obtained from tasseled cap transformation and was modeled in an integrated index of the surface biophysical condition the value of this index is between 1 and 1 deng and wu 2012 bci can be calculated by using equation 1 1 b c i h l 2 v h l 2 v where h is normalized tc1 the brightness component of the tasseled cap transformation or high albedo l is normalized tc3 the wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation or low albedo v is normalized tc2 the greenness component of the tasseled cap transformation or vegetation h v and l were calculated by using equations 2 3 and 4 respectively 2 h t c 1 t c 1 m i n t c 1 m a x t c 1 m i n 3 v t c 2 t c 2 m i n t c 2 m a x t c 2 m i n 4 l t c 3 t c 3 m i n t c 3 m a x t c 3 m i n where tcimax and tcimin are the maximum and minimum values of the ith tasseled cap transformation respectively surface topographic properties surface topography is one of the most effective variables affecting swi topography is the primary factor controlling the spatial variation of hydrological conditions that affect the swi spatial distribution and groundwater flow often follows the surface topography therefore topographic indices are used to study the swi spatial variation pattern raduła et al 2018 in this study elevation twi and sia were used as topographic indices increasing elevation decreases the air temperature decreases evapotranspiration and increases rainfall and consequently the amount of swi the relationship between elevation and swi is direct firozjaei et al 2020 kattel et al 2013 martínez murillo et al 2017 also by decreasing slia the amount of energy entering the surface increases and as a result the amount of swi decreases srivastava et al 2009 topographic wetness index twi is a broad index in hydrological analysis that describes the tendency of an area to accumulate water and can quantify the effect of topography on runoff production and it is defined as follows 5 twi l n sca tan φ where sca is the specific catchment area and φ is the slope angle geographical properties depending on the location of the point the amount of swi will be different because the geographical location affects the amount of received energy from the sun and factors related to solar energy such as number of hours of sunshine evapotranspiration climatic parameters air temperature and rainfall each of these parameters changes swi the latitude and longitude of the sm measurement station points were used to express their geographical location 3 2 2 downscaling model in the first step swi was modeled based on effective parameters with low spatial resolution 10 000 m equation 6 6 swi cmodel f effective p a r a m e t e r s c in equation 1 s w i c m o d e l is modeled swi at low spatial resolution based on surface properties f is a function of the model formed between swi and low spatial resolution affecting parameters rf was used to create a model between the surface properties and swi rf is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines a large set of decision trees to improve the accuracy of estimating a variable belgiu and drăguţ 2016 breiman 2001 shah et al 2019 to implement this algorithm two parameters including number of trees and number of attributes must be set the number of trees varied from 50 to 400 with step size 50 the number of attributes is equal to the number of environmental parameters the rmse value was calculated between the swi obtained from ascat and swi modeled by rf with a spatial resolution of 10 000 m in each step at each step the number of trees used in the rf model was changed the minimum value of rmse was used as a criterion to determine the optimal rf model for each of the study areas the usa france and iran 250 150 and 200 were determined as the optimal number of trees in the rf model respectively the degree of importance of each of the environmental parameters used in the rf model in the swi modeling process of each region was calculated using the varimp function in the second step the residual value due to different sources in swi modeling was calculated based on the surface properties at low spatial resolution for each case based on equation 7 7 ε s w i cmodel swi cobs swi cmodel where ε s w i c m o d e l is the residual value from different sources in swi modeling at low spatial resolution based on regression model s w i c o b s is the extracted swi from satellite products at low spatial resolution and s w i c m o d e l is the modeled swi at low spatial resolution based on the regression model the residual value was calculated on a low spatial resolution pixel scale the simple addition of the residual at a low spatial resolution pixel scale could introduce a block effect to the final estimates therefore in this study the impact of effective parameters neighborhood on the residual value at low spatial resolution was modeled using an rf regression then the residual effect on the modeled swi was applied at high spatial resolution considering the effective parameters neighborhood effect equation 8 the 3 3 moving window was used to calculate the effective parameters neighborhood effect at low and high spatial resolution 8 ε s w i fmodel f ε neffective p a r a m e t e r s f in equation 8 ε s w i f m o d e l is residual effect on the modeled swi at high spatial resolution f ε is a function of the model formed between ε s w i c m o d e l and low spatial resolution effective parameters neighborhood effect and n e f f e c t i v e p a r a m e t e r s f is high spatial resolution effective parameters neighborhood effect then equation 9 was used to model swi at high resolution 9 s w i f m o d e l f e f f e c t i v e p a r a m e t e r s f ε s w i f m o

resolution and e f f e c t i v e p a r a m e t e r s f is effective parameters with high spatial resolution 1 000 and 30 m in this study 3 2 3 accuracy assessment to evaluate the accuracy of swi with spatial resolution of 10 000 1000 and 30 m measured sm data recorded at ground stations was used firstly statistical parameters of downscaled swi in location of ground stations and measured sm were calculated and compared with each other then to determine the model prediction certainty in the study areas the error of swi at a spatial resolution of 10 000 and 1000 m in the location of ground stations were calculated equation 10 and compared with each other finally coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were calculated between downscaled swi and measured sm data using equations 11 and 12 10 e r r o r s w i d o w n s a c l e d i s m m e a s u r e d i 11 r 2 1 i 1 n s m m e a s u r e d i s w i d o w n s a c l e d i 2 i 1 n s m m e a s u r e d s w i d o w n s a

all considered environmental parameters including surface topographic biophysical and geographical properties had a significant impact on the spatial distribution of swi fig 3 however the degree of importance of each auxiliary parameter on the swi spatial variation was different also the importance of environmental parameters in swi modeling varied in different study areas in all three study areas lst and sia were the most important in swi modeling in warm and cold seasons respectively for warm season the importance of lst for the usa france and iran was 23 5 21 and 21 respectively after lst wetness was the second effective environmental parameter in swi modeling with a importance of 21 5 16 and 17 for the usa france and iran respectively latitude and longitude were the least important in swi modeling in the study areas the importance of lst ndvi and wetness variables was the highest for the usa and then iran and france while the importance of bci in france 14 was higher than iran 12 and the usa 11 among the surface biophysical properties albedo was the least important parameter in swi modeling the importance of sia and dem parameters in iran 11 and 9 was higher than for france 9 and 7 and the usa 8 and 6 among the topographic parameters the importance of sia on swi spatial distribution was greater than dem the average importance of biophysical topographic and geographical parameters in swi modeling was 14 8 and 2 respectively the spatial distribution of swi in the study areas was influenced more by biophysical parameters than topographic and geographical fig 3 for the cold season the effect of topographic parameters on the spatial distribution of swi was greater than biophysical and geographical parameters the importance of sia in swi modeling in the usa france and iran was 22 18 and 19 respectively among the biophysical parameters wetness was more important than others the significance of the latitude and longitude properties in swi modeling was almost equal fig 3 4 2 swi spatial resolution improvement swi spatial details in swi maps with improved spatial resolution 1000 m were better than swi maps at initial spatial resolution 10 000 m spatial patterns of areas with high swi such as agricultural and irrigated areas and low swi bare soil were more pronounced in maps with improved spatial resolution than in maps with initial spatial resolution swi maps 30 m for sub areas showed higher spatial details the spatial alignment of the 30 m swi maps and the false color composition fcc maps showed that the swi spatial variations were well modeled the swi pattern of farms was illustrated well in 30 m swi maps in the usa in france high elevation areas with dense vegetation had the highest swi values were shown on 30 m swi maps in red for the subarea located in iran the highest swi values were for the water areas and under the dam fig 4 the mean values of swi with initial improved spatial resolution for the study areas of the usa france and iran were 29 28 20 18 and 34 35 respectively the small difference between the mean value of initial and improved swi spatial resolutions indicated a high performance of the spatial resolution improvement model the average value of french swi was higher than iran and the usa swi standard deviation sd values with initial improved spatial resolution for the usa france and iran were 10 14 8 15 and 8 14 respectively for all three areas the sd of swi maps with improved spatial resolution was greater than swi maps with initial spatial resolution the difference between the sd values of the swi maps with the initial and improved spatial resolution indicated that the details heterogeneity and spatial variation of the swi with the improved spatial resolution were greater than that with the initial spatial resolution fig 4 the mean sd of swi of three subareas at spatial resolution of 10 000 1 000 and 30 m in warm cold season were 7 3 8 10 6 15 6 and 14 3 14 6 respectively with increasing spatial resolution to 30 m the sd of the modeled swi increased over the original higher sd indicated an increase in the display of spatial details in the swi status of the area the mean swi values for the three subareas located in the usa france and iran were similar to each other the largest difference between the mean swi in the initial and improved spatial resolution of 30 m was for the subarea located in france 4 in warm season and 5 in cold season table 1 4 3 accuracy assessment the statistical parameters of swi at a spatial resolution of 10 000 initial and 1 000 m downscaled in the location of ground stations and ground measured sm data for warm and cold seasons was showed in table 2 the results showed that the similarity of measured sm and modeled swi at 1000 m scale was more than 10 000 m the mean value of the swi of the three study areas with spatial resolution of 10 000 and 1000 m in the geographical location of the ground stations for the warm cold season was 35 9 48 5 and 31 1 42 1 respectively the mean value of ground measured sm was 20 1 29 1 so that its difference with the mean value of swi in the spatial resolution of 1000 m was less than 10000 m for the warm season the sd of the swi values of the usa france and iran with a spatial resolution of 10 000 1000 m in the geographic location of the ground stations was 8 0 13 5 8 9 13 8 and 7 1 9 0 respectively these values for the cold season were 7 3 10 5 6 8 12 9 and 6 9 7 9 respectively by improving the spatial resolution of swi from 10000 m to 1000 m the sd of swi values increased and became closer to the sd of ground measured sm it means that the proposed method for swi downscaling is able to increase the swi map s accuracy and improve its spatial resolution to determine the model prediction certainty in the study areas the error values were calculated table 3 this evaluation method shows how far the modeled values are from the measured values small error values indicated that the modeled values were equal or close to the measured values the mean swi error of the usa france and iran at spatial resolution of 10 000 1000 m in warm season were 23 6 15 8 14 2 9 8 and 10 7 7 4 respectively these values for the cold season were 27 9 17 2 15 3 13 2 and 15 5 8 8 respectively the highest and lowest residual values were in the usa and iran respectively in the usa and 10 000 m spatial resolution at least 20 sample points had more than 30 error values while no sample point had more than 30 error values for modeled swi in 1000 m special resolution in french and 10 000 m spatial resolution more than five sample points had more than 15 error value while the residual value of all sample points in 1000 m was less than 15 in iran the maximum error values in 10 000 and 1000 m spatial resolutions were 16 and 11 respectively for warm season r2 rmse between measured sm values recorded at ground stations and swi with initial spatial resolution 10 000 m for the study areas of the usa france and iran were 0 12 25 1 0 14 15 6 and 0 15 12 2 respectively table 4 by improving the spatial resolution of swi to 1 000 m the values of r2 rmse for different study areas improved and reached to 0 42 17 2 0 52 11 2 and 0 40 7 9 respectively the r2 rmse between measured sm values recorded at ground stations and swi with improved spatial resolution of 30 m in france and iran were 0 78 7 9 and 0 68 6 5 respectively for cold season mean of r2 and rmse between measured sm and modeled swi in 10 000 m 1000 m and 30 m spatial resolutions were 0 10 0 39 0 67 and 20 7 14 3 7 2 respectively the results showed that by improving the spatial resolution of the initial swi based on the proposed model the swi accuracy was increased significantly due to limited access to ground station sm data quantitative evaluation of the improved 30 m swi was not performed in the usa sub area 5 discussion daily swi products derived from satellite imagery face the challenge of low spatial resolution therefore improving the spatial resolution of daily swi products obtained from satellite images is important in this study for the first time the spatial resolution of swi obtained from the satellite with a spatial resolution of approximately 10 000 m has been improved to 30 m the results show the high accuracy of the proposed model to improve spatial resolution the downscaling method presented in this study was able to well monitor the spatial variations of swi at higher spatial resolution fig 4 table 2 3 and 4 these results were in line with the findings of senanayake et al 2021 who showed that downscaling algorithms constructed using in situ data and time series images of a grid surface model with a resolution of 25 km despite their different spatial resolution can well provide robust swi monitoring methods the downscaled swi in 30 m spatial resolution better presented the swi spatial variation than original swi data which is in line with the findings of fang et al 2018 the accuracy of improving the spatial resolution of swi is affected by considering effective environmental parameters each of the environmental parameters can have a specific and different effect on the spatial distribution of swi in this study the effect of biophysical topographic and geographical features on swi modeling was evaluated for warm season the highest and lowest impact of environmental parameters on swi are related to biophysical lst and geographical longitude properties respectively for the cold season in swi modeling the degree of importance of topographic properties were greater than biophysical and geographical properties in previous studies it was shown that lst was the most effective parameter on the spatial distribution of swi fathololoumi et al 2022 huang et al 2016 in humid climates the effect of surface biophysical properties on swi is greater than topographic properties however in areas with hot and dry climates and mountains the effect of surface topographic properties on swi can be greater than the surface biophysical properties vegetation and moisture status also have a significant effect on the spatial distribution of swi the effect of latitude and longitude on the spatial distribution of swi in large areas can be clearer in small area the impact of these parameters is low most previous studies have used only the surface biophysical properties in the process of improving the spatial resolution of swi in this study it was shown that the surface topographic and geographical properties can also have a high degree of importance in the spatial variation of swi several other environmental parameters can also affect the spatial distribution of swi one of the reasons for the differences in modeling accuracy in different study areas may be related to the effect of soil properties including soil texture various studies have shown that different soil textures depending on whether they are fine or coarse can affect soil water holding capacity gholami bidkhani and mobasheri 2018 other soil properties such as salinity organic matter saturated conductivity field capacity wilting point etc can also affect the accuracy of swi modeling results in different areas fathololoumi et al 2021 sadeghi et al 2017 but not only the map of these parameters is not available for different areas but ground measurement of these parameters at large scale is time consuming and costly the used environmental parameters map should be able to be obtained from remote sensing data or other sources on the other hand the reason for using environmental parameters such as greenness imperviousness elevation slope aspect etc is considering the effect of soil physical characteristics in the swi modeling process indirectly also the influence of climatic parameters such as wind speed precipitation and snow can affect the swi value of a particular geographical location therefore considering these parameters in the process of improving the swi spatial resolution is useful in future studies improving swi spatial resolution based on the type of composite data is divided into two categories 1 a combination of active and passive microwave data chen et al 2018 fang et al 2018 fang et al 2020 gao et al 2020 and 2 a combination of visible and infrared data and microwave fathololoumi et al 2022 filion et al 2016 the advantage of the combination of active and passive microwave data is low sensitivity to cloud cover duan et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 although the possibility of using a wide range of surface properties as effective parameters in the process of improving the swi spatial resolution is an advantage of the strategy of combining visible infrared and microwave data this strategy is highly sensitive to cloud cover in this study the strategy of combining visible infrared and microwave data was used common models for improving swi spatial resolution are based on regression algorithms neural networks or physical methods regression methods are easier to implement than other methods the regression methods used to improve the spatial resolution of swi in previous studies are classified into univariate and multivariate groups either linear or nonlinear previous studies have shown that the use of rf in modeling the spatial resolution of swi can be useful and efficient fathololoumi et al 2021 however the black box of this model is one of its limitations and weaknesses hence details of the relationship between swi and effective environmental parameters based on the rf algorithm are not available therefore it is not possible to physically analyze and understand the type of impact of each of the environmental parameters affecting swi based on this algorithm one of the challenges in swi downscaling studies is the limitation of access to sm data recorded at ground stations with suitable conditions in terms of density and spatial distribution to assess improved swi accuracy 6 conclusion swi is a key variable in the study of land atmosphere interactions and is of great importance in many land based studies including agriculture hydrology and environmental sciences however improving the spatial resolution of swi obtained from satellite images is required the results show that the effect of each of the surface biophysical and topographic properties on swi is different among the set of environmental parameters lst sia had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of swi in warm cold season the impact of biophysical properties on the spatial variation of swi was greater than topographic and geographical parameters in warm season however in cold season the topographic parameters degree of importance was greater than biophysical and geographical parameters the proposed machine learning based model to improve the spatial resolution of swi was highly efficient the accuracy of the proposed model in swi downscaling in the warm season is more than in the cold season by improving the spatial resolution of swi the spatial patterns of areas with high moisture content are well modeled however in swi data with initial spatial resolution it is impossible to detect these moisture spatial patterns it is suggested that in future studies some soil related properties be evaluated in the modeling to improve the spatial resolution of swi the use of local strategies in calibrating swi spatial resolution models can be very useful credit authorship contribution statement solmaz fathololoumi conceptualization data curation formal analysis

interpret the genesis of nh4 the results show groundwater nh4 loadings range from 0 04 to 6 2 mg l with typically higher loadings along the coastline than in the plains elevated nh4 loadings 0 2 mg l

isotopic fingerprints and hydrochemical features indicate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra glucose fermentation methanogenesis acetate fermentation and sulfide oxidation or sulfate reduction the findings suggest acidic rainwater sulfide oxidation and no3 reduction by ferrous iron fe2 could jointly account for the formation of acidic groundwater ph as low as 4 0 that is of meteoric origin fermentative and sulfide driven dnra with anthropogenic no3 is notably responsible for the enrichment of groundwater nh4 concentrations with a minor contribution from anthropogenic nh4 infiltration and algae decomposition as a result of silicate and carbonate weathering seawater inputs and fermentation the addition of bicarbonate hco3 results in circumneutral ph values these results indicate dnra plays a critical role in the enrichment of nh4 and hence improve understanding of its genesis in the groundwater of beihai and other similar areas keywords ammonium coastal groundwater

k in minerals such as micas and k feldspar during metamorphism as well as exchange between adsorbed nh4 and dissolved cations could also regulate its aqueous concentrations hiscock et al 1991 sadofsky and bebout 2000 sasamoto et al 2018 nonetheless dissimilatory nitrate no3 reduction to ammonium dnra via fermentative and sulfide driven pathways may play an important role in the attenuation of aquatic no3 burgin and hamilton 2007 specifically electrons from the fermentation of organic matter om and sulfide oxidation can be enzymatically transferred to no3 reducing it to nh4 glucose and acetate are common fermentation products of om fenchel et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 reactive sulfides include free sulfide and iron sulfides burgin and hamilton 2007 given groundwater nh4 enrichment potentially linked to dnra coincides with co2 methanogenesis the relevant electron accepting half reactions are bethke et al 2011 1 8 e n o 3 10 h n h 4 3 h 2 o 2 8 e h c o 3 9 h c h 4 a q 3 h 2 o according to the thermodynamic ladder e g anderson and lovley 2002 bethke et al 2011 for dnra eq 1 the free energy change δg 297 kj mol is higher than mn iv and no3 reduction to n2 i e denitrification and lower than fe iii so4 2 and co2 reduction consequently dnra is the other prevailing process besides denitrification involved in microbial no3 reduction in groundwater under anaerobic conditions rivett et al 2008 no3 introduced to groundwater is usually considered to be anthropogenic and transports from up gradient parts e g recharge areas and phreatic aquifers to down gradient areas along flow paths hosono et al 2013 because chemical fertilizers are one of the main sources of anthropogenic no3 seasonal increases in groundwater no3 concentrations can also be associated with farming seasons hosono et al 2013 wu et al 2018 to the best of the author s knowledge few field studies have paid adequate attention to the potentially significant role played by dnra in the enrichment of groundwater nh4 the reason for the occurrence of nh4 in the coastal groundwater of beihai southern china is not clear a prevailing hypothesis is that high contents of pyrite fes2 and om as well as the occurrence of lignite layers in the strata would drive dnra in groundwater that contains no3 as a result of the infiltration of surface water that is contaminated with anthropogenic n species chen et al 2022 niu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 this study combines hydrochemical and isotopic δ15n in no3 and nh4 and δ13cdic investigations involving groundwater rainwater seawater and reservoir water samples from beihai to capture the potential peak groundwater no3 loadings linked to chemical fertilizer use the sampling campaign was conducted in october 2019 with the timing aligned with a 1 2 month lag after summer farming this lag was estimated on the basis of an infiltration rate of 0 6 m d and depths of 10 25 m below land surface bls for the phreatic aquifer china geological survey cgs 2022 the paper presents an overview of the hydrochemistry isotopic composition and distribution of nh4 concentrations discusses the genesis of the acidic groundwater quantifies fresh groundwater seawater mixing characterizes enrichment of nh4 and finally examines dnra along flow paths the main goals of the study were to determine the occurrence of groundwater nh4 and interpret its genesis focusing on dnra the results may bring new insights into the genesis of high nh4 groundwater and the approach could be applicable in future studies for a better understanding of groundwater

groundwater samples and two seawater samples were collected in october 2019 fig 1b five rainwater samples were collected between october 2019 and august 2020 one surface water sample s3 was collected

hydrochemical parameters ionic concentrations as well as δ15nno3 δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic values of the water samples are listed in table s1 of the supplementary data to explain the influence of seawater inputs and surficial contaminants the data are reported and discussed from coastline vs plain and phreatic vs confined aquifer perspectives respectively this is because the coastline areas are highly vulnerable to seawater intrusion and the phreatic aquifer is sensitive to surficial material infiltration ma et al 2020 the results show the groundwater is more anoxic along the coastline relative to the plains and has a ph that is typically acidic in the plains and near neutral along the coastline fig 2 a b it is saline with high sulfate so4 2 concentrations along the coastline and relatively high no3 concentrations in the plains and the phreatic aquifer fig 2c d e generally hydrochemical types are na cl along the coastline and na cl and ca na no3 cl in the plains fig 3 in addition to high tds and so4 2 the alkaline seawater samples have relatively high hco3 and low no3 and are characterized by na cl type water for the weakly acidic rainwater samples the types are ca na hco3 ca so4 no3 and na ca hco3 cl the reservoir sample contains high no3 groundwater δ15nno3 δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic values range from 3 2 to 7 4 4 0 to 8 0 and 20 2 to 4 2 respectively modestly higher δ15nno3 values occur in the phreatic aquifer than in the confined aquifers fig 4 a slightly lower δ15nnh4 values and higher δ13cdic values are often found along the coastline compared to the plains fig 4b c in relation to groundwater these values are typically higher for the seawater samples and lower for the rainwater samples 4 2 distribution of ammonium concentrations concentrations of nh4 are low relatively high and high in the seawater rainwater and reservoir samples respectively the world health organization who proposed that natural levels of nh4 in groundwater and surface water are usually 0 2 mg l who 2011 this value is accepted as the threshold of high nh4 groundwater in the present study in this view 32 of the sampled sites have high nh4 i e 0 2 mg l and mainly occur along the coastline fig 5 at depths of 10 136 m bls fig 6 aligning with the intermediate and deep confined aquifers fig 2f 5 discussion 5 1 genesis of acidic groundwater according to the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip database δ2h and δ18o values in the rainwater of nearby haikou fig 1a range from 95 3 to 5 8 n 59 and 12 76 to 0 42 respectively iaea wmo 2020 they exhibit strong seasonal variations with more depleted values in the wet season and display a linear regression equation i e the local meteoric water line lmwl of δ2h 7 5δ18o 6 2 r 2 0 93 the slope of the lmwl 7 5 is close to that of the global meteoric water line gmwl 8 craig 1961 such a slope reflects vapor that originates from evaporated oceanic water in the tropics and rains out when it cools appelo and postma 2005 an earlier investigation in the study area notes δ2h and δ18o values of 52 0 to 32 1 n 30 and 8 06 to 3 26 respectively for groundwater and 9 4 and 1 14 respectively for surface seawater li 2018 as shown in fig 7 a the grey dashed line polygon defined by the rainwater and seawater samples represents the ideal mixing area of these two endmembers ems the groundwater samples mostly lie on or along the lmwl suggesting the groundwater is principally of meteoric origin which is consistent with a previous argument zhang et al 2022 also the samples are commonly situated within or approach the rainwater seawater mixing area this indicates rainwater seawater mixing is mainly responsible for the groundwater h and o isotopic composition four groups are delineated in fig 7a generally comprised of samples from the plain group 1 coastline group 2 coastline intermediate confined group 3 and deep confined group 4 aquifers respectively relative to group 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of group 2 are closer to the seawater em which can be attributed to a greater contribution of seawater inputs to groundwater h and o isotopic ratios in group 2 the enrichment ratio δ2h δ18o of group 3 is 4 2 4 8 reflecting the infiltration of surface water affected by evaporation which induces an enrichment ratio of 5 craig 1961 group 4 displays enrichment ratios of 11 9 15 4 which may be related to old groundwater replenished by precipitation at historic lower temperatures craig 1961 acid rain has been an important environmental problem in south china during recent decades owing to large emissions of so2 nox and nh3 from coal combustion vehicle exhaust and volatilization of fertilizers and animal wastes to the atmosphere e g larssen et al 2006 liu et al 2017 although alkalinity resulting from weathering of carbonates and silicates in atmospheric dust neutralizes the acidity and buffers the ph of rainwater final ph values are commonly 5 5 in air polluted areas han et al 2011 kotowski et al 2020 for example in shenzhen and hong kong which are coastal cities of south china fig 1a the ph values of rainwater are 3 7 6 8 mean 4 4 n 59 with a volume weighted average of 4 2 respectively wai et al 2005 zhou et al 2019 in the nearby coastal city zhanjiang rainwater ph values typically range from 4 0 to 6 0 zhou et al 2007a for beihai rainwater ph values in this study of 6 3 6 4 are comparable to values of 5 6 6 5 mean 6 0 n 4 noted by zhou et al 2007b this evidence that the groundwater is of a meteoric origin suggests infiltration of acidic rainwater is one of the reasons for its acidity zhou et al 2006 however groundwater ph values lower than local rainwater indicate the presence of alternative pathways to balance the acidity budget notably sulfides e g fes2 that are common in the nn and qpz strata can be oxidized under aerobic conditions with the overall reaction moses et al 1987 3 f e s 2 15 4 o 2 7 2 h 2 o f e o h 3 2 s o 4 2 4 h from which fe2 is also produced as an intermediate product accordingly fes2 oxidation releases acidity to groundwater and thus could induce very acidic environments nordstrom et al 2000 this process is considered responsible for the lower groundwater ph values in the gwda river basin along the baltic coast poland kotowski and burkowska 2011 furthermore fe2 may react with no3 by the reaction hosono et al 2014 4 10 f e 2 2 n o 3 14 h 2 o 10 f e o o h n 2 18 h this reaction releases acidity to solution and may be another mechanism responsible for the acidic conditions however if excess fes2 is present fe2 will remain unoxidized as sulfide oxidation acquires more energy than fe2 oxidation appelo and postma 2005 in the na normalized ca2 vs mg2 plots fig 7b the ems of carbonates silicates and evaporites are illustrated after gaillardet et al 1999 the groundwater samples from the plains mostly situate within or along the silicate weathering domain and slightly approach the carbonate dissolution domain this indicates silicate weathering is largely responsible for the major elements present in groundwater in the plains with a minor contribution from carbonate dissolution the rainwater and reservoir samples have ratio characters similar with those of plains groundwater whereas lower mg2 na ratios that are comparable to seawater reflect silicates and carbonates in addition to sea salts in atmospheric dust the coastline samples cluster around the seawater samples which is ascribed to the strong influence of seawater inputs to the ionic composition of the groundwater in addition several groundwater samples from the plains have mg2 na ratios lower than seawater and ca2 na ratios lower than the evaporite em probably owing to the infiltration of domestic wastewater containing higher loadings of na derived from food salt usage overall the addition of hco3 as a result of water rock interactions eqs s1 s10 of the supplementary data buffers groundwater acidity and could result in alkaline ph values kotowski et al 2020 5 2 fresh groundwater seawater mixing for conservative mixing of seawater and fresh water the fraction of seawater f sea in the mixed water can be calculated using the concentration mmol l of conservative parameter cl appelo and postma 2005 5 f s e a c c l m i x c c l f r e s h c c l s e a c c l f r e s h where the subscripts mix fresh and sea indicate the

isotopic composition caused by reaction could be 9 δ δ i r e a c t δ i s a m p l e δ i m i x sample 84 intermediate confined groundwater from the plains has the lowest tds concentration of 44 mg l has an eh value of 525 7 mv and contains 7 9 mg l cl and so4 2 of 0 2 mg l and is thus assigned to represent the fresh water em accordingly f sea values are calculated to range from 0 0 to 89 9 with much higher values along the coastline mean 21 2 relative to the plains typically 0 3 this explains the much higher tds loadings and relatively high ph values and partially accounts for the higher so4 2 loadings in groundwater along the coastline than in the plains sulfate in the ocean sulfide in marine sediments and s in evaporite deposits are the major reservoirs for the global s cycle bottrell and newton 2006 accordingly seawater inputs and sulfide oxidation are deemed the principal sources of groundwater so4 2 considering there is no geological evidence for so4 2 evaporite occurrence in this region niu et al 2017 to identify other potential inputs of so4 2 a combined method of ca2 na molar ratios in conjunction with δ34s values fig 8 was used in this figure the ems of fertilizer gypsum domestic industrial wastewater and carbonates are after wu et al 2018 for the biogenic pyrite in guangxi and rainwater in shenzhen δ34s values are reported to range from 7 8 to 2 0 and 4 0 to 9 0 n 7 respectively yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2002 provided the nn lignite layers are interbedded in silicate matrix the ca2 na ratios of 0 02 to 0 06 for waters draining silicates gaillardet et al 1999 can be assigned to groundwater leaching fes2 ca2 na ratios are 0 29 to 1 37 for beihai rainwater in this study the triangle defined by rainwater pyrite and seawater indicate a ternary mixing system in which the dashed line represents ideal mixing of two ems the groundwater samples all lie within the triangle or along the mixing lines and are far away from the fertilizer and gypsum ems this shows seawater inputs fes2 oxidation and rainwater so4 2 significantly account for so4 2 loadings in the groundwater whereas the contributions of fertilizer and gypsum are negligible two samples from the plain intermediate confined aquifers have ca2 na ratios slightly approaching the wastewater em probably reflecting its minor contribution to the so4 2 loadings anyway as a result of water precipitation and wastewater rock interactions their contributions to groundwater ionic loadings can be incorporated into the fresh groundwater em in the fresh groundwater seawater mixing model hence samples with δcso4 react concentrations 0 00 and 0 00 mmol l are linked to 1 sulfide oxidation and 2 so4 2 reduction or gypsum formation respectively thermodynamic calculations indicate the saturation indices of gypsum are 5 6 to 0 6 suggesting groundwater is undersaturated with respect to this mineral sulfate reduction is therefore the sole process accounting for samples with δcso4 react values 0 00 mmol l sulfide oxidation induces increases in δcso4 react concentrations and decreases in ph values of groundwater apart from decreases in the concentrations so4 2 reduction leads to increases in groundwater alkalinity and ph values due to the addition of produced hco3 eqs s11 s12 seawater inputs cause increases in groundwater ph the trends in changes in ph values and δcso4 react concentrations associated with these processes are shown in fig 9 a majority of the groundwater samples have ph values lower than rainwater and 38 of them have δcso4 react values 0 00 mmol l indicating sulfide oxidation contributes to the formation of the acidic environments in the subsurface due to so4 2 reduction 41 of these samples have δcso4 react values 0 00 mmol l the very low ph values 5 0 are mostly found in samples containing 0 00 mmol l δcso4 react with higher no3 loadings and nh4 loadings 0 04 mg l in suboxic environments this is probably related to no3 reduction by fe2 eq 4 in bulk aquifers where the presence of fes2 is negligible owing to the heterogeneity of the media 5 3 characterizing the enrichment of ammonium concentrations the ideal fresh groundwater seawater mixing line is plotted in the cl vs so4 2 diagram fig 10 a based on the above geochemical constraints samples with elevated concentrations of nh4 0 2 mg l are delineated into two clusters in the figure cluster 1 with sample names in red is characterized by acidic to circumneutral ph values of 5 0 to 6 7 mean 5 9 n 7 and eh values ranging from 93 7 to 343 4 mv suggesting anoxic to suboxic conditions borch et al 2010 contributions of sulfide oxidation to so4 2 loadings calculated as positive δcso4 react cso4 are 5 4 to 84 8 mean 31 7 cluster 2 with sample names in green is also characterized by anoxic to suboxic conditions with eh values ranging from 88 9 to 368 1 mean 135 1 mv n 6 and ph values of 4 4 to 7 7 so4 2 reduction ratios calculated as negative δcso4 react cso4 are 3 6 to 71 1 mean 36 2 these hydrochemical characters indicate two redox processes 1 sulfide oxidation enhancing the formation of acidic groundwater with high so4 2 loadings and 2 hco3 derived from microbial so4 2 reduction buffering groundwater acidity and potentially bringing the ph values to near neutral fig 9 more importantly nh4 loading enrichment appears to be coupled with sulfide oxidation and so4 2 reduction s redox which can be ascribed to sulfide driven and fermentative dnra respectively in other words so4 2 reduction may relate to some sort of fermentation theoretically fermentation and methanogenesis have some overlap fermentation of sugar e g glucose produces acids e g acetate alcohols and gases e g co2 and h2 eq s13 zhou et al 2018 fermentation of acetate produces co2 and ch4 eq s14 also termed acetoclastic methanogenesis fenchel et al 2012 vincent et al 2021 co2 reduction also produces ch4 eq 2 borch et al 2010 thus the evidence of both so4 2 reduction and fermentation can be interpreted as reflecting the fermentation of glucose and acetate fueling so4 2 reduction as electron donors furthermore the δg of so4 2 reduction 150 kj mol is notably close to that of co2 methanogenesis 184 kj mol bethke et al 2011 suggesting these two processes could almost occur concurrently in a bulk aquifer from this perspective during microbial so4 2 reduction the fermentation of electron donors and the product sulfide can both thermodynamically drive dnra coincident with acetoclastic and co2 methanogenesis to some extent this is supported by the earlier finding that nh4 is mainly enriched at the methanogenesis stage in coastal confined groundwater of the pearl river delta south china du et al 2021 in c3 plant prevailing terrains soil co2 net δ13c values of 22 5 are expected boutton et al 1998 cerling et al 1991 wu et al 2018 the values for marine carbonates average 0 telmer and veizer 1999 depleted and enriched 13c in dic respectively demonstrate glucose fermentation and methanogenesis owing to preferential usage of the lighter 12c by the bacteria clark and fritz 1997 penger et al 2012 whiticar 1999 given the system is under anaerobic conditions δδ13cdic react values were calculated as δ13cdic sample δ13cdic mix eqs 8 9 in this silicate terrain silicate and carbonate weathering by soil co2 and h2co3 essentially produce the major elements in groundwater and thus result in a δδ13cdic react value of 0 similar to the seawater em dissolution of the minor carbonates by h2so4 and hno3 derived from sulfide oxidation and acid rain makes the value a little higher than 0 obviously methanogenesis and glucose fermentation induce increases and decreases in δδ13cdic react values respectively hco3 ca2 and mg2 produced from weathering of common silicates and carbonates by h2co3 exhibit a hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 0 eqs s1 s5 s8 mukherjee et al 2009 wu and wang 2014 dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and hno3 results in a ratio of 1 0 eqs s6 s7 s9 s10 wu et al 2018 the high mg2 and lower hco3 loadings of seawater make the ratio close to 0 co2 hco3 originating from fermentation of glucose and acetate and its reduction respectively result in a slight increase and decrease in the ratios eqs 2 s13 s14 in the δδ13cdic react value vs hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio plots fig 10b intermediate confined groundwater sample 27 from the plain fig 6 containing 13 3 mg l cl with a f sea of 0 0 is an alternative selection to represent the fresh water em as no δ13cdic value was measured for sample 84 samples in clusters 1 and 2 typically situate within the methanogenesis domain fig 10b this suggests nh4 enrichment is prominently due to dnra fueled by acetate fermentation and sulfide oxidation samples 40 and 14 under so4 2 reducing conditions lie within the glucose fermentation domain indicating dnra driven by glucose fermentation should also be taken into account 5 4 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium under anaerobic conditions no3 can be chemically reduced by fes2 and fe2 korom 1992 moses et al 1987 pedersen et al 1991 however chemical no3 reduction by fes2 is not observed in experimental studies schippers and jørgensen 2001 2002 furthermore the kinetics of this reaction in nature mean it is not considered to occur at significant rates postma et al 1991 for biotic nitrate reduction pathways dnra is mediated by microorganisms that are widely distributed in natural soils sediments fresh and marine waters and waste treatment systems tiedje 1988 dnra could be the dominant fate of no3 in terrestrial ecosystems and account for up to 92 9 of its reduction in aquatic environments e g cheng et al 2022 nie et al 2020 as mentioned above aside from dnra decomposition of animal and plant remains by fungi and bacteria often termed organic n mineralization is another source of nh4 in solution hiscock et al 1991 jiao et al 2010 lingle et al 2017 fractionation between the decomposed nh4 and organic n is small at 1 whereas that caused by nitrification of nh4 is large with enrichment factors of 12 to 29 making δ15nno3 much lower than δ15nnh4 kendall 1998 resulting from microbial nitrate reduction the heavy 15n is enriched in the residual no3 as microbes preferentially utilize the lighter 14n margalef marti et al 2021 as a consequence increases in groundwater δ15nno3 values occur due to kinetic isotope fractionation effects hosono et al 2014 algae are one of the principal organic n sources in marine sediments as they account for up to 90 of marine plants e g pérez alva et al 2022 inputs of alga remains into the aquifers during seawater intrusion can provide substrate for the fungi and bacteria to conduct organic n mineralization the δ15n values of amino acids for tetraselmis suecica in the sub tropical atlantic are reported to range from 7 8 to 1 8 mean 2 0 mcclelland and montoya 2002 in situ directly measured δ15n values for trichodesmium one of the predominant species in the south china sea are thought to be 1 5 to 0 brandes and devol 2002 thus δ15n values are accepted as 1 5 to 0 and 0 respectively in this study for algae derived nh4 and resultant no3 from its nitrification fig 11 a provided nh3 volatilization is suppressed in a confined aquifer the dnra bacteria preferentially use the lighter 14n and as a result the nh4 produced is enriched in 14n and has lower δ15n values than the precursor i e δ15nnh4 δ15nno3 owing to kinetic isotope fractionation effects accordingly a 1 1 trend line is assumed for dnra with respect to relationships between δ15n values of the precursor and product given this process increases groundwater δ15nno3 values the reservoir sample s3 with higher n loadings can be regarded as representative of anthropogenic nh4 and no3 hence it is found at the beginning of the dnra trend line for this sample the high δ15nnh4 value of 7 28 agrees with the reported δ15n values of human and animal waste 7 47 49 71 in china induced by the volatilization of 15n depleted nh3 and subsequent 15n enrichment in the residual nh4 xing et al 2001 xue et al 2009 its much lower δ15nno3 value 0 81 can be interpreted as reflecting the fractionation resulting from the nitrification of nh4 as mentioned above fig 11a illustrates that sample 40 is situated at the margin of the algae decomposition domain suggesting it is a source of nh4 in the groundwater such algae derived nh4 could mainly occur along the coastline where has been suffered from seawater intrusion accompanied by inputs of alga remains recalling this sample was also discussed with respect to fermentative dnra its elevated nh4 concentration can be attributed to both algae decomposition and fermentative dnra sample 13 displays a δ15nno3 value tracing nitrification of algae derived nh4 and a δ15nnh4 value moderately approaching that of the anthropogenic em which is related to mixing of the decomposition related and anthropogenic nh4 samples with elevated nh4 concentrations mostly fall below the dnra 1 1 trend line demonstrating dnra is largely responsible for the enrichment of groundwater nh4 samples 51 and 52 for example collected from private wells located within a vegetable plot and a nursery garden respectively are theoretically affected by anthropogenic n species however their higher δ15nno3 values and lower δ15nnh4 values as well as no3 concentrations of 0 1 mg l reflect the dnra process likewise samples 41 and 44 collected from the coastline phreatic aquifer which is susceptible to surficial contamination have no3 concentrations 0 3 mg l and values of δ15nno3 and δ15nnh4 that could also be the result of dnra sample 14 lies above the 1 1 trend line making it difficult to discern its nh4 genesis from this figure to address this problem combined use of δ15nno3 in conjunction with δδ13cdic react and δcso4 react shown in fig 11b and 11c respectively may be helpful to further differentiate nh4 sources on the basis of the hydrochemical and isotope geochemical constraints argued previously the contributions of dnra methanogenesis glucose and acetate fermentation algae decomposition as well as s redox are illustrated in fig 11b and 11c because groundwater carrying anthropogenic no3 flows from the plains to the coastline dnra can be examined along the flow paths assuming sample 27 with 6 4 mg l no3 is the initial point of flow this is consistent with the attenuation of groundwater no3 along the coastline relative to the plains accordingly the position of sample 27 relative to samples 5 and 17 provides evidence of joint dnra acetate fermentation and sulfate reduction which denote acetate fueled fermentative dnra accompanied by methanogenesis and sulfate reduction combined trends of dnra acetate fermentation and sulfide oxidation as indicated by the position of sample 27 relative to sample 2 indicate simultaneous fermentative and sulfide driven dnra similarly the positions of samples 27 and 14 implicate sulfide oxidation and glucose fermentation demonstrating concurrent sulfide driven and fermentative dnra in contrast no change in δ15nno3 values are observed for samples 31 and 32 compared to sample 27 however in relation to the anthropogenic em they have notable increases in δ15nno3 values and decreases in δ15nnh4 values which implicate dnra therefore as demonstrated by their higher δcso4 react concentrations a dominant sulfide oxidizing environment is conducive to sulfide driven dnra likewise for sample 12 the methanogenesis character is probably indicative of dnra driven by acetate fermentation which is the reason for its elevated nh4 concentration the addition of hco3 from silicate and carbonate weathering seawater inputs and fermentation explains why nh4 is enriched in circumstances with circumneutral ph values under favorable geochemical conditions 6 conclusions this study reports the occurrence of high concentrations of nh4 in the coastal acidic groundwater of beihai and interprets its genesis using hydrochemical data and values of δ15nno3 δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic this study featured the combined use of δ15nno3 vs δ15nnh4 δδ13cdic react and δcso4 react plots as well as a cl concentration based fresh groundwater seawater mixing model to address this issue the combined effect of acidic rainwater oxidation of sulfides e g pyrite and no3 reduction by fe2 may be responsible for the formation of the acidic groundwater with ph values as low as 4 0 nh4 concentrations in the groundwater range from 0 04 to 6 2 mg l with 32 of the sampled sites having concentrations above 0 2 mg l the concentrations are typically higher along the coastline than in the plains enrichment of nh4 is significantly induced by dnra of anthropogenic no3 with a minor contribution from the infiltration of anthropogenic nh4 and algae decomposition dnra is fueled by fermentation of acetate and glucose and or sulfide oxidation which often simultaneously take place the addition of hco3 resulting from silicate and carbonate weathering seawater inputs and fermentation can increase the groundwater ph values to near neutral these findings emphasize the prominent role of dnra in the genesis of high nh4 groundwater in beihai and other similar areas which can threaten ecological safety

2713,high levels of ammonium nh4 in groundwater can threaten the health of surface ecosystems and the safety of water supplies to ascertain the occurrence of nh4 in the coastal acidic groundwater of beihai southern china a combined hydrochemical and isotopic δ15n in nitrate no3 and nh4 δ13c in dissolved inorganic carbon dic study was performed in addition to a chloride concentration based fresh water seawater mixing model δ15nno3 vs δ15nnh4 δδ13cdic react changes in δ13cdic values caused by reaction and δcso4 react changes in sulfate concentrations caused by reaction were applied to interpret the genesis of nh4 the results show groundwater nh4 loadings range from 0 04 to 6 2 mg l with typically higher loadings along the coastline than in the plains elevated nh4 loadings 0 2 mg l are commonly accompanied by enriched δ15nno3 and depleted δ15nnh4 values in relation to the anthropogenic endmember depleted or enriched δδ13cdic react values and δcso4 react 0 00 or 0 00 mmol l such isotopic fingerprints and hydrochemical features indicate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra glucose fermentation methanogenesis acetate fermentation and sulfide oxidation or sulfate reduction the findings suggest acidic rainwater sulfide oxidation and no3 reduction by ferrous iron fe2 could jointly account for the formation of acidic groundwater ph as low as 4 0 that is of meteoric origin fermentative and sulfide driven dnra with anthropogenic no3 is notably responsible for the enrichment of groundwater nh4 concentrations with a minor contribution from anthropogenic nh4 infiltration and algae decomposition as a result of silicate and carbonate weathering seawater inputs and fermentation the addition of bicarbonate hco3 results in circumneutral ph values these results indicate dnra plays a critical role in the enrichment of nh4 and hence improve understanding of its genesis in the groundwater of beihai and other similar areas keywords ammonium coastal groundwater dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium beihai data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction high levels of groundwater ammonium nh4 in porewater systems e g fluvial marine alluvial lacustrine and glacial drift aquifers in many parts of the world are thought to threaten both the health of surface ecosystems via water quality deterioration and eutrophication due to groundwater discharge as well as the safety of water supplies du et al 2020 2021 jiao et al 2010 liang et al 2022 lingle et al 2017 mastrocicco et al 2013 norrman et al 2015 sasamoto et al 2018 scheiber et al 2016 previous studies often claim high levels of nh4 in the groundwater are geogenic with enrichment mainly due to microbially mediated mineralization of natural organic n jiao et al 2010 lingle et al 2017 mastrocicco et al 2013 norrman et al 2015 more recently this pathway has been observed to occur during the methanogenesis stage as evidenced by enriched 13c in dissolved inorganic carbon dic present in groundwater du et al 2020 du et al 2021 other studies at least partially ascribe elevated concentrations of nh4 in groundwater to surficial anthropogenic inputs such as domestic and industrial wastewater irrigation manure and chemical fertilizers liang et al 2022 mao et al 2022 mora et al 2022 wells et al 2016 moreover nh4 adsorption on solid phases substitution for k in minerals such as micas and k feldspar during metamorphism as well as exchange between adsorbed nh4 and dissolved cations could also regulate its aqueous concentrations hiscock et al 1991 sadofsky and bebout 2000 sasamoto et al 2018 nonetheless dissimilatory nitrate no3 reduction to ammonium dnra via fermentative and sulfide driven pathways may play an important role in the attenuation of aquatic no3 burgin and hamilton 2007 specifically electrons from the fermentation of organic matter om and sulfide oxidation can be enzymatically transferred to no3 reducing it to nh4 glucose and acetate are common fermentation products of om fenchel et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 reactive sulfides include free sulfide and iron sulfides burgin and hamilton 2007 given groundwater nh4 enrichment potentially linked to dnra coincides with co2 methanogenesis the relevant electron accepting half reactions are bethke et al 2011 1 8 e n o 3 10 h n h 4 3 h 2 o 2 8 e h c o 3 9 h c h 4 a q 3 h 2 o according to the thermodynamic ladder e g anderson and lovley 2002 bethke et al 2011 for dnra eq 1 the free energy change δg 297 kj mol is higher than mn iv and no3 reduction to n2 i e denitrification and lower than fe iii so4 2 and co2 reduction consequently dnra is the other prevailing process besides denitrification involved in microbial no3 reduction in groundwater under anaerobic conditions rivett et al 2008 no3 introduced to groundwater is usually considered to be anthropogenic and transports from up gradient parts e g recharge areas and phreatic aquifers to down gradient areas along flow paths hosono et al 2013 because chemical fertilizers are one of the main sources of anthropogenic no3 seasonal increases in groundwater no3 concentrations can also be associated with farming seasons hosono et al 2013 wu et al 2018 to the best of the author s knowledge few field studies have paid adequate attention to the potentially significant role played by dnra in the enrichment of groundwater nh4 the reason for the occurrence of nh4 in the coastal groundwater of beihai southern china is not clear a prevailing hypothesis is that high contents of pyrite fes2 and om as well as the occurrence of lignite layers in the strata would drive dnra in groundwater that contains no3 as a result of the infiltration of surface water that is contaminated with anthropogenic n species chen et al 2022 niu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 this study combines hydrochemical and isotopic δ15n in no3 and nh4 and δ13cdic investigations involving groundwater rainwater seawater and reservoir water samples from beihai to capture the potential peak groundwater no3 loadings linked to chemical fertilizer use the sampling campaign was conducted in october 2019 with the timing aligned with a 1 2 month lag after summer farming this lag was estimated on the basis of an infiltration rate of 0 6 m d and depths of 10 25 m below land surface bls for the phreatic aquifer china geological survey cgs 2022 the paper presents an overview of the hydrochemistry isotopic composition and distribution of nh4 concentrations discusses the genesis of the acidic groundwater quantifies fresh groundwater seawater mixing characterizes enrichment of nh4 and finally examines dnra along flow paths the main goals of the study were to determine the occurrence of groundwater nh4 and interpret its genesis focusing on dnra the results may bring new insights into the genesis of high nh4 groundwater and the approach could be applicable in future studies for a better understanding of groundwater

groundwater samples and two seawater samples were collected in october 2019 fig 1b five rainwater samples were collected between october 2019 and august 2020 one surface water sample s3 was collected

hydrochemical parameters ionic concentrations as well as δ15nno3 δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic values of the water samples are listed in table s1 of the supplementary data to explain the influence of seawater inputs and surficial contaminants the data are reported and discussed from coastline vs plain and phreatic vs confined aquifer perspectives respectively this is because the coastline areas are highly vulnerable to seawater intrusion and the phreatic aquifer is sensitive to surficial material infiltration ma et al 2020 the results show the groundwater is more anoxic along the coastline relative to the plains and has a ph that is typically acidic in the plains and near neutral along the coastline fig 2 a b it is saline with high sulfate so4 2 concentrations along the coastline and relatively high no3 concentrations in the plains and the phreatic aquifer fig 2c d e generally hydrochemical types are na cl along the coastline and na cl and ca na no3 cl in the plains fig 3 in addition to high tds and so4 2 the alkaline seawater samples have relatively high hco3 and low no3 and are characterized by na cl type water for the weakly acidic rainwater samples the types are ca na hco3 ca so4 no3 and na ca hco3 cl the reservoir sample contains high no3 groundwater δ15nno3 δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic values range from 3 2 to 7 4 4 0 to 8 0 and 20 2 to 4 2 respectively modestly higher δ15nno3 values occur in the phreatic aquifer than in the confined aquifers fig 4 a slightly lower δ15nnh4 values and higher δ13cdic values are often found along the coastline compared to the plains fig 4b c in relation to groundwater these values are typically higher for the seawater samples and lower for the rainwater samples 4 2 distribution of ammonium concentrations concentrations of nh4 are low relatively high and high in the seawater rainwater and reservoir samples respectively the world health organization who proposed that natural levels of nh4 in groundwater and surface water are usually 0 2 mg l who 2011 this value is accepted as the threshold of high nh4 groundwater in the present study in this view 32 of the sampled sites have high nh4 i e 0 2 mg l and mainly occur along the coastline fig 5 at depths of 10 136 m bls fig 6 aligning with the intermediate and deep confined aquifers fig 2f 5 discussion 5 1 genesis of acidic groundwater according to the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip database δ2h and δ18o values in the rainwater of nearby haikou fig 1a range from 95 3 to 5 8 n 59 and 12 76 to 0 42 respectively iaea wmo 2020 they exhibit strong seasonal variations with more depleted values in the wet season and display a linear regression equation i e the local meteoric water line lmwl of δ2h 7 5δ18o 6 2 r 2 0 93 the slope of the lmwl 7 5 is close to that of the global meteoric water line gmwl 8 craig 1961 such a slope reflects vapor that originates from evaporated oceanic water in the tropics and rains out when it cools appelo and postma 2005 an earlier investigation in the study area notes δ2h and δ18o values of 52 0 to 32 1 n 30 and 8 06 to 3 26 respectively for groundwater and 9 4 and 1 14 respectively for surface seawater li 2018 as shown in fig 7 a the grey dashed line polygon defined by the rainwater and seawater samples represents the ideal mixing area of these two endmembers ems the groundwater samples mostly lie on or along the lmwl suggesting the groundwater is principally of meteoric origin which is consistent with a previous argument zhang et al 2022 also the samples are commonly situated within or approach the rainwater seawater mixing area this indicates rainwater seawater mixing is mainly responsible for the groundwater h and o isotopic composition four groups are delineated in fig 7a generally comprised of samples from the plain group 1 coastline group 2 coastline intermediate confined group 3 and deep confined group 4 aquifers respectively relative to group 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of group 2 are closer to the seawater em which can be attributed to a greater contribution of seawater inputs to groundwater h and o isotopic ratios in group 2 the enrichment ratio δ2h δ18o of group 3 is 4 2 4 8 reflecting the infiltration of surface water affected by evaporation which induces an enrichment ratio of 5 craig 1961 group 4 displays enrichment ratios of 11 9 15 4 which may be related to old groundwater replenished by precipitation at historic lower temperatures craig 1961 acid rain has been an important environmental problem in south china during recent decades owing to large emissions of so2 nox and nh3 from coal combustion vehicle exhaust and volatilization of fertilizers and animal wastes to the atmosphere e g larssen et al 2006 liu et al 2017 although alkalinity resulting from weathering of carbonates and silicates in atmospheric dust neutralizes the acidity and buffers the ph of rainwater final ph values are commonly 5 5 in air polluted areas han et al 2011 kotowski et al 2020 for example in shenzhen and hong kong which are coastal cities of south china fig 1a the ph values of rainwater are 3 7 6 8 mean 4 4 n 59 with a volume weighted average of 4 2 respectively wai et al 2005 zhou et al 2019 in the nearby coastal city zhanjiang rainwater ph values typically range from 4 0 to 6 0 zhou et al 2007a for beihai rainwater ph values in this study of 6 3 6 4 are comparable to values of 5 6 6 5 mean 6 0 n 4 noted by zhou et al 2007b this evidence that the groundwater is of a meteoric origin suggests infiltration of acidic rainwater is one of the reasons for its acidity zhou et al 2006 however groundwater ph values lower than local rainwater indicate the presence of alternative pathways to balance the acidity budget notably sulfides e g fes2 that are common in the nn and qpz strata can be oxidized under aerobic conditions with the overall reaction moses et al 1987 3 f e s 2 15 4 o 2 7 2 h 2 o f e o h 3 2 s o 4 2 4 h from which fe2 is also produced as an intermediate product accordingly fes2 oxidation releases acidity to groundwater and thus could induce very acidic environments nordstrom et al 2000 this process is considered responsible for the lower groundwater ph values in the gwda river basin along the baltic coast poland kotowski and burkowska 2011 furthermore fe2 may react with no3 by the reaction hosono et al 2014 4 10 f e 2 2 n o 3 14 h 2 o 10 f e o o h n 2 18 h this reaction releases acidity to solution and may be another mechanism responsible for the acidic conditions however if excess fes2 is present fe2 will remain unoxidized as sulfide oxidation acquires more energy than fe2 oxidation appelo and postma 2005 in the na normalized ca2 vs mg2 plots fig 7b the ems of carbonates silicates and evaporites are illustrated after gaillardet et al 1999 the groundwater samples from the plains mostly situate within or along the silicate weathering domain and slightly approach the carbonate dissolution domain this indicates silicate weathering is largely responsible for the major elements present in groundwater in the plains with a minor contribution from carbonate dissolution the rainwater and reservoir samples have ratio characters similar with those of plains groundwater whereas lower mg2 na ratios that are comparable to seawater reflect silicates and carbonates in addition to sea salts in atmospheric dust the coastline samples cluster around the seawater samples which is ascribed to the strong influence of seawater inputs to the ionic composition of the groundwater in addition several groundwater samples from the plains have mg2 na ratios lower than seawater and ca2 na ratios lower than the evaporite em probably owing to the infiltration of domestic wastewater containing higher loadings of na derived from food salt usage overall the addition of hco3 as a result of water rock interactions eqs s1 s10 of the supplementary data buffers groundwater acidity and could result in alkaline ph values kotowski et al 2020 5 2 fresh groundwater seawater mixing for conservative mixing of seawater and fresh water the fraction of seawater f sea in the mixed water can be calculated using the concentration mmol l of conservative parameter cl appelo and postma 2005 5 f s e a c c l m i x c c l f r e s h c c l s e a c c l f r e s h where the subscripts mix fresh and sea indicate the conservative mixture fresh water and seawater respectively for an ion i the seawater fraction and concentrations in seawater and fresh water can be used to determine its concentration ci arising from ideal seawater fresh water mixing 6 c i m i x f s e a c i s e a 1 f s e a c i f r e s h if ion i is nonconservative any change in concentration caused by the reaction δci react is 7 δ c i r e a c t c

without other inputs gu 2011 zhu et al 2019 the isotopic composition δ of ion i caused by mixing can be expressed as 8 δ i m i x f s e a δ i s e a 1 f s e a δ i f r e s h accordingly any change in isotopic composition caused by reaction could be 9 δ δ i r e a c t δ i s a m p l e δ i m i x sample 84 intermediate confined groundwater from the plains has the lowest tds concentration of 44 mg l has an eh value of 525 7 mv and contains 7 9 mg l cl and so4 2 of 0 2 mg l and is thus assigned to represent the fresh water em accordingly f sea values are calculated to range from 0 0 to 89 9 with much higher values along the coastline mean 21 2 relative to the plains typically 0 3 this explains the much higher tds loadings and relatively high ph values and partially accounts for the higher so4 2 loadings in groundwater along the coastline than in the plains sulfate in the ocean sulfide in marine sediments and s in evaporite deposits are the major reservoirs for the global s cycle bottrell and newton 2006 accordingly seawater inputs and sulfide oxidation are deemed the principal sources of groundwater so4 2 considering there is no geological evidence for so4 2 evaporite occurrence in this region niu et al 2017 to identify other potential inputs of so4 2 a combined method of ca2 na molar ratios in conjunction with δ34s values fig 8 was used in this figure the ems of fertilizer gypsum domestic industrial wastewater and carbonates are after wu et al 2018 for the biogenic pyrite in guangxi and rainwater in shenzhen δ34s values are reported to range from 7 8 to 2 0 and 4 0 to 9 0 n 7 respectively yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2002 provided the nn lignite layers are interbedded in silicate matrix the ca2 na ratios of 0 02 to 0 06 for waters draining silicates gaillardet et al 1999 can be assigned to groundwater leaching fes2 ca2 na ratios are 0 29 to 1 37 for beihai rainwater in this study the triangle defined by rainwater pyrite and seawater indicate a ternary mixing system in which the dashed line represents ideal mixing of two ems the groundwater samples all lie within the triangle or along the mixing lines and are far away from the fertilizer and gypsum ems this shows seawater inputs fes2 oxidation and rainwater so4 2 significantly account for so4 2 loadings in the groundwater whereas the contributions of fertilizer and gypsum are negligible two samples from the plain intermediate confined aquifers have ca2 na ratios slightly approaching the wastewater em probably reflecting its minor contribution to the so4 2 loadings anyway as a result of water precipitation and wastewater rock interactions their contributions to groundwater ionic loadings can be incorporated into the fresh groundwater em in the fresh groundwater seawater mixing model hence samples with δcso4 react concentrations 0 00 and 0 00 mmol l are linked to 1 sulfide oxidation and 2 so4 2 reduction or gypsum formation respectively thermodynamic calculations indicate the saturation indices of gypsum are 5 6 to 0 6 suggesting groundwater is undersaturated with respect to this mineral sulfate reduction is therefore the sole process accounting for samples with δcso4 react values 0 00 mmol l sulfide oxidation induces increases in δcso4 react concentrations and decreases in ph values of groundwater apart from decreases in the concentrations so4 2 reduction leads to increases in groundwater alkalinity and ph values due to the addition of produced hco3 eqs s11 s12 seawater inputs cause increases in groundwater ph the trends in changes in ph values and δcso4 react concentrations associated with these processes are shown in fig 9 a majority of the groundwater samples have ph values lower than rainwater and 38 of them have δcso4 react values 0 00 mmol l indicating sulfide oxidation contributes to the formation of the acidic environments in the subsurface due to so4 2 reduction 41 of these samples have δcso4 react values 0 00 mmol l the very low ph values 5 0 are mostly found in samples containing 0 00 mmol l δcso4 react with higher no3 loadings and nh4 loadings 0 04 mg l in suboxic environments this is probably related to no3 reduction by fe2 eq 4 in bulk aquifers where the presence of fes2 is negligible owing to the heterogeneity of the media 5 3 characterizing the enrichment of ammonium concentrations the ideal fresh groundwater seawater mixing line is plotted in the cl vs so4 2 diagram fig 10 a based on the above geochemical constraints samples with elevated concentrations of nh4 0 2 mg l are delineated into two clusters in the figure cluster 1 with sample names in red is characterized by acidic to circumneutral ph values of 5 0 to 6 7 mean 5 9 n 7 and eh values ranging from 93 7 to 343 4 mv suggesting anoxic to suboxic conditions borch et al 2010 contributions of sulfide oxidation to so4 2 loadings calculated as positive δcso4 react cso4 are 5 4 to 84 8 mean 31 7 cluster 2 with sample names in green is also characterized by anoxic to suboxic conditions with eh values ranging from 88 9 to 368 1 mean 135 1 mv n 6 and ph values of 4 4 to 7 7 so4 2 reduction ratios calculated as negative δcso4 react cso4 are 3 6 to 71 1 mean 36 2 these hydrochemical characters indicate two redox processes 1 sulfide oxidation enhancing the formation of acidic groundwater with high so4 2 loadings and 2 hco3 derived from microbial so4 2 reduction buffering groundwater acidity and potentially bringing the ph values to near neutral fig 9 more importantly nh4 loading enrichment appears to be coupled with sulfide oxidation and so4 2 reduction s redox which can be ascribed to sulfide driven and fermentative dnra respectively in other words so4 2 reduction may relate to some sort of fermentation theoretically fermentation and methanogenesis have some overlap fermentation of sugar e g glucose produces acids e g acetate alcohols and gases e g co2 and h2 eq s13 zhou et al 2018 fermentation of acetate produces co2 and ch4 eq s14 also termed acetoclastic methanogenesis fenchel et al 2012 vincent et al 2021 co2 reduction also produces ch4 eq 2 borch et al 2010 thus the evidence of both so4 2 reduction and fermentation can be interpreted as reflecting the fermentation of glucose and acetate fueling so4 2 reduction as electron donors furthermore the δg of so4 2 reduction 150 kj mol is notably close to that of co2 methanogenesis 184 kj mol bethke et al 2011 suggesting these two processes could almost occur concurrently in a bulk aquifer from this perspective during microbial so4 2 reduction the fermentation of electron donors and the product sulfide can both thermodynamically drive dnra coincident with acetoclastic and co2 methanogenesis to some extent this is supported by the earlier finding that nh4 is mainly enriched at the methanogenesis stage in coastal confined groundwater of the pearl river delta south china du et al 2021 in c3 plant prevailing terrains soil co2 net δ13c values of 22 5 are expected boutton et al 1998 cerling et al 1991 wu et al 2018 the values for marine carbonates average 0 telmer and veizer 1999 depleted and enriched 13c in dic respectively demonstrate glucose fermentation and methanogenesis owing to preferential usage of the lighter 12c by the bacteria clark and fritz 1997 penger et al 2012 whiticar 1999 given the system is under anaerobic conditions δδ13cdic react values were calculated as δ13cdic sample δ13cdic mix eqs 8 9 in this silicate terrain silicate and carbonate weathering by soil co2 and h2co3 essentially produce the major elements in groundwater and thus result in a δδ13cdic react value of 0 similar to the seawater em dissolution of the minor carbonates by h2so4 and hno3 derived from sulfide oxidation and acid rain makes the value a little higher than 0 obviously methanogenesis and glucose fermentation induce increases and decreases in δδ13cdic react values respectively hco3 ca2 and mg2 produced from weathering of common silicates and carbonates by h2co3 exhibit a hco3 ca2 mg2 molar ratio of 2 0 eqs s1 s5 s8 mukherjee et al 2009 wu and wang 2014 dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and hno3 results in a ratio of 1 0 eqs s6 s7 s9 s10 wu et al 2018 the high mg2 and lower hco3 loadings of seawater make the ratio close to 0 co2 hco3 originating from fermentation of glucose and acetate and its reduction respectively result in a slight increase and decrease in the ratios eqs 2 s13 s14 in the δδ13cdic react value vs hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio plots fig 10b intermediate confined groundwater sample 27 from the plain fig 6 containing 13 3 mg l cl with a f sea of 0 0 is an alternative selection to represent the fresh water em as no δ13cdic value was measured for sample 84 samples in clusters 1 and 2 typically situate within the methanogenesis domain fig 10b this suggests nh4 enrichment is prominently due to dnra fueled by acetate fermentation and sulfide oxidation samples 40 and 14 under so4 2 reducing conditions lie within the glucose fermentation domain indicating dnra driven by glucose fermentation should also be taken into account 5 4 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium under anaerobic conditions no3 can be chemically reduced by fes2 and fe2 korom 1992 moses et al 1987 pedersen et al 1991 however chemical no3 reduction by fes2 is not observed in experimental studies schippers and jørgensen 2001 2002 furthermore the kinetics of this reaction in nature mean it is not considered to occur at significant rates postma et al 1991 for biotic nitrate reduction pathways dnra is mediated by microorganisms that are widely distributed in natural soils sediments fresh and marine waters and waste treatment systems tiedje 1988 dnra could be the dominant fate of no3 in terrestrial ecosystems and account for up to 92 9 of its reduction in aquatic environments e g cheng et al 2022 nie et al 2020 as mentioned above aside from dnra decomposition of animal and plant remains by fungi and bacteria often termed organic n mineralization is another source of nh4 in solution hiscock et al 1991 jiao et al 2010 lingle et al 2017 fractionation between the decomposed nh4 and organic n is small at 1 whereas that caused by nitrification of nh4 is large with enrichment factors of 12 to 29 making δ15nno3 much lower than δ15nnh4 kendall 1998 resulting from microbial nitrate reduction the heavy 15n is enriched in the residual no3 as microbes preferentially utilize the lighter 14n margalef marti et al 2021 as a consequence increases in groundwater δ15nno3 values occur due to kinetic isotope fractionation effects hosono et al 2014 algae are one of the principal organic n sources in marine sediments as they account for up to 90 of marine plants e g pérez alva et al 2022 inputs of alga remains into the aquifers during seawater intrusion can provide substrate for the fungi and bacteria to conduct organic n mineralization the δ15n values of amino acids for tetraselmis suecica in the sub tropical atlantic are reported to range from 7 8 to 1 8 mean 2 0 mcclelland and montoya 2002 in situ directly measured δ15n values for trichodesmium one of the predominant species in the south china sea are thought to be 1 5 to 0 brandes and devol 2002 thus δ15n values are accepted as 1 5 to 0 and 0 respectively in this study for algae derived nh4 and resultant no3 from its nitrification fig 11 a provided nh3 volatilization is suppressed in a confined aquifer the dnra bacteria preferentially use the lighter 14n and as a result the nh4 produced is enriched in 14n and has lower δ15n values than the precursor i e δ15nnh4 δ15nno3 owing to kinetic isotope fractionation effects accordingly a 1 1 trend line is assumed for dnra with respect to relationships between δ15n values of the precursor and product given this process increases groundwater δ15nno3 values the reservoir sample s3 with higher n loadings can be regarded as representative of anthropogenic nh4 and no3 hence it is found at the beginning of the dnra trend line for this sample the high δ15nnh4 value of 7 28 agrees with the reported δ15n values of human and animal waste 7 47 49 71 in china induced by the volatilization of 15n depleted nh3 and subsequent 15n enrichment in the residual nh4 xing et al 2001 xue et al 2009 its much lower δ15nno3 value 0 81 can be interpreted as reflecting the fractionation resulting from the nitrification of nh4 as mentioned above fig 11a illustrates that sample 40 is situated at the margin of the algae decomposition domain suggesting it is a source of nh4 in the groundwater such algae derived nh4 could mainly occur along the coastline where has been suffered from seawater intrusion accompanied by inputs of alga remains recalling this sample was also discussed with respect to fermentative dnra its elevated nh4 concentration can be attributed to both algae decomposition and fermentative dnra sample 13 displays a δ15nno3 value tracing nitrification of algae derived nh4 and a δ15nnh4 value moderately approaching that of the anthropogenic em which is related to mixing of the decomposition related and anthropogenic nh4 samples with elevated nh4 concentrations mostly fall below the dnra 1 1 trend line demonstrating dnra is largely responsible for the enrichment of groundwater nh4 samples 51 and 52 for example collected from private wells located within a vegetable plot and a nursery garden respectively are theoretically affected by anthropogenic n species however their higher δ15nno3 values and lower δ15nnh4 values as well as no3 concentrations of 0 1 mg l reflect the dnra process likewise samples 41 and 44 collected from the coastline phreatic aquifer which is susceptible to surficial contamination have no3 concentrations 0 3 mg l and values of δ15nno3 and δ15nnh4 that could also be the result of dnra sample 14 lies above the 1 1 trend line making it difficult to discern its nh4 genesis from this figure to address this problem combined use of δ15nno3 in conjunction with δδ13cdic react and δcso4 react shown in fig 11b and 11c respectively may be helpful to further differentiate nh4 sources on the basis of the hydrochemical and isotope geochemical constraints argued previously the contributions of dnra methanogenesis glucose and acetate fermentation algae decomposition as well as s redox are illustrated in fig 11b and 11c because groundwater carrying anthropogenic no3 flows from the plains to the coastline dnra can be examined along the flow paths assuming sample 27 with 6 4 mg l no3 is the initial point of flow this is consistent with the attenuation of groundwater no3 along the coastline relative to the plains accordingly the position of sample 27 relative to samples 5 and 17 provides evidence of joint dnra acetate fermentation and sulfate reduction which denote acetate fueled fermentative dnra accompanied by methanogenesis and sulfate reduction combined trends of dnra acetate fermentation and sulfide oxidation as indicated by the position of sample 27 relative to sample 2 indicate simultaneous fermentative and sulfide driven dnra similarly the positions of samples 27 and 14 implicate sulfide oxidation and glucose fermentation demonstrating concurrent sulfide driven and fermentative dnra in contrast no change in δ15nno3 values are observed for samples 31 and 32 compared to sample 27 however in relation to the anthropogenic em they have notable increases in δ15nno3 values and decreases in δ15nnh4 values which implicate dnra therefore as demonstrated by their higher δcso4 react concentrations a dominant sulfide oxidizing environment is conducive to sulfide driven dnra likewise for sample 12 the methanogenesis character is probably indicative of dnra driven by acetate fermentation which is the reason for its elevated nh4 concentration the addition of hco3 from silicate and carbonate weathering seawater inputs and fermentation explains why nh4 is enriched in circumstances with circumneutral ph values under favorable geochemical conditions 6 conclusions this study reports the occurrence of high concentrations of nh4 in the coastal acidic groundwater of beihai and interprets its genesis using hydrochemical data and values of δ15nno3 δ15nnh4 and δ13cdic this study featured the combined use of δ15nno3 vs δ15nnh4 δδ13cdic react and δcso4 react plots as well as a cl concentration based fresh groundwater seawater mixing model to address this issue the combined effect of acidic rainwater oxidation of sulfides e g pyrite and no3 reduction by fe2 may be responsible for the formation of the acidic groundwater with ph values as low as 4 0 nh4 concentrations in the groundwater range from 0 04 to 6 2 mg l with 32 of the sampled sites having concentrations above 0 2 mg l the concentrations are typically higher along the coastline than in the plains enrichment of nh4 is significantly induced by dnra of anthropogenic no3 with a minor contribution from the infiltration of anthropogenic nh4 and algae decomposition dnra is fueled by fermentation of acetate and glucose and or sulfide oxidation which often simultaneously take place the addition of hco3 resulting from silicate and carbonate weathering seawater inputs and fermentation can increase the groundwater ph values to near neutral these findings emphasize the prominent role of dnra in the genesis of high nh4 groundwater in beihai and other similar areas which can threaten ecological safety

2714,the annual rainfall amount over gangetic west bengal is predominantly determined by monsoon june to september and pre monsoon march to may rain events consequently such seasonal precipitation is directly linked to the socio economic advancement of the area in this paper some characteristics of pre monsoon rainfall over a tropical urban location kolkata have been explored utilizing ground based observations pre monsoon rainfall over kolkata is characterized by convective rain events and thunderstorms mostly occurring from afternoon to night 15 30 ist 21 30 ist span emphasis has been given to the set in time of pre monsoon rain events based upon which they are classified as expected 14 30 ist 18 30 ist and delayed after 18 30 ist efforts have been made to assess the sustaining atmospheric conditions in terms of temperature water vapour liquid water content and instability parameter associated with such rain events prevailing over two non overlapping time spans of pre monsoon season the mean diurnal variations of integrated water vapour iwv liquid water path lwp and instability parameter namely convective available potential energy cape during the expected and delayed rain event dates show distinct intensity in the increasing trends prior to the respective rainfall peaks it has been observed that for the delayed events the temperature difference between ground and 2000 m altitude begins to fall at a later part of the evening in comparison with the expected ones overall the investigated parameters exhibited distinguishable nature of variations for the two classes of rain events over the study location keywords pre monsoon rainfall diurnal variation liquid water content water vapour cloud depth convective available potential energy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction spatio temporal variability of rainfall has an extensive impact on the earth s hydrological cycle circulation model as well as global climatic change rao et al 2020 nischitha et al 2013 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 the characteristics and occurrence probability of natural disasters like floods droughts and tropical cyclones are profoundly influenced by the space time diversity of global rainfall patterns huang et al 2018 diurnal variability of rainfall over a location is predominantly controlled by atmospheric parameters processes and geographical characteristics pertaining to that region zhao et al 2019 varikoden et al 2012 basu 2007 singh and nakamura 2009 singh and kumar 1997 consequently scientific knowledge about the temporal variance of rainfall is significant for short term weather forecasting diurnal cycles of rainfall over different portions of the world had already been analyzed in a number of studies bechtold et al 2004 collier and bowman 2004 dai 2001 hara et al 2009 hara et al 2014 hu 2003 li et al 2004 deshpande and goswami 2014 gao et al 2002 barros and lang 2003 ueno et al 2001 buytaert et al 2006 tabari and talaee 2011 yu et al indicated that the early morning peak mainly corresponds to long duration rainfall events lasting longer than 6 h whereas the late afternoon peak was mainly due to rainfall events lasting less than 3 h yu et al 2007 terrain induced local circulations are found to be one of the causes of late night and early morning rainfalls barros et al 2000 barros et al 2004 bhatt and nakamura 2005 singh et al 2005 nakamura and singh 2009 kuwagataet al 2001 lang and barros 2002 however an afternoon to early evening rainfall is quite common and more likely than late night to early morning peak ueno et al 2001 ohsawa et al 2001 barros et al 2000 the research on diurnal rainfall variations over india had been started a few decades back bhattacharya and bhattacharyy 1980 harlar et al 1991 nakamura and nakamura 2005 sahany et al 2010 singh and nakamura 2010 subrahmanyam et al 2015 however most of these studies reported the monsoon rainfall features from central india or the himalayan foothill region within the indian territory heavy rainfall during the night and early morning hours in the monsoon period has been reported bhattacharya and bhattacharyya 1980 over north bengal halder et al 1991 suggestedthat the effects of the mesoscale topography and the drift of thunderstorms are the reasons for the diurnal variation of precipitation over central india during the monsoon period the diurnal precipitation characteristics around the indian himalayan region had been observed using level 3 3b42 tmpa precipitation product derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite data bhatt and nakamura 2005 afternoon to evening precipitation were found as embedded convection over the location sahany et al 2010 also observed the diurnal variation using trmm data they showed three peaks of diurnal rainfall at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 ist over the bay of bengal which is located very close to kolkata and its surrounding region singh and nakamura observed the peak of diurnal variation of rainfall during the afternoon period 15 18 ist from trmm observations subrahmanyam et al 2015 reported a positive relationship between the diurnal variation of convective available potential energy cape and precipitation over the indian summer monsoon region it has been reported by several authors that maximum rainfall occurs during the late afternoon hours of the indian summer monsoon over the indian land mass nesbitt and zipser 2003 basu 2007 senroy and sen roy 2011 rajeevan et al 2012 the precipitation characteristics study is very much important in india as it shows significant seasonal and inter annual variations the monsoon rainfall is mainly characterized by stratiform rain there are many studies on the characteristics of monsoon rainfall over india as mentioned earlier on the other hand pre monsoon rainfall is mostly associated with localized convective phenomena and predominantly connected to local variabilities of atmospheric parameters the pre monsoon rainfall plays a significant role in determining the total rainfall of the year bera 2017 pre monsoon rainfall is also a determining factor in the inter annual variation of monsoon rainfall ghosh et al 2018 kolkata is located near the land ocean boundary on the verge of the tropics as a consequence of the flow of land sea breeze convective phenomena are very likely over kolkata during the pre monsoon period sadhukhan et al 2000 over a tropical urban location like kolkata and its surroundings the study of pre monsoon rainfall characteristics is thus quite significant most of the studies of diurnal variation of precipitation over india have been performed using trmm data products in the present study the diurnal precipitation characteristics and association with atmospheric parameters have been investigated using two ground based instruments a disdrometer and a radiometer the level 3 3b42 tmpa precipitation product derived from trmm satellite dataof spatial precipitation patterns encompassing the kolkata region has also been evidenced kolkata 22 34 n 88 29 e experiences appreciable rainfall during the monsoon june september and the pre monsoon april may seasons of the year though the monsoon rainfall has a major contribution to the annual rainfall occurring in kolkata pre monsoon rainfall still plays a significant role in determining the total rainfall of the year chakraborty and das 2021 the convective rainfall during the pre monsoon period in kolkata is known as nor westers which are localized thunderstorms along with medium to heavy precipitation a previous study reported that maximum pre monsoon rainfall occurs during the afternoon period over the tropical land masses hirose and nakamura 2005 however the observation was based upon trmm pr satellite of a few convective events over india from march to may of the years 1998 2003 the spatio temporal variation of asian precipitation systems had been investigated through the diurnal rainfall variability to identify the topographical impact on the rainfall regime determination the lack of accurate precipitation records often acts as a hindrance to carry out such studies on an elaborate basis in the present study atmospheric conditions and parameters associated with nor westers have been investigated to analyze their comparable and contrasting patterns in connection with the temporal shifting of the rainfall events from afternoon to late evening period during the pre monsoon days over the tropical urban location kolkata the urban agglomeration of kolkata at the verge of the tropics in the indian state of west bengal kindled the scope of diurnal precipitation research at the particular locus the diurnal cycle of rainfall not only exhibits distinguishable characteristics over the tropical lands and oceans but is also found to be more prominent over the landmass gray and jacobson 1977 kolkata being located near the land ocean boundary becomes a specialized location for the investigation of diurnal precipitation variability 2 experimental measurements and data the disdrometer and radiometer observations are collocated at the roof top of the institute of radio physics and electronics of the university of calcutta at kolkata 22 34 n 88 29 e these data sets are location specific and not available in the public domain however the trmm rainfall data can be obtained from the modis giovanni site 2 1 disdrometer data in the present study joss waldvogel disdrometer jwd observations have been utilized to obtain rain related information namely rain rate and rain accumulation over kolkata for a total span of seven years 2010 2016 this impact type disdrometer measures raindrop size distributions in 20 individual size intervals spreading over 0 359 mm to 5 5 mm with a sampling rate of 30 s the accuracy of jwd is 5 the jwd consists of a styrofoam cone with a cross sectional area of 50 cm2 joss and waldvogel 1969 joss and waldvogel 1977 impacting precipitations over the conical styrofoam produces a mechanical impulse such that the cone along with two attached coils move downwards and consequently a voltage is induced in a sensing coil the amplified form of this electrical impulse provides the measure of the impacting precipitation size the rain rate can be calculated from the recorded drop size distribution dsd data at every 30 s sampling time 2 2 radiometer data the multi frequency rpg hatpro radiometer rose and czekala 2009 placed on the rooftop of the institute of radio physics and electronics measures brightness temperatures brts at 14 different frequency channels spreading over two disjoint frequency bands having the frequency ranges of 22 24 31 40 ghz and 51 59 ghz for the retrieval of atmospheric parameters the radiometer was trained with 1500 radiosonde profiles over kolkata statistical regression models between meteorological data along with the corresponding brightness temperatures in different channels and data from temperature pressure and humidity sensors within the instrument have been used to estimate liquid water path lwp and other atmospheric parameters from radiometric measurements rose and czekala 2009 chakraborty and maitra 2016 de et al 2017 rpg hatpro obtains the cloud base height by measuring the cloud base temperature with an infrared radiometer attached to rpg hatpro and then comparing it with the temperature profile of the atmosphere the cloud thickness is taken up to the height where relative humidity exceeds 95 rose and czekala 2009 chakraborty and maitra 2016 the 60 ghz oxygen absorption line is typically used for temperature profiling from the weighting functions corresponding to the various oxygen line profiling frequencies the vertical profile of the temperature has been derived the archived radiometric data of atmospheric parameters namely integrated water vapour iwv liquid water content cloud depth and also instability parameter like convective available potential energy cape rose and czekala 2009 karstens simmer and ruprecht 1994 de et al 2017 of the period 2011 2013 have been utilized in the present study 2 3 trmm observations the spatial precipitation patterns encompassing the kolkata region have been studied using trmm 3 hourly high quality precipitation data https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni the trmm data product consists of trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rainfall estimate product 3b42 version 7 v7 which merges satellite rainfall estimates s with gauge data g the 3b42 algorithm first combines microwave precipitation estimates from multiple low earth orbiting satellites and then calibrates the trmm microwave imager precipitation tmi trmm product 2a12 and trmm combined instrument precipitation tci trmm product 2b31 these all products are merged to produce a 3 hourly microwave only best estimate the infrared precipitation estimates from multiple geosynchronous satellites are then calibrated to the microwave estimate and used to fill in the regional gaps in the merged microwave field to produce a combined satellite rainfall estimate every 3 h these 3 hourly combined satellite estimates are then summed to the monthly scale and re calibrated with a monthly precipitation gauge analysis to provide the final sg merged precipitation estimate as a level 3 l3 3 hourly 0 25 x 0 25 quasi global 50 ns gridded sg rainfall database the 3 hourly 3b42 data is stored in eight files per day at 00 utc 03 utc 06 utc etc it extends a 3 hourly 0 25 x 0 25 gridded database since 1997 toulier et al 2019 fernández et al 2016 huffman et al 2007 huffman et al 2010 3 variability of pre monsoon rain over kolkata the pre monsoon and monsoon rain characteristics over kolkata exhibit distinguishable features owing to their rudimentary rainfall formation physics here all the pre monsoon rain events of the individual years 2010 2016 have been considered to calculate the hourly accumulation mm over the study location the box plots in fig 1 represent the year to year variability of the hourly accumulation for the pre monsoon and monsoon season for the period 2010 2016 on each box the central mark is the median the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points the algorithm considers to be not outliers and the outliers are plotted individually as a sign in fig 1 we have considered all the pre monsoon fig 1a and monsoon fig 1b rain events of the individual years 2010 2016 to calculate the hourly accumulation mm over the study location it is quite evident from the figure that the diurnal variation of monsoon accumulation besides being predominant over that of the pre monsoon does not show such significant diurnal variability as that of the pre monsoon thus the diurnal variation of monsoon rainfall in contrast with pre monsoon rainfall over kolkata does not show any remarkable diversification the pre monsoon accumulation dominantly prevails over the afternoon to night period after 14 30 ist of 2010 2016 fig 1a the strong insolation during the hot summer days prompts the nor westers to occur during the afternoon and early evening gupta and sen 1952 however in kolkata significant occurrences of thunderstorms accompanied by quite intense rainfall activities can be observed during the late evening and night hours 20 30 22 30 ist accordingly in the box plot of hourly rain accumulation in fig 1a two rainfall peaks are prominently present at two different times of the day at 16 30 ist and another at 20 30 ist during the pre monsoon season the pre monsoon rain events are anticipated to set in during the afternoon to evening hours due to its characteristic nature as well as the underlying development process but the present study evidenced a considerable number of rain events deferring from the usual commencement time fig 1a consequently depending on their start time these pre monsoon rain events are classified into two types the rain events which started within the afternoon to early evening 14 30 ist 18 30 ist span are considered as expected events the rain events having start time within 18 30 ist 22 30 ist are termed as delayed events in the present study moreover the delayed events are so chosen that they do not have any expected events occurring that day the terms expected and delayed are particularly indicative of the start time of rain events occurring at the study location during the pre monsoon months march to may pre monsoon rainfall in kolkata being mostly set in due to local convection is mostly localized in nature and consequently exhibits year to year variability the statistical distribution of diurnal accumulation mm is evaluated on the basis of all the individual years of the 7 years 2010 2016 and has been shown in fig 2 the relative occurrence of expected and delayed events at kolkata can be observed in fig 2a in which the number of events of the two types namely expected and delayed is depicted for the span of years 2010 2016 it can be noted that the delayed events are predominant over the expected events in most of the years fig 2a the yearly variations of total accumulation of the expected and the delayed events have been demonstrated in fig 2b furthermore the average accumulations for expected and delayed events have also been evaluated and shown in fig 2c it is found that the average accumulations of the delayed events are not only comparable to that of the expected events but tend to exceed the precipitation of the expected ones occasionally the typical diurnal variability of accumulation prevailing over kolkata may be indicative of the dissimilar climatological characteristic associated with an urban location in order to explore such a possibility the spatial distributions of precipitation over kolkata the urban location and its surroundings along with the surrounding semi urban or rural location have been studied utilizing the 3 hourly trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rainfall estimate product 3b42 version 7 v7 fig 3 demonstrates an expected time event occurring at the study location on 31 may 2011 the time variations of the event as observed through the disdrometer data of the study location and the trmm observation are shown in fig 3a and b respectively the spatial distribution of the event during 17 30 ist is depicted in fig 3c it is evident from the trmm observations in fig 3c that during the expected hours 17 30 ist in the present case the rainfall signature is discernible in kolkata 22 34 n 88 29 e and near by locations during expected hours the pre monsoon rainfall is found to occur over the metropolitan portion as well as the surrounding non urban portions of the spatial illustration fig 3d f illustrates another set of observations for an expected event on 23 april 2013 such outcomes are indicative of the natural manifestation of the pre monsoon rain event similar observations have been carried out for two delayed events on 5 april 2012 fig 4 a d and 19 may 2013 fig 4e h in this case the spatial observations during the expected hours 17 30 ist evidenced the presence of precipitation beyond the outskirts of kolkata fig 4c and g however the delayed hours 20 30 ist map demonstrated rainfall signatures over the metropolitan stretch and its nearby locations fig 4d and h such dissimilar coverage of rainfall instances during the expected versus the delayed hours may be an obvious consequence of the associated atmospheric impact on the local convection development process over kolkata and its semi urban outskirt the spatial distribution of rain is illustrated over a 3 3 lat long area however the spread of the metropolitan city kolkata is only about 1 0 5 latitude wise 22 15 to 23 5 n longitude wise 88 2 to 88 32 e thus fig 3c and f fig 4c and f and fig 4d and h encompass the urban extent of kolkata along with its non urban surroundings as compared to the corresponding disdrometer data the decreased amount of rainfall observed through the trmm observations is due to the spatio temporal averaging of the grid data the illustrations showing the absence and presence of rainfall in and around kolkata region during expected 17 30 ist and delayed 20 30 ist hours respectively infer that the occurrence of delayed pre monsoon events may be a characteristic of urban climatology han et al 2014 niyogi et al 2017 the underlying cause may be the fact that urban locations are prone to anthropogenic carbon pollution leading to suppression of convection during expected hours recent studies have reported black carbon aerosols warm up the upper pbl with a higher heating rate ding et al 2016 and cause a significant decrease in the lower tropospheric temperature lapse rate talukdar et al 2019 this may cause a decrease in the convective available potential energy in the atmosphere and eventually can restrict the normal updraft or convection of moist air talukdar et al 2019 the carbon pollution is significantly associated with metropolitan transportation and industrialization the consequence is also reflected through the spatial map plots of the expected and delayed events in figs 3 and 4 the variations of associated atmospheric parameters during the expected and delayed hours may further help to reveal the fundamental reason for such delayed occurrence of pre monsoon events for further analysis of the pre monsoon rain events occurring over kolkata case studies of two such events expected and delayed have been chosen to inspect the associated variation of atmospheric parameters like rain drop size distribution dsd iwv lwp and cape figs 5 and 6 respectively demonstrate an expected event on 23 april 2013 and a delayed event on 19 may 2013 in the expected event rainfall sets in at about 17 00 ist whereas in the delayed event rain commences at about 18 54 ist fig 5a 6a and 5b 6b depict the dsd and rain rate variation respectively pertaining to the expected delayed event the maximum rain rates being around 40 mm h and 45 mm h respectively the expected and delayed events belong to the same rain rate class as far as the dsd is concerned as discernible in the respective rain dsd the later phase after 20 00 ist of the delayed event exhibits the presence of significantly larger diameter even 2 5 mm rain drops for quite a low rain rate value 1 5 mm h however such low intensity rain continues up to almost 2 5 h such an elongated period of low intensity rain is not evident in the expected event fig 5a the time variations of cape iwv and lwp values corresponding to the event on 23 april 2013 are demonstrated in fig 5c e fig 6c e for delayed events respectively the values of all three parameters are found to be higher in the case of the delayed event the excess amount of the associated parameters may be responsible for the long trailing low intensity rain with the presence of significantly larger diameter rain drops for the respective rain rate class usually the strong updraft associated with higher values of cape is responsible for a higher probability of coalescence than break up during the fall of rain drop from the cloud base adhikari et al 2017 consequently larger rain drops are quite probable in the ground observation for comparatively low intensity rain as evident in the case of the delayed event the height profiles of temperature variation fig 7 a and b of the two mentioned events up to the height of 2000 m are further analyzed to probe into the prevailing atmospheric conditions prior to and during the rain events occurring at two different time slots of pre monsoon season the contours depict a slower diurnal variation of temperature on 19 may 2013 in comparison to 23 april 2013 for the event on 19 may fig 7b the ground temperature is 304 k for a longer period 10 ist 18 ist however for the event on 23 april the ground temperature is around 300 k for 10 ist 16 ist fig 7a the ground temperature is thus found to be higher as well as sustained for a longer period of the day on 19 may 2013 fig 7b moreover the higher altitudes up to boundary layer height 2000 m exhibit higher temperature during 19 may 2013 than 23 april 2013 fig 7a and b the fact is also evident in the plots of temperature difference shown in fig 7c the sharp changes in temperature at 17 ist and 19 ist in fig 7a and b respectively are the consequences of the incidences of rain events within the specified periods the precipitation during the mentioned period led to a 3 4 k fall in the ground to boundary level 2 km from ground level temperature difference fig 7c the set in time of the respective events are indicated by the dashed vertical lines in fig 7c the larger deviation of temperature along the vertical height fig 7c on 23 april 2013 may be accountable for setting up rain within expected hours of pre monsoon days as a consequence of fully developed convection in the next section the average picture of the relative variations of associated atmospheric parameters like iwv lwp ratio of iwv to lwp and temperature profile up to the height of boundary layer 2000 m have been investigated in connection with such two expected and delayed sets of pre monsoon rain events during 2011 2013 as both the ground based observations from the disdrometer and radiometer measurements are concurrently available during the mentioned study period 4 diurnal variations of atmospheric parameters diurnal variations of atmospheric parameters like lwp iwv cloud depth and temperature have been discussed in this section in bearing relevance to expected and delayed rain events during pre monsoon season over kolkata the hourly average values of iwv and lwp have been estimated from concurring radiometric measurements iwv indicates the total amount of water vapour present in the vertical atmospheric column and lwp denotes the total amount of liquid water in the unit vertical column through the atmosphere in general higher lwp results in a greater amount of rainfall ye et al 2014 fujita and tomonori 2017 the diurnal variations of iwv and lwp associated with each category of rain events namely expected and delayed are demonstrated in fig 8 a and b respectively time variation of the parameters can be treated as a precursor to an upcoming rain event bhattacharya et al 2011 the lwp shows peaks exceeding 1500 g m2 value at around 15 30 ist for expected and around 18 30 ist for delayed precipitation respectively fig 8b however while monitored for the delayed events iwv exhibits insignificant variations before and during the expected hours 14 30 18 30 ist of pre monsoon rain events fig 8a in order to further explore the influence of the two parameters iwv and lwp in causing precipitation during expected or delayed hours of the pre monsoon days the ratio of iwv to lwp has also been examined and demonstrated in fig 8c this ratio may be indicative of the relative impact of iwv and lwp in causing rainfall consequently the smaller ratio values denote a higher concentration of lwp for the concurring iwv thereby pointing towards the atmospheric condition when a significant fraction of water vapour has already been converted into liquid water content now as reflected from the ratio variations for the expected events the ratio started to fall after 14 45 ist and encountered a 53 fall to reach a dip at 16 30 ist fig 8c the peak expected accumulation at 16 30 ist as evident in fig 1a complies with such hydrological conversion procedure however such falls in case of the delayed events started a bit later at 15 00 ist and predominantly continued to fall up to 17 30 ist the iwv to lwp ratio for the delayed set of events experienced a total fall of about 83 6 during this decaying stage and continued to be at a low level for the next 1 h the higher fall of the iwv to lwp ratio for the delayed events may be responsible for causing a significant precipitation peak at 20 30 ist as found to be present in fig 1a and also manifested through the delayed accumulation for 2011 2013 in fig 2b on the other hand in the morning period high ratio value for the delayed events implies the dominance of water vapour over concurring lwp the prevailing atmospheric conditions in the morning period may not be suitable to convert the water vapour content into a significant amount of lwp and thereby restraining the rainfall occurrence for the delayed events after 20 00 ist the ratio values start to increase for both expected and delayed events fig 8c which actually indicates depletion of lwp from the atmosphere and thereby weakening the probability of further precipitation cloud depth is considered to be another important factor having a close association with precipitation the cloud base height data along with the extent of liquid water profile lpr information have been utilized to estimate the cloud depth over the study location de et al 2017 the cloud depth variations have been observed for both the expected and delayed pre monsoon events the distinguishable variation patterns of cloud depth values for expected and delayed events have been demonstrated in fig 9 a and b through box plots here in fig 9a and b firstly all the delayed and expected events pertaining to the span 2011 2013 are separately identified and the respective cloud depth variations had been tracked for all the individual events the hourly average cloud depths had been evaluated for the entire day 24 h of the events for expected events the cloud depth shows the highest value 372 m at 16 30 ist after which it starts decaying however for delayed events the cloud depth shows multiple peak values 200 m when compared the cloud depth peaks are found not to be concurrent with the peak lwp values as demonstrated in fig 8b particularly for the delayed events as a matter of fact though the cloud depth is high but due to the probable lack of sufficient liquid water content within the cloud precipitation did not set in furthermore for better exposition fig 9c depicts the mean cloud depth variation of all the expected and delayed events of 2011 2013 the association of the two parameters namely cloud depth and lwp in resulting precipitation at two different periods expected and delayed hours of the pre monsoon days the ratio of lwp to cloud depth has been evaluated fig 9d the ratio is indicative of the concentration of liquid water content within the cloud as illustrated in fig 9c the cloud depth for the expected events reached its post afternoon peak at about 17 ist after which it followed a sharp fall to become null at 20 ist the lwp to cloud depth ratio indicative of liquid water concentration within the cloud for the expected events in fig 9d showed the maximum value 30 kg m3 at about 17 30 ist during which the corresponding mean cloud depth as depicted in fig 9c was 100 m on the contrary the delayed events had more than one peak mean cloud depth during the post afternoon period with a day long average of about 200 m moreover the post afternoon mean cloud depths remained above 150 m up to 22 30 ist the peak of the lwp to cloud depth ratio for the delayed events in fig 9d is found to be evident at 21 ist along with a mean cloud depth 200 m as depicted in fig 9c this is a delayed manifestation of the maximum parametric value for the delayed events as compared to the expected ones the uncertainty of multiple cloud depth peaks as discernible in fig 9c has been resolved through the variation of the mentioned ratio fig 9d the ratio shows distinct variation for the expected and delayed pre monsoon events fig 9d thus it is evident from the study that high lwp values with appreciable cloud depths result in substantial rainfall not during the anticipated hours as is true for the expected events but during delayed time spans of the pre monsoon months now it is quite expected that temperature will play an important role in the formation as well as the maturity of convective processes ogura and phillips 1962 manabe and strickler 1964 ncei report 2020 o gorman and schneider 2008 muller et al 2011 usually precipitation extremes are found to increase as the atmosphere becomes warmer ogura and phillips 1962 manabe and strickler 1964 moreover the height profile of the temperature is anticipated to be of decreasing nature with increasing height from the ground level men et al in 2020 reported a long term investigation of temperature variability and its impact on precipitation over the beijing tianjin hebei region the study depicted a decreasing trend of precipitation with increasing temperature over a period of 50 years in the present study the temperature difference between the boundary layer 2 km from ground level and the ground level has been analyzed for expected and delayed events fig 10 a it has been observed that the temperature difference begins to fall from 13 30 ist for expected events and 15 30 ist for delayed events it is also notable that the delayed events on average took almost an additional 2 h time span to reach the same temperature however the differences are greater during the first half of the pre monsoon days in the case of expected events as compared to the delayed events the fall of temperature difference may be due to two reasons either an increase in ground temperature or an increase in boundary layer temperature for expected and delayed events for above mentioned times thus the ground temperature variation has further been explored in fig 10b the ground temperature has been found to reach and maintain a higher level above 300 k up to about 20 00 ist in case of the delayed events and the ground level takes almost 3 hrs additional time for the delayed events to reach the same temperature as that of the expected events the result implies that the convective systems are tending to get matured in the later part of the day for the delayed events lenderink and meijgaard 2008 lenderink and meijgaard 2010 in comparison to the expected events in order to further dig into the diurnal variations of prevailing atmospheric conditions in connection with the two sets of rain events namely expected and delayed the variability of cape convective available potential energy has been additionally examined during the respective occurrence days the following section represents the elaborate investigation of this topic 5 diurnal variation of instability parameter the variation of the instability parameter like convective available potential energy cape is quite random in nature thus 15 min average values of this parameter have been considered for analysis cape is the amount of energy a parcel of air would acquire if lifted a certain distance vertically from the free convection level fcl to the equilibrium level el through the atmosphere cape effectively indicates the amount of atmospheric instability rose and czekala 2009 karstens et al 1994 de et al 2017 and can be estimated as 1 c a p e z n z f g t v p a r c e l t v e n v t v e n v d z where z f is the height of the level of free convection fcl and z n is the height of the equilibrium level el t v parcel is the virtual temperature of the specific parcel t v env is the virtual temperature of the environment and g is the acceleration due to gravity in fig 11 the peak cape values are observed within 16 30 18 30 ist for expected time events and between 18 30 20 30 ist for delayed time events it is usually expected that cape will be higher just before any convective event holley et al 2014 done et al 2006 zimmer et al 2011 for expected events the cape values start rising from 14 ist to reach above 400 at two different time slots first being 14 30 ist to 14 45 ist and second at 15 30 ist within the anticipated hours of nor wester related rain events the cape value for the delayed events became just 100 but below 150 at about 15 45 ist and 17 15 ist within the anticipated hours of nor wester related rain events however the cape index of the delayed events starts being significant 300 from 17 45 ist the cape value reaches the peak 480 at around 19 ist in case of the delayed events which may in turn cause considerable precipitation during the delayed hours of pre monsoon days as established from the results obtained from the present study a 15 minute average cape of 400 is quite substantial for setting in convective rain associated with the nor westers in comparison to a lower value moreover the subsidiary alteration of the temperature difference prevailing in between the ground level and boundary level 2 km may further play a substantial role in manifesting lower cape values during the expected hours of the delayed events the study indicates discernibly distinct patterns of variation of different atmospheric parameters before and during the rain events occurring during the expected and delayed hours of the pre monsoon months the observations thus divulge the diversity of pre monsoon rain at the study location 6 conclusion the study reveals the features of pre monsoon rain in association with different atmospheric parameters over a tropical location kolkata utilizing concurring disdrometer and radiometric measurements the following observations have been made from the study i in the pre monsoon season it is noticeable that the precipitation exhibits two different peaks at 16 30 ist and 20 30 ist based on which the rain events are categorized as expected 14 30 ist 18 30 ist and delayed after 18 30 ist events the yearly study reveals that the number of delayed events is mostly greater compared to the expected ones the long term occurrence of such features may lead toa modification of the hydrological cycle prevailing over this location ii as evident from the spatial distributions of precipitation over kolkata and its surrounding region utilizing the 3 hourly trmm 3b42 version 7 rainfall data for expected and delayed events the occurrence of delayed pre monsoon events may be a characteristic of urban climatology iii the two sets of rain events expected and delayed in the pre monsoon season have been observed in relation to different atmospheric parameters namely iwv lwp cloud depth and temperature the mean diurnal variation of iwv and lwp during the expected and delayed rain event dates shows discernible increasing trends prior to the respective rainfall peaks the ratio of iwv to lwp has also been observed as an indicator of subsequent rainfall the considerable fall of the iwv to lwp ratio results in significant precipitation in the case of the delayed events as compared with the expected ones furthermore the ratio of lwp to cloud depth shows distinct variations for the expected and delayed pre monsoon events and they are found to be quite significant in causing the subsequent rainfall in two different periods of the pre monsoon days iv it has been observed that for the delayed events the temperature difference between ground and 2000 m altitude begins to fall at a later part of the evening in comparison with the expected ones also the ground level temperature pertaining to the delayed events is found to exhibit 1 k higher values than the expected ones during the expected hours of pre monsoon days such a characteristic may be responsible for deferring the maturity of convective systems at later parts of the day for the delayed events in comparison to the expected ones v the variations of cape for both types namely expected and delayed of rain events are discernibly distinct and crucial in triggering the precipitation during the expected and delayed hours of the pre monsoon days such study on diurnal variations of pre monsoon rain along with the distinguishable variability of associated atmospheric parameters is really sparse over tropical urban locations like kolkata the observations of this study highlight some of the unique features of tropical rain during the pre monsoon period long term as well as multi station investigations on such topics may be helpful in improving future rain prediction and global circulation models the existing study can also be extended to explore the probable impact of aerosol environment on the seasonal or annual rainfall variability at urban locations and thereby leading to an associated climatic change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2714,the annual rainfall amount over gangetic west bengal is predominantly determined by monsoon june to september and pre monsoon march to may rain events consequently such seasonal precipitation is directly linked to the socio economic advancement of the area in this paper some characteristics of pre monsoon rainfall over a tropical urban location kolkata have been explored utilizing ground based observations pre monsoon rainfall over kolkata is characterized by convective rain events and thunderstorms mostly occurring from afternoon to night 15 30 ist 21 30 ist span emphasis has been given to the set in time of pre monsoon rain events based upon which they are classified as expected 14 30 ist 18 30 ist and delayed after 18 30 ist efforts have been made to assess the sustaining atmospheric conditions in terms of temperature water vapour liquid water content and instability parameter associated with such rain events prevailing over two non overlapping time spans of pre monsoon season the mean diurnal variations of integrated water vapour iwv liquid water path lwp and instability parameter namely convective available potential energy cape during the expected and delayed rain event dates show distinct intensity in the increasing trends prior to the respective rainfall peaks it has been observed that for the delayed events the temperature difference between ground and 2000 m altitude begins to fall at a later part of the evening in comparison with the expected ones overall the investigated parameters exhibited distinguishable nature of variations for the two classes of rain events over the study location keywords pre monsoon rainfall diurnal variation liquid water content water vapour cloud depth convective available potential energy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction spatio temporal variability of rainfall has an extensive impact on the earth s hydrological cycle circulation model as well as global climatic change rao et al 2020 nischitha et al 2013 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 the characteristics and occurrence probability of natural disasters like floods droughts and tropical cyclones are profoundly influenced by the space time diversity of global rainfall patterns huang et al 2018 diurnal variability of rainfall over a location is predominantly controlled by atmospheric parameters processes and geographical characteristics pertaining to that region zhao et al 2019 varikoden et al 2012 basu 2007 singh and nakamura 2009 singh and kumar 1997 consequently scientific knowledge about the temporal variance of rainfall is significant for short term weather forecasting diurnal cycles of rainfall over different portions of the world had already been analyzed in a number of studies bechtold et al 2004 collier and bowman 2004 dai 2001 hara et al 2009 hara et al 2014 hu 2003 li et al 2004 deshpande and goswami 2014 gao et al 2002 barros and lang 2003 ueno et al 2001 buytaert et al 2006 tabari and talaee 2011 yu et al indicated that the early morning peak mainly corresponds to long duration rainfall events lasting longer than 6 h whereas the late afternoon peak was mainly due to rainfall events lasting less than 3 h yu et al 2007 terrain induced local circulations are found to be one of the causes of late night and early morning rainfalls barros et al 2000 barros et al 2004 bhatt and nakamura 2005 singh et al 2005 nakamura and singh 2009 kuwagataet al 2001 lang and barros 2002 however an afternoon to early evening rainfall is quite common and more likely than late night to early morning peak ueno et al 2001 ohsawa et al 2001 barros et al 2000 the research on diurnal rainfall variations over india had been started a few decades back bhattacharya and bhattacharyy 1980 harlar et al 1991 nakamura and nakamura 2005 sahany et al 2010 singh and nakamura 2010 subrahmanyam et al 2015 however most of these studies reported the monsoon rainfall features from central india or the himalayan foothill region within the indian territory heavy rainfall during the night and early morning hours in the monsoon period has been reported bhattacharya and bhattacharyya 1980 over north bengal halder et al 1991 suggestedthat the effects of the mesoscale topography and the drift of thunderstorms are the reasons for the diurnal variation of precipitation over central india during the monsoon period the diurnal precipitation characteristics around the indian himalayan region had been observed using level 3 3b42 tmpa precipitation product derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite data bhatt and nakamura 2005 afternoon to evening precipitation were found as embedded convection over the location sahany et al 2010 also observed the diurnal variation using trmm data they showed three peaks of diurnal rainfall at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 ist over the bay of bengal which is located very close to kolkata and its surrounding region singh and nakamura observed the peak of diurnal variation of rainfall during the afternoon period 15 18 ist from trmm observations subrahmanyam et al 2015 reported a positive relationship between the diurnal variation of convective available potential energy cape and precipitation over the indian summer monsoon region it has been reported by several authors that maximum rainfall occurs during the late afternoon hours of the indian summer monsoon over the indian land mass nesbitt and zipser 2003 basu 2007 senroy and sen roy 2011 rajeevan et al 2012 the precipitation characteristics study is very much important in india as it shows significant seasonal and inter annual variations the monsoon rainfall is mainly characterized by stratiform rain there are many studies on the characteristics of monsoon rainfall over india as mentioned earlier on the other hand pre monsoon rainfall is mostly associated with localized convective phenomena and predominantly connected to local variabilities of atmospheric parameters the pre monsoon rainfall plays a significant role in determining the total rainfall of the year bera 2017 pre monsoon rainfall is also a determining factor in the inter annual variation of monsoon rainfall ghosh et al 2018 kolkata is located near the land ocean boundary on the verge of the tropics as a consequence of the flow of land sea breeze convective phenomena are very likely over kolkata during the pre monsoon period sadhukhan et al 2000 over a tropical urban location like kolkata and its surroundings the study of pre monsoon rainfall characteristics is thus quite significant most of the studies of diurnal variation of precipitation over india have been performed using trmm data products in the present study the diurnal precipitation characteristics and association with atmospheric parameters have been investigated using two ground based instruments a disdrometer and a radiometer the level 3 3b42 tmpa precipitation product derived from trmm satellite dataof spatial precipitation patterns encompassing the kolkata region has also been evidenced kolkata 22 34 n 88 29 e experiences appreciable rainfall during the monsoon june september and the pre monsoon april may seasons of the year though the monsoon rainfall has a major contribution to the annual rainfall occurring in kolkata pre monsoon rainfall still plays a significant role in determining the total rainfall of the year chakraborty and das 2021 the convective rainfall during the pre monsoon period in kolkata is known as nor westers which are localized thunderstorms along with medium to heavy precipitation a previous study reported that maximum pre monsoon rainfall occurs during the afternoon period over the tropical land masses hirose and nakamura 2005 however the observation was based upon trmm pr satellite of a few convective events over india from march to may of the years 1998 2003 the spatio temporal variation of asian precipitation systems had been investigated through the diurnal rainfall variability to identify the topographical impact on the rainfall regime determination the lack of accurate precipitation records often acts as a hindrance to carry out such studies on an elaborate basis in the present study atmospheric conditions and parameters associated with nor westers have been investigated to analyze their comparable and contrasting patterns in connection with the temporal shifting of the rainfall events from afternoon to late evening period during the pre monsoon days over the tropical urban location kolkata the urban agglomeration of kolkata at the verge of the tropics in the indian state of west bengal kindled the scope of diurnal precipitation research at the particular locus the diurnal cycle of rainfall not only exhibits distinguishable characteristics over the tropical lands and oceans but is also found to be more prominent over the landmass gray and jacobson 1977 kolkata being located near the land ocean boundary becomes a specialized location for the investigation of diurnal precipitation variability 2 experimental measurements and data the disdrometer and radiometer observations are collocated at the roof top of the institute of radio physics and electronics of the university of calcutta at kolkata 22 34 n 88 29 e these data sets are location specific and not available in the public domain however the trmm rainfall data can be obtained from the modis giovanni site 2 1 disdrometer data in the present study joss waldvogel disdrometer jwd observations have been utilized to obtain rain related information namely rain rate and rain accumulation over kolkata for a total span of seven years 2010 2016 this impact type disdrometer measures raindrop size distributions in 20 individual size intervals spreading over 0 359 mm to 5 5 mm with a sampling rate of 30 s the accuracy of jwd is 5 the jwd consists of a styrofoam cone with a cross sectional area of 50 cm2 joss and waldvogel 1969 joss and waldvogel 1977 impacting precipitations over the conical styrofoam produces a mechanical impulse such that the cone along with two attached coils move downwards and consequently a voltage is induced in a sensing coil the amplified form of this electrical impulse provides the measure of the impacting precipitation size the rain rate can be calculated from the recorded drop size distribution dsd data at every 30 s sampling time 2 2 radiometer data the multi frequency rpg hatpro radiometer rose and czekala 2009 placed on the rooftop of the institute of radio physics and electronics measures brightness temperatures brts at 14 different frequency channels spreading over two disjoint frequency bands having the frequency ranges of 22 24 31 40 ghz and 51 59 ghz for the retrieval of atmospheric parameters the radiometer was trained with 1500 radiosonde profiles over kolkata statistical regression models between meteorological data along with the corresponding brightness temperatures in different channels and data from temperature pressure and humidity sensors within the instrument have been used to estimate liquid water path lwp and other atmospheric parameters from radiometric measurements rose and czekala 2009 chakraborty and maitra 2016 de et al 2017 rpg hatpro obtains the cloud base height by measuring the cloud base temperature with an infrared radiometer attached to rpg hatpro and then comparing it with the temperature profile of the atmosphere the cloud thickness is taken up to the height where relative humidity exceeds 95 rose and czekala 2009 chakraborty and maitra 2016 the 60 ghz oxygen absorption line is typically used for temperature profiling from the weighting functions corresponding to the various oxygen line profiling frequencies the vertical profile of the temperature has been derived the archived radiometric data of atmospheric parameters namely integrated water vapour iwv liquid water content cloud depth and also instability parameter like convective available potential energy cape rose and czekala 2009 karstens simmer and ruprecht 1994 de et al 2017 of the period 2011 2013 have been utilized in the present study 2 3 trmm observations the spatial precipitation patterns encompassing the kolkata region have been studied using trmm 3 hourly high quality precipitation data https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni the trmm data product consists of trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rainfall estimate product 3b42 version 7 v7 which merges satellite rainfall estimates s with gauge data g the 3b42 algorithm first combines microwave precipitation estimates from multiple low earth orbiting satellites and then calibrates the trmm microwave imager precipitation tmi trmm product 2a12 and trmm combined instrument precipitation tci trmm product 2b31 these all products are merged to produce a 3 hourly microwave only best estimate the infrared precipitation estimates from multiple geosynchronous satellites are then calibrated to the microwave estimate and used to fill in the regional gaps in the merged microwave field to produce a combined satellite rainfall estimate every 3 h these 3 hourly combined satellite estimates are then summed to the monthly scale and re calibrated with a monthly precipitation gauge analysis to provide the final sg merged precipitation estimate as a level 3 l3 3 hourly 0 25 x 0 25 quasi global 50 ns gridded sg rainfall database the 3 hourly 3b42 data is stored in eight files per day at 00 utc 03 utc 06 utc etc it extends a 3 hourly 0 25 x 0 25 gridded database since 1997 toulier et al 2019 fernández et al 2016 huffman et al 2007 huffman et al 2010 3 variability of pre monsoon rain over kolkata the pre monsoon and monsoon rain characteristics over kolkata exhibit distinguishable features owing to their rudimentary rainfall formation physics here all the pre monsoon rain events of the individual years 2010 2016 have been considered to calculate the hourly accumulation mm over the study location the box plots in fig 1 represent the year to year variability of the hourly accumulation for the pre monsoon and monsoon season for the period 2010 2016 on each box the central mark is the median the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points the algorithm considers to be not outliers and the outliers are plotted individually as a sign in fig 1 we have considered all the pre monsoon fig 1a and monsoon fig 1b rain events of the individual years 2010 2016 to calculate the hourly accumulation mm over the study location it is quite evident from the figure that the diurnal variation of monsoon accumulation besides being predominant over that of the pre monsoon does not show such significant diurnal variability as that of the pre monsoon thus the diurnal variation of monsoon rainfall in contrast with pre monsoon rainfall over kolkata does not show any remarkable diversification the pre monsoon accumulation dominantly prevails over the afternoon to night period after 14 30 ist of 2010 2016 fig 1a the strong insolation during the hot summer days prompts the nor westers to occur during the afternoon and early evening gupta and sen 1952 however in kolkata significant occurrences of thunderstorms accompanied by quite intense rainfall activities can be observed during the late evening and night hours 20 30 22 30 ist accordingly in the box plot of hourly rain accumulation in fig 1a two rainfall peaks are prominently present at two different times of the day at 16 30 ist and another at 20 30 ist during the pre monsoon season the pre monsoon rain events are anticipated to set in during the afternoon to evening hours due to its characteristic nature as well as the underlying development process but the present study evidenced a considerable number of rain events deferring from the usual commencement time fig 1a consequently depending on their start time these pre monsoon rain events are classified into two types the rain events which started within the afternoon to early evening 14 30 ist 18 30 ist span are considered as expected events the rain events having start time within 18 30 ist 22 30 ist are termed as delayed events in the present study moreover the delayed events are so chosen that they do not have any expected events occurring that day the terms expected and delayed are particularly indicative of the start time of rain events occurring at the study location during the pre monsoon months march to may pre monsoon rainfall in kolkata being mostly set in due to local convection is mostly localized in nature and consequently exhibits year to year variability the statistical distribution of diurnal accumulation mm is evaluated on the basis of all the individual years of the 7 years 2010 2016 and has been shown in fig 2 the relative occurrence of expected and delayed events at kolkata can be observed in fig 2a in which the number of events of the two types namely expected and delayed is depicted for the span of years 2010 2016 it can be noted that the delayed events are predominant over the expected events in most of the years fig 2a the yearly variations of total accumulation of the expected and the delayed events have been demonstrated in fig 2b furthermore the average accumulations for expected and delayed events have also been evaluated and shown in fig 2c it is found that the average accumulations of the delayed events are not only comparable to that of the expected events but tend to exceed the precipitation of the expected ones occasionally the typical diurnal variability of accumulation prevailing over kolkata may be indicative of the dissimilar climatological characteristic associated with an urban location in order to explore such a possibility the spatial distributions of precipitation over kolkata the urban location and its surroundings along with the surrounding semi urban or rural location have been studied utilizing the 3 hourly trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rainfall estimate product 3b42 version 7 v7 fig 3 demonstrates an expected time event occurring at the study location on 31 may 2011 the time variations of the event as observed through the disdrometer data of the study location and the trmm observation are shown in fig 3a and b respectively the spatial distribution of the event during 17 30 ist is depicted in fig 3c it is evident from the trmm observations in fig 3c that during the expected hours 17 30 ist in the present case the rainfall signature is discernible in kolkata 22 34 n 88 29 e and near by locations during expected hours the pre monsoon rainfall is found to occur over the metropolitan portion as well as the surrounding non urban portions of the spatial illustration fig 3d f illustrates another set of observations for an expected event on 23 april 2013 such outcomes are indicative of the natural manifestation of the pre monsoon rain event similar observations have been carried out for two delayed events on 5 april 2012 fig 4 a d and 19 may 2013 fig 4e h in this case the spatial observations during the expected hours 17 30 ist evidenced the presence of precipitation beyond the outskirts of kolkata fig 4c and g however the delayed hours 20 30 ist map demonstrated rainfall signatures over the metropolitan stretch and its nearby locations fig 4d and h such dissimilar coverage of rainfall instances during the expected versus the delayed hours may be an obvious consequence of the associated atmospheric impact on the local convection development process over kolkata and its semi urban outskirt the spatial distribution of rain is illustrated over a 3 3 lat long area however the spread of the metropolitan city kolkata is only about 1 0 5 latitude wise 22 15 to 23 5 n longitude wise 88 2 to 88 32 e thus fig 3c and f fig 4c and f and fig 4d and h encompass the urban extent of kolkata along with its non urban surroundings as compared to the corresponding disdrometer data the decreased amount of rainfall observed through the trmm observations is due to the spatio temporal averaging of the grid data the illustrations showing the absence and presence of rainfall in and around kolkata region during expected 17 30 ist and delayed 20 30 ist hours respectively infer that the occurrence of delayed pre monsoon events may be a characteristic of urban climatology han et al 2014 niyogi et al 2017 the underlying cause may be the fact that urban locations are prone to anthropogenic carbon pollution leading to suppression of convection during expected hours recent studies have reported black carbon aerosols warm up the upper pbl with a higher heating rate ding et al 2016 and cause a significant decrease in the lower tropospheric temperature lapse rate talukdar et al 2019 this may cause a decrease in the convective available potential energy in the atmosphere and eventually can restrict the normal updraft or convection of moist air talukdar et al 2019 the carbon pollution is significantly associated with metropolitan transportation and industrialization the consequence is also reflected through the spatial map plots of the expected and delayed events in figs 3 and 4 the variations of associated atmospheric parameters during the expected and delayed hours may further help to reveal the fundamental reason for such delayed occurrence of pre monsoon events for further analysis of the pre monsoon rain events occurring over kolkata case studies of two such events expected and delayed have been chosen to inspect the associated variation of atmospheric parameters like rain drop size distribution dsd iwv lwp and cape figs 5 and 6 respectively demonstrate an expected event on 23 april 2013 and a delayed event on 19 may 2013 in the expected event rainfall sets in at about 17 00 ist whereas in the delayed event rain commences at about 18 54 ist fig 5a 6a and 5b 6b depict the dsd and rain rate variation respectively pertaining to the expected delayed event the maximum rain rates being around 40 mm h and 45 mm h respectively the expected and delayed events belong to the same rain rate class as far as the dsd is concerned as discernible in the respective rain dsd the later phase after 20 00 ist of the delayed event exhibits the presence of significantly larger diameter even 2 5 mm rain drops for quite a low rain rate value 1 5 mm h however such low intensity rain continues up to almost 2 5 h such an elongated period of low intensity rain is not evident in the expected event fig 5a the time variations of cape iwv and lwp values corresponding to the event on 23 april 2013 are demonstrated in fig 5c e fig 6c e for delayed events respectively the values of all three parameters are found to be higher in the case of the delayed event the excess amount of the associated parameters may be responsible for the long trailing low intensity rain with the presence of significantly larger diameter rain drops for the respective rain rate class usually the strong updraft associated with higher values of cape is responsible for a higher probability of coalescence than break up during the fall of rain drop from the cloud base adhikari et al 2017 consequently larger rain drops are quite probable in the ground observation for comparatively low intensity rain as evident in the case of the delayed event the height profiles of temperature variation fig 7 a and b of the two mentioned events up to the height of 2000 m are further analyzed to probe into the prevailing atmospheric conditions prior to and during the rain events occurring at two different time slots of pre monsoon season the contours depict a slower diurnal variation of temperature on 19 may 2013 in comparison to 23 april 2013 for the event on 19 may fig 7b the ground temperature is 304 k for a longer period 10 ist 18 ist however for the event on 23 april the ground temperature is around 300 k for 10 ist 16 ist fig 7a the ground temperature is thus found to be higher as well as sustained for a longer period of the day on 19 may 2013 fig 7b moreover the higher altitudes up to boundary layer height 2000 m exhibit higher temperature during 19 may 2013 than 23 april 2013 fig 7a and b the fact is also evident in the plots of temperature difference shown in fig 7c the sharp changes in temperature at 17 ist and 19 ist in fig 7a and b respectively are the consequences of the incidences of rain events within the specified periods the precipitation during the mentioned period led to a 3 4 k fall in the ground to boundary level 2 km from ground level temperature difference fig 7c the set in time of the respective events are indicated by the dashed vertical lines in fig 7c the larger deviation of temperature along the vertical height fig 7c on 23 april 2013 may be accountable for setting up rain within expected hours of pre monsoon days as a consequence of fully developed convection in the next section the average picture of the relative variations of associated atmospheric parameters like iwv lwp ratio of iwv to lwp and temperature profile up to the height of boundary layer 2000 m have been investigated in connection with such two expected and delayed sets of pre monsoon rain events during 2011 2013 as both the ground based observations from the disdrometer and radiometer measurements are concurrently available during the mentioned study period 4 diurnal variations of atmospheric parameters diurnal variations of atmospheric parameters like lwp iwv cloud depth and temperature have been discussed in this section in bearing relevance to expected and delayed rain events during pre monsoon season over kolkata the hourly average values of iwv and lwp have been estimated from concurring radiometric measurements iwv indicates the total amount of water vapour present in the vertical atmospheric column and lwp denotes the total amount of liquid water in the unit vertical column through the atmosphere in general higher lwp results in a greater amount of rainfall ye et al 2014 fujita and tomonori 2017 the diurnal variations of iwv and lwp associated with each category of rain events namely expected and delayed are demonstrated in fig 8 a and b respectively time variation of the parameters can be treated as a precursor to an upcoming rain event bhattacharya et al 2011 the lwp shows peaks exceeding 1500 g m2 value at around 15 30 ist for expected and around 18 30 ist for delayed precipitation respectively fig 8b however while monitored for the delayed events iwv exhibits insignificant variations before and during the expected hours 14 30 18 30 ist of pre monsoon rain events fig 8a in order to further explore the influence of the two parameters iwv and lwp in causing precipitation during expected or delayed hours of the pre monsoon days the ratio of iwv to lwp has also been examined and demonstrated in fig 8c this ratio may be indicative of the relative impact of iwv and lwp in causing rainfall consequently the smaller ratio values denote a higher concentration of lwp for the concurring iwv thereby pointing towards the atmospheric condition when a significant fraction of water vapour has already been converted into liquid water content now as reflected from the ratio variations for the expected events the ratio started to fall after 14 45 ist and encountered a 53 fall to reach a dip at 16 30 ist fig 8c the peak expected accumulation at 16 30 ist as evident in fig 1a complies with such hydrological conversion procedure however such falls in case of the delayed events started a bit later at 15 00 ist and predominantly continued to fall up to 17 30 ist the iwv to lwp ratio for the delayed set of events experienced a total fall of about 83 6 during this decaying stage and continued to be at a low level for the next 1 h the higher fall of the iwv to lwp ratio for the delayed events may be responsible for causing a significant precipitation peak at 20 30 ist as found to be present in fig 1a and also manifested through the delayed accumulation for 2011 2013 in fig 2b on the other hand in the morning period high ratio value for the delayed events implies the dominance of water vapour over concurring lwp the prevailing atmospheric conditions in the morning period may not be suitable to convert the water vapour content into a significant amount of lwp and thereby restraining the rainfall occurrence for the delayed events after 20 00 ist the ratio values start to increase for both expected and delayed events fig 8c which actually indicates depletion of lwp from the atmosphere and thereby weakening the probability of further precipitation cloud depth is considered to be another important factor having a close association with precipitation the cloud base height data along with the extent of liquid water profile lpr information have been utilized to estimate the cloud depth over the study location de et al 2017 the cloud depth variations have been observed for both the expected and delayed pre monsoon events the distinguishable variation patterns of cloud depth values for expected and delayed events have been demonstrated in fig 9 a and b through box plots here in fig 9a and b firstly all the delayed and expected events pertaining to the span 2011 2013 are separately identified and the respective cloud depth variations had been tracked for all the individual events the hourly average cloud depths had been evaluated for the entire day 24 h of the events for expected events the cloud depth shows the highest value 372 m at 16 30 ist after which it starts decaying however for delayed events the cloud depth shows multiple peak values 200 m when compared the cloud depth peaks are found not to be concurrent with the peak lwp values as demonstrated in fig 8b particularly for the delayed events as a matter of fact though the cloud depth is high but due to the probable lack of sufficient liquid water content within the cloud precipitation did not set in furthermore for better exposition fig 9c depicts the mean cloud depth variation of all the expected and delayed events of 2011 2013 the association of the two parameters namely cloud depth and lwp in resulting precipitation at two different periods expected and delayed hours of the pre monsoon days the ratio of lwp to cloud depth has been evaluated fig 9d the ratio is indicative of the concentration of liquid water content within the cloud as illustrated in fig 9c the cloud depth for the expected events reached its post afternoon peak at about 17 ist after which it followed a sharp fall to become null at 20 ist the lwp to cloud depth ratio indicative of liquid water concentration within the cloud for the expected events in fig 9d showed the maximum value 30 kg m3 at about 17 30 ist during which the corresponding mean cloud depth as depicted in fig 9c was 100 m on the contrary the delayed events had more than one peak mean cloud depth during the post afternoon period with a day long average of about 200 m moreover the post afternoon mean cloud depths remained above 150 m up to 22 30 ist the peak of the lwp to cloud depth ratio for the delayed events in fig 9d is found to be evident at 21 ist along with a mean cloud depth 200 m as depicted in fig 9c this is a delayed manifestation of the maximum parametric value for the delayed events as compared to the expected ones the uncertainty of multiple cloud depth peaks as discernible in fig 9c has been resolved through the variation of the mentioned ratio fig 9d the ratio shows distinct variation for the expected and delayed pre monsoon events fig 9d thus it is evident from the study that high lwp values with appreciable cloud depths result in substantial rainfall not during the anticipated hours as is true for the expected events but during delayed time spans of the pre monsoon months now it is quite expected that temperature will play an important role in the formation as well as the maturity of convective processes ogura and phillips 1962 manabe and strickler 1964 ncei report 2020 o gorman and schneider 2008 muller et al 2011 usually precipitation extremes are found to increase as the atmosphere becomes warmer ogura and phillips 1962 manabe and strickler 1964 moreover the height profile of the temperature is anticipated to be of decreasing nature with increasing height from the ground level men et al in 2020 reported a long term investigation of temperature variability and its impact on precipitation over the beijing tianjin hebei region the study depicted a decreasing trend of precipitation with increasing temperature over a period of 50 years in the present study the temperature difference between the boundary layer 2 km from ground level and the ground level has been analyzed for expected and delayed events fig 10 a it has been observed that the temperature difference begins to fall from 13 30 ist for expected events and 15 30 ist for delayed events it is also notable that the delayed events on average took almost an additional 2 h time span to reach the same temperature however the differences are greater during the first half of the pre monsoon days in the case of expected events as compared to the delayed events the fall of temperature difference may be due to two reasons either an increase in ground temperature or an increase in boundary layer temperature for expected and delayed events for above mentioned times thus the ground temperature variation has further been explored in fig 10b the ground temperature has been found to reach and maintain a higher level above 300 k up to about 20 00 ist in case of the delayed events and the ground level takes almost 3 hrs additional time for the delayed events to reach the same temperature as that of the expected events the result implies that the convective systems are tending to get matured in the later part of the day for the delayed events lenderink and meijgaard 2008 lenderink and meijgaard 2010 in comparison to the expected events in order to further dig into the diurnal variations of prevailing atmospheric conditions in connection with the two sets of rain events namely expected and delayed the variability of cape convective available potential energy has been additionally examined during the respective occurrence days the following section represents the elaborate investigation of this topic 5 diurnal variation of instability parameter the variation of the instability parameter like convective available potential energy cape is quite random in nature thus 15 min average values of this parameter have been considered for analysis cape is the amount of energy a parcel of air would acquire if lifted a certain distance vertically from the free convection level fcl to the equilibrium level el through the atmosphere cape effectively indicates the amount of atmospheric instability rose and czekala 2009 karstens et al 1994 de et al 2017 and can be estimated as 1 c a p e z n z f g t v p a r c e l t v e n v t v e n v d z where z f is the height of the level of free convection fcl and z n is the height of the equilibrium level el t v parcel is the virtual temperature of the specific parcel t v env is the virtual temperature of the environment and g is the acceleration due to gravity in fig 11 the peak cape values are observed within 16 30 18 30 ist for expected time events and between 18 30 20 30 ist for delayed time events it is usually expected that cape will be higher just before any convective event holley et al 2014 done et al 2006 zimmer et al 2011 for expected events the cape values start rising from 14 ist to reach above 400 at two different time slots first being 14 30 ist to 14 45 ist and second at 15 30 ist within the anticipated hours of nor wester related rain events the cape value for the delayed events became just 100 but below 150 at about 15 45 ist and 17 15 ist within the anticipated hours of nor wester related rain events however the cape index of the delayed events starts being significant 300 from 17 45 ist the cape value reaches the peak 480 at around 19 ist in case of the delayed events which may in turn cause considerable precipitation during the delayed hours of pre monsoon days as established from the results obtained from the present study a 15 minute average cape of 400 is quite substantial for setting in convective rain associated with the nor westers in comparison to a lower value moreover the subsidiary alteration of the temperature difference prevailing in between the ground level and boundary level 2 km may further play a substantial role in manifesting lower cape values during the expected hours of the delayed events the study indicates discernibly distinct patterns of variation of different atmospheric parameters before and during the rain events occurring during the expected and delayed hours of the pre monsoon months the observations thus divulge the diversity of pre monsoon rain at the study location 6 conclusion the study reveals the features of pre monsoon rain in association with different atmospheric parameters over a tropical location kolkata utilizing concurring disdrometer and radiometric measurements the following observations have been made from the study i in the pre monsoon season it is noticeable that the precipitation exhibits two different peaks at 16 30 ist and 20 30 ist based on which the rain events are categorized as expected 14 30 ist 18 30 ist and delayed after 18 30 ist events the yearly study reveals that the number of delayed events is mostly greater compared to the expected ones the long term occurrence of such features may lead toa modification of the hydrological cycle prevailing over this location ii as evident from the spatial distributions of precipitation over kolkata and its surrounding region utilizing the 3 hourly trmm 3b42 version 7 rainfall data for expected and delayed events the occurrence of delayed pre monsoon events may be a characteristic of urban climatology iii the two sets of rain events expected and delayed in the pre monsoon season have been observed in relation to different atmospheric parameters namely iwv lwp cloud depth and temperature the mean diurnal variation of iwv and lwp during the expected and delayed rain event dates shows discernible increasing trends prior to the respective rainfall peaks the ratio of iwv to lwp has also been observed as an indicator of subsequent rainfall the considerable fall of the iwv to lwp ratio results in significant precipitation in the case of the delayed events as compared with the expected ones furthermore the ratio of lwp to cloud depth shows distinct variations for the expected and delayed pre monsoon events and they are found to be quite significant in causing the subsequent rainfall in two different periods of the pre monsoon days iv it has been observed that for the delayed events the temperature difference between ground and 2000 m altitude begins to fall at a later part of the evening in comparison with the expected ones also the ground level temperature pertaining to the delayed events is found to exhibit 1 k higher values than the expected ones during the expected hours of pre monsoon days such a characteristic may be responsible for deferring the maturity of convective systems at later parts of the day for the delayed events in comparison to the expected ones v the variations of cape for both types namely expected and delayed of rain events are discernibly distinct and crucial in triggering the precipitation during the expected and delayed hours of the pre monsoon days such study on diurnal variations of pre monsoon rain along with the distinguishable variability of associated atmospheric parameters is really sparse over tropical urban locations like kolkata the observations of this study highlight some of the unique features of tropical rain during the pre monsoon period long term as well as multi station investigations on such topics may be helpful in improving future rain prediction and global circulation models the existing study can also be extended to explore the probable impact of aerosol environment on the seasonal or annual rainfall variability at urban locations and thereby leading to an associated climatic change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
