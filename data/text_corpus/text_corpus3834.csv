19170,the frequent detection of propranolol a widely used β blocker in wastewater effluents and surface waters has raised serious concern due to its adverse effects on organisms uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and uv persulfate uv pds processes are efficient in eliminating propranolol in various waters but the formation of oxidation products in these processes as well as the assessment of their toxicity has not been systematically addressed in this study we identified and compared transformation products of propranolol produced by hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 the electrostatic attraction enhances the reaction between so4 and the protonated form of propranolol while oh shows non selectivity toward both protonated and neutral propranolol species the hydroxylation of propranolol by oh occurs at either amine moiety or naphthalene group while so4 favors the oxidation of the electron rich naphthalene group further oxidation by oh and so4 results in ring opening products bicarbonate and chloride exert no effect on propranolol degradation the generation of co3 and cl containing radicals is favorable to oxidizing naphthalene group the acute toxicity assay of vibrio fischeri suggests that so4 generates more toxic products than oh while co3 and cl containing radicals produce similar toxicity as so4 high concentrations of bicarbonate in uv h2o2 increase the toxicity of treated solution graphical abstract image 1 keywords propranolol hydroxyl radical sulfate radical carbonate radical cl containing radicals transformation products 1 introduction as an important class of pharmaceuticals β blockers bind to the β adrenergic receptors in human body and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine which are used to treat cardiac malfunctions khetan and collins 2007 this target effect of β blockers to fish with β adrenergic receptors may exert a similar response to other vertebrates huggett et al 2002b β blockers also exhibit specific nontarget effects on organisms for example a previous study demonstrated that three types of β blocker could inhibit photosynthesis efficiency of a green algae desmodesmus subspicatus as echoed by ec50 values of 4 1 40 and 1335 mg l for propranolol metoprolol and atenolol respectively escher et al 2006 another study also indicated the influence of propranolol on the steroid level and reproduction in medaka oryzias latipes with exposure to 0 5 μg l propranolol huggett et al 2002a these results suggest that propranolol is more toxic to organisms than other β blockers the additive effect of propranolol which extensively exists in β blockers mixtures could contribute to the major toxic potential of overall compounds in the aquatic environment even at low concentrations cleuvers 2005 additionally the growing consumption of propranolol in medication and its insufficient removal by conventional wwtps lead to increasing occurrence of propranolol in surface waters thereby conceiving substantial concern of its toxicity to aquatic organisms kostich et al 2014 wang et al 2015 advanced oxidation processes aops are effective in removal of pharmaceuticals keen and linden 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 zhang et al 2015 conventional aops typically involve the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh as an oxidizing species to destruct recalcitrant organic contaminants in drinking water sources and wastewaters recently sulfate radical based aops have received increasing research interests as the rate constants for the reaction of sulfate radical so4 with many organic contaminants are near diffusion limited rate constants neta et al 1988 compared to oh the benefit of so4 is its less reactivity to scavengers like bicarbonate and dissolved organic carbon doc which substantially decrease the efficiency of oh based aops through consuming a large portion of oh buxton et al 1988 yang et al 2015 the presence of bicarbonate and halides at high concentrations becomes important scavengers of oh and so4 to generate daughter reactive species unlike oh so4 favors the conversion of halides to halogen reactive species at neutral ph anipsitakis et al 2006 yang et al 2014 the modeling results showed that inorganic radical concentrations in many wastewaters exceeded those of oh and so4 especially for co3 by several orders of magnitude grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 some halogen reactive species e g cl2 and co3 are more selective oxidants than oh and so4 but they are capable of oxidizing some organic contaminants beitz et al 1998 canonica et al 2005 hasegawa and neta 1978 for instance our previous results indicated higher reactivity of co3 and halogen reactive species toward propranolol which led to efficient removal of propranolol by aops in various waters yang et al 2016 the transformation of propranolol and its product formation by oh based aops e g ozone or photocatalytic by tio2 have been well documented where hydroxylation and ring opening are the major reaction pathways benner and ternes 2009 santiago morales et al 2013 song et al 2008 nevertheless little study has investigated the transformation of propranolol by so4 based aops the different reactivity between oh and so4 in the formation and the yield of different products have been demonstrated in the transformation of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole mahdi ahmed et al 2012 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2013 in these cases so4 reacts with amine moieties to form corresponding hydroxylamine and nitro moieties which were not observed in the reaction of oh due to the poor mineralization in most applied aops the difference in products formation between these two processes resulted in the discrepancy in toxicity assay yang et al 2017 therefore it is critical to provide a fundamental understanding of the transformation of propranolol in these aops as well as the toxicity of the formed products thereby facilitating the application of these aops in oxidizing propranolol this study aims to compare the transformation of propranolol by oh based or so4 based aops the rate constants for the reaction of oh and so4 with propranolol are determined at different phs the transformation products are identified to elucidate the reaction pathways we for the first time systematically compare the effect of bicarbonate and chloride on products formation of propranolol in these two aops the efficiency of propranolol degradation is also evaluated in two authentic water matrices while reactive species involved in reactions are predicted by kinetic modeling vibrio fisheri is used in toxicity assay which is conducted under various operating conditions to evaluate the toxicity of the products in both aops 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials propranolol and ammonium acetate were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium perdisulfate pds h2o2 solution 35 w w tert butanol sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate were received from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china methanol and acetic acid in hplc grade were obtained from thermo fisher scientific and acetonitrile was received from merck stock solutions were prepared in deionized di water 18 2 mω cm from a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma 2 2 experimental procedures a collimated beam apparatus consisting of four low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm 10 w gph212t5l 4 heraeus positioned at 30 cm shining down onto a 100 ml crystallization dish pathlength 4 0 cm was used for photolysis experiments as described previously liu et al 2015 the incident photonic flux at 254 nm was 1 291 10 7 e l 1 s 1 which was determined by the iodide iodate chemical actinometer rahn et al 2003 except when otherwise mentioned the solution contained pds or h2o2 at 1 mm and propranolol at 20 μm and was buffered with 10 mm phosphate samples 1 ml were periodically withdrawn and supplemented with 20 μl methanol to quench any radical formed by thermolysis of pds or h2o2 and kept at 4 c for further analysis within 12 h experiments were conducted at 20 2 c the second order rate constants of propranolol with oh and so4 were determined by competition kinetics atrazine was used as a reference compound for oh and so4 reactions with k o h atz 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 and k so 4 atz 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 respectively yang et al 2015 experiments were conducted according to the aforementioned except that both propranolol and atrazine were spiked at 5 μm for the determination of second order rate constant with so4 10 mm tert butanol was added to quench oh in uv pds some experiments were conducted using real water samples i e surface water and groundwater from two drinking water treatment plants these water samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter 0 7 μm whatman and stored at 4 c the surface water sample had a low doc and low alkalinity doc 3 8 mg l alkalinity 0 2 mm cl 5 2 mg l ph 7 2 while the groundwater sample has relatively higher doc and alkalinity doc 6 9 mg l alkalinity 8 0 mm cl 7 2 mg l ph 7 6 water samples were buffered using 2 mm phosphate all experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average values and standard deviations were presented 2 3 determination of rate constants for the reactions of propranolol with oh and so4 the degradation rate of propranolol by direct photolysis was negligible at ph range of 8 11 in uv h2o2 and uv pds supplementary data fig s1 to evaluate the specific rate constants for the reactions of oh and so4 with the protonated and the neutral form of propranolol the apparent rate constants k app o h and k app so 4 were determined using competition kinetics at ph ranging from 8 to 11 according to the methods described in text s1 the initial rate of propranolol and atrazine degradation degraded fraction of each compound 20 was used for calculation to circumvent the competitive effect of their products the measured k app o h and k app so 4 can be expressed as incorporating acid base speciation of propranolol 1 k app o h α s h 2 k sh 2 o h α s h k s h o h 2 k app so 4 α s h 2 k sh 2 so 4 α s h k s h so 4 where α s h 2 and α s h are the equilibrium distribution coefficients of protonated sh2 and neutral sh forms at a given ph respectively and calculated from acidity constant pk a 9 5 benner and ternes 2009 k sh 2 o h k sh o h k s h 2 so 4 and k sh so 4 are the second order rate constants for the reactions of oh and so4 with protonated and neutral forms respectively the specific rate constants were calculated through nonlinear regression of experimental data 2 4 analytical methods propranolol and atrazine were analyzed by a waters 1525 hplc with a waters 2487 dual λ detector chromatographic separations were performed using a waters symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the concentrations of propranolol and atrazine were quantified at λ 285 nm and λ 260 nm respectively with an eluent of 0 1 acetic acid and methanol with a ratio of 30 70 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min identification of products of propranolol was performed through molecular mass which was determined by a triple quadrupole tof mass spectrometer triple tof 5600 ab sciex coupled with the ekspert ultrallc110 a poroshell 120 ec c18 column 50 mm 3 0 mm 2 7 μm was used as chromatographic separation accurate ms and ms ms patterns of propranolol and its transformation products were analyzed in both positive and negative electrospray ionization esi modes the experimental conditions of chromatographic separation and instrumental parameters for hplc triple tof are provided in text s2 2 5 kinetic simulations in water samples kinetic modeling of radical concentration for uv h2o2 and uv pds processes in two authentic waters was performed using a computer program kintecus v6 01 ianni 2016 over one hundred rate constants of elementary reactions were obtained from the literature table s3 das et al 1999 yang et al 2014 2016 due to the lack of sufficient rate constants of many radicals with propranolol the modeling only took into account the effects of chloride bicarbonate and doc 2 6 toxicity analysis the acute toxicity assay was carried out by measuring the decrease in the bioluminescence of vibrio fischeri fernández alba et al 2002 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the measurements were performed using a promega glomax multi jr the luminescent intensity was determined to calculate the inhibition after 30 min 3 results and discussions 3 1 oxidation kinetics of the reaction of propranolol with oh and so4 the phototransformation quantum yield φ254 of propranolol was determined to be 8 93 10 3 at ph 8 3 in our previous study yang et al 2017 the molar absorption and quantum yield of propranolol were not varied with ph the photophysical property of propranolol was attributed to the chromophore structure of naphthalene group which was unlikely affected by ph liu and williams 2007 sortino et al 2002 the reaction rate constant of propranolol with oh k app o h was independent of ph from 8 to 11 fig 1 a indicating that oh exhibited comparable reactivity to both neutral and anionic forms of propranolol therefore the same value of k sh 2 o h and k sh o h were suggested here and determined to be 1 26 0 10 1010 m 1 s 1 which was consistent with the value of 1 07 0 02 1010 m 1 s 1 reported in radiolysis experiments song et al 2008 this value is also comparable to the rate constants determined for the reaction of oh with naphthalene 9 12 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 these results indicated that the reaction of oh with naphthalene group was predominant with minimal contribution from the side chain group sulfate radical is an electrophile so that a faster rate constant for the reaction of so4 with the neutral form of propranolol is expected however a continuous decrease in k app so 4 with increasing ph from 8 to 11 was observed in fig 1b where k s h 2 so 4 and k sh so 4 was determined to be 3 21 0 08 1010 m 1 s 1 and 1 39 0 10 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively steenken et al reported that the second order rate constant for so4 with naphthalene is 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 steenken et al 1990 the higher rate constant for propranolol may be ascribed to the following two aspects due to the electrophilicity of so4 electron donating substituents like methoxy or hydroxy groups can cause a significant increase in rate constants which has been demonstrated for substituted benzenes and benzoate ions neta et al 1977 therefore naphthalene substituted by alkoxy group ch3 2cnhch2ch oh ch2o increases the reactivity of the naphthalene moiety with so4 additionally we noticed that these two values approached the diffusion controlled limit suggesting that the difference between the expected and the experimental data was likely resulted from the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged so4 and the positively charged protonation form of propranolol a previous study also reported that the electrostatic repulsion between so4 with the anionic form of organic compounds resulted in lower reaction rate constants than with the neutral form neta et al 1977 3 2 effect of bicarbonate bicarbonate is an important scavenger of oh and so4 in the aqueous phase to form carbonate radical co3 reactions 3 and 4 anastasio and matthew 2006 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 fig 2 exhibits the effect of bicarbonate on the degradation of propranolol in uv h2o2 and uv pds no difference in propranolol degradation for uv h2o2 was observed as the increase of bicarbonate concentration up to 500 mm the presence of 5 and 50 mm bicarbonate in uv pds showed negligible impact on propranolol degradation kinetics as well while a marginal decline was observed with the addition of 500 mm bicarbonate based on the calculation 94 5 of oh and 70 of so4 were scavenged by 500 mm bicarbonate respectively to form co3 lian et al reported that the rate constant for the reaction of co3 with propranolol was 1 42 107 m 1 s 1 lian et al 2017 although this rate constant is three orders of magnitude lower than those for reaction with oh and so4 the concentration of co3 appeared to be high enough to fully compensate for the decreased contribution of oh and so4 to the degradation of propranolol 3 hco 3 o h co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 4 hco 3 s o 4 co 3 h s o 4 k 2 8 10 6 m 1 s 1 3 3 effect of chloride chloride is widely present in drinking water and wastewater with various concentrations the reaction of oh and so4 with cl generates reactive cl containing radicals e g cl cl2 and cloh kinetic modeling in previous studies demonstrated different formation pathways of reactive cl containing radicals in uv h2o2 and uv pds grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 the reaction of oh with cl has a fast rate constant of reverse reaction reaction 5 where cl forms at low ph reaction 6 yang et al 2014 in contrast the fast reaction between so4 and cl forms cl directly reaction 7 which can further react with cl to form other cl containing radicals since the reaction of oh with cl was negligible in uv h2o2 at ph 8 yang et al 2016 the effect of cl was only investigated in uv pds 5 cl o h c l oh h 2 o k for 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 k rev 6 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 6 cloh h c l h 2 o

presence of 100 mm cl 98 of so4 was scavenged where cl containing radicals were the predominant pathway of propranolol degradation cl and cl2 radicals are strong oxidants e cl cl 2 4 v and e cl2 2cl 2 0 v martire et al 2001 and likely to react with organic compounds hasegawa and neta 1978 the second order rate constants for the reaction of cl with organic compounds were reported comparably to those of oh and so4 nist 2017 although cl2 was more selective than oh and so4 rate constants of 105 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2017 the concentration of cl2 could exceed those of oh and so4 by several orders of magnitude yang et al 2016 which contributed to the degradation of propranolol 3 4 identification of transformation products eleven transformation products tps belonging to nine nominal masses were detected and identified using esi tof ms the accurate m z values are provided in table 1 the product ion spectra and the fragmentation pathways of propranolol m h 260 1649 were illustrated in fig s2 the m z 183 fragment ion was resulted from the loss of isopropene ammonia and water fragment ions m z 155 and m z 157 corresponded to the cleavage on the side chain and rearrangement of the co moiety which exhibited an unchanged naphthalene group the m z 116 98 and 74 fragment ions were formed by the different cleavages of the side chain these characteristic fragments of propranolol were important for the comparison with the spectra of tps as they provide information on the status of functional groups after oxidation for structural elucidation the fragmentation pathways of tps were investigated by performing product ion scans which were provided in fig s3 s13 3 4 1 hydroxyl radical hydroxylation due to the negligible degradation of propranolol by direct photolysis all the nine tps detected in uv h2o2 were ascribed to the oxidation by oh the observation of two isomers of tp 275 m h 276 1594 was owing to the addition of one oxygen atom to propranolol molecule the product ion scan of tp 275 1 showing two sequential loss of water fragment ions m z 258 and 240 could signify two hydroxyl moieties which were present next to a removable proton this result implied that amine moiety was likely hydroxylated to form a hydroxylamine product the fragment ion m z 173 of tp 275 2 was formed through hydroxylation on naphthalene group of m z 157 thereby indicating the oxidation of the naphthalene group on propranolol the occurrence of m z 116 and 98 fragment ions provided further support on the proposed fragment pathway the difference in molecular weight of propranolol and tp 291 1 m h 292 1543 was 32 da corresponding to the addition of two oxygen atoms the loss of 60 da i e 18 42 da suggested the cleavage of water and isopropyl moiety double hydroxylation on the ring was supported by the fragment ion m z 175 corresponding to the cleavage of co moiety and two hydroxylated groups on the ring ring opening several peaks with a nominal mass of 307 da were observed tp 307 m h 308 1492 was resulted from the addition of three oxygen atoms 48 da to propranolol the product ion scan showing two sequential loss of water fragment ions m z 290 and 272 signified that two hydroxyl moieties were present next to a removable proton implying one hydroxylation on the side chain hydroxylation next to either ethoxy group or amine moiety would cause an unstable hemiaminal benner and ternes 2009 hence the amine moiety was likely hydroxylated thus leading to the formation of hydroxylamine the m z 175 fragment ion corresponded to the addition of two oxygen atoms on the naphthalene group the proposed formation of two aldehyde moieties rather than a double hydroxylation was supported by the fragment ion m z 131 175 131 44 da loss of co2 the structure of tp 281 m h 282 1336 was also a ring opening product with the occurrence of m z 149 indicating the formation of two aldehyde moieties only one loss of water fragment ion m z 264 confirmed the hydroxylation of the naphthalene group tp 293 m h 294 1700 showed one less double bond than tp 291 1 the unchanged side chain can be seen by the single loss of water fragment ion m z 276 the fragment ions m z 199 and m z 173 had quinone like structure which derived from dehydration of one aldehyde moiety and one hydroxyl group in the aromatic structure tp 309 m h 310 1649 showed two isomers the fragment ion m z 177 was resulted from the cleavage of the co bond indicating that the addition of three oxygen atoms took place at the aromatic structure and no oxidation on the side chain the second loss of water fragment ion m z 274 suggested that the hydroxyl group on the aromatic structure was present next to a removable proton the second hydroxyl group can either occur in a carboxyl moiety or at other positions of the ring however no carboxyl moiety was detected in negative ionization mode the detection of tp 309 in the positive mode was likely ascribed to a hydroxylation of the ring the appearance of fragment ion m z 114 demonstrated the ring opening of the naphthalene group at 3 4 position cleavage the fragment ions m z 116 and 74 of tp 133 m h 134 1176 were formed by the loss of water and isopropyl group indicating two hydroxyl groups of the structure the structure of tp 166 m h 165 0193 was proposed to form two carboxyl moieties which was supported by the fragment ion m z 121 165 121 44 da loss of co2 and 77 121 77 44 da loss of co2 3 4 2 sulfate radical seven tps detected in uv pds were ascribed to the oxidation by so4 where tp 133 tp 166 tp 275 2 tp 307 and tp 309 were similar to those in uv h2o2 tp 273 m h 274 1437 corresponded to the addition of one oxygen atom to propranolol molecule with one more double bond than tp 275 the fragment ion m z 159 indicated the oxidation of naphthalene group a fragment ion m z 131 was ascribed to a loss of co of m z 159 hence the occurrence of double bond most likely took place on the side chain an isomer of tp 291 1 with different retention time and ms ms spectra was denoted as tp 291 2 the difference could be explained by the formation of two aldehyde moieties rather than double hydroxylation on the ring which was supported by the occurrence of m z 131 and 103 through two sequential loss of co 159 131 28 da and 131 103 28 da 3 4 3 carbonate radical and chlorine radicals the addition of 50 and 500 mm bicarbonate in uv h2o2 inhibited the formation of tp 291 1 neither tp 275 1 nor tp 293 was observed in the presence of 500 mm bicarbonate while tp 273 was generated in such a condition co3 was the dominant radical thus the formation of tps was attributed to the oxidation of propranolol by co3 for uv pds neither bicarbonate nor low concentration of cl affected the formation of tps tp 275 1 appeared at high concentration of cl which was due to the conversion of cl to oh see discussion below tps generated by co3 and cl containing radicals were similar to those by so4 indicating that the reaction pathways of propranolol degradation by so4 occurred for co3 and cl containing radicals 3 5 proposed transformation pathway oh pathway oh attacks the naphthalene group of propranolol to form a carbon centered radical which further reacts with oxygen to generate a peroxy radical and subsequent forms a hydroxylated product tp 291 1 scheme 1 the oxidation of this product is followed by ring opening and the formation of aldehyde moieties to produce tp 291 2 oh attacks the aldehyde moiety leading to the formation of alcohol or and carboxyl group namely tp 293 and tp 309 additionally the double bond is likely attacked by oh in the α position of the aldehyde moiety by cleavage of acetaldehyde to form tp 281 even though several isomers of tp 281 were proposed only one signal was detected the cleavage of ether bond on propranolol and its products generates tp 133 and tp166 so 4 pathway the pk a of propranolol is 9 5 implying lower reactivity of protonated amine group at ph 8 due to the electrophilic property of so4 it favors the oxidation of the naphthalene group rather than the amine group which leads to the formation of tp 275 2 rather than tp 275 1 scheme 1 the amine moiety could be considered as a secondary reactive site when the oxidized naphthalene group is less reactive i e tp 307 hydroxyl as an electron donating group on naphthalene facilitates further oxidation on its ortho position by so4 resulting in a ring opening product tp 291 2 alternatively the less selectivity of oh leads to the formation of multi hydroxyl products tp 291 1 which may occur on different benzene rings the formation of tp 273 is not clear which may involve dehydration of the side chain co 3 and cl containing radicals pathway co3 and cl2 are more selective oxidants compared with oh and so4 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 1988 thus reacting with organic compounds mainly through electron transfer which is similar to that of so4 despite the fact that cl exhibits high reactivity toward organic compounds which is similar to oh cl could not be considered as a dominant radical in the system not only the faster reverse rate of reaction 5 favors the formation of oh at neutral ph but also the excess cl consumes cl to form cl2 when co3 is the dominant radical in both uv h2o2 and uv pds the same products are formed as those by so4 with a low concentration of cl 0 1 mm most so4 reacts with propranolol while only 4 5 of so4 reacts with cl to generate cl therefore no effect was noticed on product formation compared with so4 as cl concentration increased the formation of tp 275 1 was observed which is likely ascribed to the oxidation by either oh or cl previous studies demonstrated that as cl concentration varied from 33 to 540 mm the steady date concentration of oh was three to five orders of magnitude higher than that of cl yang et al 2014 2016 since the rate constant of oh with propranolol is near the diffusion controlled limit oh is believed to the dominant oxidant contributing to the degradation of propranolol rather than cl leading to the formation of tp 275 1 3 6 oxidation in authentic water matrices the degradation of propranolol in groundwater was slightly slower than that in surface water for both uv h2o2 and uv pds this opposite effect of bicarbonate in authentic vs simulated waters was likely ascribed to the scavenging effect of reactive components in authentic waters e g doc kinetic modeling of steady state concentration of radicals in two authentic water matrices was shown in table 2 a higher doc concentration in groundwater decreased the concentration of radicals except for co3 although the concentration of co3 was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of oh or so4 in groundwater the rate constant of co3 with propranolol was three orders of magnitude lower than that of oh or so4 therefore oh or so4 was the dominant radical in both groundwater and surface water and their relatively low concentration in groundwater reduced the propranolol degradation rate as the yield of so4 1 4 in uv pds was higher than that of oh 1 0 in uv h2o2 baxendale and wilson 1957 mark et al 1990 the degradation of propranolol was faster in uv pds than that in uv h2o2 in both water matrices similar products were found in two water matrices fig 4 tp 281 and tp 291 1 were only observed in uv h2o2 while tp 275 1 was not detected in any condition a higher concentration of co3 2 inhibited the formation of tp 291 1 confirming that hydroxylation was the dominant pathway of oh the maximum concentrations of tp 273 and tp 275 2 in uv pds were higher than those in uv h2o2 consisting with the results in the simulated waters the sharp decrease of these two products was observed by uv pds in surface water although the degradation rate of propranolol in two water matrices was similar this result indicates that so4 was a stronger oxidant than co3 to further oxidize these products similar trends of products formation were also noticed for tp 291 2 tp 293 tp 307 and tp 309 the maximum concentrations of tp 293 tp 307 and tp 309 in uv h2o2 were higher than those in uv pds while the faster degradations of products were found in surface water rather than those in groundwater owing to the further oxidation of products by oh the higher concentration of the cleavage product tp 133 by uv h2o2 was due to the different reactivity of oh and so4 toward the side chain in groundwater both tp 166 and tp 291 2 exhibited higher concentration than those in surface water which was likely attributed to either the lower reactivity of co3 toward these products or the oxidation of their precursors by oh and so4 these comparisons between two matrices simulated the formation of products in real world applications of these two aops 3 7 acute toxicity of transformation products in uv based aops microtox assay has been widely employed to determine the acute toxicity of substances in the environment a model marine bacterium of vibrio fischeri was selected herein as an indicator of toxicity because it is tolerant to the high concentration of salts used in this study 100 mm bicarbonate or cl the acute toxicity was expressed by the luminescence inhibition of vibrio fischeri in the treatment of propranolol via different procedures fig 5 l 0 was the luminescence of propranolol without treatment while l was the luminescence of samples with corresponding treatments and conditions the acute toxicity was determined by the ratio of l l 0 where a lower value implies higher acute toxicity and vice versa the dashed line represented the luminescence of residual propranolol in a sample with the decrease of propranolol in uv h2o2 the inhibition effects on vibrio fischeri decreased up to 20 relative to the initial luminescence this result was consistent with the toxicity of residual propranolol which can be explained by the fewer toxic products generated by oh in uv pds 20 degradation of propranolol led to 80 inhibition of luminescence when propranolol was removed by 40 the luminescence was completely inhibited suggesting that the products generated by so4 were more toxic than propranolol the effects of oxidation products of co3 or cl containing radicals were also shown in fig 5 the concentration of bicarbonate or cl at 100 mm was used to create a background with dominant co3 or cl containing radicals the presence of bicarbonate in uv h2o2 showed no luminescence inhibition when the removal of propranolol was less than 30 however the toxicity sharply increased as the degradation of propranolol proceeded bicarbonate at 100 mm could scavenge 77 of oh implying that oh contributed to the partial degradation of propranolol and the formation of its corresponding products the non effect on vibrio fischeri in the initial phase could be explained by two possible reasons either oh generated fewer toxic products or the accumulation of toxic products by co3 was not sufficient to affect the overall toxicity subsequently the further oxidation of products by oh or co3 generated more toxic products the presence of bicarbonate or cl containing radicals in uv pds exhibited comparable toxicity to that in uv pds taken together these results indicated that the products generated by so4 co3 or cl containing radicals were more toxic than those by oh 4 conclusions hydroxyl radical showed unselective oxidation towards propranolol species although so4 was expected to be more reactive toward the neutral form of propranolol the electrostatic attraction between so4 and the protonated form of propranolol could facilitate this reaction oh reacted with either amine moiety or naphthalene group through hydroxylation pathway which underwent further oxidation to form ring opening products so4 exhibited high reactivity toward the electron rich naphthalene group when the oxidized naphthalene group was less reactive the amine moiety as a secondary reactive site could be oxidized by so4 the same products through the cleavage of the side chain were observed in both aops neither bicarbonate nor cl had a significant effect on propranolol degradation co3 and cl containing radicals were favorable in oxidizing the naphthalene group since cl2 played a role in the conversion of so4 to oh the characteristic product by oh was detected at high concentrations of cl in uv pds the acute toxicity assay implied that the products generated by so4 were more toxic than those by oh co3 and cl containing radicals gave similar toxic products as so4 the presence of bicarbonate in uv h2o2 enhanced the generation of toxic products it should be noted that the toxicity of specific product needs to be further identified which will facilitate a better understanding of toxicological potential when these aops are applied in treating waters with different backgrounds acknowledgments we acknowledge the post doctoral international exchange program no 20160074 for support for y y we are thankful for the excellent graduate student

19170,the frequent detection of propranolol a widely used β blocker in wastewater effluents and surface waters has raised serious concern due to its adverse effects on organisms uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and uv persulfate uv pds processes are efficient in eliminating propranolol in various waters but the formation of oxidation products in these processes as well as the assessment of their toxicity has not been systematically addressed in this study we identified and compared transformation products of propranolol produced by hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 the electrostatic attraction enhances the reaction between so4 and the protonated form of propranolol while oh shows non selectivity toward both protonated and neutral propranolol species the hydroxylation of propranolol by oh occurs at either amine moiety or naphthalene group while so4 favors the oxidation of the electron rich naphthalene group further oxidation by oh and so4 results in ring opening products bicarbonate and chloride exert no effect on propranolol degradation the generation of co3 and cl containing radicals is favorable to oxidizing naphthalene group the acute toxicity assay of vibrio fischeri suggests that so4 generates more toxic products than oh while co3 and cl containing radicals produce similar toxicity as so4 high concentrations of bicarbonate in uv h2o2 increase the toxicity of treated solution graphical abstract image 1 keywords propranolol hydroxyl radical sulfate radical carbonate radical cl containing radicals transformation products 1 introduction as an important class of pharmaceuticals β blockers bind to the β adrenergic receptors in human body and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine which are used to treat cardiac malfunctions khetan and collins 2007 this target effect of β blockers to fish with β adrenergic receptors may exert a similar response to other vertebrates huggett et al 2002b β blockers also exhibit specific nontarget effects on organisms for example a previous study demonstrated that three types of β blocker could inhibit photosynthesis efficiency of a green algae desmodesmus subspicatus as echoed by ec50 values of 4 1 40 and 1335 mg l for propranolol metoprolol and atenolol respectively escher et al 2006 another study also indicated the influence of propranolol on the steroid level and reproduction in medaka oryzias latipes with exposure to 0 5 μg l propranolol huggett et al 2002a these results suggest that propranolol is more toxic to organisms than other β blockers the additive effect of propranolol which extensively exists in β blockers mixtures could contribute to the major toxic potential of overall compounds in the aquatic environment even at low concentrations cleuvers 2005 additionally the growing consumption of propranolol in medication and its insufficient removal by conventional wwtps lead to increasing occurrence of propranolol in surface waters thereby conceiving substantial concern of its toxicity to aquatic organisms kostich et al 2014 wang et al 2015 advanced oxidation processes aops are effective in removal of pharmaceuticals keen and linden 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 zhang et al 2015 conventional aops typically involve the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh as an oxidizing species to destruct recalcitrant organic contaminants in drinking water sources and wastewaters recently sulfate radical based aops have received increasing research interests as the rate constants for the reaction of sulfate radical so4 with many organic contaminants are near diffusion limited rate constants neta et al 1988 compared to oh the benefit of so4 is its less reactivity to scavengers like bicarbonate and dissolved organic carbon doc which substantially decrease the efficiency of oh based aops through consuming a large portion of oh buxton et al 1988 yang et al 2015 the presence of bicarbonate and halides at high concentrations becomes important scavengers of oh and so4 to generate daughter reactive species unlike oh so4 favors the conversion of halides to halogen reactive species at neutral ph anipsitakis et al 2006 yang et al 2014 the modeling results showed that inorganic radical concentrations in many wastewaters exceeded those of oh and so4 especially for co3 by several orders of magnitude grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 some halogen reactive species e g cl2 and co3 are more selective oxidants than oh and so4 but they are capable of oxidizing some organic contaminants beitz et al 1998 canonica et al 2005 hasegawa and neta 1978 for instance our previous results indicated higher reactivity of co3 and halogen reactive species toward propranolol which led to efficient removal of propranolol by aops in various waters yang et al 2016 the transformation of propranolol and its product formation by oh based aops e g ozone or photocatalytic by tio2 have been well documented where hydroxylation and ring opening are the major reaction pathways benner and ternes 2009 santiago morales et al 2013 song et al 2008 nevertheless little study has investigated the transformation of propranolol by so4 based aops the different reactivity between oh and so4 in the formation and the yield of different products have been demonstrated in the transformation of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole mahdi ahmed et al 2012 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2013 in these cases so4 reacts with amine moieties to form corresponding hydroxylamine and nitro moieties which were not observed in the reaction of oh due to the poor mineralization in most applied aops the difference in products formation between these two processes resulted in the discrepancy in toxicity assay yang et al 2017 therefore it is critical to provide a fundamental understanding of the transformation of propranolol in these aops as well as the toxicity of the formed products thereby facilitating the application of these aops in oxidizing propranolol this study aims to compare the transformation of propranolol by oh based or so4 based aops the rate constants for the reaction of oh and so4 with propranolol are determined at different phs the transformation products are identified to elucidate the reaction pathways we for the first time systematically compare the effect of bicarbonate and chloride on products formation of propranolol in these two aops the efficiency of propranolol degradation is also evaluated in two authentic water matrices while reactive species involved in reactions are predicted by kinetic modeling vibrio fisheri is used in toxicity assay which is conducted under various operating conditions to evaluate the toxicity of the products in both aops 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials propranolol and ammonium acetate were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium perdisulfate pds h2o2 solution 35 w w tert butanol sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate were received from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china methanol and acetic acid in hplc grade were obtained from thermo fisher scientific and acetonitrile was received from merck stock solutions were prepared in deionized di water 18 2 mω cm from a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma 2 2 experimental procedures a collimated beam apparatus consisting of four low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm 10 w gph212t5l 4 heraeus positioned at 30 cm shining down onto a 100 ml crystallization dish pathlength 4 0 cm was used for photolysis experiments as described previously liu et al 2015 the incident photonic flux at 254 nm was 1 291 10 7 e l 1 s 1 which was determined by the iodide iodate chemical actinometer rahn et al 2003 except when otherwise mentioned the solution contained pds or h2o2 at 1 mm and propranolol at 20 μm and was buffered with 10 mm phosphate samples 1 ml were periodically withdrawn and supplemented with 20 μl methanol to quench any radical formed by thermolysis of pds or h2o2 and kept at 4 c for further analysis within 12 h experiments were conducted at 20 2 c the second order rate constants of propranolol with oh and so4 were determined by competition kinetics atrazine was used as a reference compound for oh and so4 reactions with k o h atz 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 and k so 4 atz 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 respectively yang et al 2015 experiments were conducted according to the aforementioned except that both propranolol and atrazine were spiked at 5 μm for the determination of second order rate constant with so4 10 mm tert butanol was added to quench oh in uv pds some experiments were conducted using real water samples i e surface water and groundwater from two drinking water treatment plants these water samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter 0 7 μm whatman and stored at 4 c the surface water sample had a low doc and low alkalinity doc 3 8 mg l alkalinity 0 2 mm cl 5 2 mg l ph 7 2 while the groundwater sample has relatively higher doc and alkalinity doc 6 9 mg l alkalinity 8 0 mm cl 7 2 mg l ph 7 6 water samples were buffered using 2 mm phosphate all experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average values and standard deviations were presented 2 3 determination of rate constants for the reactions of propranolol with oh and so4 the degradation rate of propranolol by direct photolysis was negligible at ph range of 8 11 in uv h2o2 and uv pds supplementary data fig s1 to evaluate the specific rate constants for the reactions of oh and so4 with the protonated and the neutral form of propranolol the apparent rate constants k app o h and k app so 4 were determined using competition kinetics at ph ranging from 8 to 11 according to the methods described in text s1 the initial rate of propranolol and atrazine degradation degraded fraction of each compound 20 was used for calculation to circumvent the competitive effect of their products the measured k app o h and k app so 4 can be expressed as incorporating acid base speciation of propranolol 1 k app o h α s h 2 k sh 2 o h α s h k s h o h 2 k app so 4 α s h 2 k sh 2 so 4 α s h k s h so 4 where α s h 2 and α s h are the equilibrium distribution coefficients of protonated sh2 and neutral sh forms at a given ph respectively and calculated from acidity constant pk a 9 5 benner and ternes 2009 k sh 2 o h k sh o h k s h 2 so 4 and k sh so 4 are the second order rate constants for the reactions of oh and so4 with protonated and neutral forms respectively the specific rate constants were calculated through nonlinear regression of experimental data 2 4 analytical methods propranolol and atrazine were analyzed by a waters 1525 hplc with a waters 2487 dual λ detector chromatographic separations were performed using a waters symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the concentrations of propranolol and atrazine were quantified at λ 285 nm and λ 260 nm respectively with an eluent of 0 1 acetic acid and methanol with a ratio of 30 70 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min identification of products of propranolol was performed through molecular mass which was determined by a triple quadrupole tof mass spectrometer triple tof 5600 ab sciex coupled with the ekspert ultrallc110 a poroshell 120 ec c18 column 50 mm 3 0 mm 2 7 μm was used as chromatographic separation accurate ms and ms ms patterns of propranolol and its transformation products were analyzed in both positive and negative electrospray ionization esi modes the experimental conditions of chromatographic separation and instrumental parameters for hplc triple tof are provided in text s2 2 5 kinetic simulations in water samples kinetic modeling of radical concentration for uv h2o2 and uv pds processes in two authentic waters was performed using a computer program kintecus v6 01 ianni 2016 over one hundred rate constants of elementary reactions were obtained from the literature table s3 das et al 1999 yang et al 2014 2016 due to the lack of sufficient rate constants of many radicals with propranolol the modeling only took into account the effects of chloride bicarbonate and doc 2 6 toxicity analysis the acute toxicity assay was carried out by measuring the decrease in the bioluminescence of vibrio fischeri fernández alba et al 2002 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the measurements were performed using a promega glomax multi jr the luminescent intensity was determined to calculate the inhibition after 30 min 3 results and discussions 3 1 oxidation kinetics of the reaction of propranolol with oh and so4 the phototransformation quantum yield φ254 of propranolol was determined to be 8 93 10 3 at ph 8 3 in our previous study yang et al 2017 the molar absorption and quantum yield of propranolol were not varied with ph the photophysical property of propranolol was attributed to the chromophore structure of naphthalene group which was unlikely affected by ph liu and williams 2007 sortino et al 2002 the reaction rate constant of propranolol with oh k app o h was independent of ph from 8 to 11 fig 1 a indicating that oh exhibited comparable reactivity to both neutral and anionic forms of propranolol therefore the same value of k sh 2 o h and k sh o h were suggested here and determined to be 1 26 0 10 1010 m 1 s 1 which was consistent with the value of 1 07 0 02 1010 m 1 s 1 reported in radiolysis experiments song et al 2008 this value is also comparable to the rate constants determined for the reaction of oh with naphthalene 9 12 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 these results indicated that the reaction of oh with naphthalene group was predominant with minimal contribution from the side chain group sulfate radical is an electrophile so that a faster rate constant for the reaction of so4 with the neutral form of propranolol is expected however a continuous decrease in k app so 4 with increasing ph from 8 to 11 was observed in fig 1b where k s h 2 so 4 and k sh so 4 was determined to be 3 21 0 08 1010 m 1 s 1 and 1 39 0 10 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively steenken et al reported that the second order rate constant for so4 with naphthalene is 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 steenken et al 1990 the higher rate constant for propranolol may be ascribed to the following two aspects due to the electrophilicity of so4 electron donating substituents like methoxy or hydroxy groups can cause a significant increase in rate constants which has been demonstrated for substituted benzenes and benzoate ions neta et al 1977 therefore naphthalene substituted by alkoxy group ch3 2cnhch2ch oh ch2o increases the reactivity of the naphthalene moiety with so4 additionally we noticed that these two values approached the diffusion controlled limit suggesting that the difference between the expected and the experimental data was likely resulted from the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged so4 and the positively charged protonation form of propranolol a previous study also reported that the electrostatic repulsion between so4 with the anionic form of organic compounds resulted in lower reaction rate constants than with the neutral form neta et al 1977 3 2 effect of bicarbonate bicarbonate is an important scavenger of oh and so4 in the aqueous phase to form carbonate radical co3 reactions 3 and 4 anastasio and matthew 2006 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 fig 2 exhibits the effect of bicarbonate on the degradation of propranolol in uv h2o2 and uv pds no difference in propranolol degradation for uv h2o2 was observed as the increase of bicarbonate concentration up to 500 mm the presence of 5 and 50 mm bicarbonate in uv pds showed negligible impact on propranolol degradation kinetics as well while a marginal decline was observed with the addition of 500 mm bicarbonate based on the calculation 94 5 of oh and 70 of so4 were scavenged by 500 mm bicarbonate respectively to form co3 lian et al reported that the rate constant for the reaction of co3 with propranolol was 1 42 107 m 1 s 1 lian et al 2017 although this rate constant is three orders of magnitude lower than those for reaction with oh and so4 the concentration of co3 appeared to be high enough to fully compensate for the decreased contribution of oh and so4 to the degradation of propranolol 3 hco 3 o h co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 4 hco 3 s o 4 co 3 h s o 4 k 2 8 10 6 m 1 s 1 3 3 effect of chloride chloride is widely present in drinking water and wastewater with various concentrations the reaction of oh and so4 with cl generates reactive cl containing radicals e g cl cl2 and cloh kinetic modeling in previous studies demonstrated different formation pathways of reactive cl containing radicals in uv h2o2 and uv pds grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 the reaction of oh with cl has a fast rate constant of reverse reaction reaction 5 where cl forms at low ph reaction 6 yang et al 2014 in contrast the fast reaction between so4 and cl forms cl directly reaction 7 which can further react with cl to form other cl containing radicals since the reaction of oh with cl was negligible in uv h2o2 at ph 8 yang et al 2016 the effect of cl was only investigated in uv pds 5 cl o h c l oh h 2 o k for 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 k rev 6 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 6 cloh h c l h 2 o

presence of 100 mm cl 98 of so4 was scavenged where cl containing radicals were the predominant pathway of propranolol degradation cl and cl2 radicals are strong oxidants e cl cl 2 4 v and e cl2 2cl 2 0 v martire et al 2001 and likely to react with organic compounds hasegawa and neta 1978 the second order rate constants for the reaction of cl with organic compounds were reported comparably to those of oh and so4 nist 2017 although cl2 was more selective than oh and so4 rate constants of 105 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2017 the concentration of cl2 could exceed those of oh and so4 by several orders of magnitude yang et al 2016 which contributed to the degradation of propranolol 3 4 identification of transformation products eleven transformation products tps belonging to nine nominal masses were detected and identified using esi tof ms the accurate m z values are provided in table 1 the product ion spectra and the fragmentation pathways of propranolol m h 260 1649 were illustrated in fig s2 the m z 183 fragment ion was resulted from the loss of isopropene ammonia and water fragment ions m z 155 and m z 157 corresponded to the cleavage on the side chain and rearrangement of the co moiety which exhibited an unchanged naphthalene group the m z 116 98 and 74 fragment ions were formed by the different cleavages of the side chain these characteristic fragments of propranolol were important for the comparison with the spectra of tps as they provide information on the status of functional groups after oxidation for structural elucidation the fragmentation pathways of tps were investigated by performing product ion scans which were provided in fig s3 s13 3 4 1 hydroxyl radical hydroxylation due to the negligible degradation of propranolol by direct photolysis all the nine tps detected in uv h2o2 were ascribed to the oxidation by oh the observation of two isomers of tp 275 m h 276 1594 was owing to the addition of one oxygen atom to propranolol molecule the product ion scan of tp 275 1 showing two sequential loss of water fragment ions m z 258 and 240 could signify two hydroxyl moieties which were present next to a removable proton this result implied that amine moiety was likely hydroxylated to form a hydroxylamine product the fragment ion m z 173 of tp 275 2 was formed through hydroxylation on naphthalene group of m z 157 thereby indicating the oxidation of the naphthalene group on propranolol the occurrence of m z 116 and 98 fragment ions provided further support on the proposed fragment pathway the difference in molecular weight of propranolol and tp 291 1 m h 292 1543 was 32 da corresponding to the addition of two oxygen atoms the loss of 60 da i e 18 42 da suggested the cleavage of water and isopropyl moiety double hydroxylation on the ring was supported by the fragment ion m z 175 corresponding to the cleavage of co moiety and two hydroxylated groups on the ring ring opening several peaks with a nominal mass of 307 da were observed tp 307 m h 308 1492 was resulted from the addition of three oxygen atoms 48 da to propranolol the product ion scan showing two sequential loss of water fragment ions m z 290 and 272 signified that two hydroxyl moieties were present next to a removable proton implying one hydroxylation on the side chain hydroxylation next to either ethoxy group or amine moiety would cause an unstable hemiaminal benner and ternes 2009 hence the amine moiety was likely hydroxylated thus leading to the formation of hydroxylamine the m z 175 fragment ion corresponded to the addition of two oxygen atoms on the naphthalene group the proposed formation of two aldehyde moieties rather than a double hydroxylation was supported by the fragment ion m z 131 175 131 44 da loss of co2 the structure of tp 281 m h 282 1336 was also a ring opening product with the occurrence of m z 149 indicating the formation of two aldehyde moieties only one loss of water fragment ion m z 264 confirmed the hydroxylation of the naphthalene group tp 293 m h 294 1700 showed one less double bond than tp 291 1 the unchanged side chain can be seen by the single loss of water fragment ion m z 276 the fragment ions m z 199 and m z 173 had quinone like structure which derived from dehydration of one aldehyde moiety and one hydroxyl group in the aromatic structure tp 309 m h 310 1649 showed two isomers the fragment ion m z 177 was resulted from the cleavage of the co bond indicating that the addition of three oxygen atoms took place at the aromatic structure and no oxidation on the side chain the second loss of water fragment ion m z 274 suggested that the hydroxyl group on the aromatic structure was present next to a removable proton the second hydroxyl group can either occur in a carboxyl moiety or at other positions of the ring however no carboxyl moiety was detected in negative ionization mode the detection of tp 309 in the positive mode was likely ascribed to a hydroxylation of the ring the appearance of fragment ion m z 114 demonstrated the ring opening of the naphthalene group at 3 4 position cleavage the fragment ions m z 116 and 74 of tp 133 m h 134 1176 were formed by the loss of water and isopropyl group indicating two hydroxyl groups of the structure the structure of tp 166 m h 165 0193 was proposed to form two carboxyl moieties which was supported by the fragment ion m z 121 165 121 44 da loss of co2 and 77 121 77 44 da loss of co2 3 4 2 sulfate radical seven tps detected in uv pds were ascribed to the oxidation by so4 where tp 133 tp 166 tp 275 2 tp 307 and tp 309 were similar to those in uv h2o2 tp 273 m h 274 1437 corresponded to the addition of one oxygen atom to propranolol molecule with one more double bond than tp 275 the fragment ion m z 159 indicated the oxidation of naphthalene group a fragment ion m z 131 was ascribed to a loss of co of m z 159 hence the occurrence of double bond most likely took place on the side chain an isomer of tp 291 1 with different retention time and ms ms spectra was denoted as tp 291 2 the difference could be explained by the formation of two aldehyde moieties rather than double hydroxylation on the ring which was supported by the occurrence of m z 131 and 103 through two sequential loss of co 159 131 28 da and 131 103 28 da 3 4 3 carbonate radical and chlorine radicals the addition of 50 and 500 mm bicarbonate in uv h2o2 inhibited the formation of tp 291 1 neither tp 275 1 nor tp 293 was observed in the presence of 500 mm bicarbonate while tp 273 was generated in such a condition co3 was the dominant radical thus the formation of tps was attributed to the oxidation of propranolol by co3 for uv pds neither bicarbonate nor low concentration of cl affected the formation of tps tp 275 1 appeared at high concentration of cl which was due to the conversion of cl to oh see discussion below tps generated by co3 and cl containing radicals were similar to those by so4 indicating that the reaction pathways of propranolol degradation by so4 occurred for co3 and cl containing radicals 3 5 proposed transformation pathway oh pathway oh attacks the naphthalene group of propranolol to form a carbon centered radical which further reacts with oxygen to generate a peroxy radical and subsequent forms a hydroxylated product tp 291 1 scheme 1 the oxidation of this product is followed by ring opening and the formation of aldehyde moieties to produce tp 291 2 oh attacks the aldehyde moiety leading to the formation of alcohol or and carboxyl group namely tp 293 and tp 309 additionally the double bond is likely attacked by oh in the α position of the aldehyde moiety by cleavage of acetaldehyde to form tp 281 even though several isomers of tp 281 were proposed only one signal was detected the cleavage of ether bond on propranolol and its products generates tp 133 and tp166 so 4 pathway the pk a of propranolol is 9 5 implying lower reactivity of protonated amine group at ph 8 due to the electrophilic property of so4 it favors the oxidation of the naphthalene group rather than the amine group which leads to the formation of tp 275 2 rather than tp 275 1 scheme 1 the amine moiety could be considered as a secondary reactive site when the oxidized naphthalene group is less reactive i e tp 307 hydroxyl as an electron donating group on naphthalene facilitates further oxidation on its ortho position by so4 resulting in a ring opening product tp 291 2 alternatively the less selectivity of oh leads to the formation of multi hydroxyl products tp 291 1 which may occur on different benzene rings the formation of tp 273 is not clear which may involve dehydration of the side chain co 3 and cl containing radicals pathway co3 and cl2 are more selective oxidants compared with oh and so4 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 1988 thus reacting with organic compounds mainly through electron transfer which is similar to that of so4 despite the fact that cl exhibits high reactivity toward organic compounds which is similar to oh cl could not be considered as a dominant radical in the system not only the faster reverse rate of reaction 5 favors the formation of oh at neutral ph but also the excess cl consumes cl to form cl2 when co3 is the dominant radical in both uv h2o2 and uv pds the same products are formed as those by so4 with a low concentration of cl 0 1 mm most so4 reacts with propranolol while only 4 5 of so4 reacts with cl to generate cl therefore no effect was noticed on product formation compared with so4 as cl concentration increased the formation of tp 275 1 was observed which is likely ascribed to the oxidation by either oh or cl previous studies demonstrated that as cl concentration varied from 33 to 540 mm the steady date concentration of oh was three to five orders of magnitude higher than that of cl yang et al 2014 2016 since the rate constant of oh with propranolol is near the diffusion controlled limit oh is believed to the dominant oxidant contributing to the degradation of propranolol rather than cl leading to the formation of tp 275 1 3 6 oxidation in authentic water matrices the degradation of propranolol in groundwater was slightly slower than that in surface water for both uv h2o2 and uv pds this opposite effect of bicarbonate in authentic vs simulated waters was likely ascribed to the scavenging effect of reactive components in authentic waters e g doc kinetic modeling of steady state concentration of radicals in two authentic water matrices was shown in table 2 a higher doc concentration in groundwater decreased the concentration of radicals except for co3 although the concentration of co3 was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of oh or so4 in groundwater the rate constant of co3 with propranolol was three orders of magnitude lower than that of oh or so4 therefore oh or so4 was the dominant radical in both groundwater and surface water and their relatively low concentration in groundwater reduced the propranolol degradation rate as the yield of so4 1 4 in uv pds was higher than that of oh 1 0 in uv h2o2 baxendale and wilson 1957 mark et al 1990 the degradation of propranolol was faster in uv pds than that in uv h2o2 in both water matrices similar products were found in two water matrices fig 4 tp 281 and tp 291 1 were only observed in uv h2o2 while tp 275 1 was not detected in any condition a higher concentration of co3 2 inhibited the formation of tp 291 1 confirming that hydroxylation was the dominant pathway of oh the maximum concentrations of tp 273 and tp 275 2 in uv pds were higher than those in uv h2o2 consisting with the results in the simulated waters the sharp decrease of these two products was observed by uv pds in surface water although the degradation rate of propranolol in two water matrices was similar this result indicates that so4 was a stronger oxidant than co3 to further oxidize these products similar trends of products formation were also noticed for tp 291 2 tp 293 tp 307 and tp 309 the maximum concentrations of tp 293 tp 307 and tp 309 in uv h2o2 were higher than those in uv pds while the faster degradations of products were found in surface water rather than those in groundwater owing to the further oxidation of products by oh the higher concentration of the cleavage product tp 133 by uv h2o2 was due to the different reactivity of oh and so4 toward the side chain in groundwater both tp 166 and tp 291 2 exhibited higher concentration than those in surface water which was likely attributed to either the lower reactivity of co3 toward these products or the oxidation of their precursors by oh and so4 these comparisons between two matrices simulated the formation of products in real world applications of these two aops 3 7 acute toxicity of transformation products in uv based aops microtox assay has been widely employed to determine the acute toxicity of substances in the environment a model marine bacterium of vibrio fischeri was selected herein as an indicator of toxicity because it is tolerant to the high concentration of salts used in this study 100 mm bicarbonate or cl the acute toxicity was expressed by the luminescence inhibition of vibrio fischeri in the treatment of propranolol via different procedures fig 5 l 0 was the luminescence of propranolol without treatment while l was the luminescence of samples with corresponding treatments and conditions the acute toxicity was determined by the ratio of l l 0 where a lower value implies higher acute toxicity and vice versa the dashed line represented the luminescence of residual propranolol in a sample with the decrease of propranolol in uv h2o2 the inhibition effects on vibrio fischeri decreased up to 20 relative to the initial luminescence this result was consistent with the toxicity of residual propranolol which can be explained by the fewer toxic products generated by oh in uv pds 20 degradation of propranolol led to 80 inhibition of luminescence when propranolol was removed by 40 the luminescence was completely inhibited suggesting that the products generated by so4 were more toxic than propranolol the effects of oxidation products of co3 or cl containing radicals were also shown in fig 5 the concentration of bicarbonate or cl at 100 mm was used to create a background with dominant co3 or cl containing radicals the presence of bicarbonate in uv h2o2 showed no luminescence inhibition when the removal of propranolol was less than 30 however the toxicity sharply increased as the degradation of propranolol proceeded bicarbonate at 100 mm could scavenge 77 of oh implying that oh contributed to the partial degradation of propranolol and the formation of its corresponding products the non effect on vibrio fischeri in the initial phase could be explained by two possible reasons either oh generated fewer toxic products or the accumulation of toxic products by co3 was not sufficient to affect the overall toxicity subsequently the further oxidation of products by oh or co3 generated more toxic products the presence of bicarbonate or cl containing radicals in uv pds exhibited comparable toxicity to that in uv pds taken together these results indicated that the products generated by so4 co3 or cl containing radicals were more toxic than those by oh 4 conclusions hydroxyl radical showed unselective oxidation towards propranolol species although so4 was expected to be more reactive toward the neutral form of propranolol the electrostatic attraction between so4 and the protonated form of propranolol could facilitate this reaction oh reacted with either amine moiety or naphthalene group through hydroxylation pathway which underwent further oxidation to form ring opening products so4 exhibited high reactivity toward the electron rich naphthalene group when the oxidized naphthalene group was less reactive the amine moiety as a secondary reactive site could be oxidized by so4 the same products through the cleavage of the side chain were observed in both aops neither bicarbonate nor cl had a significant effect on propranolol degradation co3 and cl containing radicals were favorable in oxidizing the naphthalene group since cl2 played a role in the conversion of so4 to oh the characteristic product by oh was detected at high concentrations of cl in uv pds the acute toxicity assay implied that the products generated by so4 were more toxic than those by oh co3 and cl containing radicals gave similar toxic products as so4 the presence of bicarbonate in uv h2o2 enhanced the generation of toxic products it should be noted that the toxicity of specific product needs to be further identified which will facilitate a better understanding of toxicological potential when these aops are applied in treating

19171,long term 155 weeks pb concentrations following partial lead service lines replacements plslr were measured in a flow through pilot made of harvested lead service lines lsl from the distribution system of the city of montreal the present study also investigates how release of pb from full and partial lsls is influenced by pipe diameter decrease in chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr from 0 9 to 0 3 addition of orthophosphate 1 mg p l and increase in ph to 8 3 pb concentrations were measured after 16 h of stagnation and under flow conditions in this study pb concentrations did not decrease in the long term after partial lsl replacement moreover the most effective corrosion control treatment in full lsls was the addition of orthop in contrast the decrease of the csmr best reduced lead release from partial lsls the impact of pipe configuration therefore influenced the effectiveness of corrosion control treatments it is noteworthy that the increase in pb concentrations following plslr were attributed to particulate pb release from the galvanic section of the pipe the occurrence of galvanic corrosion caused by the connection between pb and copper pipes adds a new source of pb in the partial lsl at least this new source of lead has to be offset by the removal of a long enough section of lsl during plslr full lsl replacements may be warranted to minimize the exposure of consumers to elevated pb levels caused by galvanic corrosion in lsls keywords lead service line partial lead service line replacement corrosion control orthophosphate csmr drinking water 1 introduction it is estimated that over 5 5 million lead service lines lsl are responsible for providing water to approximately 15 22 million americans cornwell et al 2016 and a major contributor 50 75 to sources of pb in tap water cartier et al 2011 levallois et al 2013 sandvig et al 2008 a survey of 21 canadian 20 and american 1 utilities revealed that the number of lsls varies between 50 and 69 000 per utility which represents 1 22 of service lines deshommes et al 2018 the replacement of lsls is a mitigation strategy used by utilities to decrease pb concentrations at the tap in the united states under the lead and copper rule lcr utilities exceeding the lead action level after implementing appropriate corrosion control cc must replace lead service lines usepa 2007 due to shared ownership of service lines utilities replace the public portion of lsls leaving the private section unmodified this action is termed a partial lsl replacement plslr to date only a few american cities such as madison and milwaukee have prohibited plslrs schock et al 2014 slabaugh 2017 field studies on lsls and the impact of plslr on pb concentrations are limited and are mostly short term studies spanning less than 6 months brown and cornwell 2015 camara et al 2013 lewis et al 2017 trueman et al 2016 the few long term north american studies available in the literature report an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in pb levels after plslr deshommes et al 2016 2017 muylwyk et al 2011 swertfeger et al 2006 a similar trend was observed in scottish households where the lsls contained a section of copper cu britton and richards 1981 short and long term pilot studies using new or harvested lsls have shown that plslrs can lead to spikes in particulate pb pbpart the level of pbpart detected is influenced by the presence of corrosion inhibitors flow rate type of coupling stagnation time prior to sampling and type of scales present in lsls arnold and edwards 2012 cartier et al 2012a cartier et al 2013 schock 1990 st clair et al 2016 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 corrosion control treatments often used as a mean to reduce lead levels from full flsls and partial lsls plsls include the addition of phosphates cartier et al 2013 edwards and mcneill 2002 kogo et al 2017 mcneill and edwards 2004 trueman et al 2018 wasserstrom et al 2017 xie and giammar 2011 ph adjustment cartier et al 2013 kim et al 2011 xie and giammar 2011 changing the chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr cartier et al 2013 edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 knowles et al 2015 nguyen et al 2010 2011b triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2013 and dosing sodium silicates kogo et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 the results of these treatments can vary depending on water quality and the pipe configuration as scales that forms inside plsls are different from that in flsls desantis et al 2018 the coagulant used by utilities can influence the csmr and therefore the lead release edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 overall the application of orthop has been highly successful in reducing 90 of total pb pbtotal cardew 2009 and pb solubility trueman et al 2018 wasserstrom et al 2017 however cardew 2009 states that orthop may not be a good cc treatment for the reduction of particulate pb as pbpart spikes were found to persist post treatment pbpart is the main concern associated with galvanic corrosion after plslr triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 pilot scale studies using harvested flsls found that the addition of orthop resulted in a 68 decrease in pbtotal concentrations following 16 h of stagnation cartier et al 2013 and caused a 70 decrease in dissolved pb pbdiss edwards and mcneill 2002 in new conditioned pb pipes orthop maintained pbdiss below 15 μg l following 8 h of stagnation xie and giammar 2011 however in plsl at pilot scale orthop caused a 13 fold increase in pbtotal concentrations cartier et al 2013 attributable to pbpart release in field studies pbpart release has been observed to be erratic and unpredictable as it depends on scale detachment cardew 2009 orthop decreased pb concentrations in new pb pipes galvanically connected to cu pipes mcneill and edwards 2004 similarly orthop decreased pb concentrations 5 3 fold for high csmr and low conductivity water in harvested lsls independently of the presence of galvanic connections to cu pipes in a recirculating system kogo et al 2017 in the presence of galvanic corrosion a csmr lower than 0 77 can protect the pb anode of the galvanic couple nguyen et al 2011a in agreement with the threshold of 0 6 presented in edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 however an increase in the csmr associated with the presence of galvanic corrosion also reportedly exacerbated pb release in pilot scale experiments edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 nguyen et al 2010 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 on the other hand the addition of sulfate better controlled pb concentrations in simulated plslrs but did not significantly change pb concentrations released from flsls cartier et al 2013 at bench scale changing coagulants alum vs pacl decreased the csmr and increased pb concentrations in harvested lsls galvanically connected to cu pipes knowles et al 2015 the solubility of pb decreases as ph increases resulting in lower soluble pb concentrations in water kim et al 2011 schock and gardels 1983 the interplay between ph and alkalinity as well as the drop in ph observed at the junction of pbcu pipes is an important determinant of lead release into water desantis et al 2018 increasing the ph from 7 1 to 7 8 in a pipe loop experiment using harvested lsls resulted in a decrease of the total pb concentration kim et al 2011 however increasing the ph of flsls from 7 7 to 8 3 did not significantly decrease pb concentrations cartier et al 2013 pilot studies using plastic couplings to connect pb and cu pipes induced galvanic corrosion by connecting them using a wire which allows measurement of the galvanic current between the pipes arnold and edwards 2012 knowles et al 2015 kogo et al 2017 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 in this experimental model the type of connector utilized caused significant differences in the galvanic corrosion of the exposed surface pilot studies using external wires to induce a galvanic current between the cu and the pb pipes may not be representative of real conditions at the galvanic connection as shown by wang et al 2013 notably lower pb concentrations have been measured using this technique than with a brass coupling wang et al 2013 numerous pilot studies have been completed using recirculating pipe loops which are not representative of reality as pb can accumulate in the recirculating water the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the long term effectiveness of corrosion control treatments on harvested flsls and plsls follow up of cartier et al 2013 under flow conditions and after 16 h of stagnation 2 verify the impact of pipe configurations on pb release 3 determine the minimum pb pipe length that needs to be removed during a plslr in order to offset the additional release of pb caused by galvanic corrosion to the best of our knowledge this investigation provides the first controlled comparison of pb release from partial lsls at pilot scale and in households prior to and after plslr 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot setup and operation the pilot setup used for this study is described in cartier et al 2013 it consists of aged pb pipes harvested from the city of montreal and installed in a large building fed with water from the same distribution system fig s1 in supplementary information this study presents the long term 155 weeks pb release after plslr simulation whereas cartier et al 2013 presented the short term 11 weeks results three pipe configurations were tested 1 a 3 m long aged lsl 100 pb 2 a 1 8 m copper pipe type m connected upstream of an aged lsl of 0 6 m using a red brass compression fitting ford wabash indiana usa simulating a cupb configuration and 3 a 0 6 m aged lsl connected to a 1 8 m copper pipe with a red brass compression fitting pbcu configuration water entering the pilot setup prior to modification had a ph of 7 9 alkalinity of 90 mg caco3 l hardness of 119 mg caco3 l chloride concentration of 24 5 mg l sulfate concentration of 26 mg l four water conditions were tested 1 control csmr 0 9 no added phosphate ph 7 9 2 high sulfate by addition of na2so4 csmr 0 3 and ph 7 9 3 orthophosphate orthop dosed at 1 mg p l with h3po4 and naoh for ph re stabilization csmr 0 9 ph 7 9 4 ph of 8 3 adjusted using naoh csmr 0 9 which was the ph resulting from the switch from gaseous chlorine to on site generation of sodium hypochlorite for the distribution system of montreal table 1 the internal diameter i d of the lead pipes were 16 mm the fifth condition tested consisted of lead pipes of a smaller internal diameter of 13 mm carrying control water in the last conditions partial lsls plsl were connected to the copper pipe using a soldered red brass fitting for the plsl configurations the internal volume of the lead pipes was 120 ml i d 16 mm or 80 ml i d 13 mm and for the full lsl configuration it was 600 ml i d 16 mm or 400 ml i d 13 mm initially all pipe configurations and treatments were tested in triplicates n 45 normal operating conditions consisted of water flowing at 5 lpm litres per minute 30 psi for 8 h per day 5 days per week without stagnation exceeding 72 h except during stagnation and high velocity flushing trials a flow rate of 5 lpm was selected as it is the representative flow rate of a kitchen faucet kogo et al 2017 welter 2016 2 2 sampling prior to each sampling event while the pilot was under normal operating conditions sampling valves were flushed for at least 30 s to remove particles that may have accumulated between sampling events as described in cartier et al 2013 and fig s1 water is flowing from the cupb configuration to the 100 pb and the pbcu for each water quality tested to avoid contribution from upstream pipes the flow pattern was modified the day before sampling to bring fresh water directly from the storage tank into each section of the pipes cupb 100 pb pbcu sampling valves were then flushed at 5 lpm for 30 s to remove particles that may have accumulated between sampling events each section of the pilot was then operated for 30 min at 5 lpm per pipe stagnation was then initiated samples after stagnation were collected applying the same flow rate as the operation rate 5 lpm except for the section with a smaller diameter 15 lpm the volume of each sample collected was of 2 l samples to ensure complete recovery of the water stagnating in the lead pipes cartier et al 2013 dissolved lead concentrations were measured by filtering a 40 ml aliquot using a 0 45 μm pvdf filter seti international scientific canada metal concentrations were monitored after a 16 h stagnation 16hs period and a 6 h stagnation 6hs period water pressure remained constant 30 psi inside the rigs during stagnation flowing sampling was conducted under pressurized conditions samples were collected every 30 min 3 samples after a one hour flush 2 3 water quality monitoring samples for total and dissolved metal measurements were acidified with 0 5 hno3 prior to analysis 0 5 hcl was also added to obtain the appropriate matrix metal concentrations cu pb zn fe were measured in an iso179025

chromatography and phosphate flow injection quikchem 8500 concentrations were monitored monthly all measurements were carried out on both flowing and stagnant samples 16hs to ensure adequate dosing of chemicals monthly samples were analysed for orthop chloride and sulfate concentrations every time a feeding solution was prepared for the pipes with the ph adjustment to 8 3 following thorough flushing of the piping between the metering pump and the water intake of the pilot samples were collected adjustment in the flow of the metered pump was made until a ph of 8 3 0 05 was achieved for the pipes treated with an addition of orthop to ensure that the ph was the same as the one from the water intake samples were collected in the same way as for the ph 8 3 pipes when the ph of the water feeding the orthop treated pipes was too low naoh concentrated solution was added until the target ph was obtained 2 4 statistical analysis non parametric statistical analysis including the kruskal wallis anova test were performed using statistica statsoft version 13 3 differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise 2 5 surface area normalized mass release sanmr calculations for each pipe the surface area normalized mass release sanmr measured after 16hs was calculated using pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart adapted from mcfadden et al 2011 the pb piping and galvanic corrosion are presumed to be the major contributors of pb in samples the incoming concentration of pbtotal from the dilution water was 0 4 μg l sanmr is expressed as μg of pb per m2 of pb pipe exposed to water for flsls the sanmr is considered to be the same throughout the pipe it is calculated by dividing the mass of pb measured in each sample by the internal surface area of the pb pipe for plsls the sanmr includes the release from the galvanic connection at the junction of the pb and cu pipes the brass fitting and the pb section free of galvanic corrosion it is calculated using the following equation 1 apparent sanmr background sanmr galvanic sanmr where the apparent sanmr is computed from the measured mass of pb per internal surface area of the pb pipe μg m2 the background sanmr is computed from the mass of pb per internal surface area of the pb pipe μg m2 released from each pipe before the simulated plslr the galvanic sanmr is computed as the difference between mass of the apparent and background sanmrs over the internal surface containing galvanic corrosion the galvanic zone is comprised of the brass fitting and the flanking 2 cm regions of cu and pb immediately next to the fitting both on the inside and the outside of the pipes thereby encompassing all the surfaces that are in contact with water at the galvanic junction fig 1 our visual observations and a previous report suggest that scale formed beyond the 2 cm of pipe included in the galvanic junction are markedly different desantis et al 2018 the non galvanic background sanmr value used in the aforementioned calculation is based on the median pb concentrations after 16hs measured before plslr simulation for each pipe apparent sanmr was also calculated for samplings after 6hs 2 6 field monitoring of lsl households apparent sanmr for houses with flsls and plsls was computed using the estimated mass of pb pipes contributing to the pb concentration in sequential samples collected after 6hs deshommes et al 2016 2017 a total of 25 houses were used for this calculation with 1 13 sampling profiles per house 9 flsls 51 profiles 11 recent cupb configurations 51 profiles 3 aged cupb configurations 33 profiles 1 recent pbcu configuration 1 profile and 4 aged pbcu configurations 24 profiles the houses were located in the same distribution system as the one from which the harvested lsls and water for the pilot were from water temperature ranged from 17 5 to 24 9 c mean ph and alkalinity were of 7 6 and 86 mg caco3 l deshommes et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in total pb concentrations over time mirroring the previous 11 week study cartier et al 2013 we report that the total lead pbtotal levels did not decrease during the 155 weeks following partial lead service line replacement plslr simulation fig 2 pbtotal varied over time with peak concentrations attributed to the presence of particulate pb pbpart median pbpart fraction in cupb and pbcu configurations was 67 for all treatments pb levels were best stabilized when sulfate was added to water in both the full lead service line flsl 10th 90th percentile 55 7 99 2 μg pbtotal l and partial lead service line plsl 10th 90th percentile cupb 16 0 66 3 μg pbtotal l configurations table 1 and fig 2c similar to cartier et al 2013 orthophosphate orthop treatment caused the highest and most variable pb concentrations in plsls spanning up to 3 orders of magnitude table 1 3 2 impact of treatments on pb concentrations after stagnation and under flow conditions the effectiveness of corrosion control treatments in reducing pb concentrations varied depending on the pipe configuration and type of sampling 16 h of stagnation vs flowing samples as expected the median pbtotal dissolved pb pbdiss and pbpart concentrations were lower under flow conditions than after 16hs and the 100 pb pipes released the lowest pb concentrations table 1 and fig 3 3 2 1 full lead service lines flsls after 16hs pbtotal between the control sulfate treatment and ph 8 3 samples was statistically similar median of 79 5 vs 76 7 vs 84 1 μg pbtotal l respectively figs 2 and 3 pbtotal was best reduced by orthop treatment both after stagnation 3 8 fold median of 20 8 vs 79 5 μg pbtotal l and under flowing conditions 3 9 fold 0 43 vs 1 7 μg pbtotal l table 1 and fig 3 this observed 73 decrease is consistent with short term post plslr studies reporting a 68 cartier et al 2013 or 70 edwards and mcneill 2002 decrease in pb concentrations under similar conditions or in a dump and fill experiment respectively we also found that pbdiss was reduced by orthop treatment in agreement with xie and giammar 2011 in contrast orthop failed to decrease pbpart 11 4 vs 10 5 μg pbpart l control vs orthop respectively thereby contradicting a previous dump and fill study using new pb pipes mcneill and edwards 2004 but in agreement with the findings of xie and giammar 2011 the increase in the particulate pb fraction is comparable to faucets and brass materials treated with orthop 0 8 mg p l with reported increases from 31 to 54 cartier et al 2012b mixed metals present in alloys can result in galvanic corrosion such as is the case in partial lsls when orthop is the corrosion control treatment pb phosphate compounds such as hydroxypyromorphite trueman et al 2018 are expected to be formed when these forms are present they may to contribute less to exposure because of the very low bioavailability as compared to other forms present deshommes et al 2012 xie and giammar 2011 after 16hs there were no significant differences in pbpart concentrations except for the smaller diameter condition indeed highest pbpart was recorded under this condition 8 fold higher vs control the increase in pbpart under this condition could be attributed to increased flow velocity relative to the control also the difference in pbpart between the smaller diameter and the control condition can be explained by the different types of fittings used for both conditions soldered vs compression fittings in terms of pbpart fraction smaller diameter pipes 67 1 and orthop treatment 59 8 also exhibited the highest values among all conditions tested all other conditions were comparable in terms of particulate pb fraction it is also noteworthy that the addition of sulfate decreased both the 90th percentile pbpart 31 7 vs 115 8 μg pbpart l sulfate vs control fig 3e and pbpart fraction 41 0 vs 66 1 the median pbtotal was 48 69 fold lower under flow conditions compared to 16hs table 1 corroborating a previous study we report that an increase in water ph did not cause changes to pb levels under flowing or stagnation conditions kim et al 2011 3 2 2 partial lead service lines plsls in contrast to the short term study results cartier et al 2013 we observed that pipe configuration affected pb release over the long term 155 weeks nevertheless the high level of pb detected post plslr at 11 weeks cartier et al 2013 persisted through to 155 weeks for both partial configurations sulfate treatment which decreases the csmr from 0 9 to 0 3 yielded the lowest pbtotal concentrations for both partial configurations cupb and pbcu after 16hs the addition of sulfate reduced pbtotal by 1 8 fold cupb and 3 2 fold pbcu relative to the control condition comparably to flsls we observed that orthop decreased median pbdiss concentrations by 4 1 fold in cupb rigs 18 5 vs 4 5 μg pbdiss l and by 5 8 fold in pbcu rigs 38 8 vs 6 7 μg pbdiss l fig 1 after 16hs the same trend was observed for samples collected under flowing conditions table 1 pbtotal concentrations in plsls were higher relative to 100 pb pipes after stagnation for the pipes treated with the addition of orthop this is caused by spikes of both the concentration and fraction of pbpart which are not controlled by the addition of orthop the pbpart fractions for the control and orthop treatments were 61 and 85 in the cupb configuration and 49 and 80 in the pbcu configuration respectively this increase in pbpart is in line with a reported increase observed in a recirculating pipe loop comprising pbcu galvanic couples and fed by chlorinated water treated with 2 mg p l of orthop arnold and edwards 2012 however orthop was also shown to decrease pbtotal and pbdiss more effectively than pbpart in harvested plsls partial and pvc pb kogo et al 2017 lowering the csmr was effective in controlling the pbpart concentration and fraction after 16hs and under flowing conditions table 1 and fig 3 this is in accordance with prior bench scale studies nguyen et al 2010 when compared to the control condition pbpart concentrations were 5 4 fold lower for both the cupb 28 5 vs 5 3 μg pbpart l and pbcu 31 1 vs 5 8 μg pbpart l configurations under low csmr increasing the csmr 0 1 1 0 using 50 50 pb tin coupons galvanically connected to copper has been shown to dramatically increase pb concentrations nguyen et al 2011b indicating that the csmr should be a concern to utilities with plslrs increasing sulfate concentrations has been shown to reduce galvanic currents in copper pipes containing solder joints thereby reducing the pb release arising from galvanic corrosion nguyen et al 2010 if ph adjustment was applied for corrosion control a higher ph set point than 8 3 would be desirable to achieve lead reduction moreover corrosion control guidance by the usepa does not recommend adjustments between 8 and 8 5 based on concerns over the instability of scale composition between cerussite and hydrocerussite a target ph of 8 8 10 is recommended when ph control is the corrosion control approach usepa 2016 as utilities consider switching from gaseous chlorine to onsite hypochlorite generation small increases of ph are to be expected with the water quality the unintended consequence of increasing the ph to 8 3 at short and medium term at pilot scale on full and partial lsl provided some anticipated release in the field distribution system under the conditions tested in the present study the optimal corrosion control treatment for flsls and plsls are different utilities should therefore identify the corrosion control treatment which would be effective for all lead service line configurations in general the most beneficial corrosion control treatment for flsls was orthop treatment while decreasing the csmr yielded the best results within plsls 3 3 impact of pipe configuration after 16hs the 100 pb pipes released less pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart when adjusting for pipe length compared to both partial configurations under all tested conditions fig s1 under the control condition the median pbtotal concentration linearized for pipe length in 100 pb pipes was 2 9 fold lower than in cupb pipes and 5 1 fold lower than in pbcu pipes cartier et al 2013 previously observed that pb release was higher in plsls shortly after plslr similar observations have been reported in plslr field studies trueman et al 2016 and lab experiments st clair et al 2016 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2012 using diverse water conditions in contrast to our findings one field study completed in the same distribution system reported that pb concentrations were lower in houses with plsls than flsls when a plslr was completed less than 2 years ago 90th percentile after 15 min of stagnation 11 18 μg l for plsls vs 11 25 μg l for flsls deshommes et al 2016 these lower levels persisted in older plslr completed 2 years ago partial replacements deshommes et al 2017 contrasts between our findings and other published work can be explained by differences in legacy scales present in the harvested lsls scale composition reflects the history of water qualities which these pipes were exposed over time schock and lytle 2011 the pbpart fraction measured in both partial configurations for each treatment were statistically similar after 16hs the control condition orthop treatment and high ph released statistically lower pbpart fractions in the flsl than in the partial configurations after 16hs as also reported by cartier et al 2013 under flowing conditions the pbpart fraction was similar for all conditions and treatments confirming that the effects of galvanic corrosion are mostly observed after stagnation furthermore the pbpart fraction decreases drastically under flowing condition as compared to 16hs example 37 vs 85 for the cupb configuration treated with orthop under flow conditions pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart concentrations per metre of pipe were statistically similar for both partial configurations unlike the 16hs samples 3 4 surface area normalized mass release sanmr while the sanmr within 100 pb pipes is assumed to be homogenous throughout its length this is a simplified model of reality as the scale layers within a pipe are usually non uniform desantis et al 2018 wasserstrom et al 2017 we defined the galvanic zone based on visually apparent changes to the scales fig 1 2 cm on the pb and cu pipes flanking the fitting which corresponded to a projected surface area of 107 cm2 for pipes with an internal diameter i d of 16 mm and 86 cm2 for pipes with an i d of 13 mm fig 1 and fig s2 show that corrosion deposits can be abundant on the inside as well as the outside of the cu and pb pipes indeed large amounts of deposits were found in most fittings the trends in apparent sanmr are the same as the trends observed in the pb concentrations for the various treatments for example the lowest apparent sanmr was associated with orthop treatment median 276 μg m2 vs 991 μg m2 for the control after 16hs in 100 pb pipes fig 4 a for the partial configurations fig 4b and c the calculation of the galvanic and the non galvanic sanmr better represents the mechanisms at play when adding corrosion control treatments the contribution of the galvanic sanmr was significant and highly variable between the partial pipe configurations for all water conditions tested the 10th and 90th percentile pb releases calculated based on median non galvanic rates varied greatly in the control condition between the cupb 589 and 34 608 μg m2 and the pbcu 2485 and 52 690 μg m2 configurations the mass of pb from the galvanic zone contributed to 73 median of the pbtotal mass in plsls treated with orthop in general the median galvanic sanmrs were greater for the cupb sulfate addition 839 μg m2 configuration than for the pbcu sulfate addition 161 μg m2 configuration the non galvanic sanmr accounting for the pb originating from the background zones of the pb pipes was considerably lower and less variable than the galvanic sanmr 15 3 fold for the cupb configuration treated with orthop interestingly plsls treated with sulfate show the lowest galvanic sanmr 7349 and 9499 μg m2 for the control vs 839 and 160 μg m2for the sulfate treated cupb and pbcu configurations respectively this can be attributed to better control of pbpart with the addition of sulfate which is reflected in lower levels of pbdiss and pbpart although significant particulate release remains fig 3 the high galvanic sanmr value highlights the acute pb concentrations that can potentially be present in the small volume of water at the junction of the pb and cu pipes 62 ml for 1 6 cm i d and 41 ml for 1 3 cm i d the median pb concentrations at this junction was found to reach 1271 cupb and 1643 μg l pbcu in a small volume of water while this high pb level is likely to be diluted during water usage at the faucet or sampling a volume of 250 ml would still carry a median of 314 cupb or 405 μg l pbcu it is noteworthy that an ingested dose of 175 μg of pb is defined as an acute health risk for lead contaminated toys uscpsc 2005 with the exception of sulfate treated water a dose exceeding 175 μg would indeed be delivered in the volume of water in contact with the galvanic zone 1208 and 1563 μg pb for the cupb and pbcu configurations for the control condition after 16hs calculated using median galvanic sanmr values 3 5 comparison of pb release between pilot and field investigations in parallel to the present pilot study a comprehensive field study was conducted in 112 households with flsls or plsls this previous report included a detailed longitudinal study before and after partial and complete lsl replacement at 25 sites deshommes et al 2016 2017 field and pilot study results can be compared by computing pb released after 6hs under the control condition and expressing them as a sanmr value given that the current pilot study was operated for 155 weeks we only considered the plslrs that were less than 2 years old from the previously published field study for the following comparison median pb release from 100 pb pipes after 6hs were 2 7 fold higher in the pilot pipes than in the field sites table 2 the following trend in sanmr values was observed in both pilot and field studies pbcu cupb 100 pb this comparison also shows that differences between pipe configurations are amplified at the pilot scale after plslrs field sanmrs for 100 pb pipes increased by 1 2 fold vs cupb pipes and 3 9 fold vs pbcu pipes while the pilot study revealed increases of 2 7 fold and 11 8 fold respectively the variability of pb release at the pilot scale is due to the high pbpart fraction this is exemplified by the high contribution of the particulate sanmr to the total pb sanmr estimates in the pilot as opposed to the field observations table 2 31 62 vs 4 4 11 6 the observed differences between pilot and field studies especially for pbpart levels can be explained by the following statements the method to estimate the pb release vary between the pilot and field studies in field investigations the pb mass in water is estimated from a concentration profile generated by sequential samplings at the tap as a result these measurements may also include pb contributions from sources such as brass or scale present within the premise plumbing inaccurate estimations of the premise piping or the lsl and the presence of faucet aerators that can trap pbpart may also influence pb estimations from in lsls in contrast directly sampling the lsls at the pilot scale only captures the contribution of the lsl and the galvanic connection and in turn may not provide an accurate depiction of an actual plumbing system when collecting a 2l sample we ensured that the complete volume of water stagnating within the lsl is collected thereby allowing a better estimation of the sanmr this is an advantage compared to residential sampling where there are contributions from multiple sources of lead brass scales etc within the premise plumbing water usage patterns differ considerably between pilot experiments and households desantis et al 2018 although water usages can also vary drastically between households del toral et al 2013 the pilot was continuously operated at a steady flow rate during the day for 8 h and then submitted to an extended stagnation every night and over the weekends small differences in water quality may cause significant changes to the leaching of pb into water the pilot setup was fed with dechlorinated water from a distribution system containing moderate levels of total iron which is the same distribution system as the one in which the field study was conducted the iron concentrations ranged from below detection limit to 141 4 μg fe l which is below the levels measured in the system s dead ends dias et al 2017 the maintenance of a chlorine residual impacts scale formation and composition while iron has been shown to be associated with elevated pbpart trueman and gagnon 2016 most importantly temperature fluctuations in the pilot study were more pronounced than what is experienced within buried pipes in the field during overnight stagnation the water temperature in the pilot pipes adjusted to room temperature moreover mechanical expansion and contraction of the pipes throughout the day might have disrupted scales and caused more intense particle detachment the detachment of scale deposits due to mechanical disturbances have been shown to increase pb concentrations in lsls del toral et al 2013 lewis et al 2017 the fate of pbpart in a pilot pipe loop may differ between households pbpart released from an lsl or a galvanic connection may not reach the kitchen sampling faucet in households as previously demonstrated deshommes et al 2017 indeed complex premise plumbing may trap and redistribute pb particles to the multiple points of use in a household in our pilot study we consider that most of particles are captured by sampling despite using the same fittings as the utility their installation in the pilot study could have been different depending on how tightly they were assembled furthermore the pilot pipes are not buried in the ground as such they experience different vibrations and movements compared to household pipes deshommes et al 2017 our findings show the importance of using both a pressurized pilot system constructed with harvested lsls and field samplings to identify pb release trends following changes to water quality and corrosion control treatments our data also reveals the limitations of using a pilot study to predict pb levels at the consumer s tap some of these limitations could be overcome by implementing more realistic water usage patterns at the pilot scale and by better assessing pbpart release in households deshommes et al 2017 3 6 managerial implication of partial lsl replacement the main concern for utilities is whether plslr would increase lead concentrations at the consumer s tap the present study contributes new knowledge to help determine whether plslr will be beneficial in a distribution system given its pre existing water quality it is clear that removing part of an lsl in order to reduce pb levels may not compensate for the added pb released at a new galvanic connection fig 5 shows the interplay between the non galvanic release as a function of remaining length of pb pipe and the constant contribution of the galvanic connection using data acquired from the partial configurations it is possible to determine the equivalence point at which the addition of a galvanic connection will not increase the mass of pb released from the service line table 3 provides the approximate length of pb pipe that need to be removed to balance pb release from a new galvanic connection using both the median and 90th percentile sanmr values 90th percentile values could be considered as the periods of peak pb release from a group of lsls operated in the same configuration these equivalence points vary significantly depending on the corrosion control treatment when sulfate is added to decrease csmr a plslr of less than 0 8 m using the 90th percentile sanmr offsets the additional pb released from galvanic corrosion in contrast orthop treatment requires the greatest length of lsl to be removed in order to offset the pb released by galvanic corrosion 2 4 m using the median sanmr and 49 3 m using the 90th percentile table 3 this may be because 1 orthop resulted in the highest galvanic sanmr which was primarily explained by pbpart release or 2 orthop is highly effective in removing pbdiss prior to plslr following the plslr depending on the corrosion control treatment implemented by the utility the maximum length of pb remaining to observe benefits will vary depending on the contribution from the galvanic lead release one of the key questions for utilities is whether they should conduct plslr when the owner cannot be required to replace the private section of the lsl in the case of the utility studied an average length of 7 5 m of pb pipe is removed by the city during plslrs according to the 90th percentile sanmr for the pbcu configuration a minimum length of 3 8 m would need to be removed to offset the adverse effects from galvanic contribution 3 7 options for utilities to decrease pb concentrations a decision framework to assist utilities in addressing managerial implications of new and legacy plsl including remedial actions is presented in fig 6 in order to draft a management plan for lsls utilities must complete an inventory of flsls and plsls on their territory this can be accomplished by obtaining households years of construction and the historical use of pb for service lines within the distribution system deshommes et al 2016 a field study should be conducted to estimate pb release from flsls and plsls in sentinel homes including new and legacy plslrs the resulting data will provide an estimate of galvanic and non galvanic sanmr determining the length of pb pipe to be removed to offset the addition of galvanic corrosion full lsl replacement should be the preferred approach if this is not possible utilities should aim to decrease galvanic corrosion by selecting materials such as pvc pipes or dielectric couplings deshommes et al 2017 wang et al 2013 after any intervention whether full or partial replacement extensive flushing should be mandatory as acute exposure can result from pipe disturbances del toral et al 2013 deshommes et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 for new and legacy plsls sanmrs can be used to estimate the likelihood of an increase in pb concentrations if partial replacements are likely to increase pb concentrations a corrosion control treatment optimization process should be initiated to adjust the corrosion control treatment in order to meet regulated targeted pb levels it is important to note that the findings of this study reflect the water quality and scale structure specific to montreal s water distribution system and cannot be directly translated to any other system although our results show that some corrosion control treatments can be effective at decreasing pb concentrations in both flsls and plsls other treatments are only adequate for one of the two pipe configurations as a consequence the best long term solution is undoubtedly the complete removal of the lsl when full lsl replacement is possible temporary mitigation measures should be implemented to decrease exposure to pb until all replacements are complete once a full replacement has been completed extensive flushing protocols should be implemented to remove pbpart awwa 2017 deshommes et al 2016 deshommes et al 2017 4 conclusion trends of higher pb concentrations released from plsls than from flsls are sustained through time 155 weeks as partial configurations released systematically higher pb concentrations than the full lead service lines the addition of orthop was not efficient to control pbpart release from galvanic corrosion in plsls but decreased pbdiss in flsls under the water conditions tested orthop is a sub optimal choice to control pb release from both plsls and flsls as it was linked to increases in particulate pb decreasing csmr by sulfate addition was the most efficient treatment to decrease pb concentrations from plsls due to its impact on pbpart but it was not a viable solution to decrease pb in flsls sanmr values are useful to determine when a partial replacement is unlikely to increase the mass of pb released and to determine the minimum length of lead pipe that should be removed to compensate for the addition of a galvanic junction pilot studies can be used as a proxy to determine the relative effectiveness of corrosion control treatments on pb release in flsls and plsls but they cannot predict true pb levels at the tap corrosion control treatment efficiency depends on the configuration of the lsl utilities should take into account the number of flsls and plsls before selecting their corrosion control strategy corrosion control treatment and or flsl treatment solutions should be carefully selected to ensure risk reduction for both flsls and plsls this work contributes to knowledge by comparing different corrosion control treatments on one specific water quality and 3

19171,long term 155 weeks pb concentrations following partial lead service lines replacements plslr were measured in a flow through pilot made of harvested lead service lines lsl from the distribution system of the city of montreal the present study also investigates how release of pb from full and partial lsls is influenced by pipe diameter decrease in chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr from 0 9 to 0 3 addition of orthophosphate 1 mg p l and increase in ph to 8 3 pb concentrations were measured after 16 h of stagnation and under flow conditions in this study pb concentrations did not decrease in the long term after partial lsl replacement moreover the most effective corrosion control treatment in full lsls was the addition of orthop in contrast the decrease of the csmr best reduced lead release from partial lsls the impact of pipe configuration therefore influenced the effectiveness of corrosion control treatments it is noteworthy that the increase in pb concentrations following plslr were attributed to particulate pb release from the galvanic section of the pipe the occurrence of galvanic corrosion caused by the connection between pb and copper pipes adds a new source of pb in the partial lsl at least this new source of lead has to be offset by the removal of a long enough section of lsl during plslr full lsl replacements may be warranted to minimize the exposure of consumers to elevated pb levels caused by galvanic corrosion in lsls keywords lead service line partial lead service line replacement corrosion control orthophosphate csmr drinking water 1 introduction it is estimated that over 5 5 million lead service lines lsl are responsible for providing water to approximately 15 22 million americans cornwell et al 2016 and a major contributor 50 75 to sources of pb in tap water cartier et al 2011 levallois et al 2013 sandvig et al 2008 a survey of 21 canadian 20 and american 1 utilities revealed that the number of lsls varies between 50 and 69 000 per utility which represents 1 22 of service lines deshommes et al 2018 the replacement of lsls is a mitigation strategy used by utilities to decrease pb concentrations at the tap in the united states under the lead and copper rule lcr utilities exceeding the lead action level after implementing appropriate corrosion control cc must replace lead service lines usepa 2007 due to shared ownership of service lines utilities replace the public portion of lsls leaving the private section unmodified this action is termed a partial lsl replacement plslr to date only a few american cities such as madison and milwaukee have prohibited plslrs schock et al 2014 slabaugh 2017 field studies on lsls and the impact of plslr on pb concentrations are limited and are mostly short term studies spanning less than 6 months brown and cornwell 2015 camara et al 2013 lewis et al 2017 trueman et al 2016 the few long term north american studies available in the literature report an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in pb levels after plslr deshommes et al 2016 2017 muylwyk et al 2011 swertfeger et al 2006 a similar trend was observed in scottish households where the lsls contained a section of copper cu britton and richards 1981 short and long term pilot studies using new or harvested lsls have shown that plslrs can lead to spikes in particulate pb pbpart the level of pbpart detected is influenced by the presence of corrosion inhibitors flow rate type of coupling stagnation time prior to sampling and type of scales present in lsls arnold and edwards 2012 cartier et al 2012a cartier et al 2013 schock 1990 st clair et al 2016 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 corrosion control treatments often used as a mean to reduce lead levels from full flsls and partial lsls plsls include the addition of phosphates cartier et al 2013 edwards and mcneill 2002 kogo et al 2017 mcneill and edwards 2004 trueman et al 2018 wasserstrom et al 2017 xie and giammar 2011 ph adjustment cartier et al 2013 kim et al 2011 xie and giammar 2011 changing the chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr cartier et al 2013 edwards and

treatments can vary depending on water quality and the pipe configuration as scales that forms inside plsls are different from that in flsls desantis et al 2018 the coagulant used by utilities can influence the csmr and therefore the lead release edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 overall the application of orthop has been highly successful in reducing 90 of total pb pbtotal cardew 2009 and pb solubility trueman et al 2018 wasserstrom et al 2017 however cardew 2009 states that orthop may not be a good cc treatment for the reduction of particulate pb as pbpart spikes were found to persist post treatment pbpart is the main concern associated with galvanic corrosion after plslr triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 pilot scale studies using harvested flsls found that the addition of orthop resulted in a 68 decrease in pbtotal concentrations following 16 h of stagnation cartier et al 2013 and caused a 70 decrease in dissolved pb pbdiss edwards and mcneill 2002 in new conditioned pb pipes orthop maintained pbdiss below 15 μg l following 8 h of stagnation xie and giammar 2011 however in plsl at pilot scale orthop caused a 13 fold increase in pbtotal concentrations cartier et al 2013 attributable to pbpart release in field studies pbpart release has been observed to be erratic and unpredictable as it depends on scale detachment cardew 2009 orthop decreased pb concentrations in new pb pipes galvanically connected to cu pipes mcneill and edwards 2004 similarly orthop decreased pb concentrations 5 3 fold for high csmr and low conductivity water in harvested lsls independently of the presence of galvanic connections to cu pipes in a recirculating system kogo et al 2017 in the presence of galvanic corrosion a csmr lower than 0 77 can protect the pb anode of the galvanic couple nguyen et al 2011a in agreement with the threshold of 0 6 presented in edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 however an increase in the csmr associated with the presence of galvanic corrosion also reportedly exacerbated pb release in pilot scale experiments edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 nguyen et al 2010 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 on the other hand the addition of sulfate better controlled pb concentrations in simulated plslrs but did not significantly change pb concentrations released from flsls cartier et al 2013 at bench scale changing coagulants alum vs pacl decreased the csmr and increased pb concentrations in harvested lsls galvanically connected to cu pipes knowles et al 2015 the solubility of pb decreases as ph increases resulting in lower soluble pb concentrations in water kim et al 2011 schock and gardels 1983 the interplay between ph and alkalinity as well as the drop in ph observed at the junction of pbcu pipes is an important determinant of lead release into water desantis et al 2018 increasing the ph from 7 1 to 7 8 in a pipe loop experiment using harvested lsls resulted in a decrease of the total pb concentration kim et al 2011 however increasing the ph of flsls from 7 7 to 8 3 did not significantly decrease pb concentrations cartier et al 2013 pilot studies using plastic couplings to connect pb and cu pipes induced galvanic corrosion by connecting them using a wire which allows measurement of the galvanic current between the pipes arnold and edwards 2012 knowles et al 2015 kogo et al 2017 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 in this experimental model the type of connector utilized caused significant differences in the galvanic corrosion of the exposed surface pilot studies using external wires to induce a galvanic current between the cu and the pb pipes may not be representative of real conditions at the galvanic connection as shown by wang et al 2013 notably lower pb concentrations have been measured using this technique than with a brass coupling wang et al 2013 numerous pilot studies have been completed using recirculating pipe loops which are not representative of reality as pb can accumulate in the recirculating water the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the long term effectiveness of corrosion control treatments on harvested flsls and plsls follow up of cartier et al 2013 under flow conditions and after 16 h of stagnation 2 verify the impact of pipe configurations on pb release 3 determine the minimum pb pipe length that needs to be removed during a plslr in order to offset the additional release of pb caused by galvanic corrosion to the best of our knowledge this investigation provides the first controlled comparison of pb release from partial lsls at pilot scale and in households prior to and after plslr 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot setup and operation the pilot setup used for this study is described in cartier et al 2013 it consists of aged pb pipes harvested from the city of montreal and installed in a large building fed with water from the same distribution system fig s1 in supplementary information this study presents the long term 155 weeks pb release after plslr simulation whereas cartier et al 2013 presented the short term 11 weeks results three pipe configurations were tested 1 a 3 m long aged lsl 100 pb 2 a 1 8 m copper pipe type m connected upstream of an aged lsl of 0 6 m using a red brass compression fitting ford wabash indiana usa simulating a cupb configuration and 3 a 0 6 m aged lsl connected to a 1 8 m copper pipe with a red brass compression fitting pbcu configuration water entering the pilot setup prior to modification had a ph of 7 9 alkalinity of 90 mg caco3 l hardness of 119 mg caco3 l chloride concentration of 24 5 mg l sulfate concentration of 26 mg l four water conditions were tested 1 control csmr 0 9 no added phosphate ph 7 9 2 high sulfate by addition of na2so4 csmr 0 3 and ph 7 9 3 orthophosphate orthop dosed at 1 mg p l with h3po4 and naoh for ph re stabilization csmr 0 9 ph 7 9 4 ph of 8 3 adjusted using naoh csmr 0 9 which was the ph resulting from the switch from gaseous chlorine to on site generation of sodium hypochlorite for the distribution system of montreal table 1 the internal diameter i d of the lead pipes were 16 mm the fifth condition tested consisted of lead pipes of a smaller internal diameter of 13 mm carrying control water in the last conditions partial lsls plsl were connected to the copper pipe using a soldered red brass fitting for the plsl configurations the internal volume of the lead pipes was 120 ml i d 16 mm or 80 ml i d 13 mm and for the full lsl configuration it was 600 ml i d 16 mm or 400 ml i d 13 mm initially all pipe configurations and treatments were tested in triplicates n 45 normal operating conditions consisted of water flowing at 5 lpm litres per minute 30 psi for 8 h per day 5 days per week without stagnation exceeding 72 h except during stagnation and high velocity flushing trials a flow rate of 5 lpm was selected as it is the representative flow rate of a kitchen faucet kogo et al 2017 welter 2016 2 2 sampling prior to each sampling event while the pilot was under normal operating conditions sampling valves were flushed for at least 30 s to remove particles that may have accumulated between sampling events as described in cartier et al 2013 and fig s1 water is flowing from the cupb configuration to the 100 pb and the pbcu for each water quality tested to avoid contribution from upstream pipes the flow pattern was modified the day before sampling to bring fresh water directly from the storage tank into each section of the pipes cupb 100 pb pbcu sampling valves were then flushed at 5 lpm for 30 s to remove particles that may have accumulated between sampling events each section of the pilot was then operated for 30 min at 5 lpm per pipe stagnation was then initiated samples after stagnation were collected applying the same flow rate as the operation rate 5 lpm except for the section with a smaller diameter 15 lpm the volume of each sample collected was of 2 l samples to ensure complete recovery of the water stagnating in the lead pipes cartier et al 2013 dissolved lead concentrations were measured by filtering a 40 ml aliquot using a 0 45 μm pvdf filter seti international scientific canada metal concentrations were monitored after a 16 h stagnation 16hs period and a 6 h stagnation 6hs period water pressure remained constant 30 psi inside the rigs during stagnation flowing sampling was conducted under pressurized conditions samples were collected every 30 min 3 samples after a one hour flush 2 3 water quality monitoring samples for total and dissolved metal measurements were acidified with 0 5 hno3 prior to analysis 0 5 hcl was also added to obtain the appropriate matrix metal concentrations cu pb zn fe were measured in an iso179025

chromatography and phosphate flow injection quikchem 8500 concentrations were monitored monthly all measurements were carried out on both flowing and stagnant samples 16hs to ensure adequate dosing of chemicals monthly samples were analysed for orthop chloride and sulfate concentrations every time a feeding solution was prepared for the pipes with the ph adjustment to 8 3 following thorough flushing of the piping between the metering pump and the water intake of the pilot samples were collected adjustment in the flow of the metered pump was made until a ph of 8 3 0 05 was achieved for the pipes treated with an addition of orthop to ensure that the ph was the same as the one from the water intake samples were collected in the same way as for the ph 8 3 pipes when the ph of the water feeding the orthop treated pipes was too low naoh concentrated solution was added until the target ph was obtained 2 4 statistical analysis non parametric statistical analysis including the kruskal wallis anova test were performed using statistica statsoft version 13 3 differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise 2 5 surface area normalized mass release sanmr calculations for each pipe the surface area normalized mass release sanmr measured after 16hs was calculated using pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart adapted from mcfadden et al 2011 the pb piping and galvanic corrosion are presumed to be the major contributors of pb in samples the incoming concentration of pbtotal from the dilution water was 0 4 μg l sanmr is expressed as μg of pb per m2 of pb pipe exposed to water for flsls the sanmr is considered to be the same throughout the pipe it is calculated by dividing the mass of pb measured in each sample by the internal surface area of the pb pipe for plsls the sanmr includes the release from the galvanic connection at the junction of the pb and cu pipes the brass fitting and the pb section free of galvanic corrosion it is calculated using the following equation 1 apparent sanmr background sanmr galvanic sanmr where the apparent sanmr is computed from the measured mass of pb per internal surface area of the pb pipe μg m2 the background sanmr is computed from the mass of pb per internal surface area of the pb pipe μg m2 released from each pipe before the simulated plslr the galvanic sanmr is computed as the difference between mass of the apparent and background sanmrs over the internal surface containing galvanic corrosion the galvanic zone is comprised of the brass fitting and the flanking 2 cm regions of cu and pb immediately next to the fitting both on the inside and the outside of the pipes thereby encompassing all the surfaces that are in contact with water at the galvanic junction fig 1 our visual observations and a previous report suggest that scale formed beyond the 2 cm of pipe included in the galvanic junction are markedly different desantis et al 2018 the non galvanic background sanmr value used in the aforementioned calculation is based on the median pb concentrations after 16hs measured before plslr simulation for each pipe apparent sanmr was also calculated for samplings after 6hs 2 6 field monitoring of lsl households apparent sanmr for houses with flsls and plsls was computed using the estimated mass of pb pipes contributing to the pb concentration in sequential samples collected after 6hs deshommes et al 2016 2017 a total of 25 houses were used for this calculation with 1 13 sampling profiles per house 9 flsls 51 profiles 11 recent cupb configurations 51 profiles 3 aged cupb configurations 33 profiles 1 recent pbcu configuration 1 profile and 4 aged pbcu configurations 24 profiles the houses were located in the same distribution system as the one from which the harvested lsls and water for the pilot were from water temperature ranged from 17 5 to 24 9 c mean ph and alkalinity were of 7 6 and 86 mg caco3 l deshommes et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in total pb concentrations over time mirroring the previous 11 week study cartier et al 2013 we report that the total lead pbtotal levels did not decrease during the 155 weeks following partial lead service line replacement plslr simulation fig 2 pbtotal varied over time with peak concentrations attributed to the presence of particulate pb pbpart median pbpart fraction in cupb and pbcu configurations was 67 for all treatments pb levels were best stabilized when sulfate was added to water in both the full lead service line flsl 10th 90th percentile 55 7 99 2 μg pbtotal l and partial lead service line plsl 10th 90th percentile cupb 16 0 66 3 μg pbtotal l configurations table 1 and fig 2c similar to cartier et al 2013 orthophosphate orthop treatment caused the highest and most variable pb concentrations in plsls spanning up to 3 orders of magnitude table 1 3 2 impact of treatments on pb concentrations after stagnation and under flow conditions the effectiveness of corrosion control treatments in reducing pb concentrations varied depending on the pipe configuration and type of sampling 16 h of stagnation vs flowing samples as expected the median pbtotal dissolved pb pbdiss and pbpart concentrations were lower under flow conditions than after 16hs and the 100 pb pipes released the lowest pb concentrations table 1 and fig 3 3 2 1 full lead service lines flsls after 16hs pbtotal between the control sulfate treatment and ph 8 3 samples was statistically similar median of 79 5 vs 76 7 vs 84 1 μg pbtotal l respectively figs 2 and 3 pbtotal was best reduced by orthop treatment both after stagnation 3 8 fold median of 20 8 vs 79 5 μg pbtotal l and under flowing conditions 3 9 fold 0 43 vs 1 7 μg pbtotal l table 1 and fig 3 this observed 73 decrease is consistent with short term post plslr studies reporting a 68 cartier et al 2013 or 70 edwards and mcneill 2002 decrease in pb concentrations under similar conditions or in a dump and fill experiment respectively we also found that pbdiss was reduced by orthop treatment in agreement with xie and giammar 2011 in contrast orthop failed to decrease pbpart 11 4 vs 10 5 μg pbpart l control vs orthop respectively thereby contradicting a previous dump and fill study using new pb pipes mcneill and edwards 2004 but in agreement with the findings of xie and giammar 2011 the increase in the particulate pb fraction is comparable to faucets and brass materials treated with orthop 0 8 mg p l with reported increases from 31 to 54 cartier et al 2012b mixed metals present in alloys can result in galvanic corrosion such as is the case in partial lsls when orthop is the corrosion control treatment pb phosphate compounds such as hydroxypyromorphite trueman et al 2018 are expected to be formed when these forms are present they may to contribute less to exposure because of the very low bioavailability as compared to other forms present deshommes et al 2012 xie and giammar 2011 after 16hs there were no significant differences in pbpart concentrations except for the smaller diameter condition indeed highest pbpart was recorded under this condition 8 fold higher vs control the increase in pbpart under this condition could be attributed to increased flow velocity relative to the control also the difference in pbpart between the smaller diameter and the control condition can be explained by the different types of fittings used for both conditions soldered vs compression fittings in terms of pbpart fraction smaller diameter pipes 67 1 and orthop treatment 59 8 also exhibited the highest values among all conditions tested all other conditions were comparable in terms of particulate pb fraction it is also noteworthy that the addition of sulfate decreased both the 90th percentile pbpart 31 7 vs 115 8 μg pbpart l sulfate vs control fig 3e and pbpart fraction 41 0 vs 66 1 the median pbtotal was 48 69 fold lower under flow conditions compared to 16hs table 1 corroborating a previous study we report that an increase in water ph did not cause changes to pb levels under flowing or stagnation conditions kim et al 2011 3 2 2 partial lead service lines plsls in contrast to the short term study results cartier et al 2013 we observed that pipe configuration affected pb release over the long term 155 weeks nevertheless the high level of pb detected post plslr at 11 weeks cartier et al 2013 persisted through to 155 weeks for both partial configurations sulfate treatment which decreases the csmr from 0 9 to 0 3 yielded the lowest pbtotal concentrations for both partial configurations cupb and pbcu after 16hs the addition of sulfate reduced pbtotal by 1 8 fold cupb and 3 2 fold pbcu relative to the control condition comparably to flsls we observed that orthop decreased median pbdiss concentrations by 4 1 fold in cupb rigs 18 5 vs 4 5 μg pbdiss l and by 5 8 fold in pbcu rigs 38 8 vs 6 7 μg pbdiss l fig 1 after 16hs the same trend was observed for samples collected under flowing conditions table 1 pbtotal concentrations in plsls were higher relative to 100 pb pipes after stagnation for the pipes treated with the addition of orthop this is caused by spikes of both the concentration and fraction of pbpart which are not controlled by the addition of orthop the pbpart fractions for the control and orthop treatments were 61 and 85 in the cupb configuration and 49 and 80 in the pbcu configuration respectively this increase in pbpart is in line with a reported increase observed in a recirculating pipe loop comprising pbcu galvanic couples and fed by chlorinated water treated with 2 mg p l of orthop arnold and edwards 2012 however orthop was also shown to decrease pbtotal and pbdiss more effectively than pbpart in harvested plsls partial and pvc pb kogo et al 2017 lowering the csmr was effective in controlling the pbpart concentration and fraction after 16hs and under flowing conditions table 1 and fig 3 this is in accordance with prior bench scale studies nguyen et al 2010 when compared to the control condition pbpart concentrations were 5 4 fold lower for both the cupb 28 5 vs 5 3 μg pbpart l and pbcu 31 1 vs 5 8 μg pbpart l configurations under low csmr increasing the csmr 0 1 1 0 using 50 50 pb tin coupons galvanically connected to copper has been shown to dramatically increase pb concentrations nguyen et al 2011b indicating that the csmr should be a concern to utilities with plslrs increasing sulfate concentrations has been shown to reduce galvanic currents in copper pipes containing solder joints thereby reducing the pb release arising from galvanic corrosion nguyen et al 2010 if ph adjustment was applied for corrosion control a higher ph set point than 8 3 would be desirable to achieve lead reduction moreover corrosion control guidance by the usepa does not recommend adjustments between 8 and 8 5 based on concerns over the instability of scale composition between cerussite and hydrocerussite a target ph of 8 8 10 is recommended when ph control is the corrosion control approach usepa 2016 as utilities consider switching from gaseous chlorine to onsite hypochlorite generation small increases of ph are to be expected with the water quality the unintended consequence of increasing the ph to 8 3 at short and medium term at pilot scale on full and partial lsl provided some anticipated release in the field distribution system under the conditions tested in the present study the optimal corrosion control treatment for flsls and plsls are different utilities should therefore identify the corrosion control treatment which would be effective for all lead service line configurations in general the most beneficial corrosion control treatment for flsls was orthop treatment while decreasing the csmr yielded the best results within plsls 3 3 impact of pipe configuration after 16hs the 100 pb pipes released less pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart when adjusting for pipe length compared to both partial configurations under all tested conditions fig s1 under the control condition the median pbtotal concentration linearized for pipe length in 100 pb pipes was 2 9 fold lower than in cupb pipes and 5 1 fold lower than in pbcu pipes cartier et al 2013 previously observed that pb release was higher in plsls shortly after plslr similar observations have been reported in plslr field studies trueman et al 2016 and lab experiments st clair et al 2016 triantafyllidou and edwards 2011 wang et al 2012 using diverse water conditions in contrast to our findings one field study completed in the same distribution system reported that pb concentrations were lower in houses with plsls than flsls when a plslr was completed less than 2 years ago 90th percentile after 15 min of stagnation 11 18 μg l for plsls vs 11 25 μg l for flsls deshommes et al 2016 these lower levels persisted in older plslr completed 2 years ago partial replacements deshommes et al 2017 contrasts between our findings and other published work can be explained by differences in legacy scales present in the harvested lsls scale composition reflects the history of water qualities which these pipes were exposed over time schock and lytle 2011 the pbpart fraction measured in both partial configurations for each treatment were statistically similar after 16hs the control condition orthop treatment and high ph released statistically lower pbpart fractions in the flsl than in the partial configurations after 16hs as also reported by cartier et al 2013 under flowing conditions the pbpart fraction was similar for all conditions and treatments confirming that the effects of galvanic corrosion are mostly observed after stagnation furthermore the pbpart fraction decreases drastically under flowing condition as compared to 16hs example 37 vs 85 for the cupb configuration treated with orthop under flow conditions pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart concentrations per metre of pipe were statistically similar for both partial configurations unlike the 16hs samples 3 4 surface area normalized mass release sanmr while the sanmr within 100 pb pipes is assumed to be homogenous throughout its length this is a simplified model of reality as the scale layers within a pipe are usually non uniform desantis et al 2018 wasserstrom et al 2017 we defined the galvanic zone based on visually apparent changes to the scales fig 1 2 cm on the pb and cu pipes flanking the fitting which corresponded to a projected surface area of 107 cm2 for pipes with an internal diameter i d of 16 mm and 86 cm2 for pipes with an i d of 13 mm fig 1 and fig s2 show that corrosion deposits can be abundant on the inside as well as the outside of the cu and pb pipes indeed large amounts of deposits were found in most fittings the trends in apparent sanmr are the same as the trends observed in the pb concentrations for the various treatments for example the lowest apparent sanmr was associated with orthop treatment median 276 μg m2 vs 991 μg m2 for the control after 16hs in 100 pb pipes fig 4 a for the partial configurations fig 4b and c the calculation of the galvanic and the non galvanic sanmr better represents the mechanisms at play when adding corrosion control treatments the contribution of the galvanic sanmr was significant and highly variable between the partial pipe configurations for all water conditions tested the 10th and 90th percentile pb releases calculated based on median non galvanic rates varied greatly in the control condition between the cupb 589 and 34 608 μg m2 and the pbcu 2485 and 52 690 μg m2 configurations the mass of pb from the galvanic zone contributed to 73 median of the pbtotal mass in plsls treated with orthop in general the median galvanic sanmrs were greater for the cupb sulfate addition 839 μg m2 configuration than for the pbcu sulfate addition 161 μg m2 configuration the non galvanic sanmr accounting for the pb originating from the background zones of the pb pipes was considerably lower and less variable than the galvanic sanmr 15 3 fold for the cupb configuration treated with orthop interestingly plsls treated with sulfate show the lowest galvanic sanmr 7349 and 9499 μg m2 for the control vs 839 and 160 μg m2for the sulfate treated cupb and pbcu configurations respectively this can be attributed to better control of pbpart with the addition of sulfate which is reflected in lower levels of pbdiss and pbpart although significant particulate release remains fig 3 the high galvanic sanmr value highlights the acute pb concentrations that can potentially be present in the small volume of water at the junction of the pb and cu pipes 62 ml for 1 6 cm i d and 41 ml for 1 3 cm i d the median pb concentrations at this junction was found to reach 1271 cupb and 1643 μg l pbcu in a small volume of water while this high pb level is likely to be diluted during water usage at the faucet or sampling a volume of 250 ml would still carry a median of 314 cupb or 405 μg l pbcu it is noteworthy that an ingested dose of 175 μg of pb is defined as an acute health risk for lead contaminated toys uscpsc 2005 with the exception of sulfate treated water a dose exceeding 175 μg would indeed be delivered in the volume of water in contact with the galvanic zone 1208 and 1563 μg pb for the cupb and pbcu configurations for the control condition after 16hs calculated using median galvanic sanmr values 3 5 comparison of pb release between pilot and field investigations in parallel to the present pilot study a comprehensive field study was conducted in 112 households with flsls or plsls this previous report included a detailed longitudinal study before and after partial and complete lsl replacement at 25 sites deshommes et al 2016 2017 field and pilot study results can be compared by computing pb released after 6hs under the control condition and expressing them as a sanmr value given that the current pilot study was operated for 155 weeks we only considered the plslrs that were less than 2 years old from the previously published field study for the following comparison median pb release from 100 pb pipes after 6hs were 2 7 fold higher in the pilot pipes than in the field sites table 2 the following trend in sanmr values was observed in both pilot and field studies pbcu cupb 100 pb this comparison also shows that differences between pipe configurations are amplified at the pilot scale after plslrs field sanmrs for 100 pb pipes increased by 1 2 fold vs cupb pipes and 3 9 fold vs pbcu pipes while the pilot study revealed increases of 2 7 fold and 11 8 fold respectively the variability of pb release at the pilot scale is due to the high pbpart fraction this is exemplified by the high contribution of the particulate sanmr to the total pb sanmr estimates in the pilot as opposed to the field observations table 2 31 62 vs 4 4 11 6 the observed differences between pilot and field studies especially for pbpart levels can be explained by the following statements the method to estimate the pb release vary between the pilot and field studies in field investigations the pb mass in water is estimated from a concentration profile generated by sequential samplings at the tap as a result these measurements may also include pb contributions from sources such as brass or scale present within the premise plumbing inaccurate estimations of the premise piping or the lsl and the presence of faucet aerators that can trap pbpart may also influence pb estimations from in lsls in contrast directly sampling the lsls at the pilot scale only captures the contribution of the lsl and the galvanic connection and in turn may not provide an accurate depiction of an actual plumbing system when collecting a 2l sample we ensured that the complete volume of water stagnating within the lsl is collected thereby allowing a better estimation of the sanmr this is an advantage compared to residential sampling where there are contributions from multiple sources of lead brass scales etc within the premise plumbing water usage patterns differ considerably between pilot experiments and households desantis et al 2018 although water usages can also vary drastically between households del toral et al 2013 the pilot was continuously operated at a steady flow rate during the day for 8 h and then submitted to an extended stagnation every night and over the weekends small differences in water quality may cause significant changes to the leaching of pb into water the pilot setup was fed with dechlorinated water from a distribution system containing moderate levels of total iron which is the same distribution system as the one in which the field study was conducted the iron concentrations ranged from below detection limit to 141 4 μg fe l which is below the levels measured in the system s dead ends dias et al 2017 the maintenance of a chlorine residual impacts scale formation and composition while iron has been shown to be associated with elevated pbpart trueman and gagnon 2016 most importantly temperature fluctuations in the pilot study were more pronounced than what is experienced within buried pipes in the field during overnight stagnation the water temperature in the pilot pipes adjusted to room temperature moreover mechanical expansion and contraction of the pipes throughout the day might have disrupted scales and caused more intense particle detachment the detachment of scale deposits due to mechanical disturbances have been shown to increase pb concentrations in lsls del toral et al 2013 lewis et al 2017 the fate of pbpart in a pilot pipe loop may differ between households pbpart released from an lsl or a galvanic connection may not reach the kitchen sampling faucet in households as previously demonstrated deshommes et al 2017 indeed complex premise plumbing may trap and redistribute pb particles to the multiple points of use in a household in our pilot study we consider that most of particles are captured by sampling despite using the same fittings as the utility their installation in the pilot study could have been different depending on how tightly they were assembled furthermore the pilot pipes are not buried in the ground as such they experience different vibrations and movements compared to household pipes deshommes et al 2017 our findings show the importance of using both a pressurized pilot system constructed with harvested lsls and field samplings to identify pb release trends following changes to water quality and corrosion control treatments our data also reveals the limitations of using a pilot study to predict pb levels at the consumer s tap some of these limitations could be overcome by implementing more realistic water usage patterns at the pilot scale and by better assessing pbpart release in households deshommes et al 2017 3 6 managerial implication of partial lsl replacement the main concern for utilities is whether plslr would increase lead concentrations at the consumer s tap the present study contributes new knowledge to help determine whether plslr will be beneficial in a distribution system given its pre existing water quality it is clear that removing part of an lsl in order to reduce pb levels may not compensate for the added pb released at a new galvanic connection fig 5 shows the interplay between the non galvanic release as a function of remaining length of pb pipe and the constant contribution of the galvanic connection using data acquired from the partial configurations it is possible to determine the equivalence point at which the addition of a galvanic connection will not increase the mass of pb released from the service line table 3 provides the approximate length of pb pipe that need to be removed to balance pb release from a new galvanic connection using both the median and 90th percentile sanmr values 90th percentile values could be considered as the periods of peak pb release from a group of lsls operated in the same configuration these equivalence points vary significantly depending on the corrosion control treatment when sulfate is added to decrease csmr a plslr of less than 0 8 m using the 90th percentile sanmr offsets the additional pb released from galvanic corrosion in contrast orthop treatment requires the greatest length of lsl to be removed in order to offset the pb released by galvanic corrosion 2 4 m using the median sanmr and 49 3 m using the 90th percentile table 3 this may be because 1 orthop resulted in the highest galvanic sanmr which was primarily explained by pbpart release or 2 orthop is highly effective in removing pbdiss prior to plslr following the plslr depending on the corrosion control treatment implemented by the utility the maximum length of pb remaining to observe benefits will vary depending on the contribution from the galvanic lead release one of the key questions for utilities is whether they should conduct plslr when the owner cannot be required to replace the private section of the lsl in the case of the utility studied an average length of 7 5 m of pb pipe is removed by the city during plslrs according to the 90th percentile sanmr for the pbcu configuration a minimum length of 3 8 m would need to be removed to offset the adverse effects from galvanic contribution 3 7 options for utilities to decrease pb concentrations a decision framework to assist utilities in addressing managerial implications of new and legacy plsl including remedial actions is presented in fig 6 in order to draft a management plan for lsls utilities must complete an inventory of flsls and plsls on their territory this can be accomplished by obtaining households years of construction and the historical use of pb for service lines within the distribution system deshommes et al 2016 a field study should be conducted to estimate pb release from flsls and plsls in sentinel homes including new and legacy plslrs the resulting data will provide an estimate of galvanic and non galvanic sanmr determining the length of pb pipe to be removed to offset the addition of galvanic corrosion full lsl replacement should be the preferred approach if this is not possible utilities should aim to decrease galvanic corrosion by selecting materials such as pvc pipes or dielectric couplings deshommes et al 2017 wang et al 2013 after any intervention whether full or partial replacement extensive flushing should be mandatory as acute exposure can result from pipe disturbances del toral et al 2013 deshommes et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 for new and legacy plsls sanmrs can be used to estimate the likelihood of an increase in pb concentrations if partial replacements are likely to increase pb concentrations a corrosion control treatment optimization process should be initiated to adjust the corrosion control treatment in order to meet regulated targeted pb levels it is important to note that the findings of this study reflect the water quality and scale structure specific to montreal s water distribution system and cannot be directly translated to any other system although our results show that some corrosion control treatments can be effective at decreasing pb concentrations in both flsls and plsls other treatments are only adequate for one of the two pipe configurations as a consequence the best long term solution is undoubtedly the complete removal of the lsl when full lsl replacement is possible temporary mitigation measures should be implemented to decrease exposure to pb until all replacements are complete once a full replacement has been completed extensive flushing protocols should be implemented to remove pbpart awwa 2017 deshommes et al 2016 deshommes et al 2017 4 conclusion trends of higher pb concentrations released from plsls than from flsls are sustained through time 155 weeks as partial configurations released systematically higher pb concentrations than the full lead service lines the addition of orthop was not efficient to control pbpart release from galvanic corrosion in plsls but decreased pbdiss in flsls under the water conditions tested orthop is a sub optimal choice to control pb release from both plsls and flsls as it was linked to increases in particulate pb decreasing csmr by sulfate addition was the most efficient treatment to decrease pb concentrations from plsls due to its impact on pbpart but it was not a viable solution to decrease pb in flsls sanmr values are useful to determine when a partial replacement is unlikely to increase the mass of pb released and to determine the minimum length of lead pipe that should be removed to compensate for the addition of a galvanic junction pilot studies can be used as a proxy to determine the relative effectiveness of corrosion control treatments on pb release in flsls and plsls but they cannot predict true pb levels at the tap corrosion control treatment efficiency depends on the configuration of the lsl utilities should take into account the number of flsls and plsls before selecting their corrosion control strategy corrosion control treatment and or flsl treatment solutions should be carefully selected to ensure risk reduction for both flsls and plsls this work contributes to knowledge by comparing different corrosion control treatments on one specific water quality and 3

19172,membrane fouling especially inorganic fouling due to salt crystal formation and deposition on the membrane surface is still a major technical issue in membrane distillation md applications in this study microbubble aeration mba was included in a laboratory scale vacuum membrane distillation vmd rig and its effect on a desalination process was examined without mba serious membrane scaling occurred during desalination of simulated high salinity sea water 100 g l 1 salt concentration which resulted in a dramatic reduction of permeate flux to essentially zero after 120 min scanning electron microscopy showed that a layer of large cuboid salt crystals uniformly covered the membrane surface however membrane scaling was mitigated with the introduction of mba resulting in the improved vmd desalination performance which was positively correlated with pump pressure in the microbubble mb generator results showed that the effective processing time of the vmd desalination processing cycle was respectively prolonged to 150 180 and more than 300 and 360 min cf 120 min without mba when the pump pressure was respectively at 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa leading to the increase of cumulative water production further studies found that larger numbers of mbs of smaller size were produced at higher pump pressure which are more beneficial for increasing water vapor production and alleviating salt precipitation the difference in zeta potential between the mbs in distilled water about 30 mv and that in sw100 solution about 2 mv demonstrated that mba not only effectively mitigated the negative effect of concentration polarization by enhancing the surface shear rate at the membrane surface but also reduced salt precipitation probably due to the mbs attracting counterions to the gas water interface finally energy consumption analysis of the modified vmd desalination process revealed that mba while itself only adding about 3 to the total energy consumption at varied pump pressures was able to improve the specific energy consumption especially at higher pump pressures together these results demonstrate that mba is an effective way of improving the performance of vmd desalination of water graphical abstract image 1 keywords vacuum membrane distillation microbubble aeration desalination membrane scaling pump pressure counterions 1 introduction with the rising demand for fresh water around the world the supply of drinking water by sea water desalination is becoming an increasingly attractive option in many countries bench scale tests have successfully demonstrated the potential of membrane distillation md as an alternative technology for sea water desalination mericq et al 2010 safavi and mohammadi 2009 thite 2009 md is different to other membrane technologies in that it combines both thermal distillation and membrane separation microfiltration processes the liquid phase is passed across a porous hydrophobic membrane through which only vapor molecules are able to pass with the difference in partial vapor pressure on each side of the membrane usually resulting from a temperature difference providing the driving force rather than total pressure since it operates on the principles of vapor liquid equilibrium 100 theoretically of ions macromolecules colloids and other non volatile components are rejected at the membrane polymers such as polypropylene polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyvinylidenefluoride are commonly used in membranes for md applications alklaibi and lior 2005 the main advantages of md for desalination over conventional processes are chen et al 2014a gryta et al 2006 martinetti et al 2009 mericq et al 2010 complete removal of salt ions resulting in a high quality distillate the effectiveness of the salt separation is relatively constant and the purity of the distillate is practically independent of the contaminant concentration in the feed compared to conventional distillation water can be distilled at relatively low temperatures low grade heat solar industrial waste heat or desalination waste heat may be used the water does not require extensive pretreatment as in pressure based membrane treatment processes despite the fact that md has been increasingly studied over the last few years membrane fouling especially inorganic fouling due to salt crystal formation and deposition on the membrane surface is still one of the major barriers to its more widespread use el bourawi et al 2006 tijing et al 2015 zou et al 2017 recent studies have raised the awareness of severe membrane scaling by calcium magnesium carbonate and sulphate salts present in the feed during md hickenbottom and cath 2014 zhang et al 2015 the existence of a fouling layer not only adds additional heat and mass transfer resistance but also increases the risk of pore blockage and membrane wetting and ultimately results in deterioration of md performance gryta 2008 therefore it is necessary to find an effective means of controlling inorganic fouling fouling control techniques such as feed pretreatment shon et al 2009 wang et al 2008 membrane surface modification razmjou et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 chemical cleaning gryta 2008 vibration and crystallization zhong et al 2017 and ultrasonic treatment hou et al 2015 have been tried with variable results a number of studies have demonstrated that gas bubbling is one of the more effective ways of controlling fouling because the introduction of a gas liquid two phase flow enhances the surface shear rate and creates better fluid dynamics near the membrane surface this not only mitigates the temperature and concentration polarization effects but also reduces scale formation on the membrane surface chen et al 2013 2014b cui et al 2003 ye et al 2011 it has been reported that a bubbling assisted md system achieved up to 72 permeate flux enhancement and effectively postponed the flux decline caused by supersaturation of the salt solution used chen et al 2013 when correctly used gas bubbles reduce the risk of membrane damage and can be easily separated from the feed cui et al 2003 other researchers ding et al 2011 have examined the effect of intermittent gas bubbling on fouling resistance and the rate of foulant removal during concentration of a chinese tea extract in recent years fine bubbles including microbubbles mbs with a diameter 50 μm and nanobubbles nbs with a diameter less than 200 nm which have a relatively long life in fluid streams and exhibit a high surface charge at the gas liquid interface compared to macrobubbles have been investigated for use in water treatment dayarathne et al 2017 khuntia et al 2012 usually the surfaces of mbs in liquid are negatively charged over a wide range of ph values which can be expressed in terms of zeta potential agarwal et al 2011 even in the absence of electrolytes or surfactants other than dissolved ambient co2 mbs are negatively charged with an average zeta potential of approximately 35 mv in distilled water at ph 5 8 takahashi 2005 however the zeta potential of mbs can not only be strongly affected by the ph of the water but also by the presence of inorganic electrolytes takahashi 2005 found that both sodium chloride and magnesium chloride can reduce the zeta potential of mbs due to the high concentration of counterions inside the slipping plane the electrical properties of mbs determine the coalescence interaction and repulsion between the bubbles and other materials such as organic inorganic and biological substances in water dayarathne et al 2017 thus mbs have been used to agitate and remove particulates from membrane surfaces including those used in reverse osmosis dayarathne et al 2017 and ultrafiltration cui and taha 2010 however to our knowledge no prior work has systematically studied the effects of microbubble aeration mba on md desalination performance with high salinity solutions in this study mba has been applied to vacuum membrane distillation vmd for alleviating its external membrane scaling during the desalination process for simulative high salinity sea water the mechanisms of performance enhancement by mba was proposed in addition the specific energy consumption was calculated to evaluate the effect of mba on energy consumption 2 material and methods 2 1 materials ptfe is a good candidate for md due to its superior hydrophobicity thermal stability chemical resistance and mechanical strength drioli et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 the experiments were performed with a laboratory scale pilot plant using a flat sheet ptfe membrane with a polyethylene terephthalate support layer in a specific filtration module 0 21 0 09 m the effective area was 0 0102

pretreatment synthetic high salinity sea water sw solutions with mineral fraction in the range 10 100 g l 1 were prepared by dissolving salts table 2s in deionized water sodium chloride solutions 10 100 g l 1 were also used all chemical reagents were analytical grade prior to all experiments deionized water was used as feed solution for 1 h to obtain an initial pure water flux j0 kg m 2 h 1 2 2 methods the mb assisted vmd system used in this study is shown in fig 1 the feed solution was first heated in a thermostated tank 10 l where the temperature tf 298 348 k was controlled by a thermostatic controller the heated liquid was cycled to the feed side of the membrane module by a magnetic pump a bypass pipe was set to adjust the liquid flow velocity v which ranged from 0 23 to 0 69 m s 1 reynolds number between 1039 and 3117 at the inlet of the membrane module in addition a hydrodynamic cavitation hc apparatus nano lf1500 xingheng co china was positioned as a mb generator before the inlet of the membrane module a proportion of the heated feed flowed through the mb generator and then mixed with the remainder of the feed so that a two phase flow would pass over the membrane surface on the feed side on the permeate side a vacuum or low permeate pressure pp 100 1000 pa was obtained using a rp15c vario vacuubrand pump the permeated vapor was cooled in a condenser through which cool water produced in a cooling circulator was cycled the distillate was collected in the fluid reservoir for further analysis distillate conductivity was monitored using a conductivity meter and its mass was measured with an electronic balance permeate flux was calculated using the following equation j kg m 2 h 1 m a t where m kg is the mass of permeate a m2 is the total effective membrane area and t h is the operation time the flux data are presented as normalized flux ratio j j0 where j kg m 2 h 1 is the instantaneous flux and j0 kg m 2 h 1 is the flux obtained using deionized water as feed solution the hc apparatus was used to generate mb enriched water mb size was regulated by changing the inlet gas flow and the pressure of the air pump termed pump pressure in this report the optimum gas intake capacity of the mb generator was 40 ml min 1 liu et al 2018 the mb size distribution and transmittance of the mb containing feed at various pump pressures were obtained using a particle size analyzer partica la 960 horiba japan while mb zeta potentials in distilled water and sw100 solution at various pump pressures were measured with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk a custom made device fig 1s was used to study the effect of mba on water vapor production and salt deposition two 2 l glass beakers each containing 1 l sw100 solution were placed in a thermostatic waterbath at 328 k mba was conducted in only one beaker for 1 h 2 h and 3 h respectively the production of water vapor represented by the weight loss of the beaker containing sw100 solution at various pump pressures 0 1 0 4 mpa was calculated as follows sp m 0 m 1 s t where sp kg m 2 h 1 is the water vapor production at various pump pressures m 0 kg is the initial weight of the beaker containing 1 l sw100 solution and m 1 kg is the weight of the beaker containing sw100 solution after mba s m2 is the area of the beaker and t h is the aeration time when the aeration was over the solutions in the two glass beakers were filtered and the solid particles were dried at 323 k for 24 h and weighed using an electronic balance the salt deposition was calculated as follows sd m a m n v where sd g l 1 is the salt deposition at a particular pump pressure m a g is the weight of solid particles with mba m n g is the weight of solid particles without mba and v l is the solution volume 2 3 surface characterization after the experiments were completed fouled membranes were dried at room temperature for 24 h in a dust free atmosphere and then coated with gold in a vacuum environment a scanning electron microscope sem working at primary void nova nanosem 450 was employed to obtain micrographs of the top surface of the fouled membrane elemental analysis of the surface of the membrane was carried out using energy dispersive spectrometry eds with a 30 mm2 sdd bruker quantax probe 3 results and discussion 3 1 vmd desalination performance with mba sw100 solution was selected as feed solution in this study due to its high scaling tendency compared to the two other solutions with lower salt concentrations table 2s fig 2s as shown in fig 2 a without mba there was a rapid and dramatic decline in permeate flux which fell to about zero after 120 min operation in the md process a decline in flux is attributed to a combination of concentration polarization membrane fouling and membrane pore wetting gryta 2008 wang et al 2014 without mba the permeate conductivity maintained a relatively low level in the range 4 23 7 82 μs cm 1 throughout the experiment fig 2b which indicated that the membranes did not suffer pore wetting zou et al 2017 besides the concentration polarization was expected to lead to the precipitation of salts on membrane surface zou et al 2017 hence the main reason for the rapid decline in flux is most likely the formation and growth of salt precipitation on membrane surface which not only reduces the area of open pores available for water to vaporize ramezanianpour and sivakumar 2014 but also introduces additional resistance to mass and heat transfer gryta 2008 meanwhile at the end of the vmd desalination process a dense white fouling layer could clearly be observed by the naked eye on membrane surface sem images of the fouled membranes fig 3 b showed that a layer of large cuboid crystals uniformly covered the membrane surface with the introduction of mba the decline in flux was alleviated particularly at the higher pump pressures used at low pump pressures 0 1 0 2 mpa the improvement was minimal with the effective desalination processing time i e time before flux decreased to zero only prolonged to 150 min and 180 min respectively however at higher pump pressures 0 3 0 4 mpa the performance was markedly improved e g at 0 4 mpa the effective processing time was prolonged to at least 360 min cf 120 min without mba leading to the increase of cumulative water production from 469 70 g without mba to at least 1386 26 g with mba over one operational cycle i e between two cleaning steps it seemed that the introduction of mba obviously reduced the formation and growth of salt precipitations on membrane surface which was the main reason for the rapid decline in flux without mba as shown in fig 3c at a pump pressure of 0 4 mpa and after 120 min of the vmd desalination process markedly less blocking of the membrane surface was observed compared to the control while the permeate conductivity was maintained at a relatively low level in the range 5 02 8 97 μs cm 1 fig 2b which demonstrated that mba could effectively enhance vmd desalination performance by alleviating membrane scaling 3 2 mechanisms of performance enhancement by mba 3 2 1 effect of mba on water vapor production and salt precipitation batch scaled experiments using the custom made device fig 1s were further conducted to evaluate the effect of mba on vmd desalination the characteristics of mbs as shown in fig 4 a generated under different pump pressures 0 1 0 4 mpa indicated that most mbs generated were in the size range 15 70 μm for all pump pressures used however the mean diameters differed with pump pressure being 39 66 μm and 39 92 μm at 0 1 mpa and 0 2 mpa respectively and 27 84 μm and 25 36 μm at 0 3 mpa and 0 4 mpa respectively moreover the transmittance of the feed solution decreased with increasing pump pressure fig 4b consistent with the generation of more mbs which scatter light at higher pump pressures the mb density which was only 356 22 mb per milliliter sw100 solution at 0 2 mpa increased to 1092 82 at 0 3 mpa see table 3s which might explain the large improvement in vmd desalination performance when the pump pressure was increased from 0 2 mpa to 0 3 mpa fig 2a to summarise higher pump pressures in the mb generator led to more mbs being generated and these were smaller in diameter than that at lower pressures this correlated with improved vmd desalination performance research on water vapor production and salt precipitation affected by the mba as shown in fig 5 revealed that water vapor production increased while salt production decreased with the increase of pump pressure besides salt precipitation was negatively correlated with pump pressure the longer the operation time the bigger this difference between salt productions at varied pump pressures was which meant that the introduction of mba can not only increase water vapor production but also limit salt precipitation both of which result in an enhanced vmd desalination performance 3 2 2 zeta potential of mbs in liquid media the zeta potentials of mbs in distilled water and in sw100 solution were measured after mba for 5 min at various pump pressures fig 3s no difference was found in mb zeta potential in the same liquid medium for the range of pump pressures used in this investigation 0 1 0 4 mpa however in sw100 solution the mb zeta potential was only about 2 mv compared to about 30 mv in distilled water it has been reported that inorganic ions such as sodium and magnesium ions are attracted to the gas water interface by electrostatic forces generating an electrical double layer that reduces the zeta potential by increasing the number of counterions between the gas water interface and the slipping plane fig 6 takahashi 2005 due to the greater electrostatic force ions with a valency of 2 or higher tend to be attracted to the interface more strongly than ions with a valency of 1 takahashi 2005 hence calcium and magnesium ions would be attracted to the interface more strongly than sodium which could be another reason for the limiting effect of mba on salt precipitation 3 3 energy consumption the vmd desalination process described in this report required energy to pump and circulate the feed solution for heating the feed to operate the vacuum pump and to cool the permeate vapor mba when used also represented a proportion of the total energy consumption energy consumption can be evaluated alongside the specific energy consumption q s as q s m w w w h w c w a where m is the permeate mass produced during a sampling run w is the total energy consumption during the same run w h is the energy for heating and circulating the feed solution w c is the energy for cooling the permeate vapor and w a is the energy for mba and circulating the mb containing feed w h w c and w a were measured by wattmeter during the vmd desalination process using sw100 with or without mba as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the total energy consumption for any given time point was virtually identical across the range of pump pressures used showing that the mba process consumed very little energy which only equivalent to 2 8 0 3 of the total energy consumption however as showed in fig 7b the specific energy consumption q s varied with pump pressure when mba was used although q s decreased with time as the permeate flux decreased chiam and sarbatly 2013 without mba q s decreased sharply after 50 min because of serious fouling of the membrane meanwhile with mba the downward trend was alleviated to some extent especially at higher pump pressures 0 3 and 0 4 mpa when q s was maintained at a relatively high level for longer therefore we conclude that mba is effective at improving the vmd desalination process while only adding a little to the total energy consumed 4 conclusions in this study we show that mba effectively alleviates membrane scaling and improves permeate flux during vmd desalination of simulated high salinity sea water better vmd desalination performance is achieved at higher pump pressure with the introduction of mba the effective desalination processing time was respectively prolonged to 150 180 and at least 300 and 360 min cf 120 min without mba when the pump pressure was respectively 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa leading to the increase of cumulative water production further studies find that larger numbers of mbs of smaller size are produced at higher pump pressure which are more beneficial to increase water vapor production and limit salt precipitation the mb zeta potential difference between distilled water about 30 mv and sw100 solution about 2 mv might be a reason for the limiting effect of mba on salt precipitation due to the mbs attracting counterions to the gas water interface moreover energy consumption analysis showed that mba while representing only 2 8 0 3 of the total energy consumption at varied pump pressures markedly improved the specific energy consumption especially at higher pump pressures together

19172,membrane fouling especially inorganic fouling due to salt crystal formation and deposition on the membrane surface is still a major technical issue in membrane distillation md applications in this study microbubble aeration mba was included in a laboratory scale vacuum membrane distillation vmd rig and its effect on a desalination process was examined without mba serious membrane scaling occurred during desalination of simulated high salinity sea water 100 g l 1 salt concentration which resulted in a dramatic reduction of permeate flux to essentially zero after 120 min scanning electron microscopy showed that a layer of large cuboid salt crystals uniformly covered the membrane surface however membrane scaling was mitigated with the introduction of mba resulting in the improved vmd desalination performance which was positively correlated with pump pressure in the microbubble mb generator results showed that the effective processing time of the vmd desalination processing cycle was respectively prolonged to 150 180 and more than 300 and 360 min cf 120 min without mba when the pump pressure was respectively at 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa leading to the increase of cumulative water production further studies found that larger numbers of mbs of smaller size were produced at higher pump pressure which are more beneficial for increasing water vapor production and alleviating salt precipitation the difference in zeta potential between the mbs in distilled water about 30 mv and that in sw100 solution about 2 mv demonstrated that mba not only effectively mitigated the negative effect of concentration polarization by enhancing the surface shear rate at the membrane surface but also reduced salt precipitation probably due to the mbs attracting counterions to the gas water interface finally energy consumption analysis of the modified vmd desalination process revealed that mba while itself only adding about 3 to the total energy consumption at varied pump pressures was able to improve the specific energy consumption especially at higher pump pressures together these results demonstrate that mba is an effective way of improving the performance of vmd desalination of water graphical abstract image 1 keywords vacuum membrane distillation microbubble aeration desalination membrane scaling pump pressure counterions 1 introduction with the rising demand for fresh water around the world the supply of drinking water by sea water desalination is becoming an increasingly attractive option in many countries bench scale tests have successfully demonstrated the potential of membrane distillation md as an alternative technology for sea water desalination mericq et al 2010 safavi and mohammadi 2009 thite 2009 md is different to other membrane technologies in that it combines both thermal distillation and membrane separation microfiltration processes the liquid phase is passed across a porous hydrophobic membrane through which only vapor molecules are able to pass with the difference in partial vapor pressure on each side of the membrane usually resulting from a temperature difference providing the driving force rather than total pressure since it operates on the principles of vapor liquid equilibrium 100 theoretically of ions macromolecules colloids and other non volatile components are rejected at the membrane polymers such as polypropylene polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyvinylidenefluoride are commonly used in membranes for md applications alklaibi and lior 2005 the main advantages of md for desalination over conventional processes are chen et al 2014a gryta et al 2006 martinetti et al 2009 mericq et al 2010 complete removal of salt ions resulting in a high quality distillate the effectiveness of the salt separation is relatively constant and the purity of the distillate is practically independent of the contaminant concentration in the feed compared to conventional distillation water can be distilled at relatively low temperatures low grade heat solar industrial waste heat or desalination waste heat may be used the water does not require extensive pretreatment as in pressure based membrane treatment processes despite the fact that md has been increasingly studied over the last few years membrane fouling especially inorganic fouling due to salt crystal formation and deposition on the membrane surface is still one of the major barriers to its more widespread use el bourawi et al 2006 tijing et al 2015 zou et al 2017 recent studies have raised the awareness of severe membrane scaling by calcium magnesium carbonate and sulphate salts present in the feed during md hickenbottom and cath 2014 zhang et al 2015 the existence of a fouling layer not only adds additional heat and mass transfer resistance but also increases the risk of pore blockage and membrane wetting and ultimately results in deterioration of md performance gryta 2008 therefore it is necessary to find an effective means of controlling inorganic fouling fouling control techniques such as feed pretreatment shon et al 2009 wang et al 2008 membrane surface modification razmjou et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 chemical cleaning gryta 2008 vibration and crystallization zhong et al 2017 and ultrasonic treatment hou et al 2015 have been tried with variable results a number of studies have demonstrated that gas bubbling is one of the more effective ways of controlling fouling because the introduction of a gas liquid two phase flow enhances the surface shear rate and creates better fluid dynamics near the membrane surface this not only mitigates the temperature and concentration polarization effects but also reduces scale formation on the membrane surface chen et al 2013 2014b cui et al 2003 ye et al 2011 it has been reported that a bubbling assisted md system achieved up to 72 permeate flux enhancement and effectively postponed the flux decline caused by supersaturation of the salt solution used chen et al 2013 when correctly used gas bubbles reduce the risk of membrane damage and can be easily separated from the feed cui et al 2003 other researchers ding et al 2011 have examined the effect of intermittent gas bubbling on fouling resistance and the rate of foulant removal during concentration of a chinese tea extract in recent years fine bubbles including microbubbles mbs with a diameter 50 μm and nanobubbles nbs with a diameter less than 200 nm which have a relatively long life in fluid streams and exhibit a high surface charge at the gas liquid interface compared to macrobubbles have been investigated for use in water treatment dayarathne et al 2017 khuntia et al 2012 usually the surfaces of mbs in liquid are negatively charged over a wide range of ph values which can be expressed in terms of zeta potential agarwal et al 2011 even in the absence of electrolytes or surfactants other than dissolved ambient co2 mbs are negatively charged with an average zeta potential of approximately 35 mv in distilled water at ph 5 8 takahashi 2005 however the zeta potential of mbs can not only be strongly affected by the ph of the water but also by the presence of inorganic electrolytes takahashi 2005 found that both sodium chloride and magnesium chloride can reduce the zeta potential of mbs due to the high concentration of counterions inside the slipping plane the electrical properties of mbs determine the coalescence interaction and repulsion between the bubbles and other materials such as organic inorganic and biological substances in water dayarathne et al 2017 thus mbs have been used to agitate and remove particulates from membrane surfaces including those used in reverse osmosis dayarathne et al 2017 and ultrafiltration cui and taha 2010 however to our knowledge no prior work has systematically studied the effects of microbubble aeration mba on md desalination performance with high salinity solutions in this study mba has been applied to vacuum membrane distillation vmd for alleviating its external membrane scaling during the desalination process for simulative high salinity sea water the mechanisms of performance enhancement by mba was proposed in addition the specific energy consumption was calculated to evaluate the effect of mba on energy consumption 2 material and methods 2 1 materials ptfe is a good candidate for md due to its superior hydrophobicity thermal stability chemical resistance and mechanical strength drioli et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 the experiments were performed with a laboratory scale pilot plant using a flat sheet ptfe membrane with a polyethylene terephthalate support layer in a specific filtration module 0 21 0 09 m the effective area was 0 0102 m2 0 20 0 06 m the membranes were purchased from valqua with pore size 0 3 μm more detailed characteristics of the membrane are shown in table 1s the membranes were cut to size and used without any pretreatment synthetic high salinity sea water sw solutions with mineral fraction in the range 10 100 g l 1 were prepared by dissolving salts table 2s in deionized water sodium chloride solutions 10 100 g l 1 were also used all chemical reagents were analytical grade prior to all experiments deionized water was used as feed solution for 1 h to obtain an initial pure water flux j0 kg m 2 h 1 2 2 methods the mb assisted vmd system used in this study is shown in fig 1 the feed solution was first heated in a thermostated tank 10 l where the temperature tf 298 348 k was controlled by a thermostatic controller the heated liquid was cycled to the feed side of the membrane module by a magnetic pump a bypass pipe was set to adjust the liquid flow velocity v which ranged from 0 23 to 0 69 m s 1 reynolds number between 1039 and 3117 at the inlet of the membrane module in addition a hydrodynamic cavitation hc apparatus nano lf1500 xingheng co china was positioned as a mb generator before the inlet of the membrane module a proportion of the heated feed flowed through the mb generator and then mixed with the remainder of the feed so that a two phase flow would pass over the membrane surface on the feed side on the permeate side a vacuum or low permeate pressure pp 100 1000 pa was obtained using a rp15c vario vacuubrand pump the permeated vapor was cooled in a condenser through which cool water produced in a cooling circulator was cycled the distillate was collected in the fluid reservoir for further analysis distillate conductivity was monitored using a conductivity meter and its mass was measured with an electronic balance permeate flux was calculated using the following equation j kg m 2 h 1 m a t where m kg is the mass of permeate a m2 is the total effective membrane area and t h is the operation time the flux data are presented as normalized flux ratio j j0 where j kg m 2 h 1 is the instantaneous flux and j0 kg m 2 h 1 is the flux obtained using deionized water as feed solution the hc apparatus was used to generate mb enriched water mb size was regulated by changing the inlet gas flow and the pressure of the air pump termed pump pressure in this report the optimum gas intake capacity of the mb generator was 40 ml min 1 liu et al 2018 the mb size distribution and transmittance of the mb containing feed at various pump pressures were obtained using a particle size analyzer partica la 960 horiba japan while mb zeta potentials in distilled water and sw100 solution at various pump pressures were measured with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk a custom made device fig 1s was used to study the effect of mba on water vapor production and salt deposition two 2 l glass beakers each containing 1 l sw100 solution were placed in a thermostatic waterbath at 328 k mba was conducted in only one beaker for 1 h 2 h and 3 h respectively the production of water vapor represented by the weight loss of the beaker containing sw100 solution at various pump pressures 0 1 0 4 mpa was calculated as follows sp m 0 m 1 s t where sp kg m 2 h 1 is the water vapor production at various pump pressures m 0 kg is the initial weight of the beaker containing 1 l sw100 solution and m 1 kg is the weight of the beaker containing sw100 solution after mba s m2 is the area of the beaker and t h is the aeration time when the aeration was over the solutions in the two glass beakers were filtered and the solid particles were dried at 323 k for 24 h and weighed using an electronic balance the salt deposition was calculated as follows sd m a m n v where sd g l 1 is the salt deposition at a particular pump pressure m a g is the weight of solid particles with mba m n g is the weight of solid particles without mba and v l is the solution volume 2 3 surface characterization after the experiments were completed fouled membranes were dried at room temperature for 24 h in a dust free atmosphere and then coated with gold in a vacuum environment a scanning electron microscope sem working at primary void nova nanosem 450 was employed to obtain micrographs of the top surface of the fouled membrane elemental analysis of the surface of the membrane was carried out using energy dispersive spectrometry eds with a 30 mm2 sdd bruker quantax probe 3 results and discussion 3 1 vmd desalination performance with mba sw100 solution was selected as feed solution in this study due to its high scaling tendency compared to the two other solutions with lower salt concentrations table 2s fig 2s as shown in fig 2 a without mba there was a rapid and dramatic decline in permeate flux which fell to about zero after 120 min operation in the md process a decline in flux is attributed to a combination of concentration polarization membrane fouling and membrane pore wetting gryta 2008 wang et al 2014 without mba the permeate conductivity maintained a relatively low level in the range 4 23 7 82 μs cm 1 throughout the experiment fig 2b which indicated that the membranes did not suffer pore wetting zou et al 2017 besides the concentration polarization was expected to lead to the precipitation of salts on membrane surface zou et al 2017 hence the main reason for the rapid decline in flux is most likely the formation and growth of salt precipitation on membrane surface which not only reduces the area of open pores available for water to vaporize ramezanianpour and sivakumar 2014 but also introduces additional resistance to mass and heat transfer gryta 2008 meanwhile at the end of the vmd desalination process a dense white fouling layer could clearly be observed by the naked eye on membrane surface sem images of the fouled membranes fig 3 b showed that a layer of large cuboid crystals uniformly covered the membrane surface with the introduction of mba the decline in flux was alleviated particularly at the higher pump pressures used at low pump pressures 0 1 0 2 mpa the improvement was minimal with the effective desalination processing time i e time before flux decreased to zero only prolonged to 150 min and 180 min respectively however at higher pump pressures 0 3 0 4 mpa the performance was markedly improved e g at 0 4 mpa the effective processing time was prolonged to at least 360 min cf 120 min without mba leading to the increase of cumulative water production from 469 70 g without mba to at least 1386 26 g with mba over one operational cycle i e between two cleaning steps it seemed that the introduction of mba obviously reduced the formation and growth of salt precipitations on membrane surface which was the main reason for the rapid decline in flux without mba as shown in fig 3c at a pump pressure of 0 4 mpa and after 120 min of the vmd desalination process markedly less blocking of the membrane surface was observed compared to the control while the permeate conductivity was maintained at a relatively low level in the range 5 02 8 97 μs cm 1 fig 2b which demonstrated that mba could effectively enhance vmd desalination performance by alleviating membrane scaling 3 2 mechanisms of performance enhancement by mba 3 2 1 effect of mba on water vapor production and salt precipitation batch scaled experiments using the custom made device fig 1s were further conducted to evaluate the effect of mba on vmd desalination the characteristics of mbs as shown in fig 4 a generated under different pump pressures 0 1 0 4 mpa indicated that most mbs generated were in the size range 15 70 μm for all pump pressures used however the mean diameters differed with pump pressure being 39 66 μm and 39 92 μm at 0 1 mpa and 0 2 mpa respectively and 27 84 μm and 25 36 μm at 0 3 mpa and 0 4 mpa respectively moreover the transmittance of the feed solution decreased with increasing pump pressure fig 4b consistent with the generation of more mbs which scatter light at higher pump pressures the mb density which was only 356 22 mb per milliliter sw100 solution at 0 2 mpa increased to 1092 82 at 0 3 mpa see table 3s which might explain the large improvement in vmd desalination performance when the pump pressure was increased from 0 2 mpa to 0 3 mpa fig 2a to summarise higher pump pressures in the mb generator led to more mbs being generated and these were smaller in diameter than that at lower pressures this correlated with improved vmd desalination performance research on water vapor production and salt precipitation affected by the mba as shown in fig 5 revealed that water vapor production increased while salt production decreased with the increase of pump pressure besides salt precipitation was negatively correlated with pump pressure the longer the operation time the bigger this difference between salt productions at varied pump pressures was which meant that the introduction of mba can not only increase water vapor production but also limit salt precipitation both of which result in an enhanced vmd desalination performance 3 2 2 zeta potential of mbs in liquid media the zeta potentials of mbs in distilled water and in sw100 solution were measured after mba for 5 min at various pump pressures fig 3s no difference was found in mb zeta potential in the same liquid medium for the range of pump pressures used in this investigation 0 1 0 4 mpa however in sw100 solution the mb zeta potential was only about 2 mv compared to about 30 mv in distilled water it has been reported that inorganic ions such as sodium and magnesium ions are attracted to the gas water interface by electrostatic forces generating an electrical double layer that reduces the zeta potential by increasing the number of counterions between the gas water interface and the slipping plane fig 6 takahashi 2005 due to the greater electrostatic force ions with a valency of 2 or higher tend to be attracted to the interface more strongly than ions with a valency of 1 takahashi 2005 hence calcium and magnesium ions would be attracted to the interface more strongly than sodium which could be another reason for the limiting effect of mba on salt precipitation 3 3 energy consumption the vmd desalination process described in this report required energy to pump and circulate the feed solution for heating the feed to operate the vacuum pump and to cool the permeate vapor mba when used also represented a proportion of the total energy consumption energy consumption can be evaluated alongside the specific energy consumption q s as q s m w w w h w c w a where m is the permeate mass produced during a sampling run w is the total energy consumption during the same run w h is the energy for heating and circulating the feed solution w c is the energy for cooling the permeate vapor and w a is the energy for mba and circulating the mb containing feed w h w c and w a were measured by wattmeter during the vmd desalination process using sw100 with or without mba as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the total energy consumption for any given time point was virtually identical across the range of pump pressures used showing that the mba process consumed very little energy which only equivalent to 2 8 0 3 of the total energy consumption however as showed in fig 7b the specific energy consumption q s varied with pump pressure when mba was used although q s decreased with time as the permeate flux decreased chiam and sarbatly 2013 without mba q s decreased sharply after 50 min because of serious fouling of the membrane meanwhile with mba the downward trend was alleviated to some extent especially at higher pump pressures 0 3 and 0 4 mpa when q s was maintained at a relatively high level for longer therefore we conclude that mba is effective at improving the vmd desalination process while only adding a little to the total energy consumed 4 conclusions in this study we show that mba effectively alleviates membrane scaling and improves permeate flux during vmd desalination of simulated high salinity sea water better vmd desalination performance is achieved at higher pump pressure with the introduction of mba the effective desalination processing time was respectively prolonged to 150 180 and at least 300 and 360 min cf 120 min without mba when the pump pressure was respectively 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mpa leading to the increase of cumulative water production further studies find that larger numbers of mbs of smaller size are produced at higher pump pressure which are more beneficial to increase water vapor production and limit salt precipitation the mb zeta potential difference between distilled water about 30 mv and sw100 solution about 2 mv might be a reason for the limiting effect of mba on salt precipitation due to the mbs attracting counterions to the gas water interface moreover energy consumption analysis showed that mba while representing only 2 8 0 3 of the total energy consumption at varied pump pressures markedly improved the specific energy consumption especially at higher pump pressures together

of microbial contamination in the soil and water environments henry et al 2016 however it is rarely used to estimate the contributions by different sources to airborne bacteria emitted from various treatment facilities in wwtps more than 3500 wwtps were set up in china by the end of 2016 to date no chinese provision exists for assessing the health risks of airborne bacteria in wwtps due to the limited knowledge about dose response relationships with the rapid increase in the numbers of wwtps in china the evaluation of the exposure risks posed by airborne bacteria in wwtps is of significance the objectives of this study were to characterize the emission levels community compositions and sources of airborne bacteria in a typical wwtp and then to evaluate their health risks concentrations

different heights 0 1 m 1 5 m and 3 m above the water surface were set up the other samples were taken at a height of 1 5 m above the ground 2 2 sample collection the samplings were conducted in winter december 14 2015 spring march 21 2016 and summer june 30 2016 total suspended particles tsp samplers th 150 wuhan china were used to capture the airborne microorganisms on site parallel samples were collected at each sampling site in this study in order to enhance the survival of airborne bacteria all samplings were conducted early in the morning from 6 a m to 10 a m when the relative humidity was high and solar radiation was relatively weak air samples were continuously gathered on quartz membranes 90 mm whatman qm a at an average flow rate of 100 l min without disturbing the operation of the treatment facilities prior to sampling organic compounds were removed from membranes by heating at 500 c for 4 5 h and membrane holders were washed with a 75 ethanol solution after sampling all the membranes were removed from the samplers covered and stored at 20 c for subsequent analysis during the sampling temperature and relative humidity rh were measured using a thermohygrometer 635 1 testo germany solar radiation and wind speed were determined with an irradiance meter sl 102 di log u k and an anemometer dl7010 di log u k respectively meteorological factors

filtered with 0 22 μm filters the membranes with residues were used for the microbial assays the filtrate was used for organic compounds and water soluble ions wsis analyses 2 3 1 microbial assay for the enumeration of the airborne bacteria 200 μl of the suspension was inoculated onto nutrient agar br aoboxing biotech co ltd china and cultured at 30 c for 48 h the colonies of airborne bacteria were counted and expressed as colony forming units per cubic meter cfu m3 microbial communities of airborne bacteria and water sludge samples were analyzed by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing method bacterial dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad u s a the v3 and v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna were amplified by pcr using primers 515f and 907r each

air samples was detected using a carbon analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan concentrations of anions such as no3 no2 cl so4 2 and po4 3 were measured using an ion chromatography system ics 1000 dionex u

anova 1 was used to compare the concentrations of airborne bacteria from different sites the two way analysis of variance anova 2 was applied to evaluate the effects of season on airborne bacterial concentrations unilateral student s t test was used to compare airborne bacterial concentration detected from downwind with those inside the wwtp fracchia et al 2006 the relationship between the concentrations of airborne bacteria and meteorological conditions was examined using spearman s correlation analysis all analyses were performed with the ibm spss statistics 21 0 sourcetracker a bayesian approach was applied to attribute microbial communities in an environmental sink to various potential sources and to estimate the probability that each source contributed to the sink communities wang et al 2017 in this study microbial communities of airborne bacteria were considered as a sink while wastewater ambient air and sludge samples were considered as three major known sources respectively unknown were taxa that could not map to the input sources wang et al 2017 sourcetracker analysis was conducted using r 3 4 1 the shannon index h was used to compute bacterial diversity h was calculated by h p i ln p i where p i is the proportion of each group of microorganisms in a sample 2 4 risk assessment the exposure rates and risk assessment of airborne bacteria were estimated based on the models recommended by the u s epa the average daily dose rates add through inhalation and skin contact were evaluated using the following eqs 1 add inhalation c i r e f e d inhalation b w a t 2 a d d skin c s a a b s a f e f e d skin b w a t where add inhalation and add skin represent the average daily doses of exposure by inhalation and skin contact cfu kg d c is the airborne bacterial concentration cfu m3 ir is the inhalation rate m3 d ef is the exposure frequency d yr ed inhalation and ed skin are the duration of exposure duration by inhalation and skin contact yr sa is the surface area of skin contact m2 abs is the dermal absorption factor m h af is the skin adherence factor bw is the body weight kg and at is the average lifetime d all the parameters in eqs 1 and 2 are summarized in table s2 airborne bacteria are non carcinogenic the non cancer risks of exposure by inhalation and skin contact were assessed using the following eqs 3 h q a d d r f d 4 h i h q i where hq is the hazard quotient hi is the hazard index representing the sum of the risks of each pollutant from multiple exposure pathways rfd is the reference dose cfu kg d representing the maximum acceptable daily dose of a substance the rfd of airborne bacteria has not been determined until now concentration of the cultivable bacterial exposure should not exceed 500 cfu m3 on a working day as recommended by the bioaerosols committee of the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists acgih therefore the limit of 500 cfu m3 was employed in this study when hq 1 or hi 1 risks can be ignored when hq 1 or hi 1 potential adverse health risks are of concern chen and carter 2017 3 results 3 1 emission levels of airborne bacteria and wsis the emission levels of airborne bacteria detected from each sampling site during three seasons are shown in table 1 in this study the amounts of airborne bacteria exhibited site related and seasonal variation positive correlations anova 1 p 0 001 between sites and bacterial concentrations were observed in winter spring and summer table 2 compared with other sampling sites treatment stages of cs agc pst ant and aet were the main emission sources with high airborne bacteria emission levels ranged from 257 to 4878 cfu m3 diffusion of airborne bacteria was observed in the vertical direction from the water surface of aet in summer the concentration of airborne bacteria near the water surface was 2399 291 cfu m3 when the sampling height was increased to 1 5 m and 3 0 m above the water surface the bacterial concentrations decreased by 53 8 and 90 0 to 1109 137 cfu m3 and 241 48 cfu m3 respectively similar phenomena were observed in the concentrations of airborne bacteria in spring and winter the airborne bacterial concentrations at the external downwind site of the wwtp were compared with those inside the wwtp by unilateral student s t test the results revealed that both in spring and summer concentrations of airborne bacteria at the external downwind site were significantly less than those inside the plant p 0 001 the decline in airborne bacterial concentration was mainly caused by dispersion and wind dilution in winter there was little difference in airborne bacterial loads between inside and external downwind of the plant p 0 059 bioaerosols emitted from wwtps contain not only microbes but also chemicals four anions cl no3 no2 and so4 2 and five cations na nh4 k mg2 and ca2 were detected in all the air samples table 3 the main anions were cl no3 and so4 2 the highest concentrations of cl 127 37 μg m3 and no3 24 43 μg m3 were detected in ant while the highest concentration of so4 2 119 75 μg m3 was observed in agc na was the dominant cation and was detected from all the sampling sites with small differences in concentration the concentrations of total organic carbon toc varied from 9 61 to 27 85 μg m3 the highest toc concentration was observed in samples collected from cs 3 2 microbial populations of airborne bacteria high throughput sequencing technique was applied to assay the microbial populations of airborne bacteria emitted from each site this approach provides a broad profile of numerous microorganisms including potential pathogenic bacteria present in the air of wwtps ghosh et al 2015 airborne bacteria collected from sdh had the highest species richness h 5 71 table s3 compared with those captured from other facilities with 520 species appeared in its surrounding air among those species acinetobacter 6 51 chryseobacterium 6 46 nocardioides 4 45 saccharibacteria norank 3 88 and micrococcus 2 63 were the most abundant bacterial populations fig 2 bacterial communities identified from ant and agc also showed a higher diversity h 5 29 and 5 59 respectively mycobacterium 1 15 2 89 and chroococcidiopsis 1 53 2 00 were the main bacteria in the air of the two treatment stages higher percentages of chryseobacterium 8 51 acinetobacter 7 32 and arcobacter 7 07 were detected in cs arcobacter 4 46 and acinetobacter 2 48 were also dominant among airborne bacteria collected from pst the other dominated bacteria present in pst were aeromonas 2 61 and bacteroides 1 12 cyanobacteria norank 4 13 mycobacterium 3 56 and bacillus 1 36 showed higher abundance in air samples from aet for air samples collected from sst the dominated species was pseudomonas 1 15 opportunistic pathogens such as arcobacter micrococcus chryseobacterium bacteroides acinetobacter bacillus mycobacterium pseudomonas enterococcus and aeromonas were also identified in air samples different pathogenic bacteria dominated at individual treatment stages pathogens acinetobacter chryseobacterium and micrococcus were abundant in the surrounding air of cs agc and sdh aeromonas arcobacter and bacteroides were the main pathogens in the air of pst while mycobacterium and bacillus were the dominant pathogens at aet and ant 3 3 sources of airborne bacteria the sourcetracker was used to analyze the sources of airborne bacteria combined with bacterial communities in wastewater sludge and outside ambient air fig 3 a showed that 2 35 15 77 of airborne bacteria were obtained from wastewater and 28 16 78 31 of airborne bacteria were found in outside ambient air a very small proportion of airborne bacteria 1 28 in average was recovered from sludge the sources of the remaining bacteria were unknown 21 74 in average the unknown sources were probably the surrounding plants soils and dust with the increase of vertical height from the water surface in aet the percentages of airborne bacteria from wastewater and sludge decreased from 10 48 to 5 36 and from 2 16 to 1 22 respectively and the proportion of airborne bacteria from outside ambient air increased obviously from 70 00 to 78 31 cyanobacteria norank 7 26 bacillus 3 56 and chroococcidiopsis 2 86 were identified as the main bacteria in the ambient air the dominant populations in wastewater were arcobacter 68 63 bacteroides 5 91 zoogloea 4 20 and aeromonas 1 75 pseudomonas 95 22 was the major group in sludge most of the dominant species in outside ambient air wastewater and sludge were also found among the airborne bacteria the high proportion of arcobacter in the water led to a relatively high detection percentage 0 94 7 07 of this genus being detected in airborne bacteria 3 4 health risk assessment the inhalation and skin contact risks of airborne bacteria in the wwtp were calculated for adult males adult females and children tables 4 and 5 in this study for both adults and children the health risks of airborne bacteria by inhalation were several orders of magnitude higher than those by skin contact indicating that inhalation was the main pathway of exposure to airborne bacteria in the wwtp the average inhalation risks for both adult males and females were less than 1 suggesting that the inhalation risks for adults were negligible however the hqs for children were much higher than those for adults in particular the hq for children at the agc in the summer was 1 23 indicating that exposure to airborne bacteria could cause adverse health effects for children at this site remarkable differences in the risks were observed at various treatment stages anova 1 p 0 001 at sites with high levels of airborne bacteria such as cs aet and agc the health risks were significantly higher in addition the inhalation risks of airborne bacteria in summer were higher than those in the other two seasons airborne bacteria emitted from wastewater treatment facilities would be transported to the downwind area by wind affecting residents of surrounding areas the calculated hqs of exposure to airborne bacteria through inhalation and skin contact were less than 1 for both adults and children living nearby the wwtp table 6 4 discussion 4 1 concentration of airborne bacteria at individual stages in this study the treatment facilities in cs and sdh were installed indoors while the other facilities e g agc pst and aet were located outside airborne bacteria presented in the air of all the treatment stages there were six bar screens installed in cs to remove solid materials from water the drive chains of the bar screens continuously disturbed the water surface resulting in the airborne bacterial emission excess sludge consists of chemicals inorganic and organic compounds and microbial cells active microorganisms and microbial residues in sdh decanter centrifuges were applied for sludge dewatering the sludge for dehydration was pumped into the cylindrical part of the centrifuge through the feed pipes water was continuously separated from the sludge in the centrifuge with high rotational speed solid particles with high density were collected and compacted to the bottom of the cylindrical part during the sludge delivery and dewatering some microbial aggregates bacteria pathogens and inorganic particles attached to the surface of the sludge were small enough to disperse into the surrounding air which could be detected after aerosolization agc pst and aet were located outside without capping and high concentrations of airborne bacteria were detected from these facilities agc was employed to remove grit such as gravel sand and other heavy solid materials in agc wastewater flowed through the tank in a spiral path air was introduced along one side of the tank to perpendicular to the water flow the heavier grit particles settled to the bottom of the tank while lighter particles remained in suspension the injection of air agitated the water body resulting in the release of microorganisms to the atmosphere pst was constructed to remove entrained suspended solids using gravity the turbulence of water accelerated the airborne bacteria generation in the present study fine pore diffusers were adopted in the aeration tank of the investigated wwtp large amounts of fine bubbles with a diameter of less than 5 mm were generated during the air supply processes when the bubbles reached the surface of water they burst into small film droplets and were propelled up to 15 cm above the water surface resulting in airborne bacteria formation the aeration processes promoted the transfer of the microorganisms from water to air greatly affecting the numbers of airborne microorganisms bauer et al 2002 the treatment stages e g cs agc and aet containing facilities for mechanical agitations or aeration were the sites with the highest levels of airborne bacteria emission airborne bacterial emissions from wwtps have been extensively studied and similar results have been reported li et al 2011 niazi et al 2015 uhrbrand et al 2017 fathi et al reported that the highest concentration of airborne bacteria 1373 cfu m3 on average was found downwind of the aeration basins fathi et al 2017 and szyłak szydłowski found that concentrations of airborne bacteria at the grit chamber 3 1 103 to 1 1 104 cfu m3 and the bar screen 1 3 103 to 2 3 103 cfu m3 were apparently higher than those at other sites szyłak szydłowski et al 2016 wastewater discharged into wwtp contained water soluble ions wsis such as cl so4 2 nh4 na and ca2 wsis usually adhere to the water surface by van der waals and electrostatic forces with the aeration and mechanical agitation of wastewater treatment facilities the external forces exerted on wsis were strong enough to overcome the local adhesion forces between wsis and the water surface which could carry wsis into atmosphere by water droplets and present with airborne bacteria wickman 1994 water soluble ions wsis such as no3 so4 2 and nh4 are considered important contributors to visibility impairment and haze fog weather liang et al 2017 previous studies revealed that the emission of wsis can also impact climate change by influencing the formation of cloud condensation nuclei du et al 2014 air pollution caused by water soluble ions especially generated from wwtps should because for concern and solved with efforts the seasonal variations of bacterial concentrations may be associated with various meteorological conditions such as temperature relative humidity rh solar radiation sr and wind speed karra and katsivela 2007 as shown in table 7 the concentrations of airborne bacteria were positively correlated to temperature p 0 01 and rh p 0 05 in contrast wind speed had a negative effect on bacterial loads p 0 05 the appropriate temperature 27 6 40 1 c and rh 37 8 57 4 in summer were suitable for the survival of airborne bacteria resulting in the highest numbers of bacteria present in the air wind dilutes airborne bacterial concentrations and sr can lead to the inactivation of microorganisms wang et al 2018 the roofs and walls of cs and sdh reduced the dispersion of airborne bacteria and prevented their damage from sr the lower wind speed 0 11 0 21 m s and tender sr 1 3 1 9 w m2 in cs led to the accumulation of airborne bacteria in this study the highest levels of bacteria were detected in the ant both in winter and summer the ant was covered with fiberglass due to the same reason high levels of airborne bacteria emerged at this site dilution of ventilation by mechanical or natural systems is a convenient way to reduce bioaerosols ghosh et al 2015 over 60 of airborne bacteria generated from a wastewater treatment station were reduced after 4 h of ventilation guo et al 2014 the bar screens in cs and centrifuges in sdh require regular maintenance by technicians therefore on these working sites it is necessary to introduce fresh air via periodical ventilation to prevent workers from the hazards of the accumulated airborne bacteria see table 4 4 2 bacterial diversity in the air at individual stages the principal component analysis pca was used to illustrate the variation in bacterial population among air samples collected from the different facilities fig 4 the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained 65 0 and 20 6 of the data variation respectively a clear separation was observed between the air samples collected from the indoor and outdoor facilities air samples obtained from agc aet and ant showed similarities whereas samples from cs and sdh occupied distinct positions airborne bacterial populations in the samples collected from indoor installations were quite different from those acquired from outside treatment stages sourcetracker analysis was performed to determine the sources of airborne bacteria presented both at indoor and outdoor treatment stages for the sites with facilities located indoors e g cs and sdh wastewater or sludge constituted a main proportion of the sources of airborne bacteria the largest contribution of wastewater to airborne bacteria 15 77 was observed in cs while the highest percentage of airborne bacteria originated from sludge 3 12 was found in sdh for outdoor facilities a higher percentage of airborne bacteria was obtained from outside ambient air ambient air contributed 76 45 and 70 00 of the sources of airborne bacteria present in the agc and aet respectively the quality of water is one of the key parameters that affect the concentration population structure and diversity of airborne bacteria the canonical correspondence analysis cca revealed that the concentrations of nh4 n ss na cl and tn in the water had a positive action on acinetobacter chryseobacterium lysinibacillus moraxella and arcobacter in air samples table 8 and fig 5 while the concentrations of tp cod toc and no3 showed a negative correlation with cyanobacteria micrococcus pseudomonas and bacillus variations in the raw water quality might affect the airborne bacterial population 4 3 risk of airborne bacteria exposure in this study on account of the presence of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria the health risks of exposure to airborne bacteria should not be ignored the results of the health risk assessment indicated that inhalation is the main pathway of airborne bacteria exposure previous investigations showed that the dominant particle sizes of airborne bacteria emitted from wwtps predominantly ranged from 0 65 μm to 4 7 μm ding et al 2016 katsivela et al 2017 li et al 2011 small particles with a size less than 5 μm can easily penetrate the lower airway of humans through inhalation and result in asthma or allergies gao et al 2015 the risks of inhalation were significantly higher at sites with high loads of airborne bacteria such as agc cs and aet suggesting that an outbreak of airborne bacteria at these sites would cause high risk scenarios in the wwtps management measures are therefore worthy of consideration at facilities with high emission levels of airborne bacteria in this study the health risks were estimated based on an 8 h day exposure time and 250 days year frequency but we can be certain that exposure would continue beyond the 8 h period especially for nearby residents of the wwtp the exposure time and frequency are uncertain which could lead to an underestimation of the health risks actual risks of exposure to airborne bacteria for both on site workers and neighbor communities would exceed the calculated values demonstrated in tables 4 6 some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria e g micrococcus bacteroides chryseobacterium pseudomonas and acinetobacter were found in the wwtp air sourcetracker analysis illustrated that 5 74 36 41 of the pathogens identified from air samples were originated from wastewater in the wwtp fig 3b although micrococcus seldom pose health risks to humans under normal circumstances it can cause infection in individuals with compromised immune systems smith et al 1999 bacteroides species are widely used as indicators of fecal pollution of water kabiri et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 however only a few studies have focused on their presence in wwtp air nehme et al 2008 some bacteroides species are potential pathogens and long term exposure to these bacteria can lead to the development of peritonitis and respiratory tract infections napier et al 2017 chryseobacterium was detected in inhalable particulate matters gou et al 2016 numerous studies confirm that this genus as a causative agent of pneumonia as well as urinary tract and bloodstream infections lin et al 2004 epidemiological studies have indicated that some pseudomonas species are pathogenic to humans pseudomonas aeruginosa was a clinically relevant antibiotic resistant bacterium and was the most abundant pathogenic microorganism in a hospital s atmospheric environment potentially causing secretion systems disease gao et al 2018 acinetobacter widely distributes in soil and water and is a causative pathogen of lung infections noto et al 2015 the existence of opportunistic pathogens amplified the potential exposure risks for both wwtp workers and nearby residents furthermore for vulnerable groups e g children the elderly immunocompromised individuals and postoperative convalescence patients living around the wwtp the health risks would be higher than those for the healthy people various studies have indicated that long term exposure can cause multiple chronic diseases in children and the elderly jahne et al 2015 mendell 2007 to reduce the health risks of the susceptible individuals effective measures should be taken to decrease the duration and frequency of exposure chemical particles in bioaerosols could influence the survival of microorganisms and airborne bacterial species wang et al 2018 because of the variation in meteorological conditions the sampling results may also be biased cca results illustrated that the communities of airborne bacteria were associated with both the chemical particles and the meteorological conditions fig 6 water soluble ions e g so4 2 ca2 and nh4 showed a positive correlation with some species such as acinetobacter chryseobacterium arcobacter micrococcus and aeromonas while cl no3 and wind speed had negative effects on these bacteria hence in future studies a year round observation should be conducted to further investigate the impacts of meteorological conditions microbial population and chemical components on the risk based analysis results hitherto the guideline and information for health risks associated with airborne bacteria exposure in wwtps were limited aware of the potential exposure risks this study highlights the importance of strict occupational protection and hygiene practices such as wearing masks and working clothes inside wwtps reducing the transmission of harmful microbes to the surroundings and preventing the survival of airborne bacteria from the perspective of human health in wwtps facilities which generate high quantities of airborne bacteria must be covered capture and destruction technologies such as uv radiation lee 2011 photocatalysis josset et al 2010 and biofiltration ralebitso senior et al 2012 could be used to control bioaerosol emission 5 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the characterization and source of airborne bacteria emission in a typical wwtp and to evaluate their health risks the main conclusions are as follows the concentrations and communities of airborne bacteria showed significant differences at individual stages aeration and mechanical agitation accelerated the release of airborne bacteria wastewater and sludge were main sources of airborne bacteria especially for indoor treatment facilities on average 22 25 and 9 56 of the pathogens identified from air samples originated from wastewater and sludge for on site employees and local residents inhalation was the main pathway exposure to airborne bacteria long term exposure to airborne pathogens may lead to chronic diseases the results of this study are of great importance for risk assessments and the control of airborne bacteria in wwtps acknowledgments the authors express their sincerely acknowledgements to editage services center of professional editing support for the

reported among wwtps employees benami et al 2016 heinonen tanski et al 2009 li et al 2016 since airborne bacteria usually attach to the surface of small particles they can be easily carried by the

water spray irrigation hamilton et al 2018 greywater reuse benami et al 2016 and other water environments de man et al 2014 the results of qmra are usually based on one or several target pathogens considering the complexity of airborne bacterial communities present in wwtps the implementation of a model that uses the average daily dose rates add of inhalation or contact with these organisms is recommended by the united states environmental protection agency u s epa to assess the risk posed by exposure this model had been used by li et al to evaluate the risks of bacterial aerosols emitted from the rotating brush aerator in a wwtp in xi an china li et al 2013 the exposure hazard quotient by inhalation was 105 times greater than that by skin contact the sites containing moving mechanical equipment such as screens and aerators have higher levels of bioaerosols szyłak szydłowski et al 2016 the aeration systems based on submerged diffusers produced less airborne bacteria than those that utilized surface aerators sánchez monedero et al 2008 the risks of exposure to airborne microorganisms may vary depending on type capacity and performance of the wastewater treatment facilities

were collected at each sampling site in this study in order to enhance the survival of airborne bacteria all samplings were conducted early in the morning from 6 a m to 10 a m when the relative humidity was high and solar radiation was relatively weak air samples were continuously gathered on quartz membranes 90 mm whatman qm a at an average flow rate of 100 l min without disturbing the operation of the treatment facilities prior to sampling organic compounds were removed from membranes by heating at 500 c for 4 5 h and membrane holders were washed with a 75 ethanol solution after sampling all the membranes were removed from the samplers covered and stored at 20 c for subsequent analysis during the sampling temperature and relative humidity rh were measured using a thermohygrometer 635 1 testo germany solar radiation and wind speed were determined with an irradiance meter sl 102 di log u k and an anemometer dl7010 di log u k respectively meteorological factors

filtered with 0 22 μm filters the membranes with residues were used for the microbial assays the filtrate was used for organic compounds and water soluble ions wsis analyses 2 3 1 microbial assay for the enumeration of the airborne bacteria 200 μl of the suspension was inoculated onto nutrient agar br aoboxing biotech co ltd china and cultured at 30 c for 48 h the colonies of airborne bacteria were counted and expressed as colony forming units per cubic meter cfu m3 microbial communities of airborne bacteria and water sludge samples were analyzed by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing method bacterial dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio carlsbad u s a the v3 and v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna were amplified by pcr using primers 515f and 907r each

rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu against the silva database release115 http www arb silva de with an 80 confidence threshold han et al 2018 2 3 2 chemical analysis total organic carbon toc in the air samples was detected using a carbon analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan concentrations of anions such as no3 no2 cl so4 2 and po4 3 were measured using an ion chromatography system ics 1000 dionex u s a concentrations of cations e g na mg2 ca2 nh4 and k were also determined by an ion chromatography system ic plus 883 metrohm switzerland 2 3 3 statistical analysis the one way analysis of variance anova 1 was used to compare the concentrations of airborne bacteria from different sites the two way analysis of variance anova 2 was applied to evaluate the effects of season on airborne bacterial concentrations unilateral student s t test was used to compare airborne bacterial concentration detected from downwind with those inside the wwtp fracchia et al 2006 the relationship between the concentrations of airborne bacteria and meteorological conditions was examined using spearman s correlation analysis all analyses were performed with the ibm spss statistics 21 0 sourcetracker a bayesian approach was applied to attribute microbial communities in an environmental sink to various potential sources and to estimate the probability that each source contributed to the sink communities wang et al 2017 in this study microbial communities of airborne bacteria were considered as a sink while wastewater ambient air and sludge samples were considered as three major known sources respectively unknown were taxa that could not map to the input sources wang et al 2017 sourcetracker analysis was conducted using r 3 4 1 the shannon index h was used to compute bacterial diversity h was calculated by h p i ln p i where p i is the proportion of each group of microorganisms in a sample 2 4 risk assessment the exposure rates and risk assessment of airborne bacteria were estimated based on the models recommended by the u s epa the average daily dose rates add through inhalation and skin contact were evaluated using the following eqs 1 add inhalation c i r e f e d inhalation b w a t 2 a d d skin c s a a b s a f e f e d skin b w a t where add inhalation and add skin represent the average daily doses of exposure by inhalation and skin contact cfu kg d c is the airborne bacterial concentration cfu m3 ir is the inhalation rate m3 d ef is the exposure frequency d yr ed inhalation and ed skin are the duration of exposure duration by inhalation and skin contact yr sa is the surface area of skin contact m2 abs is the dermal absorption factor m h af is the skin adherence factor bw is the body weight kg and at is the average lifetime d all the parameters in eqs 1 and 2 are summarized in table s2 airborne bacteria are non carcinogenic the non cancer risks of exposure by inhalation and skin contact were assessed using the following eqs 3 h q a d d r f d 4 h i h q i where hq is the hazard quotient hi is the hazard index representing the sum of the risks of each pollutant from multiple exposure pathways rfd is the reference dose cfu kg d representing the maximum acceptable daily dose of a substance the rfd of airborne bacteria has not been determined until now concentration of the cultivable bacterial exposure should not exceed 500 cfu m3 on a working day as recommended by the bioaerosols committee of the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists acgih therefore the limit of 500 cfu m3 was employed in this study when hq 1 or hi 1 risks can be ignored when hq 1 or hi 1 potential adverse health risks are of concern chen and carter 2017 3 results 3 1 emission levels of airborne bacteria and wsis the emission levels of airborne bacteria detected from each sampling site during three seasons are shown in table 1 in this study the amounts of airborne bacteria exhibited site related and seasonal variation positive correlations anova 1 p 0 001 between sites and bacterial concentrations were observed in winter spring and summer table 2 compared with other sampling sites treatment stages of cs agc pst ant and aet were the main emission sources with high airborne bacteria emission levels ranged from 257 to 4878 cfu m3 diffusion of airborne bacteria was observed in the vertical direction from the water surface of aet in summer the concentration of airborne bacteria near the water surface was 2399 291 cfu m3 when the sampling height was increased to 1 5 m and 3 0 m above the water surface the bacterial concentrations decreased by 53 8 and 90 0 to 1109 137 cfu m3 and 241 48 cfu m3 respectively similar phenomena were observed in the concentrations of airborne bacteria in spring and winter the airborne bacterial concentrations at the external downwind site of the wwtp were compared with those inside the wwtp by unilateral student s t test the results revealed that both in spring and summer concentrations of airborne bacteria at the external downwind site were significantly less than those inside the plant p 0 001 the decline in airborne bacterial concentration was mainly caused by dispersion and wind dilution in winter there was little difference in airborne bacterial loads between inside and external downwind of the plant p 0 059 bioaerosols emitted from wwtps contain not only microbes but also chemicals four anions cl no3 no2 and so4 2 and five cations na nh4 k mg2 and ca2 were detected in all the air samples table 3 the main anions were cl no3 and so4 2 the highest concentrations of cl 127 37 μg m3 and no3 24 43 μg m3 were detected in ant while the highest concentration of so4 2 119 75 μg m3 was observed in agc na was the dominant cation and was detected from all the sampling sites with small differences in concentration the concentrations of total organic carbon toc varied from 9 61 to 27 85 μg m3 the highest toc concentration was observed in samples collected from cs 3 2 microbial populations of airborne bacteria high throughput sequencing technique was applied to assay the microbial populations of airborne bacteria emitted from each site this approach provides a broad profile of numerous microorganisms including potential pathogenic bacteria present in the air of wwtps ghosh et al 2015 airborne bacteria collected from sdh had the highest species richness h 5 71 table s3 compared with those captured from other facilities with 520 species appeared in its surrounding air among those species acinetobacter 6 51 chryseobacterium 6 46 nocardioides 4 45 saccharibacteria norank 3 88 and micrococcus 2 63 were the most abundant bacterial populations fig 2 bacterial communities identified from ant and agc also showed a higher diversity h 5 29 and 5 59 respectively mycobacterium 1 15 2 89 and chroococcidiopsis 1 53 2 00 were the main bacteria in the air of the two treatment stages higher percentages of chryseobacterium 8 51 acinetobacter 7 32 and arcobacter 7 07 were detected in cs arcobacter 4 46 and acinetobacter 2 48 were also dominant among airborne bacteria collected from pst the other dominated bacteria present in pst were aeromonas 2 61 and bacteroides 1 12 cyanobacteria norank 4 13 mycobacterium 3 56 and bacillus 1 36 showed higher abundance in air samples from aet for air samples collected from sst the dominated species was pseudomonas 1 15 opportunistic pathogens such as arcobacter micrococcus chryseobacterium bacteroides acinetobacter bacillus mycobacterium pseudomonas enterococcus and aeromonas were also identified in air samples different pathogenic bacteria dominated at individual treatment stages pathogens acinetobacter chryseobacterium and micrococcus were abundant in the surrounding air of cs agc and sdh aeromonas arcobacter and bacteroides were the main pathogens in the air of pst while mycobacterium and bacillus were the dominant pathogens at aet and ant 3 3 sources of airborne bacteria the sourcetracker was used to analyze the sources of airborne bacteria combined with bacterial communities in wastewater sludge and outside ambient air fig 3 a showed that 2 35 15 77 of airborne bacteria were obtained from wastewater and 28 16 78 31 of airborne bacteria were found in outside ambient air a very small proportion of airborne bacteria 1 28 in average was recovered from sludge the sources of the remaining bacteria were unknown 21 74 in average the unknown sources were probably the surrounding plants soils and dust with the increase of vertical height from the water surface in aet the percentages of airborne bacteria from wastewater and sludge decreased from 10 48 to 5 36 and from 2 16 to 1 22 respectively and the proportion of airborne bacteria from outside ambient air increased obviously from 70 00 to 78 31 cyanobacteria norank 7 26 bacillus 3 56 and chroococcidiopsis 2 86 were identified as the main bacteria in the ambient air the dominant populations in wastewater were arcobacter 68 63 bacteroides 5 91 zoogloea 4 20 and aeromonas 1 75 pseudomonas 95 22 was the major group in sludge most of the dominant species in outside ambient air wastewater and sludge were also found among the airborne bacteria the high proportion of arcobacter in the water led to a relatively high detection percentage 0 94 7 07 of this genus being detected in airborne bacteria 3 4 health risk assessment the inhalation and skin contact risks of airborne bacteria in the wwtp were calculated for adult males adult females and children tables 4 and 5 in this study for both adults and children the health risks of airborne bacteria by inhalation were several orders of magnitude higher than those by skin contact indicating that inhalation was the main pathway of exposure to airborne bacteria in the wwtp the average inhalation risks for both adult males and females were less than 1 suggesting that the inhalation risks for adults were negligible however the hqs for children were much higher than those for adults in particular the hq for children at the agc in the summer was 1 23 indicating that exposure to airborne bacteria could cause adverse health effects for children at this site remarkable differences in the risks were observed at various treatment stages anova 1 p 0 001 at sites with high levels of airborne bacteria such as cs aet and agc the health risks were significantly higher in addition the inhalation risks of airborne bacteria in summer were higher than those in the other two seasons airborne bacteria emitted from wastewater treatment facilities would be transported to the downwind area by wind affecting residents of surrounding areas the calculated hqs of exposure to airborne bacteria through inhalation and skin contact were less than 1 for both adults and children living nearby the wwtp table 6 4 discussion 4 1 concentration of airborne bacteria at individual stages in this study the treatment facilities in cs and sdh were installed indoors while the other facilities e g agc pst and aet were located outside airborne bacteria presented in the air of all the treatment stages there were six bar screens installed in cs to remove solid materials from water the drive chains of the bar screens continuously disturbed the water surface resulting in the airborne bacterial emission excess sludge consists of chemicals inorganic and organic compounds and microbial cells active microorganisms and microbial residues in sdh decanter centrifuges were applied for sludge dewatering the sludge for dehydration was pumped into the cylindrical part of the centrifuge through the feed pipes water was continuously separated from the sludge in the centrifuge with high rotational speed solid particles with high density were collected and compacted to the bottom of the cylindrical part during the sludge delivery and dewatering some microbial aggregates bacteria pathogens and inorganic particles attached to the surface of the sludge were small enough to disperse into the surrounding air which could be detected after aerosolization agc pst and aet were located outside without capping and high concentrations of airborne bacteria were detected from these facilities agc was employed to remove grit such as gravel sand and other heavy solid materials in agc wastewater flowed through the tank in a spiral path air was introduced along one side of the tank to perpendicular to the water flow the heavier grit particles settled to the bottom of the tank while lighter particles remained in suspension the injection of air agitated the water body resulting in the release of microorganisms to the atmosphere pst was constructed to remove entrained suspended solids using gravity the turbulence of water accelerated the airborne bacteria generation in the present study fine pore diffusers were adopted in the aeration tank of the investigated wwtp large amounts of fine bubbles with a diameter of less than 5 mm were generated during the air supply processes when the bubbles reached the surface of water they burst into small film droplets and were propelled up to 15 cm above the water surface resulting in airborne bacteria formation the aeration processes promoted the transfer of the microorganisms from water to air greatly affecting the numbers of airborne microorganisms bauer et al 2002 the treatment stages e g cs agc and aet containing facilities for mechanical agitations or aeration were the sites with the highest levels of airborne bacteria emission airborne bacterial emissions from wwtps have been extensively studied and similar results have been reported li et al 2011 niazi et al 2015 uhrbrand et al 2017 fathi et al reported that the highest concentration of airborne bacteria 1373 cfu m3 on average was found downwind of the aeration basins fathi et al 2017 and szyłak szydłowski found that concentrations of airborne bacteria at the grit chamber 3 1 103 to 1 1 104 cfu m3 and the bar screen 1 3 103 to 2 3 103 cfu m3 were apparently higher than those at other sites szyłak szydłowski et al 2016 wastewater discharged into wwtp contained water soluble ions wsis such as cl so4 2 nh4 na and ca2 wsis usually adhere to the water surface by van der waals and electrostatic forces with the aeration and mechanical agitation of wastewater treatment facilities the external forces exerted on wsis were strong enough to overcome the local adhesion forces between wsis and the water surface which could carry wsis into atmosphere by water droplets and present with airborne bacteria wickman 1994 water soluble ions wsis such as no3 so4 2 and nh4 are considered important contributors to visibility impairment and haze fog weather liang et al 2017 previous studies revealed that the emission of wsis can also impact climate change by influencing the formation of cloud condensation nuclei du et al 2014 air pollution caused by water soluble ions especially generated from wwtps should because for concern and solved with efforts the seasonal variations of bacterial concentrations may be associated with various meteorological conditions such as temperature relative humidity rh solar radiation sr and wind speed karra and katsivela 2007 as shown in table 7 the concentrations of airborne bacteria were positively correlated to temperature p 0 01 and rh p 0 05 in contrast wind speed had a negative effect on bacterial loads p 0 05 the appropriate temperature 27 6 40 1 c and rh 37 8 57 4 in summer were suitable for the survival of airborne bacteria resulting in the highest numbers of bacteria present in the air wind dilutes airborne bacterial concentrations and sr can lead to the inactivation of microorganisms wang et al 2018 the roofs and walls of cs and sdh reduced the dispersion of airborne bacteria and prevented their damage from sr the lower wind speed 0 11 0 21 m s and tender sr 1 3 1 9 w m2 in cs led to the accumulation of airborne bacteria in this study the highest levels of bacteria were detected in the ant both in winter and summer the ant was covered with fiberglass due to the same reason high levels of airborne bacteria emerged at this site dilution of ventilation by mechanical or natural systems is a convenient way to reduce bioaerosols ghosh et al 2015 over 60 of airborne bacteria generated from a wastewater treatment station were reduced after 4 h of ventilation guo et al 2014 the bar screens in cs and centrifuges in sdh require regular maintenance by technicians therefore on these working sites it is necessary to introduce fresh air via periodical ventilation to prevent workers from the hazards of the accumulated airborne bacteria see table 4 4 2 bacterial diversity in the air at individual stages the principal component analysis pca was used to illustrate the variation in bacterial population among air samples collected from the different facilities fig 4 the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained 65 0 and 20 6 of the data variation respectively a clear separation was observed between the air samples collected from the indoor and outdoor facilities air samples obtained from agc aet and ant showed similarities whereas samples from cs and sdh occupied distinct positions airborne bacterial populations in the samples collected from indoor installations were quite different from those acquired from outside treatment stages sourcetracker analysis was performed to determine the sources of airborne bacteria presented both at indoor and outdoor treatment stages for the sites with facilities located indoors e g cs and sdh wastewater or sludge constituted a main proportion of the sources of airborne bacteria the largest contribution of wastewater to airborne bacteria 15 77 was observed in cs while the highest percentage of airborne bacteria originated from sludge 3 12 was found in sdh for outdoor facilities a higher percentage of airborne bacteria was obtained from outside ambient air ambient air contributed 76 45 and 70 00 of the sources of airborne bacteria present in the agc and aet respectively the quality of water is one of the key parameters that affect the concentration population structure and diversity of airborne bacteria the canonical correspondence analysis cca revealed that the concentrations of nh4 n ss na cl and tn in the water had a positive action on acinetobacter chryseobacterium lysinibacillus moraxella and arcobacter in air samples table 8 and fig 5 while the concentrations of tp cod toc and no3 showed a negative correlation with cyanobacteria micrococcus pseudomonas and bacillus variations in the raw water quality might affect the airborne bacterial population 4 3 risk of airborne bacteria exposure in this study on account of the presence of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria the health risks of exposure to airborne bacteria should not be ignored the results of the health risk assessment indicated that inhalation is the main pathway of airborne bacteria exposure previous investigations showed that the dominant particle sizes of airborne bacteria emitted from wwtps predominantly ranged from 0 65 μm to 4 7 μm ding et al 2016 katsivela et al 2017 li et al 2011 small particles with a size less than 5 μm can easily penetrate the lower airway of humans through inhalation and result in asthma or allergies gao et al 2015 the risks of inhalation were significantly higher at sites with high loads of airborne bacteria such as agc cs and aet suggesting that an outbreak of airborne bacteria at these sites would cause high risk scenarios in the wwtps management measures are therefore worthy of consideration at facilities with high emission levels of airborne bacteria in this study the health risks were estimated based on an 8 h day exposure time and 250 days year frequency but we can be certain that exposure would continue beyond the 8 h period especially for nearby residents of the wwtp the exposure time and frequency are uncertain which could lead to an underestimation of the health risks actual risks of exposure to airborne bacteria for both on site workers and neighbor communities would exceed the calculated values demonstrated in tables 4 6 some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria e g micrococcus bacteroides chryseobacterium pseudomonas and acinetobacter were found in the wwtp air sourcetracker analysis illustrated that 5 74 36 41 of the pathogens identified from air samples were originated from wastewater in the wwtp fig 3b although micrococcus seldom pose health risks to humans under normal circumstances it can cause infection in individuals with compromised immune systems smith et al 1999 bacteroides species are widely used as indicators of fecal pollution of water kabiri et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 however only a few studies have focused on their presence in wwtp air nehme et al 2008 some bacteroides species are potential pathogens and long term exposure to these bacteria can lead to the development of peritonitis and respiratory tract infections napier et al 2017 chryseobacterium was detected in inhalable particulate matters gou et al 2016 numerous studies confirm that this genus as a causative agent of pneumonia as well as urinary tract and bloodstream infections lin et al 2004 epidemiological studies have indicated that some pseudomonas species are pathogenic to humans pseudomonas aeruginosa was a clinically relevant antibiotic resistant bacterium and was the most abundant pathogenic microorganism in a hospital s atmospheric environment potentially causing secretion systems disease gao et al 2018 acinetobacter widely distributes in soil and water and is a causative pathogen of lung infections noto et al 2015 the existence of opportunistic pathogens amplified the potential exposure risks for both wwtp workers and nearby residents furthermore for vulnerable groups e g children the elderly immunocompromised individuals and postoperative convalescence patients living around the wwtp the health risks would be higher than those for the healthy people various studies have indicated that long term exposure can cause multiple chronic diseases in children and the elderly jahne et al 2015 mendell 2007 to reduce the health risks of the susceptible individuals effective measures should be taken to decrease the duration and frequency of exposure chemical particles in bioaerosols could influence the survival of microorganisms and airborne bacterial species wang et al 2018 because of the variation in meteorological conditions the sampling results may also be biased cca results illustrated that the communities of airborne bacteria were associated with both the chemical particles and the meteorological conditions fig 6 water soluble ions e g so4 2 ca2 and nh4 showed a positive correlation with some species such as acinetobacter chryseobacterium arcobacter micrococcus and aeromonas while cl no3 and wind speed had negative effects on these bacteria hence in future studies a year round observation should be conducted to further investigate the impacts of meteorological conditions microbial population and chemical components on the risk based analysis results hitherto the guideline and information for health risks associated with airborne bacteria exposure in wwtps were limited aware of the potential exposure risks this study highlights the importance of strict occupational protection and hygiene practices such as wearing masks and working clothes inside wwtps reducing the transmission of harmful microbes to the surroundings and preventing the survival of airborne bacteria from the perspective of human health in wwtps facilities which generate high quantities of airborne bacteria must be covered capture and destruction technologies such as uv radiation lee 2011 photocatalysis josset et al 2010 and biofiltration ralebitso senior et al 2012 could be used to control bioaerosol emission 5 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the characterization and source of airborne bacteria emission in a typical wwtp and to evaluate their health risks the main conclusions are as follows the concentrations and communities of airborne bacteria showed significant differences at individual stages aeration and mechanical agitation accelerated the release of airborne bacteria wastewater and sludge were main sources of airborne bacteria especially for indoor treatment facilities on average 22 25 and 9 56 of the pathogens identified from air samples originated from wastewater and sludge for on site employees and local residents inhalation was the main pathway exposure to airborne bacteria long term exposure to airborne pathogens may lead to chronic diseases the results of this study are of great importance for risk assessments and the control of airborne bacteria in wwtps acknowledgments the authors express their sincerely acknowledgements to editage services center of professional editing support for the

19174,concern about the presence of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment from wastewater discharge is mounting in this work the occurrence and fate of atenolol metoprolol venlafaxine and chloramphenicol including 10 different stereoisomers were investigated in sewage and sludge from diverse treatment processes in 4 sewage treatment plants stps in hong kong via 4 sampling campaigns over a period of 2 years the average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the stps ranged from 4 91 g d to 6290 g d with sludge carrying much lower amounts than the discharged effluent mass balance analysis revealed that larger quantities of these pharmaceuticals were released during the dry seasons biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for atenolol and chloramphenicol and the removal via primary sedimentation and disinfection processes was insignificant 30 selectivity toward r atenolol s metoprolol and r venlafaxine was mostly found across secondary treated effluent samples sold as an enantiopure pharmaceutical in r r para form chloramphenicol was preferentially eliminated after biological process this is the first study on the occurrence of chloramphenicol enantiomers in the aquatic environment ecotoxicological assessment indicated that atenolol and metoprolol could pose risks to marine fish in effluent receiving waters i e the western waters and victoria harbor of hong kong while r atenolol could pose a risk to protozoans five times higher than the s enantiomer graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical enantiomer sewage seasonal mass balance risk assessment 1 introduction pharmaceutical consumption has increased considerably in recent years resulting in larger quantities of pharmaceuticals being released into wastewater mainly via human excretion as parent compounds conjugates and metabolites tiwari et al 2017 with constant input and incomplete removal during wastewater treatment high amounts of pharmaceutical residues have frequently been detected in receiving waters in concentrations varying from nanograms per liter to a few milligrams per liter alygizakis et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 this finding has triggered concern because these compounds are specifically designed to have positive effects on human animal health at low concentrations which is not certain to be the same for non target species subjected to continuous exposure causing disturbances to aquatic flora and fauna petrie et al 2015 valdés et al 2014 the situation may be further complicated by the presence of pharmaceuticals with chirality more than 50 of marketed pharmaceuticals are reported to be chiral sold as either racemic mixtures or single enantiomers sanganyado et al 2017 the main concern is that enantiomers of the same pharmaceutical despite their identical physicochemical properties can have different toxicological effects on exposed organisms petrie et al 2015 for instance s atenolol is more toxic to daphnia magna a crustacean and pseudokirchneriella subcapitata a microalga than r atenolol while r atenolol is four times more toxic to tetrahymena thermophila a protozoan de andrés et al 2009 increasing evidence has revealed enantioselective distribution of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment with non racemic compositions frequently observed in wastewater and receiving waters bagnall et al 2012 castrignanò et al 2018 lópez serna et al 2013 ma et al 2016 however there remains a paucity of information on the environmental behavior of chiral pharmaceuticals although numerous chiral analysis techniques that are robust and sensitive have been developed since the publication of the review by evans and kasprzyk hordern 2014 municipal wastewater sewage discharge can provide information on the local usage of marketed pharmaceuticals which can further be used to ascertain the amount of pharmaceuticals transported and to regulate their loading in the receiving aquatic environments luo et al 2014 an international metropolis such as hong kong with an extremely high population density 7000 people km2 is an ideal study site because it houses various sewage treatment types from preliminary to tertiary treatment in an area of only 1100 km2 csd 2018a wu et al 2017 daily about 2 8 106 m3 of sewage of which over 75 receives only chemically enhanced primary treatment cept the process by which ferric chloride and polymers are added to sedimentation basins to facilitate rapid sedimentation is discharged dsd 2017 the occurrence of several kinds of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics psychoactive medicines and illicit drugs has recently been recorded in the effluent and receiving waters of hong kong deng et al 2016 lai et al 2013 leung et al 2012 yu et al 2012 the enormous quantities of pharmaceutical containing sewage discharged from hong kong end up in the south china sea and could contaminate the marine environment however there has been no enantiomeric analysis of chiral pharmaceuticals relevant to the chinese marine environment therefore focusing on four chiral pharmaceuticals which are commonly used and of environmental concern including two antihypertensives atenolol and metoprolol classified as β blockers one psychoactive venlafaxine classified as an antidepressant and one antibiotic chloramphenicol the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the occurrences pollutant loads and removal efficiencies of the target analytes in sewage and sludge samples collected at 4 stps in hong kong featuring different treatment levels including both conventional e g primary sedimentation and biological treatment and more advanced approaches e g chlorination and ultraviolet uv disinfection 2 to monitor the distribution characteristics of these compounds from an enantiomeric perspective and 3 to conduct a preliminary risk assessment of the release of these pharmaceuticals into the receiving waters based on long term sampling 2

reliability of the methods the method recoveries in sewage and solid phase using sludge as the representative at low and high concentrations are provided in table a6 in general the recoveries ranged from 63 to 104 in all of the matrices concerned the instrumental lod was defined based on a signal to noise ratio 3 1 the method lods were calculated and corrected for matrix interferences ranging from 1 5 ng l to 7 5 ng l in influent from 0 3 ng l to 1 5 ng l in effluent and from 0 2 ng g dw to 1 0 ng g dw in sludge the method lods for each analyte are presented in table a7 the details of the qa qc procedures are provided in si section 1 4 2 4 data analysis mass balance analysis was performed by calculating the daily mass load of each analyte in the stp as well as the amount lost the daily

are described in si section 1 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved pharmaceuticals in influent and effluent all of the studied pharmaceuticals were detectable in the aqueous phase during the 2 year sampling campaign table 1 summarizes the ranges and means of the pharmaceutical concentrations as sums of the stereoisomers in the initial influent and final effluent from each stp note that sewage from different catchments mainly along victoria harbor is collected and preliminarily treated before being conveyed to plant d via deep sewage tunnels dsd 2015 thereby the initial influent is degritted influent for plant d while it is raw influent for plants a c the concentrations of the different pharmaceuticals varied greatly in the influent for the two β blockers the mean concentrations of atenolol found among the stps 2310 3850 ng l were of the same order of magnitude as those in greece papageorgiou et al 2016 the usa subedi and kannan 2015 and india subedi et al 2017 but were one order of magnitude higher than in germany gurke et al 2015 and australia roberts et al 2016 note comparisons among regions if unspecified were made with those reported for urban stps sampled within the past 5 years and similarly hereafter and the mean concentrations of metoprolol observed 732 1020 ng l were largely consistent with those published recently although the range of reported values is very wide gao et al 2016 gurke et al 2015 papageorgiou et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 sui et al 2015 this variation may reflect the fact that the usage shares of different β blockers vary from country to country for instance 25 of patients with high blood pressure in hong kong receive β blockers as initial therapy where atenolol is the most commonly prescribed tak 2015 wong et al 2014 while metoprolol is more often used in denmark jørgensen et al 2017 and the usa shah and stafford 2017 venlafaxine is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in developed countries and its high consumption could lead to the elevated levels found in those regions fong and ford 2014 the mean concentrations of venlafaxine in our study 46 4 140 ng l were of the same order of magnitude as those in greece india and australia papageorgiou et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 subedi et al 2017 but 3 6 times lower than those in germany gurke et al 2015 the usa subedi and kannan 2015 and slovakia ivanová et al 2017 chloramphenicol was present at relatively low levels but its mean concentrations 45 1 81 9 ng l were higher than those in other chinese stps in beijing gao et al 2016 shanghai sui et al 2015 and guangdong province sui et al 2015 regarding effluent the amounts of pharmaceuticals found depend on the influent concentrations the physicochemical properties of the target compounds and the removal efficiency of the stp leading to different distributions from those in influent papageorgiou et al 2016 the mean concentrations of atenolol in effluent varied widely 60 1 3400 ng l by over two orders of magnitude while the effluent levels of the other three pharmaceuticals fluctuated within one order of magnitude even higher levels were observed in effluent than influent in some cases the concentrations of chloramphenicol in effluent 16 1 70 2 ng l seemed to concur with those found in our previous work for which the samples were obtained in 2008 leung et al 2012 suggesting the continuous considerable local discharge and incomplete elimination after treatment of this compound in recent years 3 2 sorbed pharmaceuticals in sludge cake for the sorbed pharmaceuticals in solid phase namely spm the fractions of the pharmaceuticals sorbed to spm were all 2 of the total mass in sewage in the present study since this amount is negligible sorption to spm was excluded from the calculations and analysis the present article for the first time reports the presence of atenolol and venlafaxine in sludge collected from chinese stps further discussion on sorbed pharmaceuticals in solid phase can be found in si section 2 3 3 mass loads and mass balance analysis to estimate the inputs and emissions of the investigated pharmaceuticals in the communities served by each stp the daily mass loads and mass losses were calculated using equations 1 4 as summarized in table 2 the average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the stps ranged from 4 91 g d to 6290 g d with the largest proportion of each pharmaceutical always observed at plant d which serves 50 of the local population of hong kong overall 10 100 g of the four pharmaceuticals entered the 4 stps daily of which 630 g left via sludge cake while 8670 g left via the final effluent only 8 20 of the initial load was lost during treatment indicating poor pharmaceutical removal through the present treatment techniques since 2015 most of the sewage sludge in hong kong has been treated by incineration before the landfill disposal csd 2018b still 85 of the initial loads of the investigated pharmaceuticals were discharged via effluent which could have adverse effects on the receiving waters seasonal patterns were observed for the studied pharmaceuticals in influent during the 2 year sampling campaign fig 1 a where they generally had significantly higher mass loads during the dry winter seasons than the wet summer seasons p 0 05 the results demonstrate that larger quantities of these compounds were consumed in winter possibly due to higher incidences of certain diseases and ailments similar but less obvious seasonal patterns were also found in effluent fig 1b possibly because these compounds were more effectively removed by treatment in the warmer temperature of summer which could indicate higher risks to aquatic ecosystems during the dry seasons based on the mass balance analysis among the different pharmaceuticals atenolol and chloramphenicol two highly hydrophilic compounds mostly exhibited higher mass loads in influent whereas metoprolol and venlafaxine two moderately hydrophilic ones mainly showed higher mass loads after sewage treatment the sharpest increase in mass load occurred for venlafaxine at plant d which was elevated by 82 5 g d after treatment among the different stps plants a and b which are equipped with secondary treatment showed higher mass loss ratios of atenolol and chloramphenicol than plants c and d which feature cept the difference is mainly attributed to biodegradation and transformation the mass losses of metoprolol and venlafaxine however show similar trends between secondary treatment and cept revealing that they were resistant to biodegradation and the lower proportion of metoprolol in sludge 10 than in effluent compared to that of venlafaxine 30 further demonstrates the lower sorption propensity of metoprolol 3 4 removal efficiencies of different sewage treatment processes the removal efficiencies of the studied pharmaceuticals via the different treatment processes were calculated using equation 5 it should be noted that only grab samples were obtained from plants a and c and typical concentration fluctuation in the waste stream could skew the apparent removal efficiencies in these stps an increase in the concentration of a parent compound i e negative removal during treatment was observed in this study and secondary treatment equipped with activated sludge generally yielded higher overall removal efficiencies than cept treatment as shown in figure a4 plants a and b yielded average overall removal efficiencies via secondary treatment during the 2 year sampling campaign ranging from 7 56 to 98 0 and from negative removal to 67 3 respectively meanwhile for plants c and d where cept is performed the average overall removal efficiencies ranged from negative removal to 23 1 and from 4 18 to 15 5 respectively removal from the aqueous phase by cept mainly depends on the sorption potential of the suspended solids deposited via coagulation and flocculation the four pharmaceuticals investigated in this study are hydrophilic compounds with relatively low n octanol water partition coefficients likely leading to less sorption to cept sludge which is partially reflected by their relatively low sludge masses table 2 meanwhile secondary treatment provided good atenolol and chloramphenicol removal the relatively low mass loads in both effluent and sludge confirmed that biodegradation and transformation were the main reasons for the removal of these compounds at plants a and b for metoprolol and venlafaxine compounds with higher hydrophobicity the overall removal efficiencies were lower probably because these compounds were less biodegradable in the given hrts and srts table a2 in nearly half of the cases negative removal was obtained for metoprolol and venlafaxine this phenomenon could be explained as follows firstly changes could occur in the sorption behaviors of particles during sewage treatment lindberg et al 2005 secondly unanalyzed conjugates could be converted back to their free forms by enzymatic activity vieno et al 2007 microorganisms with glucuronidase activity could be present in stps making deconjugation likely to occur at least in partial cleavage of the conjugates ternes et al 1999 the removal efficiencies of the different treatment units are compared in figure a5 in the primary sedimentation tank combined with an hrt of 3 h the removal of organic compounds is achieved mainly by sorption to the solid phase and the degree of removal depends largely on the hydrophobicity of the substances where highly hydrophilic compounds are not expected to be removed during this treatment the studied pharmaceuticals showed negative to low removal efficiencies and the differences in average removal of each pharmaceutical were 13 compared with primary sedimentation the average removal of each pharmaceutical by cept was improved by 3 14 possibly because a tendency toward complex formation with ferric ions during sedimentation may enhance removal by coagulation flocculation a modified ludzack ettinger system with an initial anoxic zone for nitrogen removal followed by aerobic digestion is applied in secondary treatment the removal efficiencies of atenolol and chloramphenicol reached 60 mainly owing to effective biodegradation and transformation whereas negative removal was mostly observed for metoprolol and venlafaxine likely due to the insufficient hrts and srts and or the conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds ternes et al 1999 vieno et al 2007 before being discharged into the sea effluent in the stps in hong kong is disinfected by uv irradiation or chlorination during chlorination with a contact time of 13 min sodium hypochlorite may react with organic compounds while uv irradiation with a wavelength of 254 nm and a retention time of 0 426 s may oxidize organic compounds in water tsui et al 2014 the four pharmaceuticals however were removed with negative to low efficiencies by these treatments probably due to the low reaction potency with the added chemicals as well as the given time and uv wavelength few studies have addressed the fates and distributions of pharmaceuticals in individual treatment processes especially cept and disinfection guerra et al 2014 yan et al 2014 such information is urgently needed as many urban areas have huge and continually increasing pharmaceutical consumption and inadequate sewage treatment facilities 3 5 enantiomeric compositions of chiral pharmaceuticals it should be noted that three of the studied pharmaceuticals are mainly marketed as racemates while chloramphenicol is sold as its rr enantiomer compared with atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine each of which has one chiral center chloramphenicol contains two chiral centers and therefore exists in four stereoisomers all para nitro substituted rr and ss enantiomeric pairs threo diastereomers and rs and sr enantiomeric pairs erythro diastereomers berendsen et al 2011a the four stereoisomers are all biologically active but it has been reported that only the rr enantiomer has antimicrobial properties and if not explicitly mentioned the name chloramphenicol generally refers to the rr enantiomer also called levomycetin which is the generic commercial formulation berendsen et al 2011b a pair of enantiomers for a compound have identical physicochemical properties and the integrity of racemates is preserved i e ef 0 5 when the enantiomeric pair is subjected to achiral interactions such as abiotic elements in the wastewater treatment process while a deviation from an ef of 0 5 evidences enantioselectivity from biologically mediated processes such as enzyme mediated microbial biodegradation macleod et al 2007 the enantiomers of atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine as well as r r chloramphenicol were detectable in every sample while the mean detection frequencies of the other three chloramphenicol enantiomers ss sr and rs in all of the samples were 52 1 77 1 during the 2 year sampling campaign the efs of atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine as well as the stereoisomeric compositions of chloramphenicol in influent effluent and sludge are shown in fig 2 with a few exceptions there are no significant differences between the influent and racemic standards for the efs of atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine p 0 05 indicating their general racemic patterns in raw sewage fig 2a the pharmacological action of β blockers in humans is highly stereoselective where the s enantiomers of atenolol and metoprolol exhibit much higher cardiac β blocking potencies than their antipodes kasprzyk hordern 2010 around 85 of atenolol and 10 of metoprolol are thought to be excreted unchanged with efs for renal excretion of approximately 0 476 and 0 526 respectively lennard et al 1983 lienert et al 2007 mehvar et al 1990 the weak and insignificant enrichment of r atenolol efs mostly 0 5 and the generally racemic metoprolol in influent in this study suggest that more than just healthy renal excretion accounted for the input of these β blockers from the stp serving areas in other words enantioselectivity in metabolism may differ among individuals for metoprolol the racemic loading may also come from the discouraged practice of flushing unused prescriptions into sewers venlafaxine enantiomers interact with different signal molecules in the human central nervous system where the s enantiomer primarily inhibits serotonin reuptake while its antipode inhibits both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake the oral clearance of r venlafaxine is higher kasprzyk hordern 2010 over 90 of an oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed and it is excreted mainly as the o desmethyl metabolite only 5 unchanged in urine howell et al 1993 in the present study the weak and insignificant enrichment of r venlafaxine efs mostly 0 5 observed in influent however is unlikely to be attributable to oral clearance or renal excretion because of the low excretion rate of the parent compound it is possible that ef changes also occur during transport of sewage to treatment facilities even now the pharmacological action of chloramphenicol stereoisomers in humans remains unknown except for that of the rr enantiomer mainly because chloramphenicol is rarely used in human medicine today due to its adverse effect of bone marrow suppression eliakim raz et al 2014 consequently hardly any efforts were made to research the stereoisomerism of this drug before the enantiomers began attracting interest considering that chloramphenicol is mainly used for ocular treatment in hong kong it is supposed that its stereoisomers occur in raw sewage mainly in the form of the parent compound the rr enantiomer as shown in fig 2b the mean proportions of r r chloramphenicol in influent among the 4 stps in this study were 80 indicating that microbial stereoisomerization could occur before the rr enantiomer reaches the inlets of the stps however the possibility that stereoisomeric impurities already exist in the chloramphenicol formulations should not be ruled out the efs of atenolol and venlafaxine in effluent except for venlafaxine at plant c were significantly different from those in the racemic standards p 0 05 while racemic metoprolol was generally observed except for plant a for atenolol significant changes in the efs from influent to effluent were observed at plants a and b p 0 05 demonstrating that r atenolol was more enriched in treated sewage indicating that enantioselectivity occurred during secondary treatment meanwhile for venlafaxine the changes in the efs from influent to effluent were insignificant and a racemic pattern in influent and a selective enrichment toward the r enantiomer in effluent were found at plants a and b similar results were obtained for metoprolol especially at plant a racemic metoprolol was observed in influent while the s enantiomer was more enriched in treated sewage p 0 01 in the sludge samples however enantioselective enrichment was only observed for r atenolol at plant a and r venlafaxine at plant d p 0 05 while no significant changes in the efs were found between influent and sludge or between effluent and sludge p 0 05 one trend consistently observed across the stps was the selectivity toward r atenolol s metoprolol and r venlafaxine in effluent after secondary treatment with activated sludge a preferential attenuation of s atenolol was also observed in cept treated effluent these results support the claim that r atenolol is more readily enriched during different treatment processes with a higher selectivity found in biological process whereas enantioselectivity occurs for metoprolol and venlafaxine might be attributed to stereoselective adsorption on sludge sanganyado et al 2016 and less likely due to microbial activity however the selectivity for different enantiomers of the same pharmaceutical has been observed in diverse stps in several studies suggesting the possible different enantioselectivity regarding biochemical weathering during the treatment techniques utilized kasprzyk hordern 2010 sanganyado et al 2017 the mean proportions of r r chloramphenicol were found to decrease from influent to effluent among the 4 stps with significant reductions observed at plants a and b p 0 05 along with increases in the proportions of the ss sr and rs enantiomers the mean proportions of r r chloramphenicol in sludge were even lower with significant decreases compared to those in influent observed at plants a c while compared to effluent only the proportion of r r chloramphenicol in sludge from plant a was found significantly lower p 0 05 altogether preferential elimination of r r chloramphenicol occurred from influent to effluent and sludge after biological process the higher depletion of the r r enantiomer at plant a than at plant b as well as the significant reduction of the proportion of this enantiomer at plant c but not at plant d could be attributed to the differences in the abundances of cations between freshwater and saline sewage while plants a and c treat freshwater sewage plants b and d treat saline sewage due to the practice of seawater toilet flushing in the areas served by these plants table a2 the abundance of cations in saline sewage especially bivalent cations calcium and magnesium may effectively lessen the negative surface charge of sludge leading to less hydrophilic groups at the sludge surface which may play an important role in decreasing the interactions between saline sludge and pharmaceuticals at least antibiotics li and zhang 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that enantiomeric determination of multiclass chiral pharmaceuticals has been conducted in chinese wastewater this is also the first study on the enantiomer specific occurrence of environmental contaminants in cept plants 3 6 preliminary risk assessment of chiral pharmaceuticals in effluent due to incomplete removal pharmaceuticals present in effluent may pose threats to non target organisms in receiving marine environments the risk quotients rqs of the pharmaceuticals investigated in this study were estimated by dividing the measured environmental concentrations mecs by the corresponding predicted no effect concentrations pnecs echa 2008 toxicity data were obtained from literature focusing on aquatic organisms at different trophic levels including algae invertebrates and fish to assess the worst case scenarios rqworst the maximum mecs of each compound in effluent with a dilution factor of 10 and minimum pnecs for saltwater were applied in the preliminary risk assessment fig 3 the risk classification was based on the criteria whereby rq 0 01 unlikely to pose risk 0 01 rq 0 1 low risk 0 1 rq 1 medium risk and rq 1 high risk hernando et al 2006 due to the lack of toxicological literature the enantiomeric risk assessment was conducted only for atenolol detailed toxicological information is provided in table a8 in general fish were relatively more susceptible to the studied pharmaceuticals than organisms at lower trophic levels e g algae rotifers and crustaceans the resulting rqworst ranges from 0 01 to 184 the two β blockers contribute substantially to the risks because of their ubiquitous occurrence and their more sensitive endpoints among the studied pharmaceuticals metoprolol seems to be the most harmful to aquatic organisms rqworst 100 for crustaceans mollusks and fish and contribute the most to the overall rqworst thus the occurrence of the two β blockers especially metoprolol in hong kong waters i e the western waters and victoria harbor is a cause for high concern notably venlafaxine poses a medium risk 0 1 rqworst 1 for all of the taxonomic groups considered based on the effluent concentrations emphasis should be placed on this antidepressant in future investigations because the bioaccumulation of this compound in fish has been reported recently arnnok et al 2017 huerta et al 2018 in comparison the rqworst of r r chloramphenicol was less than 0 01 by 1 4 orders of magnitude indicating that it is unlikely to pose any risk however as relevant enantioselectivity characteristics remain unknown this judgement about the risk of chloramphenicol should not be considered final enantiomeric discrimination in the ecotoxicity of atenolol has been reported previously de andrés et al 2009 enabling us to conduct a preliminary risk assessment on these enantiomers based on the reported enantioselectivity that s atenolol is more toxic to algae and crustaceans than r atenolol the obtained rqworst also reveals that s atenolol could pose a slightly higher threat from unlikely to low to these aquatic organisms however data for a more sensitive species t thermophila a freshwater ciliate demonstrate that r atenolol is much more toxic than its antipode in terms of growth inhibition de andrés et al 2009 which could indicate potential harm to certain species such as protists with a medium risk due to the excess of the r enantiomer in effluent receiving waters knowledge about the responses of aquatic species to different pharmaceutical enantiomers is very limited and the fact that enantiomeric excess could pose a higher risk to certain organisms as indicated by the present study illustrates that the enantiomer specific toxicity of chiral pharmaceuticals should be taken into account when conducting ecological risk assessment for this class of contaminant 4 conclusions four chiral pharmaceuticals from 3 therapeutic classes covering 10 different stereoisomers were analyzed at 4 stps in hong kong during a 2 year sampling campaign all of the target compounds were detectable with concentrations ranging from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter in sewage and on the order of nanograms per gram dry weight in sludge the influent masses of the studied pharmaceuticals were higher in the dry seasons biological process generally removed these compounds better than cept and disinfection treatments seemed to have little effect on pharmaceutical elimination enantioselectivity toward r atenolol s metoprolol and r venlafaxine was mostly observed in secondary treated effluent and microbial activity mainly accounted for the preferential depletion of r r chloramphenicol especially in freshwater sewage marine fish may experience risks due to atenolol and metoprolol exposure in effluent receiving waters bearing in mind that the antimicrobial activity of chloramphenicol depends strongly upon its stereoisomerism this first report on enantiomer specific chloramphenicol residues in aquatic environments emphasizes the importance of examining in depth the possible effects of different chloramphenicol enantiomers in particular the ss sr and rs enantiomers for risk evaluation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

19174,concern about the presence of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment from wastewater discharge is mounting in this work the occurrence and fate of atenolol metoprolol venlafaxine and chloramphenicol including 10 different stereoisomers were investigated in sewage and sludge from diverse treatment processes in 4 sewage treatment plants stps in hong kong via 4 sampling campaigns over a period of 2 years the average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the stps ranged from 4 91 g d to 6290 g d with sludge carrying much lower amounts than the discharged effluent mass balance analysis revealed that larger quantities of these pharmaceuticals were released during the dry seasons biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for atenolol and chloramphenicol and the removal via primary sedimentation and disinfection processes was insignificant 30 selectivity toward r atenolol s metoprolol and r venlafaxine was mostly found across secondary treated effluent samples sold as an enantiopure pharmaceutical in r r para form chloramphenicol was preferentially eliminated after biological process this is the first study on the occurrence of chloramphenicol enantiomers in the aquatic environment ecotoxicological assessment indicated that atenolol and metoprolol could pose risks to marine fish in effluent receiving waters i e the western waters and victoria harbor of hong kong while r atenolol could pose a risk to protozoans five times higher than the s enantiomer graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical enantiomer sewage seasonal mass balance risk assessment 1 introduction pharmaceutical consumption has increased considerably in recent years resulting in larger quantities of pharmaceuticals being released into wastewater mainly via human excretion as parent compounds conjugates and metabolites tiwari et al 2017 with constant input and incomplete removal during wastewater treatment high amounts of pharmaceutical residues have frequently been detected in receiving waters in concentrations varying from nanograms per liter to a few milligrams per liter alygizakis et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 this finding has triggered concern because these compounds are specifically designed to have positive effects on human animal health at low concentrations which is not certain to be the same for non target species subjected to continuous exposure causing disturbances to aquatic flora and fauna petrie et al 2015 valdés et al 2014 the situation may be further complicated by the presence of pharmaceuticals with chirality more than 50 of marketed pharmaceuticals are reported to be chiral sold as either racemic mixtures or single enantiomers sanganyado et al 2017 the main concern is that enantiomers of the same pharmaceutical despite their identical physicochemical properties can have different toxicological effects on exposed organisms petrie et al 2015 for instance s atenolol is more toxic to daphnia magna a crustacean and pseudokirchneriella subcapitata a microalga than r atenolol while r atenolol is four times more toxic to tetrahymena thermophila a protozoan de andrés et al 2009 increasing evidence has revealed enantioselective distribution of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment with non racemic compositions frequently observed in wastewater and receiving waters bagnall et al 2012 castrignanò et al 2018 lópez serna et al 2013 ma et al 2016 however there remains a paucity of information on the environmental behavior of chiral pharmaceuticals although numerous chiral analysis techniques that are robust and sensitive have been developed since the publication of the review by evans and kasprzyk hordern 2014 municipal wastewater sewage discharge can provide information on the local usage of marketed pharmaceuticals which can further be used to ascertain the amount of pharmaceuticals transported and to regulate their loading in the receiving aquatic environments luo et al 2014 an international metropolis such as hong kong with an extremely high population density 7000 people km2 is an ideal study site because it houses various sewage treatment types from preliminary to tertiary treatment in an area of only 1100 km2 csd 2018a wu et al 2017 daily about 2 8 106 m3 of sewage of which over 75 receives only chemically enhanced primary treatment cept the process by which ferric chloride and polymers are added to sedimentation basins to facilitate rapid sedimentation is discharged dsd 2017 the occurrence of several kinds of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics psychoactive medicines and illicit drugs has recently been recorded in the effluent and receiving waters of hong kong deng et al 2016 lai et al 2013 leung et al 2012 yu et al 2012 the enormous quantities of pharmaceutical containing sewage discharged from hong kong end up in the south china sea and could contaminate the marine environment however there has been no enantiomeric analysis of chiral pharmaceuticals relevant to the chinese marine environment therefore focusing on four chiral pharmaceuticals which are commonly used and of environmental concern including two antihypertensives atenolol and metoprolol classified as β blockers one psychoactive venlafaxine classified as an antidepressant and one antibiotic chloramphenicol the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the occurrences pollutant loads and removal efficiencies of the target analytes in sewage and sludge samples collected at 4 stps in hong kong featuring different treatment levels including both conventional e g primary sedimentation and biological treatment and more advanced approaches e g chlorination and ultraviolet uv disinfection 2 to monitor the distribution characteristics of these compounds from an enantiomeric perspective and 3 to conduct a preliminary risk assessment of the release of these pharmaceuticals into the receiving waters based on long term sampling 2

are described in si section 1 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved pharmaceuticals in influent and effluent all of the studied pharmaceuticals were detectable in the aqueous phase during the 2 year sampling campaign table 1 summarizes the ranges and means of the pharmaceutical concentrations as sums of the stereoisomers in the initial influent and final effluent from each stp note that sewage from different catchments mainly along victoria harbor is collected and preliminarily treated before being conveyed to plant d via deep sewage tunnels dsd 2015 thereby the initial influent is degritted influent for plant d while it is raw influent for plants a c the concentrations of the different pharmaceuticals varied greatly in the influent for the two β blockers the mean concentrations of atenolol found among the stps 2310 3850 ng l were of the same order of magnitude as those in greece papageorgiou et al 2016 the usa subedi and kannan 2015 and india subedi et al 2017 but were one order of magnitude higher than in germany gurke et al 2015 and australia roberts et al 2016 note comparisons among regions if unspecified were made with those reported for urban stps sampled within the past 5 years and similarly hereafter and the mean concentrations of metoprolol observed 732 1020 ng l were largely consistent with those published recently although the range of reported values is very wide gao et al 2016 gurke et al 2015 papageorgiou et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 sui et al 2015 this variation may reflect the fact that the usage shares of different β blockers vary from country to country for instance 25 of patients with high blood pressure in hong kong receive β blockers as initial therapy where atenolol is the most commonly prescribed tak 2015 wong et al 2014 while metoprolol is more often used in denmark jørgensen et al 2017 and the usa shah and stafford 2017 venlafaxine is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in developed countries and its high consumption could lead to the elevated levels found in those regions fong and ford 2014 the mean concentrations of venlafaxine in our study 46 4 140 ng l were of the same order of magnitude as those in greece india and australia papageorgiou et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 subedi et al 2017 but 3 6 times lower than those in germany gurke et al 2015 the usa subedi and kannan 2015 and slovakia ivanová et al 2017 chloramphenicol was present at relatively low levels but its mean concentrations 45 1 81 9 ng l were higher than those in other chinese stps in beijing gao et al 2016 shanghai sui et al 2015 and guangdong province sui et al 2015 regarding effluent the amounts of pharmaceuticals found depend on the influent concentrations the physicochemical properties of the target compounds and the removal efficiency of the stp leading to different distributions from those in influent papageorgiou et al 2016 the mean concentrations of atenolol in effluent varied widely 60 1 3400 ng l by over two orders of magnitude while the effluent levels of the other three pharmaceuticals fluctuated within one order of magnitude even higher levels were observed in effluent than influent in some cases the concentrations of chloramphenicol in effluent 16 1 70 2 ng l seemed to concur with those found in our previous work for which the samples were obtained in 2008 leung et al 2012 suggesting the continuous considerable local discharge and incomplete elimination after treatment of this compound in recent years 3 2 sorbed pharmaceuticals in sludge cake for the sorbed pharmaceuticals in solid phase namely spm the fractions of the pharmaceuticals sorbed to spm were all 2 of the total mass in sewage in the present study since this amount is negligible sorption to spm was excluded from the calculations and analysis the present article for the first time reports the presence of atenolol and venlafaxine in sludge collected from chinese stps further discussion on sorbed pharmaceuticals in solid phase can be found in si section 2 3 3 mass loads and mass balance analysis to estimate the inputs and emissions of the investigated pharmaceuticals in the communities served by each stp the daily mass loads and mass losses were calculated using equations 1 4 as summarized in table 2 the average amounts of individual pharmaceuticals entering the stps ranged from 4 91 g d to 6290 g d with the largest proportion of each pharmaceutical always observed at plant d which serves 50 of the local population of hong kong overall 10 100 g of the four pharmaceuticals entered the 4 stps daily of which 630 g left via sludge cake while 8670 g left via the final effluent only 8 20 of the initial load was lost during treatment indicating poor pharmaceutical removal through the present treatment techniques since 2015 most of the sewage sludge in hong kong has been treated by incineration before the landfill disposal csd 2018b still 85 of the initial loads of the investigated pharmaceuticals were discharged via effluent which could have adverse effects on the receiving waters seasonal patterns were observed for the studied pharmaceuticals in influent during the 2 year sampling campaign fig 1 a where they generally had significantly higher mass loads during the dry winter seasons than the wet summer seasons p 0 05 the results demonstrate that larger quantities of these compounds were consumed in winter possibly due to higher incidences of certain diseases and ailments similar but less obvious seasonal patterns were also found in effluent fig 1b possibly because these compounds were more effectively removed by treatment in the warmer temperature of summer which could indicate higher risks to aquatic ecosystems during the dry seasons based on the mass balance analysis among the different pharmaceuticals atenolol and chloramphenicol two highly hydrophilic compounds mostly exhibited higher mass loads in influent whereas metoprolol and venlafaxine two moderately hydrophilic ones mainly showed higher mass loads after sewage treatment the sharpest increase in mass load occurred for venlafaxine at plant d which was elevated by 82 5 g d after treatment among the different stps plants a and b which are equipped with secondary treatment showed higher mass loss ratios of atenolol and chloramphenicol than plants c and d which feature cept the difference is mainly attributed to biodegradation and transformation the mass losses of metoprolol and venlafaxine however show similar trends between secondary treatment and cept revealing that they were resistant to biodegradation and the lower proportion of metoprolol in sludge 10 than in effluent compared to that of venlafaxine 30 further demonstrates the lower sorption propensity of metoprolol 3 4 removal efficiencies of different sewage treatment processes the removal efficiencies of the studied pharmaceuticals via the different treatment processes were calculated using equation 5 it should be noted that only grab samples were obtained from plants a and c and typical concentration fluctuation in the waste stream could skew the apparent removal efficiencies in these stps an increase in the concentration of a parent compound i e negative removal during treatment was observed in this study and secondary treatment equipped with activated sludge generally yielded higher overall removal efficiencies than cept treatment as shown in figure a4 plants a and b yielded average overall removal efficiencies via secondary treatment during the 2 year sampling campaign ranging from 7 56 to 98 0 and from negative removal to 67 3 respectively meanwhile for plants c and d where cept is performed the average overall removal efficiencies ranged from negative removal to 23 1 and from 4 18 to 15 5 respectively removal from the aqueous phase by cept mainly depends on the sorption potential of the suspended solids deposited via coagulation and flocculation the four pharmaceuticals investigated in this study are hydrophilic compounds with relatively low n octanol water partition coefficients likely leading to less sorption to cept sludge which is partially reflected by their relatively low sludge masses table 2 meanwhile secondary treatment provided good atenolol and chloramphenicol removal the relatively low mass loads in both effluent and sludge confirmed that biodegradation and transformation were the main reasons for the removal of these compounds at plants a and b for metoprolol and venlafaxine compounds with higher hydrophobicity the overall removal efficiencies were lower probably because these compounds were less biodegradable in the given hrts and srts table a2 in nearly half of the cases negative removal was obtained for metoprolol and venlafaxine this phenomenon could be explained as follows firstly changes could occur in the sorption behaviors of particles during sewage treatment lindberg et al 2005 secondly unanalyzed conjugates could be converted back to their free forms by enzymatic activity vieno et al 2007 microorganisms with glucuronidase activity could be present in stps making deconjugation likely to occur at least in partial cleavage of the conjugates ternes et al 1999 the removal efficiencies of the different treatment units are compared in figure a5 in the primary sedimentation tank combined with an hrt of 3 h the removal of organic compounds is achieved mainly by sorption to the solid phase and the degree of removal depends largely on the hydrophobicity of the substances where highly hydrophilic compounds are not expected to be removed during this treatment the studied pharmaceuticals showed negative to low removal efficiencies and the differences in average removal of each pharmaceutical were 13 compared with primary sedimentation the average removal of each pharmaceutical by cept was improved by 3 14 possibly because a tendency toward complex formation with ferric ions during sedimentation may enhance removal by coagulation flocculation a modified ludzack ettinger system with an initial anoxic zone for nitrogen removal followed by aerobic digestion is applied in secondary treatment the removal efficiencies of atenolol and chloramphenicol reached 60 mainly owing to effective biodegradation and transformation whereas negative removal was mostly observed for metoprolol and venlafaxine likely due to the insufficient hrts and srts and or the conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds ternes et al 1999 vieno et al 2007 before being discharged into the sea effluent in the stps in hong kong is disinfected by uv irradiation or chlorination during chlorination with a contact time of 13 min sodium hypochlorite may react with organic compounds while uv irradiation with a wavelength of 254 nm and a retention time of 0 426 s may oxidize organic compounds in water tsui et al 2014 the four pharmaceuticals however were removed with negative to low efficiencies by these treatments probably due to the low reaction potency with the added chemicals as well as the given time and uv wavelength few studies have addressed the fates and distributions of pharmaceuticals in individual treatment processes especially cept and disinfection guerra et al 2014 yan et al 2014 such information is urgently needed as many urban areas have huge and continually increasing pharmaceutical consumption and inadequate sewage treatment facilities 3 5 enantiomeric compositions of chiral pharmaceuticals it should be noted that three of the studied pharmaceuticals are mainly marketed as racemates while chloramphenicol is sold as its rr enantiomer compared with atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine each of which has one chiral center chloramphenicol contains two chiral centers and therefore exists in four stereoisomers all para nitro substituted rr and ss enantiomeric pairs threo diastereomers and rs and sr enantiomeric pairs erythro diastereomers berendsen et al 2011a the four stereoisomers are all biologically active but it has been reported that only the rr enantiomer has antimicrobial properties and if not explicitly mentioned the name chloramphenicol generally refers to the rr enantiomer also called levomycetin which is the generic commercial formulation berendsen et al 2011b a pair of enantiomers for a compound have identical physicochemical properties and the integrity of racemates is preserved i e ef 0 5 when the enantiomeric pair is subjected to achiral interactions such as abiotic elements in the wastewater treatment process while a deviation from an ef of 0 5 evidences enantioselectivity from biologically mediated processes such as enzyme mediated microbial biodegradation macleod et al 2007 the enantiomers of atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine as well as r r chloramphenicol were detectable in every sample while the mean detection frequencies of the other three chloramphenicol enantiomers ss sr and rs in all of the samples were 52 1 77 1 during the 2 year sampling campaign the efs of atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine as well as the stereoisomeric compositions of chloramphenicol in influent effluent and sludge are shown in fig 2 with a few exceptions there are no significant differences between the influent and racemic standards for the efs of atenolol metoprolol and venlafaxine p 0 05 indicating their general racemic patterns in raw sewage fig 2a the pharmacological action of β blockers in humans is highly stereoselective where the s enantiomers of atenolol and metoprolol exhibit much higher cardiac β blocking potencies than their antipodes kasprzyk hordern 2010 around 85 of atenolol and 10 of metoprolol are thought to be excreted unchanged with efs for renal excretion of approximately 0 476 and 0 526 respectively lennard et al 1983 lienert et al 2007 mehvar et al 1990 the weak and insignificant enrichment of r atenolol efs mostly 0 5 and the generally racemic metoprolol in influent in this study suggest that more than just healthy renal excretion accounted for the input of these β blockers from the stp serving areas in other words enantioselectivity in metabolism may differ among individuals for metoprolol the racemic loading may also come from the discouraged practice of flushing unused prescriptions into sewers venlafaxine enantiomers interact with different signal molecules in the human central nervous system where the s enantiomer primarily inhibits serotonin reuptake while its antipode inhibits both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake the oral clearance of r venlafaxine is higher kasprzyk hordern 2010 over 90 of an oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed and it is excreted mainly as the o desmethyl metabolite only 5 unchanged in urine howell et al 1993 in the present study the weak and insignificant enrichment of r venlafaxine efs mostly 0 5 observed in influent however is unlikely to be attributable to oral clearance or renal excretion because of the low excretion rate of the parent compound it is possible that ef changes also occur during transport of sewage to treatment facilities even now the pharmacological action of chloramphenicol stereoisomers in humans remains unknown except for that of the rr enantiomer mainly because chloramphenicol is rarely used in human medicine today due to its adverse effect of bone marrow suppression eliakim raz et al 2014 consequently hardly any efforts were made to research the stereoisomerism of this drug before the enantiomers began attracting interest considering that chloramphenicol is mainly used for ocular treatment in hong kong it is supposed that its stereoisomers occur in raw sewage mainly in the form of the parent compound the rr enantiomer as shown in fig 2b the mean proportions of r r chloramphenicol in influent among the 4 stps in this study were 80 indicating that microbial stereoisomerization could occur before the rr enantiomer reaches the inlets of the stps however the possibility that stereoisomeric impurities already exist in the chloramphenicol formulations should not be ruled out the efs of atenolol and venlafaxine in effluent except for venlafaxine at plant c were significantly different from those in the racemic standards p 0 05 while racemic metoprolol was generally observed except for plant a for atenolol significant changes in the efs from influent to effluent were observed at plants a and b p 0 05 demonstrating that r atenolol was more enriched in treated sewage indicating that enantioselectivity occurred during secondary treatment meanwhile for venlafaxine the changes in the efs from influent to effluent were insignificant and a racemic pattern in influent and a selective enrichment toward the r enantiomer in effluent were found at plants a and b similar results were obtained for metoprolol especially at plant a racemic metoprolol was observed in influent while the s enantiomer was more enriched in treated sewage p 0 01 in the sludge samples however enantioselective enrichment was only observed for r atenolol at plant a and r venlafaxine at plant d p 0 05 while no significant changes in the efs were found between influent and sludge or between effluent and sludge p 0 05 one trend consistently observed across the stps was the selectivity toward r atenolol s metoprolol and r venlafaxine in effluent after secondary treatment with activated sludge a preferential attenuation of s atenolol was also observed in cept treated effluent these results support the claim that r atenolol is more readily enriched during different treatment processes with a higher selectivity found in biological process whereas enantioselectivity occurs for metoprolol and venlafaxine might be attributed to stereoselective adsorption on sludge sanganyado et al 2016 and less likely due to microbial activity however the selectivity for different enantiomers of the same pharmaceutical has been observed in diverse stps in several studies suggesting the possible different enantioselectivity regarding biochemical weathering during the treatment techniques utilized kasprzyk hordern 2010 sanganyado et al 2017 the mean proportions of r r chloramphenicol were found to decrease from influent to effluent among the 4 stps with significant reductions observed at plants a and b p 0 05 along with increases in the proportions of the ss sr and rs enantiomers the mean proportions of r r chloramphenicol in sludge were even lower with significant decreases compared to those in influent observed at plants a c while compared to effluent only the proportion of r r chloramphenicol in sludge from plant a was found significantly lower p 0 05 altogether preferential elimination of r r chloramphenicol occurred from influent to effluent and sludge after biological process the higher depletion of the r r enantiomer at plant a than at plant b as well as the significant reduction of the proportion of this enantiomer at plant c but not at plant d could be attributed to the differences in the abundances of cations between freshwater and saline sewage while plants a and c treat freshwater sewage plants b and d treat saline sewage due to the practice of seawater toilet flushing in the areas served by these plants table a2 the abundance of cations in saline sewage especially bivalent cations calcium and magnesium may effectively lessen the negative surface charge of sludge leading to less hydrophilic groups at the sludge surface which may play an important role in decreasing the interactions between saline sludge and pharmaceuticals at least antibiotics li and zhang 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that enantiomeric determination of multiclass chiral pharmaceuticals has been conducted in chinese wastewater this is also the first study on the enantiomer specific occurrence of environmental contaminants in cept plants 3 6 preliminary risk assessment of chiral pharmaceuticals in effluent due to incomplete removal pharmaceuticals present in effluent may pose threats to non target organisms in receiving marine environments the risk quotients rqs of the pharmaceuticals investigated in this study were estimated by dividing the measured environmental concentrations mecs by the corresponding predicted no effect concentrations pnecs echa 2008 toxicity data were obtained from literature focusing on aquatic organisms at different trophic levels including algae invertebrates and fish to assess the worst case scenarios rqworst the maximum mecs of each compound in effluent with a dilution factor of 10 and minimum pnecs for saltwater were applied in the preliminary risk assessment fig 3 the risk classification was based on the criteria whereby rq 0 01 unlikely to pose risk 0 01 rq 0 1 low risk 0 1 rq 1 medium risk and rq 1 high risk hernando et al 2006 due to the lack of toxicological literature the enantiomeric risk assessment was conducted only for atenolol detailed toxicological information is provided in table a8 in general fish were relatively more susceptible to the studied pharmaceuticals than organisms at lower trophic levels e g algae rotifers and crustaceans the resulting rqworst ranges from 0 01 to 184 the two β blockers contribute substantially to the risks because of their ubiquitous occurrence and their more sensitive endpoints among the studied pharmaceuticals metoprolol seems to be the most harmful to aquatic organisms rqworst 100 for crustaceans mollusks and fish and contribute the most to the overall rqworst thus the occurrence of the two β blockers especially metoprolol in hong kong waters i e the western waters and victoria harbor is a cause for high concern notably venlafaxine poses a medium risk 0 1 rqworst 1 for all of the taxonomic groups considered based on the effluent concentrations emphasis should be placed on this antidepressant in future investigations because the bioaccumulation of this compound in fish has been reported recently arnnok et al 2017 huerta et al 2018 in comparison the rqworst of r r chloramphenicol was less than 0 01 by 1 4 orders of magnitude indicating that it is unlikely to pose any risk however as relevant enantioselectivity characteristics remain unknown this judgement about the risk of chloramphenicol should not be considered final enantiomeric discrimination in the ecotoxicity of atenolol has been reported previously de andrés et al 2009 enabling us to conduct a preliminary risk assessment on these enantiomers based on the reported enantioselectivity that s atenolol is more toxic to algae and crustaceans than r atenolol the obtained rqworst also reveals that s atenolol could pose a slightly higher threat from unlikely to low to these aquatic organisms however data for a more sensitive species t thermophila a freshwater ciliate demonstrate that r atenolol is much more toxic than its antipode in terms of growth inhibition de andrés et al 2009 which could indicate potential harm to certain species such as protists with a medium risk due to the excess of the r enantiomer in effluent receiving waters knowledge about the responses of aquatic species to different pharmaceutical enantiomers is very limited and the fact that enantiomeric excess could pose a higher risk to certain organisms as indicated by the present study illustrates that the enantiomer specific toxicity of chiral pharmaceuticals should be taken into account when conducting ecological risk assessment for this class of contaminant 4 conclusions four chiral pharmaceuticals from 3 therapeutic classes covering 10 different stereoisomers were analyzed at 4 stps in hong kong during a 2 year sampling campaign all of the target compounds were detectable with concentrations ranging from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter in sewage and on the order of nanograms per gram dry weight in sludge the influent masses of the studied pharmaceuticals were higher in the dry seasons biological process generally removed these compounds better than cept and disinfection treatments seemed to have little effect on pharmaceutical elimination enantioselectivity toward r atenolol s metoprolol and r venlafaxine was mostly observed in secondary treated effluent and microbial activity mainly accounted for the preferential depletion of r r chloramphenicol especially in freshwater sewage marine fish may experience risks due to atenolol and metoprolol exposure in effluent receiving waters bearing in mind that the antimicrobial activity of chloramphenicol depends strongly upon its stereoisomerism this first report on enantiomer specific chloramphenicol residues in aquatic environments emphasizes the importance of examining in depth the possible effects of different chloramphenicol enantiomers in particular the ss sr and rs enantiomers for risk evaluation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no
