5635,multiple global datasets simulated by different land surface models lsms are useful for providing information to decision makers on the water balance in different subareas of a river basin as a large basin covering a vast area the yellow river basin yrb represents a typical case to evaluate the water cycle components in lsm products the main objective of this study is to evaluate and compare multiple lsm products with respect to precipitation runoff evapotranspiration et and terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa the datasets analyzed include different global land data assimilation system gldas products era interim land datasets and augmented noah lsm products with multiple parameterization options noah mp driven by different gldas forcing datasets the evaluation is conducted with reference to gauge based precipitation datasets reconstructed natural streamflow and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived twsa several statistical metrics and the partitioning of runoff and et were emphasized the results show that the products generated diverse spatial patterns for the water cycle components the era interim land data present the best performance almost for all water cycle components the three models variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic and community land model clm driven by gldas version 1 generated different but large systematic biases and the noah model performs the best among the four models the noah simulation of gldas version 2 0 gldas 2 0 and the noah mp simulation with the princeton global forcing also have systematically large biases for runoff the different noah mp simulations perform better for runoff although overestimated than other models used in gldas but present the poorest correlations of twsa to grace derived twsa the ensemble averages of multiple products perform the best for precipitation and et than any other individual product but not for runoff keywords runoff evapotranspiration gldas noah mp terrestrial water storage anomaly yellow river basin 1 introduction land surface models lsm are powerful tools for understanding the complex water exchange and energy transfer occurring on the earth s surface dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 based on the abundant theoretical representation of physical processes involved in the water balance energy budget and carbon cycle lsms can be used to estimate variables that are difficult to monitor for large areas with detailed spatial resolutions with these lsms abundant products were generated at a global scale and are publicly available due to different theoretical assumptions parameters and forcing datasets inevitable uncertainties and differing simulation results will be generated when different models are used duan et al 2007 thus comparison and evaluation should be conducted so that users can choose the right dataset among the multiple products according to their own needs the evaluation of the different products can help readers to understand the actual water balance that occurs globally or locally and can help modelers to understand the limitation in different schemes used in their models for all lsms the partitioning of different water cycle components especially the partitioning of runoff and et is a fundamental function which should be a focus of the evaluation of lsm products the global land data assimilation system gldas was developed to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes using advanced data assimilation techniques and land surface modelling rodell et al 2004 gldas provides simulations of multiple lsms driven by several versions of forcing dataset and have been used in some studies for estimating soil moisture or evapotranspiration liu et al 2016 kim and choi 2015 li et al 2015 min et al 2016 zawadzki and kędzior 2016 bai et al 2016 evaluated gldas simulations on streamflow on the tibetan plateau and found that the noah and community land model clm generated systematic overestimations while the variable infiltration capacity vic and mosaic models generated systematic underestimations bi et al 2016 and chen et al 2013 found that the gldas simulations systematically underestimated soil moisture in some regions era interim land is a global land surface reanalysis dataset balsamo et al 2015 produced by a land surface model of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the forcings of era interim land are based on the high quality era interim reanalysis datasets and adjusted precipitation huffman et al 2009 ceglar et al 2017 found era interim land showed a good spatial performance of precipitation over monsoon aisa era interim land was widely used qiu et al 2016 zhou and wang 2017 ullah et al 2018 yang and zhang 2018 but few comparisons were made with other lsm products with regards to the multiple water cycle components the augmented noah lsm with multiple parameterization options noah mp is a widely used land surface model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 noah mp was compared with other models with respect to different water cycle components see zheng et al 2017 cai et al 2014 hu et al 2014 xia et al 2017 liang et al 2019 and generally has a good performance noah mp enables us to conduct simulations with the same gldas forcings to enrich the gldas products in addition to the existing simulations of noah vic clm and mosaic but the related test and evaluation studies are now very limited to evaluate the performance of the above lsm products the ground measurement datasets for precipitation satellite derived terrestrial water storage datasets and observed hydrological discharge data at the river outlets can be taken as the references terrestrial water transfer involves precipitation runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration et among others for a large river basin some of the variables can be observed via ground based observations or satellite based remote sensing including precipitation rate and runoff however some hydrological processes are difficult to monitor in large scale areas or over long term periods due to limited observational conditions including terrestrial water storage surface water in water bodies soil moisture content and groundwater cazenave and chen 2010 and et these processes at large temporal and spatial scales can only be roughly estimated through the water budget theory assuming no lateral flow of groundwater across different basins the water budget over a given period in a river basin can be described as the temporal change of terrestrial water storage tws is the difference of input precipitation minus evapotranspiration et and runoff by closing this water budget the et can be estimated long et al 2014 lv et al 2017 rodell et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 because precipitation and runoff can be measured and tws anomaly twsa can be roughly estimated with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites et is a component for which observational records are not available at the whole river basin scale grace satellite derived twsa provide an data source to close the water budget and estimate the et rodell et al 2011 swenson and wahr 2006 found that grace derived precipitation minus et is consistent with a reanalysis dataset but shows significant difference to the gldas noah estimation according to syed et al 2008 the twsa in gldas simulations is consistent with the grace based twsa at the global scale while yang et al 2013 found that the twsa from multiple grace products is poorly consistent with the twsa estimated by gldas in asia and africa long et al 2013 found that the grace derived twsa is more reliable than the soil moisture storage determined by gldas 1 in texas usa the uncertainties of et in different products were evaluated in many studies by using a method without knowing the true et values long et al 2014 concluded the lowest uncertainties for lsm based et moderate uncertainties in remote sensing derived et and the largest uncertainties in the grace derived et however a different conclusion was drawn by andam akorful et al 2015 nevertheless these uncertainties related studies were based on multiple product ensemble or variances without a reference to observational et values when observational datasets are available it is convenient to evaluate the different products directly and is unnecessary to consider the ensemble uncertainties since low performance product has little value to take as a reference the performances of different products may be site specific for the yellow river basin yrb in northern china several studies have analyzed the water balance or dry wet conditions based on land surface products see lv et al 2017 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 nevertheless these studies were mainly based on datasets from a single data source or single lsm and inter comparisons of more lsm products are limited the objectives of this study are to evaluate and compare the water cycle components in different lsm products for the yrb the products were evaluated include gldas 1 based outputs of four models noah vic clm mosaic gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 based outputs of the noah model the era interim land dataset noah mp simulations with the three versions of gldas forcings gldas 1 gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 here the noah mp simulations were run in this study while all other products are publicly available datasets which were presented in previous studies the evaluations were mainly carried out by comparing the area averaged time series against available reference datasets on an annual basis the spatial patterns were compared based on interannual averages multiple lsm products were compared from multiple aspects 1 performance of runoff et and twsa simulations between different models noah vic clm mosaic and noah mp driven by the same gldas 1 forcing 2 performance of simulations of the same models noah or noah mp but driven by different forcing datasets gldas 1 pgfv2 gldas 2 0 gldas 2 1 3 performances of all the different products including multiple gldas simulations multiple noah mp simulations the era interim land dataset and the ensemble averages the evaluation was conducted on a long period of 1980 2016 in order to capture an overall understanding of the products some of the datasets are only available in shorter periods thus the related comparisons were made for the common periods shared by multiple products 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river flows through an arid and semi arid region of northern china and the annual variations of river discharge are very large the water cycle in the yellow river basin yrb is very sensitive to meteorological conditions and climate change which poses a big challenge to land surface modelers in this respect the water cycle in yrb is a typical case for evaluating global land surface datasets nearly 120 million people live in the yrb and numerous large urban areas industrial areas heavily irrigated agricultural areas and oases rely on the water from the yellow river due to the increasing urban and economic development in the yrb water resources become more critical than ever nakayama 2011 zhang et al 2011 thus grasping the quantities of runoff and et in the yrb will aid in making appropriate social and economic plans yang et al 2012 it is widely believed that the yrb has endured a drying process over the last half century liu and yang 2010 wang et al 2010 and excessive extraction of groundwater has significantly decreased the groundwater level according to the annual bulletin of yellow river water resources http www yellowriver gov cn gao et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 gldas data two versions of the gldas are available for modeling land surfaces gldas version 1 gldas 1 and gldas version 2 the data sources for constructing gldas 1 forcing datasets have been changed several times from 1979 to present wang et al 2016 gldas 1 forcing was used to drive four lsms noah ek et al 2003 the community land model clm lawrence et al 2011 the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 and mosaic koster and suarez 1992 in this paper the different products simulated by these four lsms are represented as noah gl1 clm gl1 vic gl1 and mos gl1 respectively these products are at a 1 degree resolution gldas version 2 has two components gldas 2 0 which is forced entirely by princeton meteorological forcing data and gldas 2 1 which is forced by a combination of model and observation based forcing gldas 2 0 simulations were generated by the noah model at two resolutions 1 and 0 25 for consistency with other abbreviations we use noah gl2 0 and noah gl2 1 to represent the gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 based simulations respectively in this study multiple products from gldas version 1 2 0 and 2 1 were downloaded online and details on these products are presented in table 1 2 2 2 era interim land data the era interim land dataset balsamo et al 2015 is the output from the tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel lsm van den hurk et al 2000 which is driven by the meteorological forcing from era interim reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on global precipitation climatology project gpcp v2 1 huffman et al 2009 era interim land data are more accurate for the water balance than the original era interim reanalysis data balsamo et al 2015 the era interim land dataset has the same grid as that of the era interim reanalysis in this study the era interim land datasets integrated at the daily scale for the period 1980 2010 were collected table 1 2 2 3 precipitation dataset from ground based observations the china ground based precipitation cgp monthly gridded 0 5 x0 5 dataset was produced by the china national meteorological information center china meteorological administration zhao et al 2014 zhao and zhu 2015 the cgp is purely the output of an interpolation based on ground precipitation observations at 2472 meteorological stations in china the interpolation was conducted based on a digital elevation model and the thin plate spline method hutchinson 1998b hutchinson 1998a this dataset is available for the period 1980 2015 table 1 and was used to represent observations to evaluate precipitation based on the lsm simulations 2 2 4 remotely sensed precipitation dataset the climate prediction center morphing global precipitation analysis cmorph dataset joyce et al 2004 and the tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis system near real time dataset trmm rt huffman et al 2007 were collected the cmorph product is derived by an algorithm which propagates the precipitation estimates from multiple passive sensors according to motion vectors the final datasets are publicly available on the website https rda ucar edu datasets ds502 0 the trmm satellite based product in code 3b42rt was used in this study the overall system for producing this product is referred to as the real time trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rt and is in version 7 both the cmorph and trmm rt in three hourly and 0 25 x0 25 version were downloaded and were used to compare the spatial patterns of precipitation to that in the lsm products 2 2 5 grace satellite based twsa twsa from the grace dataset for a global mascon solution luthcke et al 2013 was obtained in this study this dataset was downloaded as a time series represented in a text based format with separate dates generally these data have one set of global record values in each month in some specific months no record exists to compare with other products we have interpolated the global cover records for each date to a 1 1 grid using the nearest neighbor method and the resulting gridded data were stored as files on specific dates other than on a monthly basis the minimum area size that can use grace to estimate water mass was believed to be approximately 200 000 km2 rodell et al 2007 and this threshold is smaller than the area of the yrb at 752 000 km2 2 2 6 modis based evapotranspiration data an 8 day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis global terrestrial et product version 6 mod16a2 mu et al 2007 was used the dataset was resampled into a longitude latitudinal grid with a resolution of 0 025 this product was estimated based on an energy balance model which considers the surface water and energy flux thus the mod16a2 is different from a common remote sensing product which is estimated more directly in this respect the product cannot be used as an accurate observational data for evaluating lsm products 2 2 7 monthly dataset of the natural river discharge for the yellow river the annual dataset of natural river discharge reconstructed by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources nrd yrcc was obtained here the annual series for lijin station was used lijin station is the closest station to the estuary of the yellow river fig 1 the annual discharge at lijin station can be regarded as an estimation of annual total runoff for the entire yrb details about this dataset can also be found in table 1 2 2 8 princeton global meteorological forcing data princeton global meteorological forcing data version 2 pgfv2 sheffield et al 2006 was used to drive the land surface model noah mp this dataset was produced by terrestrial hydrology research group princeton university the dataset was stored with a 3 hourly step in a 0 5 x0 5 grid and covers the period of 1948 2012 the subset obtained for this study covers the period of 1980 2012 2 3 noah mp model and simulations as a widely used lsm noah mp was packed into the community weather research and forecasting model hydro wrf hydro arnault et al 2016 senatore et al 2015 modelling system which is maintained by the national center for atmospheric research ncar noah mp is also the core of the national water model noaa 2016 which was developed for the prediction of river flows in the usa noah mp has been widely validated and enhanced zheng and yang 2016 cai et al 2016 gao et al 2015 pilotto et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 in this study the noah mp land surface model was used to perform simulations for the yrb with multiple forcing datasets for common users conducting simulations based on default options table 2 for physical schemes is convenient therefore only the default options were used in this study the gridded domain fig 1 a used for simulation includes 350 columns and 170 rows which is in lambert conformal conic projection coordinates and generally cover the whole yrb see fig 1 a with a resolution of 6 km the domain centers at 107 2574 e and 37 21718 n the geophysical information for the domain such as the digital elevation land use and land cover and green vegetable fraction was extracted from the wrf3 5 database multiple forcing datasets for driving noah mp include the pgfv2 gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 gldas 2 0 forcing was not used because this dataset is generally equivalent to pgfv2 for simplicity in the following paragraphs the abbreviations for the simulated products of noah mp driven by the three forcing datasets are represented as nmp pgfv2 nmp gl1 and nmp gl2 1 all meteorological data used as forcing datasets were extracted for the domain by transforming the coordinates into the selected lambert conformal conic projection and resampling by bilinear interpolation all simulations were run on 3 hourly steps 2 4 preprocessing the products 2 4 1 data preprocessing the gldas 1 gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 datasets noah mp simulations era interim land reanalysis data mod16 product and gridded grace datasets underwent similar processing first the data in the yrb were extracted and interpolated into the same spatial domain of the noah mp simulations second the precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and twsa in the yrb were averaged along the time axis to investigate the spatial distributions of these variables and third the 3 hourly or daily values were averaged across the yrb area and the time axis into monthly and annually time series 2 4 2 reconstruct et based observational dataset to evaluate the et in multiple products a et series can be reconstructed based on the observational precipitation and annual river discharge the water budget model in a period can be written as 1 p e t r δ s δ t here p et and r represent precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff discharge δs δt represents the change of twsa in a certain period δt in a long term period δs δt tends to zero and the formula became 2 et p r thus although et has no observational dataset it can be estimated from observed precipitation and runoff using eq 2 in this study an annual et series was reconstructed by calculating the difference of the cgp precipitation minus the nrd yrcc this calculation implies that the annual δs were treated as zeros theoretically the δs can be represented by twsa grace anomalies thus by subtracting δs from the reconstructed et δs δt et can be isolated from the twsa however the twsa grace data is unavailable for the period 1980 2001 since the grace satellite was launched in 2002 2 4 3 extraction of simulated twsa in lsm products all the lsms neglected the simulation of underground water but the multiple layer soil water content was generated which can act as a dynamic state of twsa the presumptions of soil layers in different products are different although the total soil thickness in all products is at least 2 m to calculate the twsa in different products in this study the snow water equivalent canopy water storage cws and all water content in the top layers with a total thickness equal to or less than 2 m were summarized as the twsa cws data are not available in era interim land nevertheless according to our analysis cws constitutes a very small proportion of the twsa in these multiple lsm datasets and it does not have a significant influence on the multi product comparisons 2 5 evaluation metrics to evaluate the time series from different products with reference to the observational dataset pearson s correlation coefficient cc nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse were used it is notable that nse ranges from to 1 and a good solution should have a nse value close to 1 to detect decreasing trends in the twsa a mann kendall test kendall 1955 mann 1945 was also used to evaluate overestimations underestimations of the simulated precipitation or runoff compared with the observed values relative bias rb was also calculated as follows 3 rb y 1 m s y y 1 m o y y 1 m o y where sy represents the simulated annual variables such as precipitation or runoff for the yth year oy is the observed equivalent at the yth year and m is the total number of years considered a product has a higher performance than other products should has higher cc and nse but lower rb and rmse to the observational dataset 2 6 uncertainty the standard deviation of the difference from a modeled variable to an observational variable is used to quantify the uncertainty of the modeled variable here the modeled variables include the variables precipitation runoff and et estimated by lsms remote sensing based algorithms and the ensemble of multiple products while the observational variables represent those estimated from ground based observation which is believed to be more reliable than other modeled variables in this study only the cgp nrd yrcc and the et reconstructed from cgp and nrd yrcc were regarded as observational variables the ensemble averages of multiple products can be obtained through two methods the first method uses the simple arithmetic average on the ensemble members the second method is a weighted ensemble average andam akorful et al 2015 of n ensemble members 4 e t i 1 n w i u i t where ui t is the variable value of the ith ensemble member wi is the weight calculated by the uncertainties w i 1 δ i 2 i 1 n 1 δ i 2 here δi is the uncertainty of the ith ensemble member 3 results 3 1 precipitation forcing the annual precipitation from multi source datasets showed that the spatial patterns in the gldas datasets and era interim land are very similar but different from that of cgp cmorph and trmm fig 2 when the precipitation across the yrb were averaged and analyzed for annual variations obvious uncertainties were observed between the different products fig 3 a and they were comparatively large before 1996 and decreased after 1996 the standard deviations across the multiple products were 37 mm during the period 1980 1996 and 26 5 mm during the period 1997 2012 precipitation in gldas 1 was consistent with the other datasets for most years although an abnormal extremely small value occurred in 1996 and an extremely large value occurred in 2000 the anomaly in 1996 has been reported by zhou et al 2013 the anomaly in 2000 can be attributed to the special data source used for this year wang et al 2016 in order to avoid the influence of these extreme gldas 1 precipitation values on the evaluation metrics the values in 1996 and 2000 were discarded and then were interpolated by referencing to the values in era interim land for the year 1996 2000 the interpolation was done by adding a six year mean difference calculated by subtracting the gldas 1 values from the era interim land values to the era interim land values of the year 1996 2000 the interpolated series can be found in fig 3 b the interpolation can be represented as 5 v g l 1 1996 v el 1996 1 6 y 1993 y 1996 1999 v gl y v el y v g l 1 2000 v el 2000 1 6 y 1997 y 2000 2003 v gl y v el y where v gl1 year represents the variable values precipitation or runoff in gldas 1in that year and v el1 year represents those variable values in era interim land the precipitation in pgfv2 and gldas 2 0 were generally consistent with each other consistent with the fact that gldas 2 0 is generated from pgfv2 although the two datasets have likely undergone a different resampling process over most of the years precipitation in the era interim land reanalysis have the largest values while that of the pgfv2 gldas 2 0 datasets showed the smallest the annual precipitation series were evaluated against cgp table 3 when 1996 and 2000 were excluded gldas 1 was also consistent with cgp after 2002 both gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 become more consistent with cgp over most years pgfv2 underestimated precipitation while era interim land showed a slight overestimation moreover pgfv2 only overestimated precipitation in 1996 and 2000 when these two years were excluded an underestimation is significant in pgfv2 the overestimation of era interim land was 26 mm from 1980 to 2010 although an underestimation occurred in 2010 all the three versions 1 2 0 2 1 of gldas underestimated precipitation but gldas 1 has very small bias to cgp during 2000 2010 over the long period of 1980 2010 era interim land can be regarded as the best dataset for precipitation but for the later years 2000 2010 gldas 1 becomes the best when cgp are taken as the true values the uncertainties of annual precipitation in pgfv2 gldas 2 gldas 1 gldas 2 1 and era interim land are 22 2 mm 28 1 mm 24 2 mm 16 7 mm respectively the uncertainty of the weighted ensemble average over pgfv2 era interim land and gldas 1 is estimated as 14 mm 3 2 runoff 3 2 1 spatial patterns to investigate the spatial pattern of runoff in different products and remove the influence of different precipitation forcings runoff coefficients were calculated instead of using runoff directly runoff coefficient is defined as the ratio of the total runoff to the related total precipitation during a given period in fact the spatial pattern of runoff coefficients is close to the pattern of runoff because a large amount of precipitation can result in considerable runoff due to the allocation of water on the land surface whereas when the precipitation amount is very low most of the water will evaporate limited observations on the spatial pattern of runoff are available therefore only the spatial patterns between different products were compared in this study the spatial patterns of runoff coefficients during the period from 1980 to 2000 showed different patterns the cc of the spatial runoff between each pair of the multiple products range from 0 6 to 0 8 not displayed in any figures or tables the spatial patterns produced by different products were shown in fig 4 in the gldas 1 products vic and mosaic give comparatively small runoff coefficients nmp pgfv2 and noah gl2 0 at two different resolutions 0 25 and 1 0 were generally based on the same dataset but the runoff coefficients show different spatial patterns between the two products the two resolutions 0 25 and 1 of gldas 2 0 show similar spatial patterns but different details noah gl1 and noah gl2 0 are the simulations of the same model with different forcings and show different spatial patterns of the runoff coefficients 3 2 2 annual time series due to the abnormal extreme values of gldas 1 precipitation in 1996 and 2000 all the gldas 1 based runoff series also show similar extremes in order to calculate the evaluation indices the runoff values in 1996 and 2000 were also discarded and interpolated using equation 5 here the interpolation was done for all the gldas 1 based products simulated by noah vic mosaic clm and noah mp as a statistical indicator of interannual variability the standard deviation of the annual runoff averaged over the yrb in the multiple products is in the range 20 mm 50 mm with mean 31 mm this variability can match that of precipitation in the multiple products it shows that the runoff of era interim land reanalysis matches nrd yrcc the best by visual inspection fig 5 a according to the rmse between annual runoff and nrd yrcc during 1980 2010 the performance from the best to the worst is as follows table 4 era interim land noah gl1 noah gl2 0 nmp gl1 nmp pgfv2 mos gl1 vic gl1 and clm gl1 similar order holds for the period 2000 2010 except that the gldas 2 1 products become available and are slightly better than the gldas 2 0 products for both the noah and noah mp simulations among the products of gldas 1 forcing vic and mosaic produced very small runoff values while clm produced very large runoff values noah produced generally comparable runoff values to nrd yrcc before 1995 but the runoff values decreased gradually after 2002 and became underestimated in gldas 1 based products noah mp overestimated runoff and the increasing order of runoff is as follows vic mosaic noah noah mp and clm these results show that different models produce very different runoff according to the rmse noah mp performed the best among all the four models driven by the gldas 1 forcing but also generated a systematic bias in gldas 2 0 products noah gl2 0 underestimated runoff while nmp pgfv2 overestimated that for noah mp the simulations nmp pgfv2 nmp gl1 and nmp gl2 1 were consistent with each other especially after 2000 before 2002 the simulated runoff is different between nmp gl1 and nmp pgfv2 although this difference was smaller than the variability between other products in most years before 1996 the runoff of nmp pgfv2 was smaller than that of nmp gl1 which maybe also related to the smaller annual precipitation forcing in pgfv2 than in gldas 1 in the period after 2005 the noah simulations based on the three gldas forcings were very close to each other all the above findings illustrate that the runoff overestimations in noah mp simulations can be attributed to the systematic bias caused by the model and the differences in forcings have a comparatively small influence ccs and nse were also calculated for the annual runoff in multiple products and nrd yrcc table 4 the relative biases from the simulated runoff to nrd yrcc were also calculated using eq 3 the runoff in era interim land reanalysis showed the smallest rmse and rb the largest cc and nse both noah gl1 and noah gl2 0 runoff showed performances comparable to or better than that simulated by noah mp generally all runoff simulations of noah mp are better than those of mosaic clm and vic according to rmse rb and nse although noah mp obtained a smaller cc than clm 3 3 terrestrial water storage twsa was extracted from vic gl1 and noah gl1 noah gl2 0 1 0 and 0 25 nmp pgfv2 noah gl2 1 and era interim land among these products the spatial patterns of the long term averaged twsa across the yrb are different fig 6 generally noah gl2 0 shows similar patterns at two different resolutions 1 0 and 0 25 although the values are very different from those in noah gl1 very similar patterns were simulated in nmp pgfv2 and nmp gl1 twsa grace is used here as an observational data to assess the land surface products with respect to twsa the twsa grace dataset is available during the period of 2003 2015 there is at most one value available for each month and no value exists in some specific months to compare with twsa grace for each date with a grace record available the twsa in the lsm products corresponding to that date were sampled out instead of calculating monthly averages the twsa in all land surface products and twsa grace can reflect seasonal or interannual variations fig 7 mann kendall tests were used to test the long term trends of all annual averaged twsa series twsa grace showed a decreasing trend at a significance level of 0 001 but the twsa in the lsm products did not pass the significance test at 0 05 similarly no significant trend was found in cgp the trend of twsa grace was estimated to decrease by 3 6 mm a and the period of 2013 2015 shows the greatest decreasing according to cgp the year 2002 is a historical drought year which can explain that the very low twsa in the beginning of 2003 increased to a high value after that summer all modeled twsa also reflected such a phenomenon however the very low twsa grace values in 2014 and 2015 were not reflected by most of the modeled products and only noah gl2 1 presented exceptional values the ccs between the lsm derived twsa and grace twsa were calculated for the common period 2003 2010 in all the products as well as the arithmetic ensemble average the descendent order of ccs is as follows era interim land cc 0 85 noah gl2 1 cc 0 76 the ensemble average cc 0 74 clm gl1 cc 0 73 noah gl1 cc 0 72 noah gl2 0 cc 0 67 vic gl1 cc 0 66 mos gl1 cc 0 65 nmp gl2 0 pgf cc 0 53 nmp gl2 1 cc 0 44 and nmp gl1 cc 0 36 among the different lsms noah and clm produced better correlations with twsa grace than the other models which is similar to that obtained by long et al 2014 noah mp produced very small r values to twsa grace because noah mp failed to reproduce the amplitude of seasonal variability and the simulated twsa peaks and valleys usually lead one month ahead of those in twsa grace the standard deviation of long term twsa variations were estimated based on the above mentioned samples from 2003 to 2010 compared with the standard deviation of twsa grace 28 0 mm clm gl1 8 1 mm noah gl1 22 7 mm mos gl1 22 4 mm vic gl1 20 4 mm and era interim land 22 2 mm underestimated while noah gl2 0 39 5 mm noah gl2 1 34 84 mm nmp gl2 1 36 0 mm nmp pgfv2 32 mm and nmp gl1 34 78 mm overestimated the underestimation of tws variations in noah gl1 and vic gl1 are similar to that found in a study of the tibetan plateau bi et al 2016 the twsa extracted from all products reflects the seasonal fluctuations of twsa grace for example an extreme case is that the increase in twsa from a very low value in 2003 was simulated well by all land surface products however twsa grace shows a significant decreasing trend at a rate of 3 6 mm a in 2003 2015 which is not reflected by any other land surface products in particular from 2010 to 2015 twsa grace has a significant decreasing trend which was reflected by the twsa of noah gl2 1 meanwhile the twsa simulated by all noah simulations and vic gl1 also displayed a decreasing trend based on the same forcings the noah mp simulation shows no decline of twsa indicating that this decline is not likely caused by the trend in forcing dataset 3 4 evapotranspiration the spatial et patterns of other products were not displayed because they have the similar pattern of era interim land according to fig 8 the spatial patterns of et from all products except mod16 were generally consistent with each other here the spatial et pattern of mod16 shows more details than that in other products since mod16 has a very high resolution but this resolution inconsistency cannot conceal the main difference of spatial patterns the gldas 1 et series have two extreme small values in 1996 and 1997 which are highly different to that in other products in 1996 the extreme et is corresponding to the erroneous precipitation but this is unlikely a fact in 1997 although low precipitation in 1997 exists in all the products the extreme small value in 1997 may be related to the other variables which affect the estimation of et for the year 2000 the et values are generally normal which is reasonable because the extreme high precipitation in that year can lead to extreme runoff instead of an abnormally high et in any lsm models before calculating the evaluation indices the abnormal et values in 1996 1997 were discarded and interpolated using a modified eq 5 fig 9 b instead of the six year mean difference the five year 1993 1994 1995 1998 1999 mean difference were used here the standard deviations of the annual average et over the yrb are 24 mm 89 mm with the mean of 45 mm and these deviations are larger than that of precipitation and runoff indicating that the lsms led to larger variability than the original precipitation forcing datasets the seasonal variations show that the difference of et between mod16 and other lsm based products mainly occurred in summer as shown by the case of 2001 fig 10 a and similar effects were also found in other years the difference is not very large except for that in mod16 which estimated larger et during winter but smaller values during summer to investigate the simulated long term change the averages of et were presented in table 5 for all products based on gldas 1 forcing the descending order of et values is vic mosaic noah noah mp and clm which is generally consistent with the reversed order of runoff the noah mp output has larger et and smaller runoff than the clm output for noah and noah mp et driven by the gldas 2 0 forcing is smaller than that driven by the gldas 1 forcing mod16 et showed an exceptional increasing trend that passes the mann kendall test at the 0 05 significance level from 2001 to 2016 no such significant increasing was found in the multiple lsm products another phenomenon is that the mod16 et has different interannual variations when compared with other products it is difficult to accurately evaluate et due to some facts no observational tws dataset is available and the tws estimated by grace do not cover the period 1980 2002 meanwhile grace tws itself has large uncertainty long et al 2014 in this study the et estimated based on water balance was used as a baseline to evaluate the et in lsms eqs 1 and 2 were both used annual tws changes δs δt are needed in eq 1 thus the tws estimated from era interim land was used as a substitute considering that era interim land shows the highest performance on twsa the et in lsm products were evaluated against these two water balance et estimations in following text e1 and e2 are used to represent the reconstructed et through eqs 1 and 2 respectively when e1 is used as a baseline instead of e2 no significant improvement of performance was obtained for most of the products according to different metrics table 5 comparatively nmp gl1 performs the best and era interim land performs second according to ccs and nses nmp gl1 has better correlation but larger rmse and bias than era interim land the two ensemble averages obtain larger correlations and nses smaller rmse and biases than all other single product which shows the good performance of ensembles generally the et uncertainties were reduced by evaluating against e1 the uncertainties of et ranges from 28 mm to 40 mm and are generally close to each other in different products the smallest one was obtained by nmp gl1 28 04 mm the second and the third were obtained by nmp pgfv2 28 13 mm and clm gl1 31 32 mm respectively 3 5 partitioning of runoff and et in water balance partitioning of runoff and et is an aspect to compare different lsm simulations zheng et al 2019 when the annual runoff against et in each year is plotted in a point then the runoff et relationship in multiple years forms a group of scatter points fig 11 a in this way the relationship among runoff et and precipitation in different products can be clearly visualized according to eq 2 if the annual precipitation is set to a fixed value then the runoff et relationship can be represented by a declining straight line for the yrb the fixed reference precipitation value was set to 492 mm fig 11 a which is the mean annual precipitation estimated from the era interim land reanalysis dataset the points in the upper right side of the line of 492 mm indicates that the related precipitation is larger than the mean annual precipitation here note that the reconstructed et includes et and δs thus this et error caused by annual δs should have slight influence on the location of each runoff et point but do not change the area occupied by the group of points which represent the runoff et relationship of different years because the multiple year averaged δs tends to zero most of the points related to nmp pgfv2 and noah gl2 0 lie on the left downward side of the line of 492 mm indicating that the precipitation was underestimated by pgfv2 the ratio r ra ea reflects the partition of runoff and et from precipitation and here ra is the annual runoff mm and ea is the annual et mm when r is known the runoff coefficient can be estimated as r 1 r in fig 11 a the points of the era interim land reanalysis and observations reconstructed are mixed together except that the latter shows smaller annual precipitation values the averaged ratios r of these two datasets are close to each other 0 13 and 0 137 for era interim land and the reconstructed data respectively thus the runoff coefficients for the era interim land reanalysis and observations reconstructed can be estimated as 0 115 and 0 12 respectively indicating the era interim land reanalysis can reflect the actual runoff et partition very well theoretically r values should be influenced by many factors and the annual total precipitation is one important factor here based on the case of the era interim land the relation between r values and total annual precipitation p unit mm were linearly regressed as r 0 0003 p 0 0121 with the determination coefficient of 0 486 compared to the ratios r obtained from these two products nmp pgfv2 and nmp gl1 overestimated the ratios and the averages were 0 232 and 0 22 respectively the nmp gl2 1 obtained significantly better runoff et ratios than the nmp gl1 and nmp pgfv2 the gldas 1 simulated by mosaic vic and noah underestimated the ratios with averages of 0 043 0 036 and 0 108 respectively the clm overestimated the ratio with an average of 0 287 gldas 2 0 noah also slightly underestimated the ratio with an average of 0 078 thus providing the second closest ratios to the reconstructed values 4 discussion 4 1 spatial patterns similar spatial patterns of interannual mean precipitation were obtained in the multiple forcing datasets of different versions of gldas and era interim land although differences were observed in the spatial patterns of ground measured and remote sensing derived precipitation however based on these precipitation forcings the spatial patterns of the simulated runoff and twsa by different lsms are more diverse than the precipitation patterns meanwhile the spatial patterns of runoff and twsa produced by the same model noah or noah mp with different forcings show small differences which indicates the different lsms can produce large uncertainties in the spatial patterns therefore cautions should be taken when using the runoff and twsa simulated by each single lsm to the hydrological application in the subbasin of the yrb 4 2 performances of different products on the water cycle 4 2 1 precipitation annual precipitation is more diverse between different forcing datasets in the early years than after 2002 fig 3 after 2002 both gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 are accurate relative to the ground based precipitation the cgp although the annual precipitation in era interim land are more accurate than that in other products before 2004 its accuracy after 2004 is improved little and is not superior to that in gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 pgfv2 gldas 2 has a large underestimation of precipitation all precipitation in different products can reproduce the interannual variations and the decreasing trend in 1980 2002 except that the gldas 1 has significant error in 1996 and 2000 this result is meaningful when the precipitation of each dataset is used to analyze and interpret climate change impacts in the yrb 4 2 2 runoff and et for runoff comparisons can be made between different products of the same gldas 1 forcing but different models noah vic mosaic clm and noah mp bai et al 2016 evaluated the streamflow simulated from the four model gldas 1 products for the tibetan plateau and found systematic overestimations were obtained by noah and clm and systematic underestimations were obtained by vic and mosaic similarly in this study for the yrb vic and mosaic systematically underestimated runoff and clm overestimated runoff however noah produced runoff values equivalent to the reconstructed natural discharge with larger interannual variations before 2001 but generated increasingly underestimated values thereafter all the noah mp simulations show obvious overestimations from 1980 to 2015 a significant decreasing runoff trend in noah gl1 and an underestimation of runoff in noah gl2 0 noah were observed from 1980 to 2015 considering that the annual precipitation forcing in gldas 2 0 is less than that in gldas 1 noah gl2 0 further underestimated runoff this conclusion is different from wang et al 2016 who reported that gldas 1 and gldas 2 0 showed small runoff overestimations wang et al 2016 also found that gldas 2 0 runoff values were more accurate than gldas 1 runoff values although contrasting results were obtained in the present study table 2 this inconsistency probably is due to that the discharge data used by wang et al 2016 is different from nrd yrcc the contrasts of et between different lsm products were found contrary to that of runoff therefore the ratio of annual runoff to annual et is a useful index to evaluate the partitioning of runoff and et in different lsm products 4 3 long term trend in tws the continuing decrease of tws is possibly related to the excessive extraction of groundwater in the yrb there is no consideration of groundwater changes in the lsm models it is difficult to verify the above mentioned decreasing rate due to the lack of in situ tws data however the decreasing rate of the twsa grace at 3 6 mm a is much larger than the increasing water consumption 0 78 mm a in the yrb gao et al 2016 such a large decreasing rate is likely affected by the grace estimation of the adjacent river basins the haihe and the huaihe which also underwent severe groundwater extraction meanwhile during the period 2003 2015 the massive coal mining activity in the yrb certainly contributes much to the decreasing of gravity which maybe another explanation for the overestimated mass loss as observed by grace but no studies have quantified this influence among all the gldas based simulations noah performed the best while noah mp performed the worst here it should be noted that the noah mp simulation was run under the default combination of physical scheme options the performance of noah mp under other different combinations of physical scheme options can be evaluated in additional studies the noah gl1 and vic gl1 show decreasing of tws during 2010 2015 but with the same forcings none of three noah mp simulations show such decrease the low twsa grace values in 2015 and 2016 appear to be reflected by noah gl2 1 and these results are likely inaccurate because underground water is not considered by noah gl2 1 due to these inconsistence whether the simulated decreasing trends imply some simulation error or reflect the real climate change is unknown which makes it difficult to quantify the over depletion of ground water in yrb when taking the twsa in these products as references 4 4 uncertainty comparatively the uncertainty of runoff is smaller than that of precipitation forcing compare them in figs 3 and 5 the runoff uncertainty theoretically comes from two sources precipitation forcing and lsms it is inferable that the uncertainty in precipitation forcing can contribute a part in runoff uncertainty and the rest of the precipitation uncertainties canpropagate to other components et and territorial water storage nasonova et al 2011 nevertheless the relative biases of runoff except that for era interim land are actually far larger than that in precipitation forcings according to these different biases in different lsms most of the runoff uncertainties should come from the lsms the uncertainties of et in different products generally lie in a narrow range 28 mm 40 mm for era interim land and nmp gl1 the et uncertainty is smaller than the sum of precipitation uncertainty and runoff uncertainty but this does not hold true for other products the uncertainties obtained by era interim land and the ensemble averages are close to the direct estimation in lv et al 2017 but are far larger than the uncertainty of the reconstructed et by lv et al 2017 which considered irrigation and water diversion since et observations are not available in the whole yrb it is difficult to determine whether the et in mod16 are worse than those of other lsms nevertheless the accurate results for runoff runoff et partitioning and twsa simulated in era interim land indicate that et was likely well simulated by the era interim land dataset accordingly the seasonal and interannual variations simulated by mod16 should be worse than those of other land surface products this inference is consistent with the conclusion that the et values from lsms have lower uncertainties than those derived from modis as indicated by long et al 2014 and baik et al 2018 but is different from the conclusion of andam akorful et al 2015 which supported that mod16 has smaller uncertainty than that estimated by lsms over the volta basin west africa 4 5 performance of multiple products ensemble ensemble average of multiple products can be used as a baseline to evaluate individual modeled product when the true states such as et or runoff are unknown andam akorful et al 2015 however the reliability of such evaluations is unknown since the ensemble average is not equivalent to the observation in this study the different ensemble averages almost obtained the best performance with precipitation runoff and et when compared with any individual product except era interim land for precipitation and et the two ensemble averages perform better than era interim land but this is not true for runoff for tws anomalies the arithmetic ensemble mean of the 11 products has a smaller cc to grace tws than that obtained by era interim land and noah gl2 1 of course the observational data the cgp natural river discharge and grace tws which is used as the baseline also has unknown uncertainties nevertheless era interim land agrees best to the observational data in the three water cycle components but the ensemble averages do not indicating that era interim land and the observational data are possibly more reliable than the ensemble averages the ensemble averages may perform inferior to the best product but generally performs better than most individual products in this respect when the true states are unknown the ensemble average of multiple products can be used as a baseline to evaluate most of the individual ensemble member 5 conclusion and remarks the motivation of this study is to compare and evaluate the multiple lsm products on the water cycle components in the yrb the publicly available gldas products noah mp simulations driven by different versions of gldas forcing datasets era interim land and the ensemble average of multiple products were evaluated against the data derived from ground measurement based precipitation natural river discharge and grace derived tws changes focusing on annual variations the comparisons were made in multiple aspects except for era interim land all other products had large systematic biases on the partitioning of runoff and et for all the gldas 1 based simulations noah mp performs the best while noah performs the second according to the biases and correlations clm produced extremely high runoff et ratios while vic and mosaic produced very low ratios clm simulation provides good ccs but large biases to the observed runoff and twsa variations vic and mosaic simulations are very similar for all the water cycle components among all the lsms noah mp performed the worst on the tws anomaly all these comparisons demonstrate that model changes are possibly required to improve the partitioning of runoff and et in the yrb era interim land has very small bias observed and performs the best in three water budget components precipitation runoff and twsa era interim land perhaps has greatly reduced the annual uncertainties and can be used as a benchmark to evaluate other products for the yrb however this conclusion may not apply to other regions for example orth and seneviratne 2015 found that era interim land has no better capability than gldas 2 0 with regard to runoff and et in europe the ensemble average of all the lsm products does perform better than any single product and the weighted ensemble average is also better than the arithmetic ensemble average in theory the observation based water budget components have uncertainties due to measuring error limited gauges and inaccurate estimation therefore the true states of the water budget components and terrestrial water transfers are unknown combining multiple observational data with lsm simulations is helpful to better understand the real water cycle in a river basin for example it is difficult to measure the high resolution spatial distribution of runoff or et because only the total river discharge can be measured while the model based estimation can cover this shortage as for the lsm products with large biases we can obtain more reliable datasets through further bias correction in summary this paper provides an overview of the performance of different lsm models and comparisons between the different products for water budget closure in the yrb however some questions need to investigate in further research 1 why era interim land performs better than other lsm products in multiple water cycle components with regards to the percentage biases correlations and rmse and which is the main factor between the htessel lsm or the driving forcing dataset to answer this question the noah and noah mp simulation based on the same forcing data of era interim land should be conducted and other different meteorological variables wind pressure air humidity solar radiation in forcing datasets should be compared 2 although the era interim land product display a water budget coincide with the multiple observational datasets whether this product can reflect the local subbasin water budget is still unknown for example in some tributary river basins 3 due to the limited resolution of lsm products the small scale variability of the water cycle components cannot be well reflected for example in different orographic areas for hydrological applications in the yrb to model such local variability the variables should be downscaled further by considering orographic influence credit authorship contribution

5635,multiple global datasets simulated by different land surface models lsms are useful for providing information to decision makers on the water balance in different subareas of a river basin as a large basin covering a vast area the yellow river basin yrb represents a typical case to evaluate the water cycle components in lsm products the main objective of this study is to evaluate and compare multiple lsm products with respect to precipitation runoff evapotranspiration et and terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa the datasets analyzed include different global land data assimilation system gldas products era interim land datasets and augmented noah lsm products with multiple parameterization options noah mp driven by different gldas forcing datasets the evaluation is conducted with reference to gauge based precipitation datasets reconstructed natural streamflow and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived twsa several statistical metrics and the partitioning of runoff and et were emphasized the results show that the products generated diverse spatial patterns for the water cycle components the era interim land data present the best performance almost for all water cycle components the three models variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic and community land model clm driven by gldas version 1 generated different but large systematic biases and the noah model performs the best among the four models the noah simulation of gldas version 2 0 gldas 2 0 and the noah mp simulation with the princeton global forcing also have systematically large biases for runoff the different noah mp simulations perform better for runoff although overestimated than other models used in gldas but present the poorest correlations of twsa to grace derived twsa the ensemble averages of multiple products perform the best for precipitation and et than any other individual product but not for runoff keywords runoff evapotranspiration gldas noah mp terrestrial water storage anomaly yellow river basin 1 introduction land surface models lsm are powerful tools for understanding the complex water exchange and energy transfer occurring on the earth s surface dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 based on the abundant theoretical representation of physical processes involved in the water balance energy budget and carbon cycle lsms can be used to estimate variables that are difficult to monitor for large areas with detailed spatial resolutions with these lsms abundant products were generated at a global scale and are publicly available due to different theoretical assumptions parameters and forcing datasets inevitable uncertainties and differing simulation results will be generated when different models are used duan et al 2007 thus comparison and evaluation should be conducted so that users can choose the right dataset among the multiple products according to their own needs the evaluation of the different products can help readers to understand the actual water balance that occurs globally or locally and can help modelers to understand the limitation in different schemes used in their models for all lsms the partitioning of different water cycle components especially the partitioning of runoff and et is a fundamental function which should be a focus of the evaluation of lsm products the global land data assimilation system gldas was developed to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes using advanced data assimilation techniques and land surface modelling rodell et al 2004 gldas provides simulations of multiple lsms driven by several versions of forcing dataset and have been used in some studies for estimating soil moisture or evapotranspiration liu et al 2016 kim and choi 2015 li et al 2015 min et al 2016 zawadzki and kędzior 2016 bai et al 2016 evaluated gldas simulations on streamflow on the tibetan plateau and found that the noah and community land model clm generated systematic overestimations while the variable infiltration capacity vic and mosaic models generated systematic underestimations bi et al 2016 and chen et al 2013 found that the gldas simulations systematically underestimated soil moisture in some regions era interim land is a global land surface reanalysis dataset balsamo et al 2015 produced by a land surface model of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the forcings of era interim land are based on the high quality era interim reanalysis datasets and adjusted precipitation huffman et al 2009 ceglar et al 2017 found era interim land showed a good spatial performance of precipitation over monsoon aisa era interim land was widely used qiu et al 2016 zhou and wang 2017 ullah et al 2018 yang and zhang 2018 but few comparisons were made with other lsm products with regards to the multiple water cycle components the augmented noah lsm with multiple parameterization options noah mp is a widely used land surface model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 noah mp was compared with other models with respect to different water cycle components see zheng et al 2017 cai et al 2014 hu et al 2014 xia et al 2017 liang et al 2019 and generally has a good performance noah mp enables us to conduct simulations with the same gldas forcings to enrich the gldas products in addition to the existing simulations of noah vic clm and mosaic but the related test and evaluation studies are now very limited to evaluate the performance of the above lsm products the ground measurement datasets for precipitation satellite derived terrestrial water storage datasets and observed hydrological discharge data at the river outlets can be taken as the references terrestrial water transfer involves precipitation runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration et among others for a large river basin some of the variables can be observed via ground based observations or satellite based remote sensing including precipitation rate and runoff however some hydrological processes are difficult to monitor in large scale areas or over long term periods due to limited observational conditions including terrestrial water storage surface water in water bodies soil moisture content and groundwater cazenave and chen 2010 and et these processes at large temporal and spatial scales can only be roughly estimated through the water budget theory assuming no lateral flow of groundwater across different basins the water budget over a given period in a river basin can be described as the temporal change of terrestrial water storage tws is the difference of input precipitation minus evapotranspiration et and runoff by closing this water budget the et can be estimated long et al 2014 lv et al 2017 rodell et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 because precipitation and runoff can be measured and tws anomaly twsa can be roughly estimated with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites et is a component for which observational records are not available at the whole river basin scale grace satellite derived twsa provide an data source to close the water budget and estimate the et rodell et al 2011 swenson and wahr 2006 found that grace derived precipitation minus et is consistent with a reanalysis dataset but shows significant difference to the gldas noah estimation according to syed et al 2008 the twsa in gldas simulations is consistent with the grace based twsa at the global scale while yang et al 2013 found that the twsa from multiple grace products is poorly consistent with the twsa estimated by gldas in asia and africa long et al 2013 found that the grace derived twsa is more reliable than the soil moisture storage determined by gldas 1 in texas usa the uncertainties of et in different products were evaluated in many studies by using a method without knowing the true et values long et al 2014 concluded the lowest uncertainties for lsm based et moderate uncertainties in remote sensing derived et and the largest uncertainties in the grace derived et however a different conclusion was drawn by andam akorful et al 2015 nevertheless these uncertainties related studies were based on multiple product ensemble or variances without a reference to observational et values when observational datasets are available it is convenient to evaluate the different products directly and is unnecessary to consider the ensemble uncertainties since low performance product has little value to take as a reference the performances of different products may be site specific for the yellow river basin yrb in northern china several studies have analyzed the water balance or dry wet conditions based on land surface products see lv et al 2017 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 nevertheless these studies were mainly based on datasets from a single data source or single lsm and inter comparisons of more lsm products are limited the objectives of this study are to evaluate and compare the water cycle components in different lsm products for the yrb the products were evaluated include gldas 1 based outputs of four models noah vic clm mosaic gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 based outputs of the noah model the era interim land dataset noah mp simulations with the three versions of gldas forcings gldas 1 gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 here the noah mp simulations were run in this study while all other products are publicly available datasets which were presented in previous studies the evaluations were mainly carried out by comparing the area averaged time series against available reference datasets on an annual basis the spatial patterns were compared based on interannual averages multiple lsm products were compared from multiple aspects 1 performance of runoff et and twsa simulations between different models noah vic clm mosaic and noah mp driven by the same gldas 1 forcing 2 performance of simulations of the same models noah or noah mp but driven by different forcing datasets gldas 1 pgfv2 gldas 2 0 gldas 2 1 3 performances of all the different products including multiple gldas simulations multiple noah mp simulations the era interim land dataset and the ensemble averages the evaluation was conducted on a long period of 1980 2016 in order to capture an overall understanding of the products some of the datasets are only available in shorter periods thus the related comparisons were made for the common periods shared by multiple products 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river flows through an arid and semi arid region of northern china and the annual variations of river discharge are very large the water cycle in the yellow river basin yrb is very sensitive to meteorological conditions and climate change which poses a big challenge to land surface modelers in this respect the water cycle in yrb is a typical case for evaluating global land surface datasets nearly 120 million people live in the yrb and numerous large urban areas industrial areas heavily irrigated agricultural areas and oases rely on the water from the yellow river due to the increasing urban and economic development in the yrb water resources become more critical than ever nakayama 2011 zhang et al 2011 thus grasping the quantities of runoff and et in the yrb will aid in making appropriate social and economic plans yang et al 2012 it is widely believed that the yrb has endured a drying process over the last half century liu and yang 2010 wang et al 2010 and excessive extraction of groundwater has significantly decreased the groundwater level according to the annual bulletin of yellow river water resources http www yellowriver gov cn gao et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 gldas data two versions of the gldas are available for modeling land surfaces gldas version 1 gldas 1 and gldas version 2 the data sources for constructing gldas 1 forcing datasets have been changed several times from 1979 to present wang et al 2016 gldas 1 forcing was used to drive four lsms noah ek et al 2003 the community land model clm lawrence et al 2011 the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 and mosaic koster and suarez 1992 in this paper the different products simulated by these four lsms are represented as noah gl1 clm gl1 vic gl1 and mos gl1 respectively these products are at a 1 degree resolution gldas version 2 has two components gldas 2 0 which is forced entirely by princeton meteorological forcing data and gldas 2 1 which is forced by a combination of model and observation based forcing gldas 2 0 simulations were generated by the noah model at two resolutions 1 and 0 25 for consistency with other abbreviations we use noah gl2 0 and noah gl2 1 to represent the gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 based simulations respectively in this study multiple products from gldas version 1 2 0 and 2 1 were downloaded online and details on these products are presented in table 1 2 2 2 era interim land data the era interim land dataset balsamo et al 2015 is the output from the tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel lsm van den hurk et al 2000 which is driven by the meteorological forcing from era interim reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on global precipitation climatology project gpcp v2 1 huffman et al 2009 era interim land data are more accurate for the water balance than the original era interim reanalysis data balsamo et al 2015 the era interim land dataset has the same grid as that of the era interim reanalysis in this study the era interim land datasets integrated at the daily scale for the period 1980 2010 were collected table 1 2 2 3 precipitation dataset from ground based observations the china ground based precipitation cgp monthly gridded 0 5 x0 5 dataset was produced by the china national meteorological information center china meteorological administration zhao et al 2014 zhao and zhu 2015 the cgp is purely the output of an interpolation based on ground precipitation observations at 2472 meteorological stations in china the interpolation was conducted based on a digital elevation model and the thin plate spline method hutchinson 1998b hutchinson 1998a this dataset is available for the period 1980 2015 table 1 and was used to represent observations to evaluate precipitation based on the lsm simulations 2 2 4 remotely sensed precipitation dataset the climate prediction center morphing global precipitation analysis cmorph dataset joyce et al 2004 and the tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis system near real time dataset trmm rt huffman et al 2007 were collected the cmorph product is derived by an algorithm which propagates the precipitation estimates from multiple passive sensors according to motion vectors the final datasets are publicly available on the website https rda ucar edu datasets ds502 0 the trmm satellite based product in code 3b42rt was used in this study the overall system for producing this product is referred to as the real time trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rt and is in version 7 both the cmorph and trmm rt in three hourly and 0 25 x0 25 version were downloaded and were used to compare the spatial patterns of precipitation to that in the lsm products 2 2 5 grace satellite based twsa twsa from the grace dataset for a global mascon solution luthcke et al 2013 was obtained in this study this dataset was downloaded as a time series represented in a text based format with separate dates generally these data have one set of global record values in each month in some specific months no record exists to compare with other products we have interpolated the global cover records for each date to a 1 1 grid using the nearest neighbor method and the resulting gridded data were stored as files on specific dates other than on a monthly basis the minimum area size that can use grace to estimate water mass was believed to be approximately 200 000 km2 rodell et al 2007 and this threshold is smaller than the area of the yrb at 752 000 km2 2 2 6 modis based evapotranspiration data an 8 day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis global terrestrial et product version 6 mod16a2 mu et al 2007 was used the dataset was resampled into a longitude latitudinal grid with a resolution of 0 025 this product was estimated based on an energy balance model which considers the surface water and energy flux thus the mod16a2 is different from a common remote sensing product which is estimated more directly in this respect the product cannot be used as an accurate observational data for evaluating lsm products 2 2 7 monthly dataset of the natural river discharge for the yellow river the annual dataset of natural river discharge reconstructed by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources nrd yrcc was obtained here the annual series for lijin station was used lijin station is the closest station to the estuary of the yellow river fig 1 the annual discharge at lijin station can be regarded as an estimation of annual total runoff for the entire yrb details about this dataset can also be found in table 1 2 2 8 princeton global meteorological forcing data princeton global meteorological forcing data version 2 pgfv2 sheffield et al 2006 was used to drive the land surface model noah mp this dataset was produced by terrestrial hydrology research group princeton university the dataset was stored with a 3 hourly step in a 0 5 x0 5 grid and covers the period of 1948 2012 the subset obtained for this study covers the period of 1980 2012 2 3 noah mp model and simulations as a widely used lsm noah mp was packed into the community weather research and forecasting model hydro wrf hydro arnault et al 2016 senatore et al 2015 modelling system which is maintained by the national center for atmospheric research ncar noah mp is also the core of the national water model noaa 2016 which was developed for the prediction of river flows in the usa noah mp has been widely validated and enhanced zheng and yang 2016 cai et al 2016 gao et al 2015 pilotto et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 in this study the noah mp land surface model was used to perform simulations for the yrb with multiple forcing datasets for common users conducting simulations based on default options table 2 for physical schemes is convenient therefore only the default options were used in this study the gridded domain fig 1 a used for simulation includes 350 columns and 170 rows which is in lambert conformal conic projection coordinates and generally cover the whole yrb see fig 1 a with a resolution of 6 km the domain centers at 107 2574 e and 37 21718 n the geophysical information for the domain such as the digital elevation land use and land cover and green vegetable fraction was extracted from the wrf3 5 database multiple forcing datasets for driving noah mp include the pgfv2 gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 gldas 2 0 forcing was not used because this dataset is generally equivalent to pgfv2 for simplicity in the following paragraphs the abbreviations for the simulated products of noah mp driven by the three forcing datasets are represented as nmp pgfv2 nmp gl1 and nmp gl2 1 all meteorological data used as forcing datasets were extracted for the domain by transforming the coordinates into the selected lambert conformal conic projection and resampling by bilinear interpolation all simulations were run on 3 hourly steps 2 4 preprocessing the products 2 4 1 data preprocessing the gldas 1 gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 datasets noah mp simulations era interim land reanalysis data mod16 product and gridded grace datasets underwent similar processing first the data in the yrb were extracted and interpolated into the same spatial domain of the noah mp simulations second the precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and twsa in the yrb were averaged along the time axis to investigate the spatial distributions of these variables and third the 3 hourly or daily values were averaged across the yrb area and the time axis into monthly and annually time series 2 4 2 reconstruct et based observational dataset to evaluate the et in multiple products a et series can be reconstructed based on the observational precipitation and annual river discharge the water budget model in a period can be written as 1 p e t r δ s δ t here p et and r represent precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff discharge δs δt represents the change of twsa in a certain period δt in a long term period δs δt tends to zero and the formula became 2 et p r thus although et has no observational dataset it can be estimated from observed precipitation and runoff using eq 2 in this study an annual et series was reconstructed by calculating the difference of the cgp precipitation minus the nrd yrcc this calculation implies that the annual δs were treated as zeros theoretically the δs can be represented by twsa grace anomalies thus by subtracting δs from the reconstructed et δs δt et can be isolated from the twsa however the twsa grace data is unavailable for the period 1980 2001 since the grace satellite was launched in 2002 2 4 3 extraction of simulated twsa in lsm products all the lsms neglected the simulation of underground water but the multiple layer soil water content was generated which can act as a dynamic state of twsa the presumptions of soil layers in different products are different although the total soil thickness in all products is at least 2 m to calculate the twsa in different products in this study the snow water equivalent canopy water storage cws and all water content in the top layers with a total thickness equal to or less than 2 m were summarized as the twsa cws data are not available in era interim land nevertheless according to our analysis cws constitutes a very small proportion of the twsa in these multiple lsm datasets and it does not have a significant influence on the multi product comparisons 2 5 evaluation metrics to evaluate the time series from different products with reference to the observational dataset pearson s correlation coefficient cc nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse were used it is notable that nse ranges from to 1 and a good solution should have a nse value close to 1 to detect decreasing trends in the twsa a mann kendall test kendall 1955 mann 1945 was also used to evaluate overestimations underestimations of the simulated precipitation or runoff compared with the observed values relative bias rb was also calculated as follows 3 rb y 1 m s y y 1 m o y y 1 m o y where sy represents the simulated annual variables such as precipitation or runoff for the yth year oy is the observed equivalent at the yth year and m is the total number of years considered a product has a higher performance than other products should has higher cc and nse but lower rb and rmse to the observational dataset 2 6 uncertainty the standard deviation of the difference from a modeled variable to an observational variable is used to quantify the uncertainty of the modeled variable here the modeled variables include the variables precipitation runoff and et estimated by lsms remote sensing based algorithms and the ensemble of multiple products while the observational variables represent those estimated from ground based observation which is believed to be more reliable than other modeled variables in this study only the cgp nrd yrcc and the et reconstructed from cgp and nrd yrcc were regarded as observational variables the ensemble averages of multiple products can be obtained through two methods the first method uses the simple arithmetic average on the ensemble members the second method is a weighted ensemble average andam akorful et al 2015 of n ensemble members 4 e t i 1 n w i u i t where ui t is the variable value of the ith ensemble member wi is the weight calculated by the uncertainties w i 1 δ i 2 i 1 n 1 δ i 2 here δi is the uncertainty of the ith ensemble member 3 results 3 1 precipitation forcing the annual precipitation from multi source datasets showed that the spatial patterns in the gldas datasets and era interim land are very similar but different from that of cgp cmorph and trmm fig 2 when the precipitation across the yrb were averaged and analyzed for annual variations obvious uncertainties were observed between the different products fig 3 a and they were comparatively large before 1996 and decreased after 1996 the standard deviations across the multiple products were 37 mm during the period 1980 1996 and 26 5 mm during the period 1997 2012 precipitation in gldas 1 was consistent with the other datasets for most years although an abnormal extremely small value occurred in 1996 and an extremely large value occurred in 2000 the anomaly in 1996 has been reported by zhou et al 2013 the anomaly in 2000 can be attributed to the special data source used for this year wang et al 2016 in order to avoid the influence of these extreme gldas 1 precipitation values on the evaluation metrics the values in 1996 and 2000 were discarded and then were interpolated by referencing to the values in era interim land for the year 1996 2000 the interpolation was done by adding a six year mean difference calculated by subtracting the gldas 1 values from the era interim land values to the era interim land values of the year 1996 2000 the interpolated series can be found in fig 3 b the interpolation can be represented as 5 v g l 1 1996 v el 1996 1 6 y 1993 y 1996 1999 v gl y v el y v g l 1 2000 v el 2000 1 6 y 1997 y 2000 2003 v gl y v el y where v gl1 year represents the variable values precipitation or runoff in gldas 1in that year and v el1 year represents those variable values in era interim land the precipitation in pgfv2 and gldas 2 0 were generally consistent with each other consistent with the fact that gldas 2 0 is generated from pgfv2 although the two datasets have likely undergone a different resampling process over most of the years precipitation in the era interim land reanalysis have the largest values while that of the pgfv2 gldas 2 0 datasets showed the smallest the annual precipitation series were evaluated against cgp table 3 when 1996 and 2000 were excluded gldas 1 was also consistent with cgp after 2002 both gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 become more consistent with cgp over most years pgfv2 underestimated precipitation while era interim land showed a slight overestimation moreover pgfv2 only overestimated precipitation in 1996 and 2000 when these two years were excluded an underestimation is significant in pgfv2 the overestimation of era interim land was 26 mm from 1980 to 2010 although an underestimation occurred in 2010 all the three versions 1 2 0 2 1 of gldas underestimated precipitation but gldas 1 has very small bias to cgp during 2000 2010 over the long period of 1980 2010 era interim land can be regarded as the best dataset for precipitation but for the later years 2000 2010 gldas 1 becomes the best when cgp are taken as the true values the uncertainties of annual precipitation in pgfv2 gldas 2 gldas 1 gldas 2 1 and era interim land are 22 2 mm 28 1 mm 24 2 mm 16 7 mm respectively the uncertainty of the weighted ensemble average over pgfv2 era interim land and gldas 1 is estimated as 14 mm 3 2 runoff 3 2 1 spatial patterns to investigate the spatial pattern of runoff in different products and remove the influence of different precipitation forcings runoff coefficients were calculated instead of using runoff directly runoff coefficient is defined as the ratio of the total runoff to the related total precipitation during a given period in fact the spatial pattern of runoff coefficients is close to the pattern of runoff because a large amount of precipitation can result in considerable runoff due to the allocation of water on the land surface whereas when the precipitation amount is very low most of the water will evaporate limited observations on the spatial pattern of runoff are available therefore only the spatial patterns between different products were compared in this study the spatial patterns of runoff coefficients during the period from 1980 to 2000 showed different patterns the cc of the spatial runoff between each pair of the multiple products range from 0 6 to 0 8 not displayed in any figures or tables the spatial patterns produced by different products were shown in fig 4 in the gldas 1 products vic and mosaic give comparatively small runoff coefficients nmp pgfv2 and noah gl2 0 at two different resolutions 0 25 and 1 0 were generally based on the same dataset but the runoff coefficients show different spatial patterns between the two products the two resolutions 0 25 and 1 of gldas 2 0 show similar spatial patterns but different details noah gl1 and noah gl2 0 are the simulations of the same model with different forcings and show different spatial patterns of the runoff coefficients 3 2 2 annual time series due to the abnormal extreme values of gldas 1 precipitation in 1996 and 2000 all the gldas 1 based runoff series also show similar extremes in order to calculate the evaluation indices the runoff values in 1996 and 2000 were also discarded and interpolated using equation 5 here the interpolation was done for all the gldas 1 based products simulated by noah vic mosaic clm and noah mp as a statistical indicator of interannual variability the standard deviation of the annual runoff averaged over the yrb in the multiple products is in the range 20 mm 50 mm with mean 31 mm this variability can match that of precipitation in the multiple products it shows that the runoff of era interim land reanalysis matches nrd yrcc the best by visual inspection fig 5 a according to the rmse between annual runoff and nrd yrcc during 1980 2010 the performance from the best to the worst is as follows table 4 era interim land noah gl1 noah gl2 0 nmp gl1 nmp pgfv2 mos gl1 vic gl1 and clm gl1 similar order holds for the period 2000 2010 except that the gldas 2 1 products become available and are slightly better than the gldas 2 0 products for both the noah and noah mp simulations among the products of gldas 1 forcing vic and mosaic produced very small runoff values while clm produced very large runoff values noah produced generally comparable runoff values to nrd yrcc before 1995 but the runoff values decreased gradually after 2002 and became underestimated in gldas 1 based products noah mp overestimated runoff and the increasing order of runoff is as follows vic mosaic noah noah mp and clm these results show that different models produce very different runoff according to the rmse noah mp performed the best among all the four models driven by the gldas 1 forcing but also generated a systematic bias in gldas 2 0 products noah gl2 0 underestimated runoff while nmp pgfv2 overestimated that for noah mp the simulations nmp pgfv2 nmp gl1 and nmp gl2 1 were consistent with each other especially after 2000 before 2002 the simulated runoff is different between nmp gl1 and nmp pgfv2 although this difference was smaller than the variability between other products in most years before 1996 the runoff of nmp pgfv2 was smaller than that of nmp gl1 which maybe also related to the smaller annual precipitation forcing in pgfv2 than in gldas 1 in the period after 2005 the noah simulations based on the three gldas forcings were very close to each other all the above findings illustrate that the runoff overestimations in noah mp simulations can be attributed to the systematic bias caused by the model and the differences in forcings have a comparatively small influence ccs and nse were also calculated for the annual runoff in multiple products and nrd yrcc table 4 the relative biases from the simulated runoff to nrd yrcc were also calculated using eq 3 the runoff in era interim land reanalysis showed the smallest rmse and rb the largest cc and nse both noah gl1 and noah gl2 0 runoff showed performances comparable to or better than that simulated by noah mp generally all runoff simulations of noah mp are better than those of mosaic clm and vic according to rmse rb and nse although noah mp obtained a smaller cc than clm 3 3 terrestrial water storage twsa was extracted from vic gl1 and noah gl1 noah gl2 0 1 0 and 0 25 nmp pgfv2 noah gl2 1 and era interim land among these products the spatial patterns of the long term averaged twsa across the yrb are different fig 6 generally noah gl2 0 shows similar patterns at two different resolutions 1 0 and 0 25 although the values are very different from those in noah gl1 very similar patterns were simulated in nmp pgfv2 and nmp gl1 twsa grace is used here as an observational data to assess the land surface products with respect to twsa the twsa grace dataset is available during the period of 2003 2015 there is at most one value available for each month and no value exists in some specific months to compare with twsa grace for each date with a grace record available the twsa in the lsm products corresponding to that date were sampled out instead of calculating monthly averages the twsa in all land surface products and twsa grace can reflect seasonal or interannual variations fig 7 mann kendall tests were used to test the long term trends of all annual averaged twsa series twsa grace showed a decreasing trend at a significance level of 0 001 but the twsa in the lsm products did not pass the significance test at 0 05 similarly no significant trend was found in cgp the trend of twsa grace was estimated to decrease by 3 6 mm a and the period of 2013 2015 shows the greatest decreasing according to cgp the year 2002 is a historical drought year which can explain that the very low twsa in the beginning of 2003 increased to a high value after that summer all modeled twsa also reflected such a phenomenon however the very low twsa grace values in 2014 and 2015 were not reflected by most of the modeled products and only noah gl2 1 presented exceptional values the ccs between the lsm derived twsa and grace twsa were calculated for the common period 2003 2010 in all the products as well as the arithmetic ensemble average the descendent order of ccs is as follows era interim land cc 0 85 noah gl2 1 cc 0 76 the ensemble average cc 0 74 clm gl1 cc 0 73 noah gl1 cc 0 72 noah gl2 0 cc 0 67 vic gl1 cc 0 66 mos gl1 cc 0 65 nmp gl2 0 pgf cc 0 53 nmp gl2 1 cc 0 44 and nmp gl1 cc 0 36 among the different lsms noah and clm produced better correlations with twsa grace than the other models which is similar to that obtained by long et al 2014 noah mp produced very small r values to twsa grace because noah mp failed to reproduce the amplitude of seasonal variability and the simulated twsa peaks and valleys usually lead one month ahead of those in twsa grace the standard deviation of long term twsa variations were estimated based on the above mentioned samples from 2003 to 2010 compared with the standard deviation of twsa grace 28 0 mm clm gl1 8 1 mm noah gl1 22 7 mm mos gl1 22 4 mm vic gl1 20 4 mm and era interim land 22 2 mm underestimated while noah gl2 0 39 5 mm noah gl2 1 34 84 mm nmp gl2 1 36 0 mm nmp pgfv2 32 mm and nmp gl1 34 78 mm overestimated the underestimation of tws variations in noah gl1 and vic gl1 are similar to that found in a study of the tibetan plateau bi et al 2016 the twsa extracted from all products reflects the seasonal fluctuations of twsa grace for example an extreme case is that the increase in twsa from a very low value in 2003 was simulated well by all land surface products however twsa grace shows a significant decreasing trend at a rate of 3 6 mm a in 2003 2015 which is not reflected by any other land surface products in particular from 2010 to 2015 twsa grace has a significant decreasing trend which was reflected by the twsa of noah gl2 1 meanwhile the twsa simulated by all noah simulations and vic gl1 also displayed a decreasing trend based on the same forcings the noah mp simulation shows no decline of twsa indicating that this decline is not likely caused by the trend in forcing dataset 3 4 evapotranspiration the spatial et patterns of other products were not displayed because they have the similar pattern of era interim land according to fig 8 the spatial patterns of et from all products except mod16 were generally consistent with each other here the spatial et pattern of mod16 shows more details than that in other products since mod16 has a very high resolution but this resolution inconsistency cannot conceal the main difference of spatial patterns the gldas 1 et series have two extreme small values in 1996 and 1997 which are highly different to that in other products in 1996 the extreme et is corresponding to the erroneous precipitation but this is unlikely a fact in 1997 although low precipitation in 1997 exists in all the products the extreme small value in 1997 may be related to the other variables which affect the estimation of et for the year 2000 the et values are generally normal which is reasonable because the extreme high precipitation in that year can lead to extreme runoff instead of an abnormally high et in any lsm models before calculating the evaluation indices the abnormal et values in 1996 1997 were discarded and interpolated using a modified eq 5 fig 9 b instead of the six year mean difference the five year 1993 1994 1995 1998 1999 mean difference were used here the standard deviations of the annual average et over the yrb are 24 mm 89 mm with the mean of 45 mm and these deviations are larger than that of precipitation and runoff indicating that the lsms led to larger variability than the original precipitation forcing datasets the seasonal variations show that the difference of et between mod16 and other lsm based products mainly occurred in summer as shown by the case of 2001 fig 10 a and similar effects were also found in other years the difference is not very large except for that in mod16 which estimated larger et during winter but smaller values during summer to investigate the simulated long term change the averages of et were presented in table 5 for all products based on gldas 1 forcing the descending order of et values is vic mosaic noah noah mp and clm which is generally consistent with the reversed order of runoff the noah mp output has larger et and smaller runoff than the clm output for noah and noah mp et driven by the gldas 2 0 forcing is smaller than that driven by the gldas 1 forcing mod16 et showed an exceptional increasing trend that passes the mann kendall test at the 0 05 significance level from 2001 to 2016 no such significant increasing was found in the multiple lsm products another phenomenon is that the mod16 et has different interannual variations when compared with other products it is difficult to accurately evaluate et due to some facts no observational tws dataset is available and the tws estimated by grace do not cover the period 1980 2002 meanwhile grace tws itself has large uncertainty long et al 2014 in this study the et estimated based on water balance was used as a baseline to evaluate the et in lsms eqs 1 and 2 were both used annual tws changes δs δt are needed in eq 1 thus the tws estimated from era interim land was used as a substitute considering that era interim land shows the highest performance on twsa the et in lsm products were evaluated against these two water balance et estimations in following text e1 and e2 are used to represent the reconstructed et through eqs 1 and 2 respectively when e1 is used as a baseline instead of e2 no significant improvement of performance was obtained for most of the products according to different metrics table 5 comparatively nmp gl1 performs the best and era interim land performs second according to ccs and nses nmp gl1 has better correlation but larger rmse and bias than era interim land the two ensemble averages obtain larger correlations and nses smaller rmse and biases than all other single product which shows the good performance of ensembles generally the et uncertainties were reduced by evaluating against e1 the uncertainties of et ranges from 28 mm to 40 mm and are generally close to each other in different products the smallest one was obtained by nmp gl1 28 04 mm the second and the third were obtained by nmp pgfv2 28 13 mm and clm gl1 31 32 mm respectively 3 5 partitioning of runoff and et in water balance partitioning of runoff and et is an aspect to compare different lsm simulations zheng et al 2019 when the annual runoff against et in each year is plotted in a point then the runoff et relationship in multiple years forms a group of scatter points fig 11 a in this way the relationship among runoff et and precipitation in different products can be clearly visualized according to eq 2 if the annual precipitation is set to a fixed value then the runoff et relationship can be represented by a declining straight line for the yrb the fixed reference precipitation value was set to 492 mm fig 11 a which is the mean annual precipitation estimated from the era interim land reanalysis dataset the points in the upper right side of the line of 492 mm indicates that the related precipitation is larger than the mean annual precipitation here note that the reconstructed et includes et and δs thus this et error caused by annual δs should have slight influence on the location of each runoff et point but do not change the area occupied by the group of points which represent the runoff et relationship of different years because the multiple year averaged δs tends to zero most of the points related to nmp pgfv2 and noah gl2 0 lie on the left downward side of the line of 492 mm indicating that the precipitation was underestimated by pgfv2 the ratio r ra ea reflects the partition of runoff and et from precipitation and here ra is the annual runoff mm and ea is the annual et mm when r is known the runoff coefficient can be estimated as r 1 r in fig 11 a the points of the era interim land reanalysis and observations reconstructed are mixed together except that the latter shows smaller annual precipitation values the averaged ratios r of these two datasets are close to each other 0 13 and 0 137 for era interim land and the reconstructed data respectively thus the runoff coefficients for the era interim land reanalysis and observations reconstructed can be estimated as 0 115 and 0 12 respectively indicating the era interim land reanalysis can reflect the actual runoff et partition very well theoretically r values should be influenced by many factors and the annual total precipitation is one important factor here based on the case of the era interim land the relation between r values and total annual precipitation p unit mm were linearly regressed as r 0 0003 p 0 0121 with the determination coefficient of 0 486 compared to the ratios r obtained from these two products nmp pgfv2 and nmp gl1 overestimated the ratios and the averages were 0 232 and 0 22 respectively the nmp gl2 1 obtained significantly better runoff et ratios than the nmp gl1 and nmp pgfv2 the gldas 1 simulated by mosaic vic and noah underestimated the ratios with averages of 0 043 0 036 and 0 108 respectively the clm overestimated the ratio with an average of 0 287 gldas 2 0 noah also slightly underestimated the ratio with an average of 0 078 thus providing the second closest ratios to the reconstructed values 4 discussion 4 1 spatial patterns similar spatial patterns of interannual mean precipitation were obtained in the multiple forcing datasets of different versions of gldas and era interim land although differences were observed in the spatial patterns of ground measured and remote sensing derived precipitation however based on these precipitation forcings the spatial patterns of the simulated runoff and twsa by different lsms are more diverse than the precipitation patterns meanwhile the spatial patterns of runoff and twsa produced by the same model noah or noah mp with different forcings show small differences which indicates the different lsms can produce large uncertainties in the spatial patterns therefore cautions should be taken when using the runoff and twsa simulated by each single lsm to the hydrological application in the subbasin of the yrb 4 2 performances of different products on the water cycle 4 2 1 precipitation annual precipitation is more diverse between different forcing datasets in the early years than after 2002 fig 3 after 2002 both gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 are accurate relative to the ground based precipitation the cgp although the annual precipitation in era interim land are more accurate than that in other products before 2004 its accuracy after 2004 is improved little and is not superior to that in gldas 1 and gldas 2 1 pgfv2 gldas 2 has a large underestimation of precipitation all precipitation in different products can reproduce the interannual variations and the decreasing trend in 1980 2002 except that the gldas 1 has significant error in 1996 and 2000 this result is meaningful when the precipitation of each dataset is used to analyze and interpret climate change impacts in the yrb 4 2 2 runoff and et for runoff comparisons can be made between different products of the same gldas 1 forcing but different models noah vic mosaic clm and noah mp bai et al 2016 evaluated the streamflow simulated from the four model gldas 1 products for the tibetan plateau and found systematic overestimations were obtained by noah and clm and systematic underestimations were obtained by vic and mosaic similarly in this study for the yrb vic and mosaic systematically underestimated runoff and clm overestimated runoff however noah produced runoff values equivalent to the reconstructed natural discharge with larger interannual variations before 2001 but generated increasingly underestimated values thereafter all the noah mp simulations show obvious overestimations from 1980 to 2015 a significant decreasing runoff trend in noah gl1 and an underestimation of runoff in noah gl2 0 noah were observed from 1980 to 2015 considering that the annual precipitation forcing in gldas 2 0 is less than that in gldas 1 noah gl2 0 further underestimated runoff this conclusion is different from wang et al 2016 who reported that gldas 1 and gldas 2 0 showed small runoff overestimations wang et al 2016 also found that gldas 2 0 runoff values were more accurate than gldas 1 runoff values although contrasting results were obtained in the present study table 2 this inconsistency probably is due to that the discharge data used by wang et al 2016 is different from nrd yrcc the contrasts of et between different lsm products were found contrary to that of runoff therefore the ratio of annual runoff to annual et is a useful index to evaluate the partitioning of runoff and et in different lsm products 4 3 long term trend in tws the continuing decrease of tws is possibly related to the excessive extraction of groundwater in the yrb there is no consideration of groundwater changes in the lsm models it is difficult to verify the above mentioned decreasing rate due to the lack of in situ tws data however the decreasing rate of the twsa grace at 3 6 mm a is much larger than the increasing water consumption 0 78 mm a in the yrb gao et al 2016 such a large decreasing rate is likely affected by the grace estimation of the adjacent river basins the haihe and the huaihe which also underwent severe groundwater extraction meanwhile during the period 2003 2015 the massive coal mining activity in the yrb certainly contributes much to the decreasing of gravity which maybe another explanation for the overestimated mass loss as observed by grace but no studies have quantified this influence among all the gldas based simulations noah performed the best while noah mp performed the worst here it should be noted that the noah mp simulation was run under the default combination of physical scheme options the performance of noah mp under other different combinations of physical scheme options can be evaluated in additional studies the noah gl1 and vic gl1 show decreasing of tws during 2010 2015 but with the same forcings none of three noah mp simulations show such decrease the low twsa grace values in 2015 and 2016 appear to be reflected by noah gl2 1 and these results are likely inaccurate because underground water is not considered by noah gl2 1 due to these inconsistence whether the simulated decreasing trends imply some simulation error or reflect the real climate change is unknown which makes it difficult to quantify the over depletion of ground water in yrb when taking the twsa in these products as references 4 4 uncertainty comparatively the uncertainty of runoff is smaller than that of precipitation forcing compare them in figs 3 and 5 the runoff uncertainty theoretically comes from two sources precipitation forcing and lsms it is inferable that the uncertainty in precipitation forcing can contribute a part in runoff uncertainty and the rest of the precipitation uncertainties canpropagate to other components et and territorial water storage nasonova et al 2011 nevertheless the relative biases of runoff except that for era interim land are actually far larger than that in precipitation forcings according to these different biases in different lsms most of the runoff uncertainties should come from the lsms the uncertainties of et in different products generally lie in a narrow range 28 mm 40 mm for era interim land and nmp gl1 the et uncertainty is smaller than the sum of precipitation uncertainty and runoff uncertainty but this does not hold true for other products the uncertainties obtained by era interim land and the ensemble averages are close to the direct estimation in lv et al 2017 but are far larger than the uncertainty of the reconstructed et by lv et al 2017 which considered irrigation and water diversion since et observations are not available in the whole yrb it is difficult to determine whether the et in mod16 are worse than those of other lsms nevertheless the accurate results for runoff runoff et partitioning and twsa simulated in era interim land indicate that et was likely well simulated by the era interim land dataset accordingly the seasonal and interannual variations simulated by mod16 should be worse than those of other land surface products this inference is consistent with the conclusion that the et values from lsms have lower uncertainties than those derived from modis as indicated by long et al 2014 and baik et al 2018 but is different from the conclusion of andam akorful et al 2015 which supported that mod16 has smaller uncertainty than that estimated by lsms over the volta basin west africa 4 5 performance of multiple products ensemble ensemble average of multiple products can be used as a baseline to evaluate individual modeled product when the true states such as et or runoff are unknown andam akorful et al 2015 however the reliability of such evaluations is unknown since the ensemble average is not equivalent to the observation in this study the different ensemble averages almost obtained the best performance with precipitation runoff and et when compared with any individual product except era interim land for precipitation and et the two ensemble averages perform better than era interim land but this is not true for runoff for tws anomalies the arithmetic ensemble mean of the 11 products has a smaller cc to grace tws than that obtained by era interim land and noah gl2 1 of course the observational data the cgp natural river discharge and grace tws which is used as the baseline also has unknown uncertainties nevertheless era interim land agrees best to the observational data in the three water cycle components but the ensemble averages do not indicating that era interim land and the observational data are possibly more reliable than the ensemble averages the ensemble averages may perform inferior to the best product but generally performs better than most individual products in this respect when the true states are unknown the ensemble average of multiple products can be used as a baseline to evaluate most of the individual ensemble member 5 conclusion and remarks the motivation of this study is to compare and evaluate the multiple lsm products on the water cycle components in the yrb the publicly available gldas products noah mp simulations driven by different versions of gldas forcing datasets era interim land and the ensemble average of multiple products were evaluated against the data derived from ground measurement based precipitation natural river discharge and grace derived tws changes focusing on annual variations the comparisons were made in multiple aspects except for era interim land all other products had large systematic biases on the partitioning of runoff and et for all the gldas 1 based simulations noah mp performs the best while noah performs the second according to the biases and correlations clm produced extremely high runoff et ratios while vic and mosaic produced very low ratios clm simulation provides good ccs but large biases to the observed runoff and twsa variations vic and mosaic simulations are very similar for all the water cycle components among all the lsms noah mp performed the worst on the tws anomaly all these comparisons demonstrate that model changes are possibly required to improve the partitioning of runoff and et in the yrb era interim land has very small bias observed and performs the best in three water budget components precipitation runoff and twsa era interim land perhaps has greatly reduced the annual uncertainties and can be used as a benchmark to evaluate other products for the yrb however this conclusion may not apply to other regions for example orth and seneviratne 2015 found that era interim land has no better capability than gldas 2 0 with regard to runoff and et in europe the ensemble average of all the lsm products does perform better than any single product and the weighted ensemble average is also better than the arithmetic ensemble average in theory the observation based water budget components have uncertainties due to measuring error limited gauges and inaccurate estimation therefore the true states of the water budget components and terrestrial water transfers are unknown combining multiple observational data with lsm simulations is helpful to better understand the real water cycle in a river basin for example it is difficult to measure the high resolution spatial distribution of runoff or et because only the total river discharge can be measured while the model based estimation can cover this shortage as for the lsm products with large biases we can obtain more reliable datasets through further bias correction in summary this paper provides an overview of the performance of different lsm models and comparisons between the different products for water budget closure in the yrb however some questions need to investigate in further research 1 why era interim land performs better than other lsm products in multiple water cycle components with regards to the percentage biases correlations and rmse and which is the main factor between the htessel lsm or the driving forcing dataset to answer this question the noah and noah mp simulation based on the same forcing data of era interim land should be conducted and other different meteorological variables wind pressure air humidity solar radiation in forcing datasets should be compared 2 although the era interim land product display a water budget coincide with the multiple observational datasets whether this product can reflect the local subbasin water budget is still unknown for example in some tributary river basins 3 due to the limited resolution of lsm products the small scale variability of the water cycle components cannot be well reflected for example in different orographic areas for hydrological applications in the yrb to model such local variability the variables should be downscaled further by considering orographic influence credit authorship contribution

measured data of i and iii identify the strengths and limitations of the proposed model by breaking the linear and power regression equations commonly fitted to the i vs p gross precipitation

montane cloud tmc n 6 temperate t n 4 and tropical dry td n 21 forests were used to calibrate the model results showed that even though the model was constructed independently of the common equations it isolates s er and ep and reproduces remarkably well the conventional empirical linear and power regression equations of i vs p and simulates unbiased cumulative and individual storm i values when coupled with the function of rainfall duration the model projects lower er rates than previously anticipated using other empirical approaches statistical analysis revealed the likely oscillation of the i vs p relationship between the linear and power functions depending on rainfall canopy and climate conditions the model represents an important advancement in forest hydrology by analytically isolating s er ep and simulating compatible i values for individual as well as for assemblages of storms it further clarifies the large variability of er and helps to explain the role of forests in

the atmosphere contributing to the regulation of the climate system bonan 2008 rotenberg and yakir 2010 and the recycle of local precipitation because of this importance several models with varying degrees of empiricicism have been developed over the years to predict i these include simple regression helvey and patric 1965 empirical ponce and hawkins 1996 probabilistic calder 1986 and physical models rutter et al 1971 gash 1979 mulder 1985 calder 1986 massman 1983 valente et al 1997 liu 1997 de groen and savenije 2006 gerrits et al 2009 návar 2019a currently there are at least 17 published i models muzylo et al 2009 although the most frequently tested ones are the sparse gash et al 1995 the rutter et al 1971 and the liu 1997 models muzylo et al 2009 návar 2019b muzylo et al 2009 and návar 2019b summarized individual model applications and performance amongst the physical models the rutter type models solve a running balance of rainfall canopy and trunk storage drainage and evaporation over the course of a storm rutter et al 1971 gash type models are analytical interpretations of the rutter type models gash 1979 the návar 2019a model develops further the horton 1919

deriving interception loss i p t h s f considering i e s where e is the total evaporation during rainfall other kinds of models must focus explicitly on simulating these i components however these types of models are scarce in the scientific literature the physically based models of rutter gash and liu receive most consideration in i studies muzylo et al 2009 návar 2019b these models however require of at least four different coefficients such as s er mean rainfall intensity r drainage rate d and the slope regression coefficients for interception components as a function of p throughfall

methods commonly evaluate er by solving the energy balance of forest canopies three physically based techniques quantify the energy balance with the goal of evaluating er total evaporation during the storm e e r t or the average evaporation rate during the storm e t e r t are derived with the energy balance approaches energy balance budget methods commonly account for the amount of sensible heat h or net radiation transformed into the latent heat of evaporation le of wet canopy nonetheless net radiation is negligible small because e r occurs during the storm these methods are expensive and complex hence the vast majority of i case studies do not report the average in storm er the modified fao penman monteith reference evaporation equation rutter et al 1971 gash morton 1978 gash 1979

methodology baldocchi 2008 czikowski and fitzjarrald 2009 are three techniques employed to physically evaluate er the empirical water budget approaches of gash 1979 liu 1997 and návar 2019a also evaluate er however er assessments using either the physical or empirical methods most often result in large deviations van dijk et al 2015 návar 2019b several improvements have been recommended to evaluate more precisely available h in forests that will eventually lead to increased er values beyond commonly reported figures e 0 80 mm h 1 miralles et al 2010 návar 2019b as a consequence there is an urgent need of developing testing and simplifying i models to provide further insights into the amount of energy devoted to evaporate intercepted rainfall the performance at several temporal scales is a second limitation of most i models reported in the scientific literature the rutter and gash models originally developed and calibrated for approximately monthly time steps achieve poor accuracy in individual storms schellekens et al 1999 holwerda et al 2010 linhoss and siegert 2016 klingaman et al 2007 muzylo et al 2009 linhoss and siegert 2016 and návar 2017 2019b successfully compared the gash liu rutter mulder mulder 1985 and wimo hörmann et al 1996 models in predicting cumulative interception but tested models were less accurate in predicting i for individual storm events although the model of massman 1983 improved model predictions for individual storms it was tested in a single tree given the limitations of the models available as well as the importance of i in the water cycle and the climate system the objectives of this study were to i develop an independent model based on analytically breaking the i components s and er ii compare the model based on its fitness to cumulative and event based measured data of i and iii identify the strengths and limitations of the proposed model this novel technique provides a robust and objective contrast with other physically based i models and identify specific areas for model development and improvement in future work 2 materials and methods the proposed model interception loss can be broken into s and er these i components can be modeled using analytical techniques in statistical analysis by developing further the horton s 1919 eq 1 1 i t 0 t f s t t 0 t f e r t i s e where t0 tf time to start and time to end precipitation t respectively s rate of canopy wetting l t 1 eq 1 hypothesizes storm depth and duration controls s and er different forms of s and er are likely in different storms climates and forests and s and er are independent of the lag time between storms návar 2017 proposed the mathematical functions s and er over time could take many forms depending on the forest and environmental climate and rainfall conditions as depicted in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 t f t 0 s t t f t 0 q t p exp q t c t s 3 t t f t 0 e r t t f t 0 t t α e xp t β β α 1 γ α 1 t e t where q p q c statistical parameters of the gamma function α β form and scale parameters of the weibull function dt tf t0 these fundamental equations require hourly measurements of s and er that are not commonly measured during the course of each storm in most reported i investigations návar 2019a in a parallel report published in agricultural and forest meteorology developed an independent approach to solve eq 1 that yields s and er using extended drip equations with excellent preliminary expectations this report presents an alternate solution based on breaking the i vs p relationship to independently derive s and er the weibull and gamma functions can be described as a function of p that is the model can be developed by assuming p actually is the most influential parameter to dictate er making no considerations of the preconception that er is in fact a drying process that must respond primarily to air temperature humidity wind speed among other climatic factors consistent with the statements of zabret et al 2018 then i can be derived as a function of p as follows 4 i p f p 0 k p p exp q p c p p f p t 0 p p α exp p β β α 1 γ α 1 p where po pf start and end of precipitation l the development of eq 4 transforms the conventional er l t 1 into ep l l 1 that is a function of p linear or power regression equations have commonly described the i vs p relationship zinke 1967 the linear equation has the intercept b0 and the slope bin coefficients which have commonly positive values pointing to the rapid wetting of the canopy and the linear function of ep over p these statements consistently match the positive relationship of er vs r proposed earlier by gash 1979 as r f p for most storms the power equation has usually slope values 1 0 pointing to the rapid increase and a quick decay function of ep vs p close observation of i data as a function of p for many forests in small depth storms the absolute depth of i is small p 5 mm and tends to curve in medium size depth storms 5 p 15 mm for several temperate and boreal forests indicating the likely lack of energy to evaporate intercepted precipitation návar 2019a once the canopy has been wetted the linear and power equations suggest quasi constant and decaying ep rates respectively as a monotonically increasing function of p for most forests these statements and a graphical representation of the model are depicted in fig 1 approximately 99 and 1 of compiled n 700 i studies report the linear ile and power ipe equations fit the i vs p relationship respectively návar 2019a however studies testing the appropriateness of the linear or power equations are yet to be conducted the ile and ipe are mathematically defined in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 i le b 0 b in p e i 6 i pe k p c ln k c l n p e i

of equation eq 5 often results in higher and eq 6 in smaller predicted i values for small depth and may be for large depth storms as well the model assumes precipitation wets most of the canopy before the intersection of these two equations and ep accounts for the remaining fraction of i then solving eqs 5 and 6 for p yields the intersection of p where these equations converge pin the depth of p from p 0 to p pin is assumed to account for most of the precipitation needed to saturate the canopy s in conjunction with a small fraction of ep of partially wetted canopy as in eq 7 7 b 0 b in p k p

loss model in power fashion in this single realization of horton s eq 1 the ilm coefficient values ep bi n and g 0 convoluting into the linear function depicted by the i vs p relationship for ipm ep decays rapidly over p or over t of importance is how g varies from the linear to the power decaying functions this issue is key to understand the amount of h devoted to evaporate wet canopy during the duration of p most rains in most forests over the world occur in the absence of direct sunlight because of overcast conditions hence sensible heat h must be responsible for er during the storm then er assessments with this or by any other model must be explained as a function of h if not then the question remains where does the energy to evaporate wet canopy comes from eqs 11 and 13 display two forms the decaying function of ep over p or t takes in different forests climates and rainfall conditions the assumption of a decaying exponential function of ep over p may hold correct for most rains anteceded by warm canopy biomass conditions advected h into the forest maintains ep during the duration of a storm should the g coefficient be small in ilm or is absent in ipm that is the power decaying function predicts the abatement of local and advected h over p or over t and the absence or a notorious reduction of advected h the s and ep functions when transformed from the p to the t scale would take one of the many forms depicted by eqs 2 and 3 respectively and these forms vary between forests climates and rainfall attributes the decaying ep over p functions has many different

evaporate wet canopy as the rate of i diminishes with the rate of p the eleven individual trees of td with c 1 0 probably reported large errors in the measurements of p th and sf that pushed upwards the slope of the i vs p relationship although 11 trees are sufficient to consider the alternate hypothesis of the relative importance of advected energy in tropical dry forests increasing ep in

storms for all four forests had been previously proposed and reported in several i investigations in mexico veliz chavez et al 2014 návar 2017 2019a b the 250 mm storms in 24 h duration had been recorded in several hurricanes that have made landfall with mexico in the past using the proposed model as a function of precipitation and as a function of time ep rates for average statistics for

decays exponentially over time for both models pointing to the rapid transformation of h into le of wet canopies fig 6 as predicted by the model the gamma function eq 3 would fit well derived er rates

please also note that e should be evaluated from pin to the end of the storm individual in storm evaporation rates n 3616 as a function of time are depicted in fig 7 it is difficult to make a statement of the lower or higher er when contrasted with the resulting values using the linear or the power versions of the model however maximum e values do not exceed 2 3 mm h 1 with a grand average

they account for by 70 of the annual precipitation large deviations would be produced for single large storms due in part to errors in the assessment and evaluation of the i components therefore most case studies should include whenever possible an important number of large storms in order to test whether the linear or power functions would fit better the i vs p relationship this is a matter of further research as the selection of the equation has a strong influence on the description of the available energy used to evaporate wet canopy the physical model description defines whether advected h controls er over the duration of the storm and it appears advected h limits er for most rains for most forests in mexico 4 discussion model assumptions the proposed model assumes i i ep and s are a function of only p ii ep is not a function of other e g meteorological factors such as relative humidity air temperature and wind speed forest canopy variables such as leaf area branch area bark roughness among others or rainfall features such as intensity duration depth iii one single realization of i ep s characterizes all forest all rain conditions and all climates all these factors concern with ep and s and as a consequence on i however the model is a good first approximation and several likely scenarios can be derived as an important portion approximately 70 of the i variance was preliminarily attributed to p the canopy storage s values vary as a function of leaf area index lai leaf bark type and thickness vertical projected canopy area among other canopy factors herwitz 1987 li et al 2015 iida et al 2017 návar 2019a b er on the other side is a function of s the energy available in the forest and climate and rainfall factors rutter et al 1971 large s values usually exhibit larger wetted canopy area accessible for evaporation afternoon rains in dry climates would probably evaporate the highest volumes of intercepted rainfall in contrast to winter morning storms therefore the assumptions made for the development of this model could become some limitations for some forests as for example the er tendency over time may start from 0 early in the storm in sparse forest after or during the filling of s in the same way the filling of s could start very high at the rain onset in forest with large leaf area index and decay or keep increasing over time these are issues that require some further revisions to be better understand and extract the most common tendencies with the goal of increasing precision in further model refinement the role of the major sources of variation forest canopies climates and rain features on these common relationships of ep and s over p or over t must also be carefully investigated in future forest interception experiments model performance the proposed model was able to successfully simulate cumulative as well as individual storm interception loss this finding provides important insights into how well the linear and power equations can be disentangled into s and ep when s and ep are a function of p the model reproduces precisely both the linear and power equations with only three coefficients for the linear version b0 bin pin and a constant value g 0 0001 for the power version the model requires of only k pin and g 1 the g 1 value has a mean standard deviation n of 0 32 0 065 n 44 and it does not distribute normal p w 0 0001 it varies as a function of the forest unfortunately none of the coefficients c pin s predicts well g 1 for all forests neither for each individual forest using the proposed model s values vary from 5 to 30 of p and e values from 70 to 95 of p depending on the forest rainfall and climate conditions the advantage of this approach is the evaluation of the i component independent of rainfall duration and rainfall intensity evaporation et trunk storage st free throughfall p stemflow pt drainage partitioning pd or canopy drip ds the proposed model provides consistent i assessments as it reproduces well the linear or power equations it provides unbiased i evaluations that are important in the quantification of the water balance budget of forests or watersheds it also delivers e values that are important in the evaluation of the role forests play on the climate system the proposed model is easily transformed as a function of time to provide the evaporation rate er the total evaporation during the storm e or the average evaporation rate for any time interval during the storm e of importance is how the two formulations depicts consistently well the gamma function with different er parameters pointing out at the relative importance of the role local and advected h play on i for each of the four forest communities although návar 2019a compiled approximately 700 i case studies no statistical contrasts between linear and power equations were found and they should be conducted whenever possible and the selected equation would better depict er as a function of time the proposed model estimated e values with an average of 1 73 0 77 n 3616 mm h 1 this figure is smaller than previously anticipated values using other empirical approaches for example using the same dataset the gash 1979 empirical equation e bin r resulted in an average standard deviation n of 2 00 0 96 n 44 mm h 1 návar 2019b návar 2019a developed a second independent model based on extending drip equations to empirically evaluate e and recorded a grand average standard deviation n of 1 91 1 0 n 1238 mm h 1 evaluated e values remain high when contrasted with other more physical measurements based on the assessment of the energy balance budget approach the modified penman monteith reference equation described in monteith 1982 rutter et al 1971 gash et al 1978 1995 and liu 1997 consistently yields e 0 8 mm h 1 in many i investigations rutter et al 1971 gash morton 1978 gash 1979 gash et al 1980 1995 singh and szeicz 1979 stewart 1979 pearce et al 1980 valente et al 1997 liu 1997 schellekens et al 1999 average estimates of 0 23 mm h 1 miralles et al 2010 or 0 31 mm h 1 n 63 s 0 23 návar 2019b had been reported similar small e assessments have been evaluated using some modifications of the eddy covariance methodology to overcome problems when sensors are wet czikowski and fitzjarrald 2009 the wet bulb approach has been found to yield consistent small e assessments for individual isolated well ventilated trees using simple diffusion equations and e has to be increased by a factor of up to 138 in contrast to the values calculated by the modified penman monteith fao reference equation pereira et al 2016 the evaluation of the major components of e accounting for other major energy sources the aerodynamic exchange the downward heat flux by the cooling process of evaporation aerodynamic conductance that increase precision had been proposed that will rise e in contrast to the conventional energy balance budget approaches considering these additional sources of energy e rates could rise to approximately 1 0 mm h 1 schellekens et al 1999 holwerda et al 2010 van dijk et al 2015 for many extra tropical forests where average values had been usually estimated as 0 05 e 0 80 miralles et al 2010 návar 2019b advected h from the air aloft from surrounding landscapes as well as from the ground may account for an additional 0 20 mm h 1 of e schellekens et al 1999 holwerda et al 2010 guevara escobar et al 2007 saito et al 2013 the physical transport and partial evaporation of rain splash droplets from canopies when rainfall drops strike the canopy could be more important in the transfer of energy between canopies and the atmosphere empirical evaluations had predicted increments of at least an additional 0 20 mm h 1 of e for each 10 mm h 1 of r in several forests dunin et al 1988 bandeira brasil et al 2018 návar 2019a b murakami 2006 herbst et al 2008 dunkerley 2008 2009 van dijk et al 2015 tokay and short 1996 jackson 2000 murakami 2006 2007 saito et al 2013 horman et al 1996 herbst et al 2008 klingaman et al 2007 improved assessments using the recommendations of van dijk et al 2015 would eventually lead to more precisely physical evaluations of e for many forests the difference between these physical assessments energy available to evaporate wet canopy and the empirical evaluations of e would account for the contribution of other physical processes explaining the high e values droplets or fine spry rain splash produced when striking the canopy may be carried away by wind evaporated at the canopy atmosphere interface or remain suspended in the air could be accounted for in s or er and in i these issues must be further investigated in many forests to complete the water balance of forest interception these subjects are of paramount importance in quantifying the contribution of forests to regulate the climate system and the recycle of local precipitation model applications although results from this study must be treated with caution as a single realization for all forests for all rainfalls for all climates may not hold correct several applications can be extracted as a first approximation this research emphasizes the need to further clarify the appropriateness of the linear or power equations when statistically predicting i as a function of p in future investigations the correct physical interpretation of the role advected h plays in i requires of strong statistical equations that can be derived with data that include the measurement of i components across the full scope of common rainfall events in the forest of interest these preliminarily investigations point the model in linear form redistributes er over the duration of the storm while the model in power fashion forecasts large er values early in the storm and declines rapidly as the storm progresses these findings appear to be applicable for forests where advection of h is important in the former while the energy stored in the canopy and the early abatement appears to be more important in the later process mesic forests tmc and t had more i case investigations where the power fitted better and more xeric a s and td forests reported the power version of the model fitted only in a few cases the i vs p relationship the consistency of these findings support xeric forests would accumulate more solar energy in tree aboveground biomass than more mesic forests due to high insolation coupled with high day time temperatures and small transpiration rates local and advected h maintains high er values over the duration of the local convective short duration rains in dry forests other sources of variation in micro climate conditions such as wind speed wind direction topography aspect among others as well as rainfall features of which the most important could be the area covered by the storm may explain the variability in the fitness of the power and linear versions of the model 5 conclusions this report presents a novel method for simulating forest interception i and its components the canopy storage s and the evaporation rate er during the storm as an aid to quantify the role of i on the water balance and the climate system the benefits of the novel technique are fourfold first the method provides independent and unbiased i s and ep assessments as a function of precipitation or as a function of rainfall duration second the method reproduces very well the conventional regression equations and therefore provides compatible cumulative and individual i assessments for four forests of mexico third the method allows for comparing linear and power versions of the model to provide an important number of forms of the weibull and gamma functions that predict s and er respectively over time fourth the method provides further insights into the physics of the er and can be easily modified to derive drip rates and the components throughfall and stemflow the approach can be integrated into larger scale models as it simulates well individual as well as cumulative i values improvements of the model may be through better measurements and assessments of s and er using other independent approaches and how these coefficients vary in order to better project better the inherent inter storm i variability author contribution

5636,interception loss i the amount of precipitation intercepted by forests and evaporated back to the atmosphere plays important roles in the water balance and the climate system by removing approximately one quarter of the annual precipitation from the terrestrial hydrologic cycle models are critical for simulating i and its components the canopy storage s and the evaporation rate during

montane cloud tmc n 6 temperate t n 4 and tropical dry td n 21 forests were used to calibrate the model results showed that even though the model was constructed independently of the common equations it isolates s er and ep and reproduces remarkably well the conventional empirical linear and power regression equations of i vs p and simulates unbiased cumulative and individual storm i values when coupled with the function of rainfall duration the model projects lower er rates than previously anticipated using other empirical approaches statistical analysis revealed the likely oscillation of the i vs p relationship between the linear and power functions depending on rainfall canopy and climate conditions the model represents an important advancement in forest hydrology by analytically isolating s er ep and simulating compatible i values for individual as well as for assemblages of storms it further clarifies the large variability of er and helps to explain the role of forests in

i models muzylo et al 2009 although the most frequently tested ones are the sparse gash et al 1995 the rutter et al 1971 and the liu 1997 models muzylo et al 2009 návar 2019b muzylo et al 2009 and návar 2019b summarized individual model applications and performance amongst the physical models the rutter type models solve a running balance of rainfall canopy and trunk storage drainage and evaporation over the course of a storm rutter et al 1971 gash type models are analytical interpretations of the rutter type models gash 1979 the návar 2019a model develops further the horton 1919

deriving interception loss i p t h s f considering i e s where e is the total evaporation during rainfall other kinds of models must focus explicitly on simulating these i components however these types of models are scarce in the scientific literature the physically based models of rutter gash and liu receive most consideration in i studies muzylo et al 2009 návar 2019b these models however require of at least four different coefficients such as s er mean rainfall intensity r drainage rate d and the slope regression coefficients for interception components as a function of p throughfall

methods commonly evaluate er by solving the energy balance of forest canopies three physically based techniques quantify the energy balance with the goal of evaluating er total evaporation during the storm e e r t or the average evaporation rate during the storm e t e r t are derived with the energy balance approaches energy balance budget methods commonly account for the amount of sensible heat h or net radiation transformed into the latent heat of evaporation le of wet canopy nonetheless net radiation is negligible small because e r occurs during the storm these methods are expensive and complex hence the vast majority of i case studies do not report the average in storm er the modified fao penman monteith reference evaporation equation rutter et al 1971 gash morton 1978 gash 1979

evaluate er however er assessments using either the physical or empirical methods most often result in large deviations van dijk et al 2015 návar 2019b several improvements have been recommended to evaluate more precisely available h in forests that will eventually lead to increased er values beyond commonly reported figures e 0 80 mm h 1 miralles et al 2010 návar 2019b as a consequence there is an urgent need of developing testing and simplifying i models to provide further insights into the amount of energy devoted to evaporate intercepted rainfall the performance at several temporal scales is a second limitation of most i models reported in the scientific literature the rutter and gash models originally developed and calibrated for approximately monthly time steps achieve poor accuracy in individual storms schellekens et al 1999 holwerda et al 2010 linhoss and siegert 2016 klingaman et al 2007 muzylo et al 2009 linhoss and siegert 2016 and návar 2017 2019b successfully compared the gash liu rutter mulder mulder 1985 and wimo hörmann et al 1996 models in predicting cumulative interception but tested models were less accurate in predicting i for individual storm events although the model of massman 1983 improved model predictions for individual storms it was tested in a single tree given the limitations of the models available as well as the importance of i in the water cycle and the climate system the objectives of this study were to i develop an independent model based on analytically breaking the i components s and er ii compare the model based on its fitness to cumulative and event based measured data of i and iii identify the strengths and limitations of the proposed model this novel technique provides a robust and objective contrast with other physically based i models and identify specific areas for model development and improvement in future work 2 materials and methods the proposed model interception loss can be broken into s and er these i components can be modeled using analytical techniques in statistical analysis by developing further the horton s 1919 eq 1 1 i t 0 t f s t t 0 t f e r t i s e where t0 tf time to start and time to end precipitation t respectively s rate of canopy wetting l t 1 eq 1 hypothesizes storm depth and duration controls s and er different forms of s and er are likely in different storms climates and forests and s and er are independent of the lag time between storms návar 2017 proposed the mathematical functions s and er over time could take many forms depending on the forest and environmental climate

parameters of the gamma function α β form and scale parameters of the weibull function dt tf t0 these fundamental equations require hourly measurements of s and er that are not commonly measured during the course of each storm in most reported i investigations návar 2019a in a parallel report published in agricultural and forest meteorology developed an independent approach to solve eq 1 that yields s and er using extended drip equations with excellent preliminary expectations this report presents an alternate solution based on breaking the i vs p relationship to independently derive s and er the weibull and gamma functions can be described as a function of p that is the model can be developed by assuming p actually is the most influential parameter to dictate er making no considerations of the preconception that er is in fact a drying process that must respond primarily to air temperature humidity wind speed among other climatic factors consistent with the statements of zabret et al 2018 then i can be derived as a function of p as follows 4 i p f p 0 k p p exp q p c p p f p t 0 p p α exp p β β α 1 γ α 1 p where po pf start and end of precipitation l the development of eq 4 transforms the conventional er l t 1 into ep l l 1 that is a function of p linear or power regression equations have commonly described the i vs p relationship zinke 1967 the linear equation has the intercept b0 and the slope bin coefficients which have commonly positive values pointing to the rapid wetting of the canopy and the linear function of ep over p these statements consistently match the positive relationship of er vs r proposed earlier by gash 1979 as r f p for most storms the power equation has usually slope values 1 0 pointing to the rapid increase and a quick decay function of ep vs p close observation of i data as a function of p for many forests in small depth storms the absolute depth of i is small p 5 mm and tends to curve in medium size depth storms 5 p 15 mm for several temperate and boreal forests indicating the likely lack of energy to evaporate intercepted precipitation návar 2019a once the canopy has been wetted the linear and power equations suggest quasi constant and decaying ep rates respectively as a monotonically increasing function of p for most forests these statements and a graphical representation of the model are depicted in fig 1 approximately 99 and 1 of compiled n 700 i studies report the linear ile and power ipe equations fit the i vs p relationship respectively návar 2019a however studies testing the

of equation eq 5 often results in higher and eq 6 in smaller predicted i values for small depth and may be for large depth storms as well the model assumes precipitation wets most of the canopy before the intersection of these two equations and ep accounts for the remaining fraction of i then solving eqs 5 and 6 for p yields the intersection of p where these equations converge pin the depth of p from p 0 to p pin is assumed to account for most of the precipitation needed to saturate the canopy s in conjunction with a small fraction of ep of partially wetted canopy as in eq 7 7 b 0 b in p k p

loss model in power fashion in this single realization of horton s eq 1 the ilm coefficient values ep bi n and g 0 convoluting into the linear function depicted by the i vs p relationship for ipm ep decays rapidly over p or over t of importance is how g varies from the linear to the power decaying functions this issue is key to understand the amount of h devoted to evaporate wet canopy during the duration of p most rains in most forests over the world occur in the absence of direct sunlight because of overcast conditions hence sensible heat h must be responsible for er during the storm then er assessments with this or by any other model must be explained as a function of h if not then the question remains where does the energy to evaporate wet canopy comes from eqs 11 and 13 display two forms the decaying function of ep over p or t takes in different forests climates and rainfall conditions the assumption of a decaying exponential function of ep over p may hold correct for most rains anteceded by warm canopy biomass conditions advected h into the forest maintains ep during the duration of a storm should the g coefficient be small in ilm or is absent in ipm that is the power decaying function predicts the abatement of local and advected h over p or over t and the absence or a notorious reduction of advected h the s and ep functions when transformed from the p to the t scale would take one of the many forms depicted by eqs 2 and 3 respectively and these forms vary between forests climates and rainfall attributes the decaying ep over p functions has many different

td1 c 1 31a and smallest in t c 0 53c all i case studies with the exception of 11 individual trees of td recorded bin 1 0 pointing to the importance of the rapid exhaustion of local energy to evaporate wet canopy as the rate of i diminishes with the rate of p the eleven individual trees of td with c 1 0 probably reported large errors in the measurements of p th and sf that pushed upwards the slope of the i vs p relationship although 11 trees are sufficient to consider the alternate hypothesis of the relative importance of advected energy in tropical dry forests increasing ep in contrast to the local energy sources that is the i rate increases with an increase of the rate of p the intersection of the linear and power equations pin varied significantly between forests p 0 025 tmc recorded larger pin 2 24a t pin 1 66b td pin 1 09b and a s pin 0 90b forests smaller average values of importance is the relative small difference of the pin and b0 values of the linear regression equations of a s forests b0 0 48 0 83 stressing early in the storm most rain is used to wet the canopy of these forests as proposed in the model the assumption s results from the integration of eq 9

when assuming ep bin that is bin can be considered a constant coefficient value as it declines at the most only 3 from an average value of bin 0 187 to an average value of bin 0 183 in the largest depth storms with 24 h duration the small g value indicated the influx of advected energy is quasi constant during the duration of most storms in dry and seasonal dry forests of mexico ipm resulted in

deviations 4 for a s and td forests again these me errors are found only in a few investigations of model performance and i pm predicted consistently well unbiased i assessments when contrasted with the linear model for t and tmc forests but the i pm tended to produce slightly biased i assessments for a s and td forests fig 2 stressing the appropriateness of the i lm rather than the i pm for these forests that is the climate of dry forests a s and td appear to be featured by sufficient sensible heat to evaporate wet canopies for large depth storms in contrast to the climate of more mesic t and tmc forests model performance for individual storms using the nse estimator the model performance at the scale of individual case study simulations for each of the two versions of the model is depicted in fig 3 statistically similar average nse values between ilm and ipm illustrate the compatibility between the linear and power functions to predict i the minimum and maximum nse values were 0 40 and 0 90 with average standard deviation n values of 0 59 0 25 n 88 although the i lm consistently produced average nse standard deviation estimators of 0 65 0 22 higher than the i pm estimators with average of 0 54 0 29 the duncan s test showed means were not significantly different p 0 28 i pm did a rather poor job simulating interception loss for storms with p 50 mm for all forests the model reproduces well the linear and power regression equations the proposed model reproduced significantly well compatible linear and power equations p 0 0001 for all case studies for each forest an example of these versions of the model fitted to empirical raw data in addition to the linear and power equations is depicted in fig 4 the example shows all data for all i case studies for each forest in these examples the power model deviates slightly from the linear model only in t tmc and a s and significantly in td forests evaporation rates using extended drip equations návar 2019a b reported the transformation of p to a time scale produces compatible rainfall duration and rainfall intensity statistics for most forests in mexico with the following power equations for summer rains t 6 4p 0

storms for all four forests had been previously proposed and reported in several i investigations in mexico veliz chavez et al 2014 návar 2017 2019a b the 250 mm storms in 24 h duration had been recorded in several hurricanes that have made landfall with mexico in the past using the proposed model as a function of precipitation and as a function of time ep rates for average statistics for each of the four forests of mexico are reported in fig 6 fig 6 depicts the large variability the difference between the linear and power versions of the model of ep as a function of p expected in these four forest communities in ipm ep values decay in the following order td a s t and tmc forests points of rupture of these four examples for each forest show the depth of p when local energy is being wasted and advected h controls ep note the large rate of decay in tmc a s and td unlike in t forests in these examples the proposed model reproduces remarkably well similar e values for both versions of the model as the integration of ep over p yields similar ep statistics for all four forests predicted er l t 1 as a function of rainfall duration starts from 0 increases to a maximum and decays exponentially over time for both models pointing to the rapid transformation of h into le of wet canopies fig 6 as predicted by the model the gamma function eq 3 would fit well derived er rates as a function of rainfall duration time for all four forests for both the linear and power versions of the model note e g the difference between the black lines of both upper ilm and lower ipm figures representing the wide range of er mm h 1 rates expected in t forests of mexico these er values vary from 1 3 to 4 0 mm h 1 early in the storm and decay to nearly 0 mm h 1 in ipm in 60 min storms please also note that e should be evaluated from pin to the end of the storm individual in storm evaporation rates n 3616 as a function of time are depicted in fig 7 it is difficult to make a statement of the lower or higher er when contrasted with the resulting values using the linear or the power versions of the model however maximum e values do not exceed 2 3 mm h 1 with a grand average standard deviation n of 1 73 0 77 n 3616 mm h 1 e varied significantly between forests p 0 0001 versions of the model p 0 0001 and for version of the model forests p 0 0001 duncan s test showed the

for tmc yields an average e 2 14a and for ilm for t an average of e 1 02b for 3 hour duration storms and p 35 mm the coefficient of determination was significantly similar for the linear r2 0 48a c i

they account for by 70 of the annual precipitation large deviations would be produced for single large storms due in part to errors in the assessment and evaluation of the i components therefore most case studies should include whenever possible an important number of large storms in order to test whether the linear or power functions would fit better the i vs p relationship this is a matter of further research as the selection of the equation has a strong influence on the description of the available energy used to evaporate wet canopy the physical model description defines whether advected h controls er over the duration of the storm and it appears advected h limits er for most rains for most forests in mexico 4 discussion model assumptions the proposed model assumes i i ep and s are a function of only p ii ep is not a function of other e g meteorological factors such as relative humidity air temperature and wind speed forest canopy variables such as leaf area branch area bark roughness among others or rainfall features such as intensity duration depth iii one single realization of i ep s characterizes all forest all rain conditions and all climates all these factors concern with ep and s and as a consequence on i however the model is a good first approximation and several likely scenarios can be derived as an important portion approximately 70 of the i variance was preliminarily attributed to p the canopy storage s values vary as a function of leaf area index lai leaf bark type and thickness vertical projected canopy area among other canopy factors herwitz 1987 li et al 2015 iida et al 2017 návar 2019a b er on the other side is a function of s the energy available in the forest and climate and rainfall factors rutter et al 1971 large s values usually exhibit larger wetted canopy area accessible for evaporation afternoon rains in dry climates would probably evaporate the highest volumes of intercepted rainfall in contrast to winter morning storms therefore the assumptions made for the development of this model could become some limitations for some forests as for example the er tendency over time may start from 0 early in the storm in sparse forest after or during the filling of s in the same way the filling of s could start very high at the rain onset in forest with large leaf area index and decay or keep increasing over time these are issues that require some further revisions to be better understand and extract the most common tendencies with the goal of increasing precision in further model refinement the role of the major sources of variation forest canopies climates and rain features on these common relationships of ep and s over p or over t must also be carefully investigated in future forest interception experiments model performance the proposed model was able to successfully simulate cumulative as well as individual storm interception loss this finding provides important insights into how well the linear and power equations can be disentangled into s and ep when s and ep are a function of p the model reproduces precisely both the linear and power equations with only three coefficients for the linear version b0 bin pin and a constant value g 0 0001 for the power version the model requires of only k pin and g 1 the g 1 value has a mean standard deviation n of 0 32 0 065 n 44 and it does not distribute normal p w 0 0001 it varies as a function of the forest unfortunately none of the coefficients c pin s predicts well g 1 for all forests neither for each individual forest using the proposed model s values vary from 5 to 30 of p and e values from 70 to 95 of p depending on the forest rainfall and climate conditions the advantage of this approach is the evaluation of the i component independent of rainfall duration and rainfall intensity evaporation et trunk storage st free throughfall p stemflow pt drainage partitioning pd or canopy drip ds the proposed model provides consistent i assessments as it reproduces well the linear or power equations it provides unbiased i evaluations that are important in the quantification of the water balance budget of forests or watersheds it also delivers e values that are important in the evaluation of the role forests play on the climate system the proposed model is easily transformed as a function of time to provide the evaporation rate er the total evaporation during the storm e or the average evaporation rate for any time interval during the storm e of importance is how the two formulations depicts consistently well the gamma function with different er parameters pointing out at the relative importance of the role local and advected h play on i for each of the four forest communities although návar 2019a compiled approximately 700 i case studies no statistical contrasts between linear and power equations were found and they should be conducted whenever possible and the selected equation would better depict er as a function of time the proposed model estimated e values with an average of 1 73 0 77 n 3616 mm h 1 this figure is smaller than previously anticipated values using other empirical approaches for example using the same dataset the gash 1979 empirical equation e bin r resulted in an average standard deviation n of 2 00 0 96 n 44 mm h 1 návar 2019b návar 2019a developed a second independent model based on extending drip equations to empirically evaluate e and recorded a grand average standard deviation n of 1 91 1 0 n 1238 mm h 1 evaluated e values remain high when contrasted with other more physical measurements based on the assessment of the energy balance budget approach the modified penman monteith reference equation described in monteith 1982 rutter et al 1971 gash et al 1978 1995 and liu 1997 consistently yields e 0 8 mm h 1 in many i investigations rutter et al 1971 gash morton 1978 gash 1979 gash et al 1980 1995 singh and szeicz 1979 stewart 1979 pearce et al 1980 valente et al 1997 liu 1997 schellekens et al 1999 average estimates of 0 23 mm h 1 miralles et al 2010 or 0 31 mm h 1 n 63 s 0 23 návar 2019b had been reported similar small e assessments have been evaluated using some modifications of the eddy covariance methodology to overcome problems when sensors are wet czikowski and fitzjarrald 2009 the wet bulb approach has been found to yield consistent small e assessments for individual isolated well ventilated trees using simple diffusion equations and e has to be increased by a factor of up to 138 in contrast to the values calculated by the modified penman monteith fao reference equation pereira et al 2016 the evaluation of the major components of e accounting for other major energy sources the aerodynamic exchange the downward heat flux by the cooling process of evaporation aerodynamic conductance that increase precision had been proposed that will rise e in contrast to the conventional energy balance budget approaches considering these additional sources of energy e rates could rise to approximately 1 0 mm h 1 schellekens et al 1999 holwerda et al 2010 van dijk et al 2015 for many extra tropical forests where average values had been usually estimated as 0 05 e 0 80 miralles et al 2010 návar 2019b advected h from the air aloft from surrounding landscapes as well as from the ground may account for an additional 0 20 mm h 1 of e schellekens et al 1999 holwerda et al 2010 guevara escobar et al 2007 saito et al 2013 the physical transport and partial evaporation of rain splash droplets from canopies when rainfall drops strike the canopy could be more important in the transfer of energy between canopies and the atmosphere empirical evaluations had predicted increments of at least an additional 0 20 mm h 1 of e for each 10 mm h 1 of r in several forests dunin et al 1988 bandeira brasil et al 2018 návar 2019a b murakami 2006 herbst et al 2008 dunkerley 2008 2009 van dijk et al 2015 tokay and short 1996 jackson 2000 murakami 2006 2007 saito et al 2013 horman et al 1996 herbst et al 2008 klingaman et al 2007 improved assessments using the recommendations of van dijk et al 2015 would eventually lead to more precisely physical evaluations of e for many forests the difference between these physical assessments energy available to evaporate wet canopy and the empirical evaluations of e would account for the contribution of other physical processes explaining the high e values droplets or fine spry rain splash produced when striking the canopy may be carried away by wind evaporated at the canopy atmosphere interface or remain suspended in the air could be accounted for in s or er and in i these issues must be further investigated in many forests to complete the water balance of forest interception these subjects are of paramount importance in quantifying the contribution of forests to regulate the climate system and the recycle of local precipitation model applications although results from this study must be treated with caution as a single realization for all forests for all rainfalls for all climates may not hold correct several applications can be extracted as a first approximation this research emphasizes the need to further clarify the appropriateness of the linear or power equations when statistically predicting i as a function of p in future investigations the correct physical interpretation of the role advected h plays in i requires of strong statistical equations that can be derived with data that include the measurement of i components across the full scope of common rainfall events in the forest of interest these preliminarily investigations point the model in linear form redistributes er over the duration of the storm while the model in power fashion forecasts large er values early in the storm and declines rapidly as the storm progresses these findings appear to be applicable for forests where advection of h is important in the former while the energy stored in the canopy and the early abatement appears to be more important in the later process mesic forests tmc and t had more i case investigations where the power fitted better and more xeric a s and td forests reported the power version of the model fitted only in a few cases the i vs p relationship the consistency of these findings support xeric forests would accumulate more solar energy in tree aboveground biomass than more mesic forests due to high insolation coupled with high day time temperatures and small transpiration rates local and advected h maintains high er values over the duration of the local convective short duration rains in dry forests other sources of variation in micro climate conditions such as wind speed wind direction topography aspect among others as well as rainfall features of which the most important could be the area covered by the storm may explain the variability in the fitness of the power and linear versions of the model 5 conclusions this report presents a novel method for simulating forest interception i and its components the canopy storage s and the evaporation rate er during the storm as an aid to quantify the role of i on the water balance and the climate system the benefits of the novel technique are fourfold first the method provides independent and unbiased i s and ep assessments as a function of precipitation or as a function of rainfall duration second the method reproduces very well the conventional regression equations and therefore provides compatible cumulative and individual i assessments for four forests of mexico third the method allows for comparing linear and power versions of the model to provide an important number of forms of the weibull and gamma functions that predict s and er respectively over time fourth the method provides further insights into the physics of the er and can be easily modified to derive drip rates and the components throughfall and stemflow the approach can be integrated into larger scale models as it simulates well individual as well as cumulative i values improvements of the model may be through better measurements and assessments of s and er using other independent approaches and how these coefficients vary in order to better project better the inherent inter storm i variability author contribution

5637,soil moisture plays a critical role as an essential component of the global water resources by regulating mass and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere quantification of these exchange processes requires accurate characterization and simulation of soil water movement physically based models pbms and machine learning methods mlms can both be used in soil moisture simulation however their performances in soil water simulation have only been compared in a limited number of cases moreover almost all of them are conducted in field studies each with fixed soil initial condition and boundary condition here we developed three artificial neural network ann frameworks and made clearer and more systematic comparisons between them and a pbm ross numerical model solving richards equation and parameter estimation using a data assimilation approach iterative ensemble smoother ross ies in synthetic and real world conditions compared with the anns ross ies is more significantly affected by physical model uncertainties such as soil heterogeneity initial and boundary conditions while both methods are affected by observation noise for ross ies the errors from boundary conditions and hydraulic parameter conceptualization are found to be more prominent than that of observation noise and therefore are suggested to be identified first meanwhile the anns have difficulty in simulating the peaks and troughs of the soil water time series as well as in situations where the soil moisture is constantly saturated anns yield a superior simulation when the nonlinear relationship between the response variables and driving data is weak while the performance of ross ies is governed by the prior soil hydraulic information in addition ross ies approach requires much higher computational cost than the anns ann ms performs best among the three ann based machine learning models and demonstrates great data mining ability and robustness against overfitting keywords soil moisture machine learning data assimilation physically based model artificial neural network 1 introduction soil moisture sm plays a fundamental role in many research areas such as hydrologic cycle horton 1933 kuczera 1983 wooldridge et al 2003 environmental sciences hillel 1998 ibekwe et al 2018 and agriculture adamchuk et al 2004 basche et al 2016 toumi et al 2016 as it controls mass energy and terrestrial biogeochemical exchange processes between the ground surface and the atmospheric boundary layer quantification of these processes requires detailed characterization of soil water movement numerous physically based models pbms have been developed for soil water simulation and prediction ju et al 2018 saxton et al 1986 song et al 2014 šimůnek et al 2012 during the last decades which are comprehensible and useful under many different management options freeze and harlan 1969 however pbms have several inherent limitations for example much work and time need to be paid for model development and calibration zhang et al 2016 2018b and uncertainty including model and data leads to the poor performance of the calibrated models yoon et al 2011 in addition in most hydrologic processes our understanding in pbm is far from perfect due to the unsolved difficulties such as the high degree of temporal and spatial variability highly nonlinear relationship between model parameters and state variables and conflicting spatial and temporal scales of model settings asce 2000a as a result a model may be too simplified to simulate complicated physical processes while being too complicated to have generalization capabilities prasad et al 2019 or even completely wrong compared to the reality leading to considerable uncertainty in the pbm simulation the contradiction between model simulation and reality is exactly reflected by the famous statement from box and draper 1987 quote all models are wrong but some are useful machine learning modeling mlm is an alternative to model simulation which is a data driven technique and has been applied widely in hydrology solomatine and ostfeld 2008 elshorbagy et al 2010a 2010b made a concise and comprehensive review of various mlm techniques and conducted experimental investigation among different models proposed by mcculloch and pitts 1943 artificial neural network ann is one of the most widely used machine learning techniques and can be employed as universal functional estimators since there are no prior assumptions about model conceptualization for the problem under study e g following a gaussian distribution van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 1998 2018c zhang and schaap 2017 the review of issues and applications of anns in hydrology can be found in maier and dandy 2000 asce 2000a 2000b reported that anns could be a robust alternative tool for modeling many of the nonlinear hydrologic processes such as rainfall runoff streamflow groundwater recharge precipitation and solute transport in porous media however there are several inherent issues for such techniques such as lack of transparency overfitting and difficulties in reproducing explaining the results elshorbagy et al 2010b although ann has been widely used in surface hydrology its application in modeling sm has only been reported in a limited number of studies elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 prasad et al 2019 koekkoek and booltink 1999 developed and evaluated neural networks based functions to predict soil water retention characteristics and reported that the neural networks performed somewhat better than previous regression functions but the improvements were not significant elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 predicted soil moisture by utilizing precipitation air temperature net radiation and soil temperature at different depths and found that their estimation results are largely influenced by the structure and formation of the soil covers zou et al 2010 compared the backpropagation ann with a classical statistical technique and suggested that the ann could be used as an alternative method in forecasting soil water and salt dynamics under a stationary condition tzeng et al 2012 proposed a recurrent dynamic learning neural network to estimate sm evolution by rainfall forcing data and indicated that the proposed method is a promising tool for estimating sm from hourly precipitation kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 reported that anns are flexible tools capable of predicting root zone soil moisture with acceptable accuracy but the transferability of the model appears to be limited to the same geographic region matei et al 2017 used the ann to predict sm for the next day based on meteorological data from weather stations pan et al 2017 concluded that the ann could be an efficient alternative to assimilate remote sensing sm data for shallow root zone soil water retrieval in addition recent advances in heuristic optimization methods have been proposed alongside with anns e g support vector machine liu et al 2008 genetic algorithm huang et al 2010 particle swarm algorithm yang and zhang 2016 discrete wavelet decomposition and particle swarm algorithm yang et al 2017 and committee ensemble model prasad et al 2018 given the strengths and limitations of pbms and mlms comparative studies between these two approaches have been recently carried out on the groundwater level and sm prediction lamorski et al 2013 compared the prediction of long term daily sm at different depths using the variably saturated flow model hydrus 1d and support vector machine svm they found that svm can be used as an alternative method for water content prediction with acceptable accuracy that is comparable to that of the pbm mohanty et al 2013 compared groundwater simulation code i e modflow and ann for simulating groundwater depths in an alluvial aquifer system and indicated that ann model provides a better prediction of groundwater dynamics karandish and šimůnek 2016 compared the effectiveness of hydrus 2d with various mlms i e multiple linear regressions adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems and svms for simulating sm over time under different water stress conditions they found that the mlms could be used favorably for the prediction of sm especially when data are scarce while pbm is probably a better choice when adequate data are available existing literature that compares pbm and mlm for sm modelling has only considered pbms with simple parameter calibration while recent advances in data assimilation methods have made better use of observational data some studies only highlight a preference of pbm or mlm without discussing the contributing factors to their strengths and weaknesses the impact of the various sources of uncertainties that impact sm modelling has not been considered in these studies since the real world field conditions are fixed as a result their conclusions are generally problem specific therefore a thorough comparison between pbm and mlm using a series of synthetic cases can highlight and generalize the strengths and limitations of both methods for predicting sm dynamics the contribution of this work is threefold first the sm simulations and predictions of the pbm and mlm are systematically compared for the prediction of daily long term sm second the pbm is coupled with a data assimilation method iterative ensemble smoother ies chen and oliver 2013 which can invert the hydraulic parameters automatically and three ann variants are developed as typical mlms for the sm prediction third our investigation focuses mainly on the comparisons of various synthetic cases in order to provide a more transparent comparison between the two methods in this paper we first present the theoretical background of the pbm and mlm used for this study in section 2 the framework of the model parameters and setup are described in section 3 we then discuss the results of the synthetic and real world experiments in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methods 2 1 physically based model pbm the forward physical model to describe variably saturated water flow is based on one dimensional richards equations richards 1931 written as 1 θ t z k h 1 h z where θ denotes the volumetric soil moisture t is time t h is the pressure head l positive or zero for saturated soil and negative for unsaturated soil z represents the vertical coordinate l positive upward k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is a function of h or θ relationships between θ h and k h are required to solve the richards equation the van genuchten muelem vg model van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 is used to describe these relationships as 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k θ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θs and θr are respectively saturated and residual sms α 1 l and n are empirical parameters related to the first and the second moments of the pore size density function respectively m

equation the initial condition in this study is set by specifying the sm profile the upper boundary condition is specified as a meteorological boundary state dependent boundary condition see šimůnek et al 2012 and the bottom boundary condition is a free drainage boundary the ross method which is a non iterative numerical scheme is used in the present study which reduces computational time without sacrificing computational accuracy crevoisier et al 2009 ross 2003 varado et al 2006 zha et al 2019 this study uses the extension of zha et al 2013 2014 to the ross method for heterogeneous soils which uses soil water pressure instead of kirchhoff potential since the latter is not continuous across the heterogeneous soil interface ross and bristow 1990 suk and park 2019 the ross method is coupled with the ensemble smoother es to estimate hydraulic parameters in eqs 2 and 3 es was first proposed by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 and has been used increasingly in hydrology to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters bailey and baù 2010 2012 ju et al 2018 li et al 2018 es takes the global states space and time into consideration in the parameter estimation thus effectively keeping the overall consistency of parameters and state variables over time emerick and reynolds 2013 history matching can be achieved with iterations bailey and baù 2010 the combination of the levenberg marquardt iteration algorithm and es ies is suitable for the nonlinear problem chen and oliver 2013 in each iteration the ies can be divided into two steps the first step can be described as follows 4

learning model mlm in this study the feed forward neural network optimized using the backpropagation algorithm is employed for model comparison which is a typical machine learning model and has been successfully utilized in hydrology maier and dandy 2000 mohanty et al 2013 schaap et al 2001 backpropagation can significantly improve convergence and has been verified as an excellent solution for nonlinear and complex problems rumelhart et al 1985 zhang et al 2007 in general an ann is composed of one input layer several hidden layers and one output layer one hidden layer is sufficient for ann fig 1 to approximate any complex nonlinear function with any desired accuracy theoretically cybenko 1989 hornik et al 1989 the configuration has been successfully used in many studies asce 2000a minns and hall 1996 mohanty et al 2013 pan et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017 yoon et al 2011 zhang et al 1998 2018a zou et al 2010 and is therefore selected for this study the numbers of nodes for the input and output layers are equal to the numbers of input and output data respectively while the number of hidden nodes is given based on the performance of the ann too many hidden nodes may lead to overfitting the details of the number of nodes in each layer are given in section 3 2 2 the mathematical framework of hidden and output layers in our ann is written as 11 o g xw b where x is the input vector size c m c denotes the batch size m is the number of the neurons in the previous layer o is the output vector size c n n is the number of the neurons in the current layer w is the matrix size m n that represents the connection weight mapping x to o b is a vector size c n named the bias the g is the activation function in the current layer the activation function consists of a relu function the formula is g x max 0 x in the hidden layer and a linear function in the output layer which is widely used in the previous work elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 maier and dandy 2000 a dropout layer is added between the hidden layer and the output layer which can make the weighting matrix w smaller to prevent the ann from overfitting srivastava et al 2014 the ann is trained using the stochastic gradient descent method the loss function minimizes the mean summation of squares of the network errors mse which is written as 12 mse 1 k i k o i o i 2 where o i and o i are respectively observed and simulated target state variables i e sm values k is the number of o 2 3 performance metrics and evaluation the data used for machine learning or calibration prediction are generally divided into two subsets i e calibration training and validation testing to validate the accuracy of sm derived from the ross ies and ann the root mean square error rmse a useful error index when large errors are particularly undesirable is mainly used besides the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 is also calculated the metrics above are presented as follows 13 rmse 1 k i 1 k s i t s i a 2 14 nse 1 i 1 k s i t s i a 2 i 1 k s i t s t 2 where st is the reference or real world sm while sa is the calculated value sm unless otherwise stated and k is the number of s the best fit between observed and simulated sm under ideal conditions would yield rmse 0 and nse 1 to further validate the stability of model performance the standard deviation index sd is introduced and written as 15 sd i e m i m 2 e where m denotes the above metrics i e rmse nse and e is the number of repeated cases higher sd means less stability of the model performance 3 data descriptions and model setup 3 1 description of data the reference data used for the comparison of ross ies and ann in the synthetic cases are based on the output from the reference model by running ross model with correct input i e perfectly known initial condition boundary condition soil hydraulic parameters etc the details of which are given in section 3 3 which is similar in the work of kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 the numerical ross model simulates the flow in a one dimensional vertical soil column which is discretized into 21 nodes with a uniform interval of 5 cm the allowed maximum absolute effective saturation variation per time step δs e max is 0 5 zha et al 2013 and the allowed maximum time step δt max is 0 1 day δt max governs the time step size under most situations unless the flow dynamic is fast e g early stage infiltration the bottom boundary is set as a free drainage boundary and the forcing at the upper boundary bare soil is governed by the atmospheric boundary with precipitation p mm d and potential evapotranspiration etp mm d fig 2 shows four kinds of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration etp from humid h semi humid sh semi arid sa and arid a regions in china resampled from two year data in order to cover more different short term meteorological scenarios e g rainy and dry seasons the climatic scenario from sh region in china typical continental monsoon climate is selected the uniform initial soil moisture is set as 0 2 the above condition is the default condition used in this study unless otherwise stated the reference models in different cases have homogeneous or heterogeneous columns for the homogeneous soil column the hydraulic parameters are set based on the soil parameter statistics given in carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 for the heterogeneous soil column we use the mean and variance based on the values of loam soil in table 2 to generate the random fields of hydraulic parameters α n and ks simulated by the reference model three sms at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m are selected for ann training and ross calibration as shown in fig 2 the entire simulation period is divided into two equally sized parts in order to capture a wide variety of features in the calibration training data the first one is from the 1st day to the 120th day used for model calibration or commonly referred as training in the anns while the other part is from the 121st day to the 240th day used for model validation or testing in the anns 3 2 model settings 3 2 1 model settings for ross ies for ross ies three kinds of hydraulic parameters i e α n and ks are assumed unknown and are given initial guess values based on experience and available information table 2 and we assume they follow logarithmic normal distribution during data assimilation θs and θr are not optimized and are given the same as the reference values in the heterogeneous soil cases the 21 elements are assigned with uniform θs and θr while at the beginning of data assimilation realizations of α n and ks are generated by a random field generator with the mean and the variance given in table 2 a correlation length of 0 25 m and assuming an exponential covariance function 3 2 2 model settings for ann in this study the initial weights of ann are generated using the truncated normal distribution n 0 0 01 which is truncated at twice sd above or below the mean the initial biases are set as 0 during training the dropout rate is set as 0 2 to avoid overfitting which means 20 of the randomly sampled units are dropped during training during validation the dropout rate is set as 0 to use a single unthinned network that has smaller weights three target depths of θ observations at day j 1 and the potential evapotranspiration etp and the precipitation p at day j are selected as the input variables the three target depths of θ at day j are the output variables therefore the numbers of nodes in the input and output layers are 5 and 3 a total of 50 nodes are set in the hidden layer the number of nodes in the ann is not changed unless otherwise stated during testing only the initial condition on the first day j 0 is directly provided as initial conditions and all the other θ values are predicted values which are used as inputs for subsequent days we have developed three variants of ann for a more thorough comparison the benchmark ann bk is compared against two other anns i e ann bk with multi steps ann ms and ann ms with more computational cost and more complicated structure ann ms x in ann bk we use the θ data on the previous day and the potential evapotranspiration etp and the precipitation p at the current day as the input variables in ann ms we include more preceding information as input variables specifically the three target depths of θ from day j 5 to day j 1 and the potential evapotranspiration etp and the precipitation p from day j 4 to day j are selected as the input variables to predict θ at day j in order to investigate the potential of ann ms we double the number of nodes in the hidden layer to 100 in ann ms x the iteration number of ann bk and ann ms are set as 100 000 while that of ann ms x is set as 1 000 000 the setting of most hyper parameters is determined by trial and error through preliminary experiments more details in the supplementary material 3 3 factor setting the comparison of two methods with different error sources is complex here are the details about the cases we design a total of seven different cases bk uic on lbe me le hc see table 4 in which the reference models and our biased knowledge differ the reference model as mentioned before is our synthetic reality and the resultant reference solution is used to drive data assimilation and machine learning models respectively our knowledge biases reflect our imperfect description of the real situation which may introduce error during data assimilation and machine learning model construction for instance in the lbe case the true lower boundary condition is a free drainage boundary at 1 5 m while in ross ies model we set a free drainage boundary at 1 0 m to reflect our knowledge bias however this bias does not affect the setting of ann models since they do not require the boundary condition in contrast on case which has significant observation error affects the results of both ross ies and anns since their calibration training involves data among these cases bk and hc denote the situation that no knowledge bias exists while the true soil column is heterogeneous and homogeneous in bk and hc respectively the intra comparison of model performance e g rmse of sms from the model calibration validation output compared to the reference solution based on bk values within pbm and mlm models indicates the influences of model conceptualization error or data noise while the inter comparison of rmses between the corresponding cases reflects the differences in the ability of pbm and mlm models to handle model conceptualization error or observation noise for the case with uncertain initial condition uic we set the initial guess sm at the 1st day as 0 21 while the reference value is 0 2 for the observation noise on case we add noise following a normal distribution of n 0 0 0004 to the three target depths of sm data during calibration training as shown in fig 3 to consider the lower boundary error lbe we first extend the 1 m soil column to 1 5 m using the same discretization and parameter setting of the 1 m soil column in the reference model then the values of α n and ks in the extended 0 5 m soil column are divided by 2 1 25 and 100 respectively which can be regarded as very low permeability soil listed in table 3 for the meteorological error me we use biased parameters in the hargreaves equation to bring error in calculating etp the hargreaves equation is written as 16 e t p c r a t max t min e t max t min 2 t where ra is the equivalent of the extraterrestrial radiation mm d computed according to allen et al 1998 while tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures c c e and t are the original empirical coefficients which are advised as 0 0023 0 5 and 17 8 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 these uncalibrated values are used in the model setting of ross ies the tmax and tmin time series which are necessary for the computation of etp are from miyun station in beijing of china during 2011 2012 the calibrated values of c e and t in the reference model are given as 0 0008 0 74 and 37 9 based on hu et al 2011 for the anns we do not explicitly calculate etp but instead we directly use ra tmax and tmin as input variables the input variables for the two kinds of models are shown in fig 4 soil material layer conceptualization error le occurs when the heterogeneity in soil structure is not correctly noted the soil column in the reference model is heterogeneous as the default setting while in ross ies the forward model ross regards it as a homogeneous column a list of the error sources can be found in table 4 3 4 implementation details in this research we adopted the intel xeon gold 6130 multi core cpu as the high performance computing hardware a dell t7920 high performance work station hosts the hardware computational costs are much different over the two kinds of methods the execution time for ann bk and ann ms is only about 10 min and half an hour for each implementation respectively the running time of ann ms x takes about 2 3 h however ross ies is much more computationally intensive and it requires about 12 h for each case run most of the cost in ross ies is spent on the solution of the inverse of kalman gain k in eq 6 furthermore the computational time of ross ies increases significantly as the number of observations and unknown parameters increases 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of performance with different sources of errors the rmse and nse of sms using the ross ies and anns with different sources of errors are shown in fig 5 for the anns the relatively low rmse or relatively high nse during training indicates that the information hidden in the training data has been fully mined in most cases the rmse and nse improve from ann bk ann ms to ann ms x moreover there is a greater difference between ann bk and ann ms than that between ann ms and ann ms x the results show that the ann with a more complicated structure and more computational cost can achieve better performance but their marginal advantage gradually diminishes with increasing model complexity and computational cost in addition in the on and me cases ann ms performs best during testing it indicates that overfitting somewhat exists which shows the drawback of an over complicated or over simplified framework besides the variability between repeated cases generally decreases with increasing ann complexity which suggests that the stability of ann ms can be improved further although ross ies has the powerful ability to identify the gaussian observation error and outlive the model bias serious parameter compensation problem exists that is the effects of model conceptualization and observation errors are implicitly reflected in the estimated parameters which could deviate significantly from the truth moreover parameter compensation can bring adverse effects to the soil moisture modeling for instance in the lbe case the rmse or nse during calibration using ross ies is much lower higher than that during validation when the prior knowledge is seriously biased the well calibrated ross ies during calibration cannot achieve the same accuracy during validation the results during validation perform much worse than that during calibration due to the similar pattern of rmse and nse the further discussion below is focused on rmse 4 1 1 uncertainty of heterogeneity soils are inherently heterogeneous at multiple scales zha et al 2019 which significantly alters the sm state for the anns the heterogeneity brings little effect some effect may result from more complicated nonlinearity of flow in the heterogeneity column and rmse even gets better compared with the homogeneous hc case see fig 5 where rmses are 0 0166 and 0 0160 respectively for ann ms however as for ross ies the effect becomes more complicated first ross ies needs much more unknown hydraulic parameters to describe the heterogeneity of soil thus significantly increase the complexity of the model as well as the difficulty to calibrate them the effect is apparent by comparing the hc and bk cases according to fig 5 rmses in prediction in the bk case with heterogeneous soil are much larger than that in the homogeneous case with soil loam 0 00041 versus 0 00003 though both of them are small second the wrong description for the heterogeneity in soil structure soil material layer conceptualization error results in the rmse of ross ies in the le case increasing significantly rmse of sm using ross ies in this case 0 0081 during training and 0 0089 during testing are approximately 20 times larger than those in the bk case the values are close to the results of the anns in the bk case 0 0145 of ann ms x during testing the comparison of parameter estimations between cases hc bk and le is shown in fig 6 in the bk case although the estimated parameters are close to the reference parameters at the shallow depths relatively significant differences between the estimated parameters and the reference parameters still exist at deeper depths due to the lack of observation at the lower part of soil profile fig 6 a c and e in the le case the estimated parameters are just within the range of reference parameters fig 6 a c and e the difference between the estimated and the reference parameters via ross ies is significantly different from that in the bk case in the hc case there is already little difference between the reference parameters and the estimations after 7 iterations fig 6 b d and f the wrong description of heterogeneity in the le case or even the uncertainty of parameters in the bk case with heterogeneous soil cannot be neglected fig 7 shows rmses between estimated sm via ross ies and reference sm in cases hc bk and le at different depths from cases hc bk to le rmse gradually increases in case bk similar to the performance of parameter estimation fig 6 significantly different performances via ross ies between the observed locations and locations far from observations e g 0 8 m 0 9 m and 1 0 m exist which further affects the water balance in the soil column 4 1 2 uncertainty of initial condition uic according to fig 5 the results of anns in the uic case are only slightly different from those in the bk case specifically the performance of ann bk is even better in the uic case than that in the bk case from 0 015 to 0 016 during training and from 0 022 to 0 025 during testing while the performances of ann ms and ann ms x slightly deteriorate the results indicate that the uncertainty of the initial condition has little effect on the simulation using the anns in this study since the uncertainty of initial condition only exists in one of the 120 training samples the lack of stability could be the main reason for the better performance of ann bk for ross ies uic has a relatively strong influence on its performance the rmses during training and testing increase about two times due to the presence of uic compared relative to the bk case different from the anns the uncertainty of initial condition can affect the model calibration and thus can have a substantial impact on the sm prediction for subsequent simulations yu et al 2019 4 1 3 observation noise on according to fig 5 the effect of observation noise on anns is the most significant since ann training relies on observations while model settings usually do not affect ann unlike other error sources ann ms performs best during training and testing among the three anns in this case for further investigation the temporal sms simulated by the anns and reference observations with noise at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m during training are compared in fig 8 from ann bk ann ms to ann ms x the rmses between the simulation and the observation with noise rmsenoise during training gradually decrease compared with the rmses between the simulation and the observation without noise during training see fig 5 where ann ms performs best the overfitting in ann ms x and the insufficient data mining in ann bk are believed to be the main reason the results during testing ann ms performs best see fig 5 also demonstrate the importance of the appropriate balance between model complexity and training calibration cost as for ross ies the rmses between the simulation and the observation without noise during calibration and prediction are much less than the absolute error of observation noise which shows the ability of ies to eliminate the noise of gaussian distribution however compared with the rmse in the bk case no observation noise the rmse between the simulation and the observation increases significantly from 0 00017 to 0 00451 during training and from 0 00041 to 0 01032 during testing the results may be worse when the noise is non gaussian both results for the anns and ross ies indicate that it is essential for us to improve the observation accuracy to gain a better simulation 4 1 4 lower boundary error lbe the anns do not require the description of the lower boundary condition so the wrong knowledge of the lower boundary has little effect on the results see fig 5 compared with the bk case for ross ies both rmses during training and testing increase but the rmse during training is much smaller than that during testing the results indicate that ross ies fits the observations very well however because of the wrong physical model conceptualization a wrong interpretation of the information contained in the observation has been made to calibrate the model and thus lead to poor predictions it is demonstrated in fig 5 that the rmse of the lbe case using ross ies during validation increases much more substantially with regard to calibration compared with other errors the comparison between the reference and estimated parameters is shown in fig 9 the difference between the reference and estimated parameters near the 1 m interface is larger than that close to the soil surface which can be attributed to the lack of observation constraint at the deep depths and the wrong knowledge of the lower boundary conditions thus we should carefully examine our model assumptions prior to data processing and model calibration 4 1 5 meteorological error me as fig 4 shows the meteorological condition during calibration training is similar to that during validation testing which indicates that scenarios during calibration training are representative for the anns the rmse increase during testing is second only to the performance in the on case see fig 5 and sds of ann bk and ann ms are larger than those in the other cases although they avoid the error from the false potential evapotranspiration by directly using the raw meteorological data ra tmax and tmin besides ann ms performs best during testing among the three anns as in the on case the results indicate that more complicated inputs tend to bring a negative effect on the prediction of the sm or even result in overfitting for ross ies the comparison of sms simulated with the reference hydraulic parameters using the true and the false potential evapotranspiration values is shown in fig 10 rmses between them rmseme during calibration and validation are both larger than rmses see fig 5 between the estimated sm using the false potential evapotranspiration with the estimated hydraulic parameters and the reference sm which implies the existence of the parameter compensation besides compared with rmse caused by the observation noise rmseon 0 02 see section 3 3 in the on case rmseme of sms 0 0062 during calibration see fig 10 caused by the uncertainty of the meteorological condition is insignificant rmseon is 3 2 times larger than rmseme during training and 3 5 times larger during testing from 0 02 to 0 057 see fig 10 however rmse in the on case during testing is only 2 7 times larger than rmse in me case see fig 5 0 0103 versus 0 00379 it shows that meteorological data error also brings significant effect on ross ies besides the effect of observation noise can be alleviated with sufficient observations while the effect of the meteorological data error is hard to eliminate the accurate evaluation of evapotranspiration has been a persisting challenge the estimation varies among different models and is difficult to observe directly in a field case therefore the meteorological data can be another significant error source in ross ies unlike ross ies the anns use the meteorological data directly which could be regarded as a significant advantage of them 4 2 discussion on the synthetic experiments our results show that many model conceptualization errors have insignificant effects on the anns since these assumptions are not or only partially applicable to them while both model conceptualization errors and data errors have significant effects on ross ies specifically the heterogeneity in the soil structure and the boundary conditions do not affect the anns the uncertainty of initial condition shows a minor effect since the initial condition is a special observation data at the beginning and it is involved in the ann training the observation noise is the only error source that shows a relatively significant effect on the anns for ross ies the uncertainty of initial condition can affect sm prediction over a long period ross ies has the powerful ability to eliminate the observation noise of gaussian distribution but the effect cannot be eliminated entirely the heterogeneity in the soil structure can increase the difficulty of estimation and may result in layer conceptualization error thus making much deteriorated result the lower boundary error and the error of meteorological information also show strong effects on the performance of ross ies and can make a significant difference in the performance between calibration and prediction based on these findings we should prioritize minimizing model conceptualization error for ross ies the comparisons of some other factors show some limitations of anns and performances of the two methods under a few additional scenarios see the supplementary material the anns are not very good at extrapolation since they offer no information about the internal state and dynamics as pointed in the early work of minns and hall 1996 they perform poorly in predicting peak and trough values of sm mainly for the insufficient data of the extrema and need more historical information to make a better sm prediction when the soil is constantly saturated for a long time the two methods have different performances when simulating different soil water dynamics under different soil textures and climate scenarios the anns tend to performs well if the response variables and the driving data have a relatively linear relationship in the synthetic cases the metrics of ross ies are generally better than those of the anns which is partially attributed to the fact that the reference data are generated by ross model and the initial guess values of hydraulic parameters are relatively close to the reference parameters however there are many other factors that may influence model performance in real world conditions and larger model structural error zhang et al 2019 can bring more adverse effects on ross ies in contrast except for some neural network parameters ann involves very few assumptions from another point of view ross ies can make better and more reliable simulations than anns if a reasonable physical model can be built to achieve this it is desirable to collect as much information related to model conceptualization as possible moreover we need to be conservative during the model conceptualization and should not underestimate model conceptualization uncertainty for instance if the lower boundary condition is uncertain instead of a subjective assertion it is suggested to try different possibilities and obtain a most likely one based on observation data current pbm studies have appreciated the parameter uncertainties while the uncertainties from other aspects e g boundary conditions may need more attention bayesian model averaging neuman et al 2012 recently developed framework is potentially a good choice to identify the model conceptualization uncertainty based on data 4 3 application to field data at chatham michigan the performance of the two methods under real world conditions is compared in an sm gauging site the test gauging site 46 3345 n 86 92 w is located in chatham a village in rock river township of alger county michigan the meteorological data used to derive the potential evapotranspiration etp by the penman monteith method are retrieved from the power data access viewer dav web mapping application the precipitation p and observations of sm belong to the u s climate reference network there are observations of sm at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 5 m two years of data from 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2016 are selected the data during the first year are used for training calibration while the data during the second year are used for testing validation for ross ies one year warm up using the method of yu et al 2019 is implemented to alleviate the effects of the uncertain initial condition the settings of ross ies model is similar to that in the bk case based on prior knowledge on the physical state of the system θr is set as 0 0426 at the depth of 0 0 3 m and 0 0434 at the depth of 0 3 1 m while θs is set as 0 49 at the depth of 0 0 3 m and 0 43 at the depth of 0 3 1 m based on the data from the test site the comparison of rmse and nse between the anns and ross ies in sm simulation is shown in fig 11 for both methods the rmses and nses of sm during training are acceptable 0 015 and 0 92 considering unknown observation errors in this field case we conclude that the information of training data has been properly utilized besides the performances of the anns are better than that of ross ies during both training and testing except ann bk while the latter requires a much higher computational cost the results show the great practicability of the anns the relative inferior performance of ies ross could be attributed to the imperfect prior knowledge of the site and uncertainties in model structure and parameterization e g the boundary error which were also not considered simultaneously in the synthetic case besides rmse decreases nse increases from ann bk ann ms and ann ms x during training while sd of ann bk is much larger and ann ms performs best among the three anns during testing they show the superiority in the framework of ann ms for data mining and avoidance of overfitting fig 12 shows more details about the meteorological condition and simulations of sm at different depths via ross ies and ann ms respectively compared with the synthetic cases there are more varieties of meteorological conditions during training in the field case which could also improve the performance of the anns however there are considerable misfits in the peak and trough regions and they contribute significantly to the overall performance of ann for ross ies the sm simulation during training and testing seems to be forced toward the mean of the observations since ies is a smoother 4 4 uncertainty and limitation of current work it should be noted that there are some uncertainties and limitations of the current study the comparisons are conducted on a relatively short time series 240 days or two years which means the condition is somewhat stable over the entire time series and the nonstationary features of the sm are not considered a long representative dataset is necessary to train the ann model that is the training data need to cover the scenarios during testing validation prediction which is one of the key requirements for anns to obtain a reasonable prediction of peak and valley sm values anns will obtain unacceptable results if the prediction stage has extreme scenarios not covered in the training data kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 our study only focuses on the simulation of sms at three shallow depths in close proximity to one another which has a relatively strong correlation in space and may favor the use of anns besides more types of information e g labels of time and space can also be considered to be contained in the input of anns uncertainty of initial condition boundary error and observation noise of different levels or combination of them are not investigated although we expect our major conclusions to hold some differences could emerge if different hyper parameters e g mesh size the time step size of ross the weight factor in activation function of ann etc are assigned to the pbm and mlm and these parameters are given based on experience or brief preliminary investigations we believe that choice of different physical models e g ross hydrus simunek et al 2005 swap van dam and feddes 2000 should results in similar simulation results since they share the same governing equations in contrast the machine learning methods have a variety of choices e g ann svm asefa et al 2006 gill et al 2006 random forest friedel et al 2020 and their performances may vary significantly for different scenarios which deserves further investigation 5 conclusions in comparison with previous studies our work makes clearer and more systematical comparisons between the mlm and the pbm with data assimilation through a series of synthetic cases the effects of various sources of errors such as the initial states the observation noise the upper and lower boundary conditions and the heterogeneity in soil structure are discussed the effects of other factors e g the spatial interpolation extrapolation soil texture materials are investigated and given in the supplementary material lastly the anns and ross ies are applied in a field example the major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the anns have few model assumptions and they are seldom affected by model assumptions while physical model conceptualization the soil heterogeneity boundary conditions has a significant effect on ross ies besides the uncertainty of the initial condition also cannot be negligible for ross ies both methods are affected by observation noise for ross ies we should give priority to avoid the error from boundary conditions and hydraulic parameters compared with the uncertainty of initial condition and observation noise 2 the anns have difficulty in simulating around the peaks including constantly saturated values and troughs of the sm time series besides the anns prefer a less nonlinear relationship between response variables e g sm and the driving data e g precipitation evapotranspiration and preceding sm while ross ies is affected by the prior soil hydraulic information 3 the computational cost of ross ies is much larger than that of the anns among the three variants of ann ann ms is recommended for its data mining ability and robustness against overfitting 4 in the field example without the detailed and accurate prior knowledge e g boundary condition source sink term heterogeneity in soil structure better simulation and prediction can be achieved using the mlm but it has difficulty in obtaining the sm profile or the soil water flow dynamic due to

as soil pressure head can be conducted in a similar framework besides a deeper understanding of merits and demerits of pbm and mlm will encourage their wider utilization and further improvement in

5637,soil moisture plays a critical role as an essential component of the global water resources by regulating mass and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere quantification of these exchange processes requires accurate characterization and simulation of soil water movement physically based models pbms and machine learning methods mlms can both be used in soil moisture simulation however their performances in soil water simulation have only been compared in a limited number of cases moreover almost all of them are conducted in field studies each with fixed soil initial condition and boundary condition here we developed three artificial neural network ann frameworks and made clearer and more systematic comparisons between them and a pbm ross numerical model solving richards equation and parameter estimation using a data assimilation approach iterative ensemble smoother ross ies in synthetic and real world conditions compared with the anns ross ies is more significantly affected by physical model uncertainties such as soil heterogeneity initial and boundary conditions while both methods are affected by observation noise for ross ies the errors from boundary conditions and hydraulic parameter conceptualization are found to be more prominent than that of observation noise and therefore are suggested to be identified first meanwhile the anns have difficulty in simulating the peaks and troughs of the soil water time series as well as in situations where the soil moisture is constantly saturated anns yield a superior simulation when the nonlinear relationship between the response variables and driving data is weak while the performance of ross ies is governed by the prior soil hydraulic information in addition ross ies approach requires much higher computational cost than the anns ann ms performs best among the three ann based machine learning models and demonstrates great data mining ability and robustness against overfitting keywords soil moisture machine learning data assimilation physically based model artificial neural network 1 introduction soil moisture sm plays a fundamental role in many research areas such as hydrologic cycle horton 1933 kuczera 1983 wooldridge et al 2003 environmental sciences hillel 1998 ibekwe et al 2018 and agriculture adamchuk et al 2004 basche et al 2016 toumi et al 2016 as it controls mass energy and terrestrial biogeochemical exchange processes between the ground surface and the atmospheric boundary layer quantification of these processes requires detailed characterization of soil water movement numerous physically based models pbms have been developed for soil water simulation and prediction ju et al 2018 saxton et al 1986 song et al 2014 šimůnek et al 2012 during the last decades which are comprehensible and useful under many different management options freeze and harlan 1969 however pbms have several inherent limitations for example much work and time need to be paid for model development and calibration zhang et al 2016 2018b and uncertainty including model and data leads to the poor performance of the calibrated models yoon et al 2011 in addition in most hydrologic processes our understanding in pbm is far from perfect due to the unsolved difficulties such as the high degree of temporal and spatial variability highly nonlinear relationship between model parameters and state variables and conflicting spatial and temporal scales of model settings asce 2000a as a result a model may be too simplified to simulate complicated physical processes while being too complicated to have generalization capabilities prasad et al 2019 or even completely wrong compared to the reality leading to considerable uncertainty in the pbm simulation the contradiction between model simulation and reality is exactly reflected by the famous statement from box and draper 1987 quote all models are wrong but some are useful machine learning modeling mlm is an alternative to model simulation which is a data driven technique and has been applied widely in hydrology solomatine and ostfeld 2008 elshorbagy et al 2010a 2010b made a concise and comprehensive review of various mlm techniques and conducted experimental investigation among different models proposed by mcculloch and pitts 1943 artificial neural network ann is one of the most widely used machine learning techniques and can be employed as universal functional estimators since there are no prior assumptions about model conceptualization for the problem under study e g following a gaussian distribution van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 1998 2018c zhang and schaap 2017 the review of issues and applications of anns in hydrology can be found in maier and dandy 2000 asce 2000a 2000b reported that anns could be a robust alternative tool for modeling many of the nonlinear hydrologic processes such as rainfall runoff streamflow groundwater recharge precipitation and solute transport in porous media however there are several inherent issues for such techniques such as lack of transparency overfitting and difficulties in reproducing explaining the results elshorbagy et al 2010b although ann has been widely used in surface hydrology its application in modeling sm has only been reported in a limited number of studies elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 prasad et al 2019 koekkoek and booltink 1999 developed and evaluated neural networks based functions to predict soil water retention characteristics and reported that the neural networks performed somewhat better than previous regression functions but the improvements were not significant elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 predicted soil moisture by utilizing precipitation air temperature net radiation and soil temperature at different depths and found that their estimation results are largely influenced by the structure and formation of the soil covers zou et al 2010 compared the backpropagation ann with a classical statistical technique and suggested that the ann could be used as an alternative method in forecasting soil water and salt dynamics under a stationary condition tzeng et al 2012 proposed a recurrent dynamic learning neural network to estimate sm evolution by rainfall forcing data and indicated that the proposed method is a promising tool for estimating sm from hourly precipitation kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 reported that anns are flexible tools capable of predicting root zone soil moisture with acceptable accuracy but the transferability of the model appears to be limited to the same geographic region matei et al 2017 used the ann to predict sm for the next day based on meteorological data from weather stations pan et al 2017 concluded that the ann could be an efficient alternative to assimilate remote sensing sm data for shallow root zone soil water retrieval in addition recent advances in heuristic optimization methods have been proposed alongside with anns e g support vector machine liu et al 2008 genetic algorithm huang et al 2010 particle swarm algorithm yang and zhang 2016 discrete wavelet decomposition and particle swarm algorithm yang et al 2017 and committee ensemble model prasad et al 2018 given the strengths and limitations of pbms and mlms comparative studies between these two approaches have been recently carried out on the groundwater level and sm prediction lamorski et al 2013 compared the prediction of long term daily sm at different depths using the variably saturated flow model hydrus 1d and support vector machine svm they found that svm can be used as an alternative method for water content prediction with acceptable accuracy that is comparable to that of the pbm mohanty et al 2013 compared groundwater simulation code i e modflow and ann for simulating groundwater depths in an alluvial aquifer system and indicated that ann model provides a better prediction of groundwater dynamics karandish and šimůnek 2016 compared the effectiveness of hydrus 2d with various mlms i e multiple linear regressions adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems and svms for simulating sm over time under different water stress conditions they found that the mlms could be used favorably for the prediction of sm especially when data are scarce while pbm is probably a better choice when adequate data are available existing literature that compares pbm and mlm for sm modelling has only considered pbms with simple parameter calibration while recent advances in data assimilation methods have made better use of observational data some studies only highlight a preference of pbm or mlm without discussing the contributing factors to their strengths and weaknesses the impact of the various sources of uncertainties that impact sm modelling has not been considered in these studies since the real world field conditions are fixed as a result their conclusions are generally problem specific therefore a thorough comparison between pbm and mlm using a series of synthetic cases can highlight and generalize the strengths and limitations of both methods for predicting sm dynamics the contribution of this work is threefold first the sm simulations and predictions of the pbm and mlm are systematically compared for the prediction of daily long term sm second the pbm is coupled with a data assimilation method iterative ensemble smoother ies chen and oliver 2013 which can invert the hydraulic parameters automatically and three ann variants are developed as typical mlms for the sm prediction third our investigation focuses mainly on the comparisons of various synthetic cases in order to provide a more transparent comparison between the two methods in this paper we first present the theoretical background of the pbm and mlm used for this study in section 2 the framework of the model parameters and setup are described in section 3 we then discuss the results of the synthetic and real world experiments in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methods 2 1 physically based model pbm the forward physical model to describe variably saturated water flow is based on one dimensional richards equations richards 1931 written as 1 θ t z k h 1 h z where θ denotes the volumetric soil moisture t is time t h is the pressure head l positive or zero for saturated soil and negative for unsaturated soil z represents the vertical coordinate l positive upward k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is a function of h or θ relationships between θ h and k h are required to solve the richards equation the van genuchten muelem vg model van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 is used to describe these relationships as 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 3 k θ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θs and θr are respectively saturated and residual sms α 1 l and n are empirical parameters related to the first and the second moments of the pore size density function respectively m is related to n by m 1 1 n n 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and se is the degree of effective saturation se θ θr θs θr initial and boundary conditions are necessary to solve richards equation the initial condition in this study is set by specifying the sm profile the upper boundary condition is specified as a meteorological boundary state dependent boundary condition see šimůnek et al 2012 and the bottom boundary condition is a free drainage boundary the ross method which is a non iterative numerical scheme is used in the present study which reduces computational time without sacrificing computational accuracy crevoisier et al 2009 ross 2003 varado et al 2006 zha et al 2019 this study uses the extension of zha et al 2013 2014 to the ross method for heterogeneous soils which uses soil water pressure instead of kirchhoff potential since the latter is not continuous across the heterogeneous soil interface ross and bristow 1990 suk and park 2019 the ross method is coupled with the ensemble smoother es to estimate hydraulic parameters in eqs 2 and 3 es was first proposed by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 and has been used increasingly in hydrology to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters bailey and baù 2010 2012 ju et al 2018 li et al 2018 es takes the global states space and time into consideration in the parameter estimation thus effectively keeping the overall consistency of parameters and state variables over time emerick and reynolds 2013 history matching can be achieved with iterations bailey and baù 2010 the combination of the levenberg marquardt iteration algorithm and es ies is suitable for the nonlinear problem chen and oliver 2013 in each iteration the ies can be divided into two steps the first step can be described as follows 4 d f y u where d is a state vector with size q r q is the number of total sm values over time and vertical profile simulated by the forward model and r is the number of realizations in monte carlo simulation the model parameters of the ensemble are stored in vector y with size p r p is the number of unknown hydraulic parameters u size u r u is the number of weather data denotes external forcing such as the meteorological conditions while ƒ signifies the non linear discrete transition function in order to extract the selected simulated values to match with the observations the operator matrix h size s q only containing values of 0 and 1 is defined as 5 d hd where d is a state vector with size s r s less than q is the number of the entire selected observations over selected times and depths consisting of the counterpart of the actual spatiotemporal observation data at the second step the observational data are employed to update the model parameter vector y as follows 6 y i 1 y i k i d uc d i where i represents the iteration step duc size s r is the perturbed observation of the entire actual observation data vector dobs the relationship between dobs and duc is presented as 7 d uc d obs ε where ε is the vector s r of independent white noise drawn from gaussian distribution n 0 rε with rε size s r in the measurements duc is supposed to be perturbed with sufficient spread according to burgers et al 1998 the analytical state vector at the current step is used to produce the next step forecast state vector in eq 4 the kalman gain k at iteration i is presented as 8 k i c i p i r λ i diag p i 1 where the observational error covariance matrix r size s s and the prior error auto covariance matrix p describes the correlation between different spatiotemporal observations and the prior error cross covariance c describes the relationship between model parameters and the state variables diag p is a stability matrix which is a diagonal matrix with the same diagonal elements as the maximum of diagonal elements of p λ is the dynamic stability factor the dynamic conversion of the gauss newton algorithm and gradient descent method can be achieved by adjusting λ for optimal estimations p and c can be described as 9 p i 1 r 1 j 1 r d i j d i d i j d i t 10 c i 1 r 1 j 1 r y i j y i d i j d i t where d j size s 1 is the element vector of d y j size p 1 is the element vector of y denotes the ensemble mean for convenience the physically based model i e the ross method with data assimilation using the iterative ensemble smoother is abbreviated as ross ies 2 2 machine learning model mlm in this study the feed forward neural network optimized using the backpropagation algorithm is employed for model comparison which is a typical machine learning model and has been successfully utilized in hydrology maier and dandy 2000 mohanty et al 2013 schaap et al 2001 backpropagation can significantly improve convergence and has been verified as an excellent solution for nonlinear and complex problems rumelhart et al 1985 zhang et al 2007 in general an ann is composed of one input layer several hidden layers and one output layer one hidden layer is sufficient for ann fig 1 to approximate any complex nonlinear function with any desired accuracy theoretically cybenko 1989 hornik et al 1989 the configuration has been successfully used in many studies asce 2000a minns and hall 1996 mohanty et al 2013 pan et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017 yoon et al 2011 zhang et al 1998 2018a zou et al 2010 and is therefore selected for this study the numbers of nodes for the input and output layers are equal to the numbers of input and output data respectively while the number of hidden nodes is given based on the performance of the ann too many hidden nodes may lead to overfitting the details of the number of nodes in each layer are given in section 3 2 2 the mathematical framework of hidden and output layers in our ann is written as 11 o g xw b where x is the input vector size c m c denotes the batch size m is the number of the neurons in the previous layer o is the output vector size c n n is the number of the neurons in the current layer w is the matrix size m n that represents the connection weight mapping x to o b is a vector size c n named the bias the g is the activation function in the current layer the activation function consists of a relu function the formula is g x max 0 x in the hidden layer and a linear function in the output layer which is widely used in the previous work elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 maier and dandy 2000 a dropout layer is added between the hidden layer and the output layer which can make the weighting matrix w smaller to prevent the ann from overfitting srivastava et al 2014 the ann is trained using the stochastic gradient descent method the loss function minimizes the mean summation of squares of the network errors mse which is written as 12 mse 1 k i k o i o i 2 where o i and o i are respectively observed and simulated target state variables i e sm values k is the number of o 2 3 performance metrics and evaluation the data used for machine learning or calibration prediction are generally divided into two subsets i e calibration training and validation testing to validate the accuracy of sm derived from the ross ies and ann the root mean square error rmse a useful error index when large errors are particularly undesirable is mainly used besides the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 is also calculated the metrics above are presented as follows 13 rmse 1 k i 1 k s i t s i a 2 14 nse 1 i 1 k s i t s i a 2 i 1 k s i t s t 2 where st is the reference or real world sm while sa is the calculated value sm unless otherwise stated and k is the number of s the best fit between observed and simulated sm under ideal conditions would yield rmse 0 and nse 1 to further validate the stability of model performance the standard deviation index sd is introduced and written as 15 sd i e m i m 2 e where m denotes the above metrics i e rmse nse and e is the number of repeated cases higher sd means less stability of the model performance 3 data descriptions and model setup 3 1 description of data the reference data used for the comparison of ross ies and ann in the synthetic cases are based on the output from the reference model by running ross model with correct input i e perfectly known initial condition boundary condition soil hydraulic parameters etc the details of which are given in section 3 3 which is similar in the work of kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 the numerical ross model simulates the flow in a one dimensional vertical soil column which is discretized into 21 nodes with a uniform interval of 5 cm the allowed maximum absolute effective saturation variation per time step δs e max is 0 5 zha et al 2013 and the allowed maximum time step δt max is 0 1 day δt max governs the time step size under most situations unless the flow dynamic is fast e g early stage infiltration the bottom boundary is set as a free drainage boundary and the forcing at the upper boundary bare soil is governed by the atmospheric boundary with precipitation p mm d and potential evapotranspiration etp mm d fig 2 shows four kinds of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration etp from humid h semi humid sh semi arid sa and arid a regions in china resampled from two year data in order to cover more different short term meteorological scenarios e g rainy and dry seasons the climatic scenario from sh region in china typical continental monsoon climate is selected the uniform initial soil moisture is set as 0 2 the above condition is the default condition used in this study unless otherwise stated the reference models in different cases have homogeneous or heterogeneous columns for the homogeneous soil column the hydraulic parameters are set based on the soil parameter statistics given in carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 for the heterogeneous soil column we use the mean and variance based on the values of loam soil in table 2 to generate the random fields of hydraulic parameters α n and ks simulated by the reference model three sms at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m are selected for ann training and ross calibration as shown in fig 2 the entire simulation period is divided into two equally sized parts in order to capture a wide variety of features in the calibration training data the first one is from the 1st day to the 120th day used for model calibration or commonly referred as training in the anns while the other part is from the 121st day to the 240th day used for model validation or testing in the anns 3 2 model settings 3 2 1 model settings for ross ies for ross ies three kinds of hydraulic parameters i e α n and ks are assumed unknown and are given initial guess values based on experience and available information table 2 and we assume they follow logarithmic normal distribution during data assimilation θs and θr are not optimized and are given the same as the reference values in the heterogeneous soil cases the 21 elements are assigned with uniform θs and θr while at the beginning of data assimilation realizations of α n and ks are generated by a random field generator with the mean and the variance given in table 2 a correlation length of 0 25 m and assuming an exponential covariance function 3 2 2 model settings for ann in this study the initial weights of ann are generated using the truncated normal distribution n 0 0 01 which is truncated at twice sd above or below the mean the initial biases are set as 0 during training the dropout rate is set as 0 2 to avoid overfitting which means 20 of the randomly sampled units are dropped during training during validation the dropout rate is set as 0 to use a single unthinned network that has smaller weights three target depths of θ observations at day j 1 and the potential evapotranspiration etp and the precipitation p at day j are selected as the input variables the three target depths of θ at day j are the output variables therefore the numbers of nodes in the input and output layers are 5 and 3 a total of 50 nodes are set in the hidden layer the number of nodes in the ann is not changed unless otherwise stated during testing only the initial condition on the first day j 0 is directly provided as initial conditions and all the other θ values are predicted values which are used as inputs for subsequent days we have developed three variants of ann for a more thorough comparison the benchmark ann bk is compared against two other anns i e ann bk with multi steps ann ms and ann ms with more computational cost and more complicated structure ann ms x in ann bk we use the θ data on the previous day and the potential evapotranspiration etp and the precipitation p at the current day as the input variables in ann ms we include more preceding information as input variables specifically the three target depths of θ from day j 5 to day j 1 and the potential evapotranspiration etp and the precipitation p from day j 4 to day j are selected as the input variables to predict θ at day j in order to investigate the potential of ann ms we double the number of nodes in the hidden layer to 100 in ann ms x the iteration number of ann bk and ann ms are set as 100 000 while that of ann ms x is set as 1 000 000 the setting of most hyper parameters is determined by trial and error through preliminary experiments more details in the supplementary material 3 3 factor setting the comparison of two methods with different error sources is complex here are the details about the cases we design a total of seven different cases bk uic on lbe me le hc see table 4 in which the reference models and our biased knowledge differ the reference model as mentioned before is our synthetic reality and the resultant reference solution is used to drive data assimilation and machine learning models respectively our knowledge biases reflect our imperfect description of the real situation which may introduce error during data assimilation and machine learning model construction for instance in the lbe case the true lower boundary condition is a free drainage boundary at 1 5 m while in ross ies model we set a free drainage boundary at 1 0 m to reflect our knowledge bias however this bias does not affect the setting of ann models since they do not require the boundary condition in contrast on case which has significant observation error affects the results of both ross ies and anns since their calibration training involves data among these cases bk and hc denote the situation that no knowledge bias exists while the true soil column is heterogeneous and homogeneous in bk and hc respectively the intra comparison of model performance e g rmse of sms from the model calibration validation output compared to the reference solution based on bk values within pbm and mlm models indicates the influences of model conceptualization error or data noise while the inter comparison of rmses between the corresponding cases reflects the differences in the ability of pbm and mlm models to handle model conceptualization error or observation noise for the case with uncertain initial condition uic we set the initial guess sm at the 1st day as 0 21 while the reference value is 0 2 for the observation noise on case we add noise following a normal distribution of n 0 0 0004 to the three target depths of sm data during calibration training as shown in fig 3 to consider the lower boundary error lbe we first extend the 1 m soil column to 1 5 m using the same discretization and parameter setting of the 1 m soil column in the reference model then the values of α n and ks in the extended 0 5 m soil column are divided by 2 1 25 and 100 respectively which can be regarded as very low permeability soil listed in table 3 for the meteorological error me we use biased parameters in the hargreaves equation to bring error in calculating etp the hargreaves equation is written as 16 e t p c r a t max t min e t max t min 2 t where ra is the equivalent of the extraterrestrial radiation mm d computed according to allen et al 1998 while tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures c c e and t are the original empirical coefficients which are advised as 0 0023 0 5 and 17 8 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 these uncalibrated values are used in the model setting of ross ies the tmax and tmin time series which are necessary for the computation of etp are from miyun station in beijing of china during 2011 2012 the calibrated values of c e and t in the reference model are given as 0 0008 0 74 and 37 9 based on hu et al 2011 for the anns we do not explicitly calculate etp but instead we directly use ra tmax and tmin as input variables the input variables for the two kinds of models are shown in fig 4 soil material layer conceptualization error le occurs when the heterogeneity in soil structure is not correctly noted the soil column in the reference model is heterogeneous as the default setting while in ross ies the forward model ross regards it as a homogeneous column a list of the error sources can be found in table 4 3 4 implementation details in this research we adopted the intel xeon gold 6130 multi core cpu as the high performance computing hardware a dell t7920 high performance work station hosts the hardware computational costs are much different over the two kinds of methods the execution time for ann bk and ann ms is only about 10 min and half an hour for each implementation respectively the running time of ann ms x takes about 2 3 h however ross ies is much more computationally intensive and it requires about 12 h for each case run most of the cost in ross ies is spent on the solution of the inverse of kalman gain k in eq 6 furthermore the computational time of ross ies increases significantly as the number of observations and unknown parameters increases 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of performance with different sources of errors the rmse and nse of sms using the ross ies and anns with different sources of errors are shown in fig 5 for the anns the relatively low rmse or relatively high nse during training indicates that the information hidden in the training data has been fully mined in most cases the rmse and nse improve from ann bk ann ms to ann ms x moreover there is a greater difference between ann bk and ann ms than that between ann ms and ann ms x the results show that the ann with a more complicated structure and more computational cost can achieve better performance but their marginal advantage gradually diminishes with increasing model complexity and computational cost in addition in the on and me cases ann ms performs best during testing it indicates that overfitting somewhat exists which shows the drawback of an over complicated or over simplified framework besides the variability between repeated cases generally decreases with increasing ann complexity which suggests that the stability of ann ms can be improved further although ross ies has the powerful ability to identify the gaussian observation error and outlive the model bias serious parameter compensation problem exists that is the effects of model conceptualization and observation errors are implicitly reflected in the estimated parameters which could deviate significantly from the truth moreover parameter compensation can bring adverse effects to the soil moisture modeling for instance in the lbe case the rmse or nse during calibration using ross ies is much lower higher than that during validation when the prior knowledge is seriously biased the well calibrated ross ies during calibration cannot achieve the same accuracy during validation the results during validation perform much worse than that during calibration due to the similar pattern of rmse and nse the further discussion below is focused on rmse 4 1 1 uncertainty of heterogeneity soils are inherently heterogeneous at multiple scales zha et al 2019 which significantly alters the sm state for the anns the heterogeneity brings little effect some effect may result from more complicated nonlinearity of flow in the heterogeneity column and rmse even gets better compared with the homogeneous hc case see fig 5 where rmses are 0 0166 and 0 0160 respectively for ann ms however as for ross ies the effect becomes more complicated first ross ies needs much more unknown hydraulic parameters to describe the heterogeneity of soil thus significantly increase the complexity of the model as well as the difficulty to calibrate them the effect is apparent by comparing the hc and bk cases according to fig 5 rmses in prediction in the bk case with heterogeneous soil are much larger than that in the homogeneous case with soil loam 0 00041 versus 0 00003 though both of them are small second the wrong description for the heterogeneity in soil structure soil material layer conceptualization error results in the rmse of ross ies in the le case increasing significantly rmse of sm using ross ies in this case 0 0081 during training and 0 0089 during testing are approximately 20 times larger than those in the bk case the values are close to the results of the anns in the bk case 0 0145 of ann ms x during testing the comparison of parameter estimations between cases hc bk and le is shown in fig 6 in the bk case although the estimated parameters are close to the reference parameters at the shallow depths relatively significant differences between the estimated parameters and the reference parameters still exist at deeper depths due to the lack of observation at the lower part of soil profile fig 6 a c and e in the le case the estimated parameters are just within the range of reference parameters fig 6 a c and e the difference between the estimated and the reference parameters via ross ies is significantly different from that in the bk case in the hc case there is already little difference between the reference parameters and the estimations after 7 iterations fig 6 b d and f the wrong description of heterogeneity in the le case or even the uncertainty of parameters in the bk case with heterogeneous soil cannot be neglected fig 7 shows rmses between estimated sm via ross ies and reference sm in cases hc bk and le at different depths from cases hc bk to le rmse gradually increases in case bk similar to the performance of parameter estimation fig 6 significantly different performances via ross ies between the observed locations and locations far from observations e g 0 8 m 0 9 m and 1 0 m exist which further affects the water balance in the soil column 4 1 2 uncertainty of initial condition uic according to fig 5 the results of anns in the uic case are only slightly different from those in the bk case specifically the performance of ann bk is even better in the uic case than that in the bk case from 0 015 to 0 016 during training and from 0 022 to 0 025 during testing while the performances of ann ms and ann ms x slightly deteriorate the results indicate that the uncertainty of the initial condition has little effect on the simulation using the anns in this study since the uncertainty of initial condition only exists in one of the 120 training samples the lack of stability could be the main reason for the better performance of ann bk for ross ies uic has a relatively strong influence on its performance the rmses during training and testing increase about two times due to the presence of uic compared relative to the bk case different from the anns the uncertainty of initial condition can affect the model calibration and thus can have a substantial impact on the sm prediction for subsequent simulations yu et al 2019 4 1 3 observation noise on according to fig 5 the effect of observation noise on anns is the most significant since ann training relies on observations while model settings usually do not affect ann unlike other error sources ann ms performs best during training and testing among the three anns in this case for further investigation the temporal sms simulated by the anns and reference observations with noise at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m during training are compared in fig 8 from ann bk ann ms to ann ms x the rmses between the simulation and the observation with noise rmsenoise during training gradually decrease compared with the rmses between the simulation and the observation without noise during training see fig 5 where ann ms performs best the overfitting in ann ms x and the insufficient data mining in ann bk are believed to be the main reason the results during testing ann ms performs best see fig 5 also demonstrate the importance of the appropriate balance between model complexity and training calibration cost as for ross ies the rmses between the simulation and the observation without noise during calibration and prediction are much less than the absolute error of observation noise which shows the ability of ies to eliminate the noise of gaussian distribution however compared with the rmse in the bk case no observation noise the rmse between the simulation and the observation increases significantly from 0 00017 to 0 00451 during training and from 0 00041 to 0 01032 during testing the results may be worse when the noise is non gaussian both results for the anns and ross ies indicate that it is essential for us to improve the observation accuracy to gain a better simulation 4 1 4 lower boundary error lbe the anns do not require the description of the lower boundary condition so the wrong knowledge of the lower boundary has little effect on the results see fig 5 compared with the bk case for ross ies both rmses during training and testing increase but the rmse during training is much smaller than that during testing the results indicate that ross ies fits the observations very well however because of the wrong physical model conceptualization a wrong interpretation of the information contained in the observation has been made to calibrate the model and thus lead to poor predictions it is demonstrated in fig 5 that the rmse of the lbe case using ross ies during validation increases much more substantially with regard to calibration compared with other errors the comparison between the reference and estimated parameters is shown in fig 9 the difference between the reference and estimated parameters near the 1 m interface is larger than that close to the soil surface which can be attributed to the lack of observation constraint at the deep depths and the wrong knowledge of the lower boundary conditions thus we should carefully examine our model assumptions prior to data processing and model calibration 4 1 5 meteorological error me as fig 4 shows the meteorological condition during calibration training is similar to that during validation testing which indicates that scenarios during calibration training are representative for the anns the rmse increase during testing is second only to the performance in the on case see fig 5 and sds of ann bk and ann ms are larger than those in the other cases although they avoid the error from the false potential evapotranspiration by directly using the raw meteorological data ra tmax and tmin besides ann ms performs best during testing among the three anns as in the on case the results indicate that more complicated inputs tend to bring a negative effect on the prediction of the sm or even result in overfitting for ross ies the comparison of sms simulated with the reference hydraulic parameters using the true and the false potential evapotranspiration values is shown in fig 10 rmses between them rmseme during calibration and validation are both larger than rmses see fig 5 between the estimated sm using the false potential evapotranspiration with the estimated hydraulic parameters and the reference sm which implies the existence of the parameter compensation besides compared with rmse caused by the observation noise rmseon 0 02 see section 3 3 in the on case rmseme of sms 0 0062 during calibration see fig 10 caused by the uncertainty of the meteorological condition is insignificant rmseon is 3 2 times larger than rmseme during training and 3 5 times larger during testing from 0 02 to 0 057 see fig 10 however rmse in the on case during testing is only 2 7 times larger than rmse in me case see fig 5 0 0103 versus 0 00379 it shows that meteorological data error also brings significant effect on ross ies besides the effect of observation noise can be alleviated with sufficient observations while the effect of the meteorological data error is hard to eliminate the accurate evaluation of evapotranspiration has been a persisting challenge the estimation varies among different models and is difficult to observe directly in a field case therefore the meteorological data can be another significant error source in ross ies unlike ross ies the anns use the meteorological data directly which could be regarded as a significant advantage of them 4 2 discussion on the synthetic experiments our results show that many model conceptualization errors have insignificant effects on the anns since these assumptions are not or only partially applicable to them while both model conceptualization errors and data errors have significant effects on ross ies specifically the heterogeneity in the soil structure and the boundary conditions do not affect the anns the uncertainty of initial condition shows a minor effect since the initial condition is a special observation data at the beginning and it is involved in the ann training the observation noise is the only error source that shows a relatively significant effect on the anns for ross ies the uncertainty of initial condition can affect sm prediction over a long period ross ies has the powerful ability to eliminate the observation noise of gaussian distribution but the effect cannot be eliminated entirely the heterogeneity in the soil structure can increase the difficulty of estimation and may result in layer conceptualization error thus making much deteriorated result the lower boundary error and the error of meteorological information also show strong effects on the performance of ross ies and can make a significant difference in the performance between calibration and prediction based on these findings we should prioritize minimizing model conceptualization error for ross ies the comparisons of some other factors show some limitations of anns and performances of the two methods under a few additional scenarios see the supplementary material the anns are not very good at extrapolation since they offer no information about the internal state and dynamics as pointed in the early work of minns and hall 1996 they perform poorly in predicting peak and trough values of sm mainly for the insufficient data of the extrema and need more historical information to make a better sm prediction when the soil is constantly saturated for a long time the two methods have different performances when simulating different soil water dynamics under different soil textures and climate scenarios the anns tend to performs well if the response variables and the driving data have a relatively linear relationship in the synthetic cases the metrics of ross ies are generally better than those of the anns which is partially attributed to the fact that the reference data are generated by ross model and the initial guess values of hydraulic parameters are relatively close to the reference parameters however there are many other factors that may influence model performance in real world conditions and larger model structural error zhang et al 2019 can bring more adverse effects on ross ies in contrast except for some neural network parameters ann involves very few assumptions from another point of view ross ies can make better and more reliable simulations than anns if a reasonable physical model can be built to achieve this it is desirable to collect as much information related to model conceptualization as possible moreover we need to be conservative during the model conceptualization and should not underestimate model conceptualization uncertainty for instance if the lower boundary condition is uncertain instead of a subjective assertion it is suggested to try different possibilities and obtain a most likely one based on observation data current pbm studies have appreciated the parameter uncertainties while the uncertainties from other aspects e g boundary conditions may need more attention bayesian model averaging neuman et al 2012 recently developed framework is potentially a good choice to identify the model conceptualization uncertainty based on data 4 3 application to field data at chatham michigan the performance of the two methods under real world conditions is compared in an sm gauging site the test gauging site 46 3345 n 86 92 w is located in chatham a village in rock river township of alger county michigan the meteorological data used to derive the potential evapotranspiration etp by the penman monteith method are retrieved from the power data access viewer dav web mapping application the precipitation p and observations of sm belong to the u s climate reference network there are observations of sm at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 5 m two years of data from 1 january 2015 to 31 december 2016 are selected the data during the first year are used for training calibration while the data during the second year are used for testing validation for ross ies one year warm up using the method of yu et al 2019 is implemented to alleviate the effects of the uncertain initial condition the settings of ross ies model is similar to that in the bk case based on prior knowledge on the physical state of the system θr is set as 0 0426 at the depth of 0 0 3 m and 0 0434 at the depth of 0 3 1 m while θs is set as 0 49 at the depth of 0 0 3 m and 0 43 at the depth of 0 3 1 m based on the data from the test site the comparison of rmse and nse between the anns and ross ies in sm simulation is shown in fig 11 for both methods the rmses and nses of sm during training are acceptable 0 015 and 0 92 considering unknown observation errors in this field case we conclude that the information of training data has been properly utilized besides the performances of the anns are better than that of ross ies during both training and testing except ann bk while the latter requires a much higher computational cost the results show the great practicability of the anns the relative inferior performance of ies ross could be attributed to the imperfect prior knowledge of the site and uncertainties in model structure and parameterization e g the boundary error which were also not considered simultaneously in the synthetic case besides rmse decreases nse increases from ann bk ann ms and ann ms x during training while sd of ann bk is much larger and ann ms performs best among the three anns during testing they show the superiority in the framework of ann ms for data mining and avoidance of overfitting fig 12 shows more details about the meteorological condition and simulations of sm at different depths via ross ies and ann ms respectively compared with the synthetic cases there are more varieties of meteorological conditions during training in the field case which could also improve the performance of the anns however there are considerable misfits in the peak and trough regions and they contribute significantly to the overall performance of ann for ross ies the sm simulation during training and testing seems to be forced toward the mean of the observations since ies is a smoother 4 4 uncertainty and limitation of current work it should be noted that there are some uncertainties and limitations of the current study the comparisons are conducted on a relatively short time series 240 days or two years which means the condition is somewhat stable over the entire time series and the nonstationary features of the sm are not considered a long representative dataset is necessary to train the ann model that is the training data need to cover the scenarios during testing validation prediction which is one of the key requirements for anns to obtain a reasonable prediction of peak and valley sm values anns will obtain unacceptable results if the prediction stage has extreme scenarios not covered in the training data kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 our study only focuses on the simulation of sms at three shallow depths in close proximity to one another which has a relatively strong correlation in space and may favor the use of anns besides more types of information e g labels of time and space can also be considered to be contained in the input of anns uncertainty of initial condition boundary error and observation noise of different levels or combination of them are not investigated although we expect our major conclusions to hold some differences could emerge if different hyper parameters e g mesh size the time step size of ross the weight factor in activation function of ann etc are assigned to the pbm and mlm and these parameters are given based on experience or brief preliminary investigations we believe that choice of different physical models e g ross hydrus simunek et al 2005 swap van dam and feddes 2000 should results in similar simulation results since they share the same governing equations in contrast the machine learning methods have a variety of choices e g ann svm asefa et al 2006 gill et al 2006 random forest friedel et al 2020 and their performances may vary significantly for different scenarios which deserves further investigation 5 conclusions in comparison with previous studies our work makes clearer and more systematical comparisons between the mlm and the pbm with data assimilation through a series of synthetic cases the effects of various sources of errors such as the initial states the observation noise the upper and lower boundary conditions and the heterogeneity in soil structure are discussed the effects of other factors e g the spatial interpolation extrapolation soil texture materials are investigated and given in the supplementary material lastly the anns and ross ies are applied in a field example the major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the anns have few model assumptions and they are seldom affected by model assumptions while physical model conceptualization the soil heterogeneity boundary conditions has a significant effect on ross ies besides the uncertainty of the initial condition also cannot be negligible for ross ies both methods are affected by observation noise for ross ies we should give priority to avoid the error from boundary conditions and hydraulic parameters compared with the uncertainty of initial condition and observation noise 2 the anns have difficulty in simulating around the peaks including constantly saturated values and troughs of the sm time series besides the anns prefer a less nonlinear relationship between response variables e g sm and the driving data e g precipitation evapotranspiration and preceding sm while ross ies is affected by the prior soil hydraulic information 3 the computational cost of ross ies is much larger than that of the anns among the three variants of ann ann ms is recommended for its data mining ability and robustness against overfitting 4 in the field example without the detailed and accurate prior knowledge e g boundary condition source sink term heterogeneity in soil structure better simulation and prediction can be achieved using the mlm but it has difficulty in obtaining the sm profile or the soil water flow dynamic due to its inability to provide reliable predictions away from observed locations i e extrapolation based on this study further investigations about more factors e g different types of observation data such as soil pressure head can be conducted in a similar framework besides a deeper understanding of merits and demerits of pbm and mlm will encourage their wider utilization and further improvement in

5638,qanat is a type of drain that extract water from aquifers by gravity significant amount of fresh water used in middle east and other parts of the world are supplied by qanats despite their importance discharge variation of these type of wells received almost no attention the aim of this research is to obtain a laplace domain solution of discharge variation of a qanat installed in an anisotropic unconfined aquifer subjected to arbitrary areal recharge and nearby pumping well s discharge a new semi analytical solution of drawdown is obtained first to implement the effects of arbitrary areal recharge and nearby pumping well s using the principle of superposition then the discharge variation solution of the qanat is obtained from the drawdown solution to establish a constant head boundary condition at the qanat periphery the qanat is discretized into several segments the results of this study are presented in dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curves the effects of hydraulic as well as geometric parameters on the discharge variation of the qanat due to arbitrary areal recharge falling of water table from its initial position and discharge of nearby wells are explored we also investigate the influences of distance and screen depth and location of the nearby well on the discharge variation of the qanat the results of this study can be utilized for multiple purposes 1 to predict discharge of qanat in response to rainfall and nearby pumping well s 2 to estimate the aquifer parameters using hydrograph of the qanat 3 to determine optimal location and pumping pattern of the nearby wells to minimize their influences on the discharge of the qanat 4 to calculate water budget of aquifers drained by a qanat the equation presented in this work can also be used to estimate discharge of a horizontal drain installed in cropland subjected to arbitrary irrigation pattern keywords analytical solution laplace domain screen segmentation qanat areal recharge constant head 1 introduction qanat is a gently sloping drain that extract water from the aquifer by gravity and is invented by persians 2500 years ago ahmadi et al 2010 and has been subsequently utilized broadly in middle east and other parts of the world wulff 1968 stated that there were 50 000 chain of qanat in iran with a total length of 360 000 km and a total discharge of 500 m3 s 1 kowsar and kowsar 2012 these days in iran 22 000 qanats supply 75 of all water used in the country samani et al 2006 todd and mays 2005 also there are many qanats in other parts of the world such as western china and spain allen jr 2016 avni 2018 charloux et al 2018 gerrard and gutiérrez 2018 the amount and origin of the water recharged the aquifer and drained by qanat were considered in some studies moghadam et al 2019 determined the origin of groundwater of some qanats in northeastern of iran groundwater flow models were utilized by joodavi et al 2016 to estimate the recharge to aquifer drained by spring and qanats many qanats were dried in the middle east due to drought and overexploitation of the aquifers and have become a grave public concern ahmadi et al 2010 goes et al 2017 yazdi and khaneiki 2017 despite their importance there are few analytical solutions of head or discharge variation due to the qanat in the literature qanat can be regarded as a type of horizontal or slightly inclined or slanted wells analytical models of groundwater flow to this type of wells were subject of many researches a uniform flux horizontal well in an anisotropic confined aquifer was considered by zhan et al 2001 groundwater flow to this type of well in leaky sun and zhan 2006 zhan and park 2003 fractured park and zhan 2003 and unconfined aquifers zhan and zlotnik 2002 were also investigated a single horizontal pumping well in an unconfined aquifer parallel to a fully penetrating stream was considered by huang et al 2011 groundwater head distribution and stream depletion rate due to a radial collector well were investigated by huang et al 2012 a general well configurations in an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured bedrock were also considered by sedghi and zhan 2019b in all above mentioned solutions uniform flux boundary condition at the pumping well were considered and the pumping well discharge was constant sometimes pumping tests are performed in aquifers under constant head conditions rather than the constant discharge condition the analytical solutions for this type of test in low permeability aquifers are useful when the rate of discharge is too small or too difficult to measure accurately within a perceivable test duration murdoch and franco 1994 analytical solution of constant head discharge in a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer was obtained by jacob and lohman 1952 a similar solution was obtained by bennett and patten 1962 for the case in which a well penetrates several aquifers murdoch and franco 1994 analyzed constant drawdown well using an instantaneous source function their analysis was based on drawdown solution in laplace domain which is a multiplication of source function and green s function chang and chen 2003 obtained semi analytical solution of discharge of a constant head vertical well they discretized the well screen into a finite number of segments with a constant drawdown and obtained the discharge of each segment the well screen discretization was also considered by wang and zhan 2017b to simulate the mixed type and uniform head boundary conditions at the horizontal well in a confined aquifer they stated that 16 segments were usually sufficient for the well screen discretization for the computational purpose a similar problem with a vertical well segmentation was done by wang and zhan 2017a samani et al 2006 obtained laplace domain solution of head and discharge of a horizontal drain in an unconfined aquifer qanat they obtained their solution based on the solution presented by zhan and zlotnik 2002 their discharge solution was applicable when a qanat outlet was closed for a long time to establish the zero drawdown initial condition the long time approximation of their solution also was applicable to analyze the base flow of a qanat however the discharge solution presented by samani et al 2006 could not address important issues such as effects of areal recharge due to rainfall and extraction from nearby pumping well s on the discharge variations of a qanat thus there is a need to consider these practical issues in developing analytical solutions of discharge of a qanat the aim of this research is therefore obtaining analytical solutions of discharge variation of a qanat in an unconfined aquifer subjected to arbitrary areal recharge and pumping from nearby wells with arbitrary discharge variations in this work the qanat is segmented according to wang and zhan 2017b for accurate simulation of the constant head condition along the qanat the presented solution is applicable in groundwater management prediction of the discharge variation of a qanat and estimation of the aquifer hydraulic parameters using a qanat hydrograph among others as stated by hill 1998 and hill and tiedeman 2006 the hydraulic conductivity that are estimated using flow data e g the hydrograph of a qanat are more accurate comparing to those estimated using drawdown or head data 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem statement fig 1 is a schematic reperesentation of the unconfineed aquifer with a qanat the saturated part of the qanat is considered both the initial water table and the qanat are horizontal the origin of the coordinate system is located at the base of the unconfined aquifer under the central point of the qanat the z axis is positive upward the depth of the unconfined aquifer is d and it has infinite horizontal extent the qanat is positioned along the x axis from lx 2 to lx 2 where lx is the screen length of the qanat the elevation of the qanat from the base of the aquifer is zq a vertical pumping well is located at the xw and yw with the screen from zw 1 to zw 2 the general areal recharge is imposed at the top of the unconfined aquifer in this work first the point source sink solution of the problem is obtained then the line source sink solution is obtained from the point source sink one integrating along the horizontal direction finally the constant head line source solution qanat is acquired the three dimensional 3d governing equation of drawdown in the vicinity of the point sink source in the unconfined aquifer is 1 k h 2 s x 2 k h 2 s y 2 k z 2 s z

source location and t is time since start of pumping t eq 1 is solved subject to the following initial and boundary conditions the initial condition is 2 s x y z 0 0 the zero drawdown boundary

the unconfined aquifer dimensionless to solve the above inhomogeneous initial boundary value problem ibvp the drawdown can be spilt into two parts as 6 s u v this is done to make the solution similar

introduced in notations it should be noted the u part of the solution is similar to problem solved by zhan and zlotnik 2002 and the v part considers the areal recharge to the aquifer 2 2 point source sink solution eq 7 with respect to initial and boundary conditions of eqs 9 11 13 and 15 is solved by zhan and zlotnik 2002 as 17 u q qd p 2 π n 1 cos ω n z d cos ω n z qd 0 25 0 5 sin 2 ω n ω n k 0 p ω n 2 x d x qd 2 y d y qd 2 where the subscript d represents the dimensionless term hereinafter p is the laplace transform parameter in respect to the dimensionless time and ω n is obtained solving

the rate of pumping for a second point sink source l3t 1 that will be used to derive the drawdown for a vertical pumping well later and q wd p is the laplace domain dimensionless counterpart of qw it should be noted that the dimensionless parameters used here are different from that of zhan and zlotnik 2002 and are presented in table 1 eq 8 with respect to initial and boundary conditions of eqs 10 12 14 and 16 is solved in appendix a as 20 v r p cosh p z d σ p sinh p p cosh p where the overbar represents the term in laplace domain hereinafter thus the point source solution is obtained by

be computed in the following section 2 4 discharge solution of qanat fixed head point the same procedure as in carslaw and jaeger 1959 murdoch and franco 1994 samani et al 2006 is followed to obtain solution of discharge of the qanat using eq 22 as 26 q qd p l xd q qd p l xd s wd p f q 0 34 l xd r q d z qd q wd p l xd f w 0 34 l xd r q d z qd f q 0 34 l xd r q d z qd r p l xd f r z qd f q 0 34 l xd r q d z qd where swd is the constant drawdown at the periphery of the qanat and is considered 1 zqd appendix b and 0 34 l xd r q d z qd is the coordinate of the constant head point there where rq represents the radius of the qanat and is set to 0 05 m it should be noted that the location of a fixed head point on the periphery of qanat is selected based as suggestion by samani et al 2006 for more discussion on the location of the fixed head point the readers are referred to the following papers rosa and carvalho 1989 samani et al 2006 eq 26 consists of three terms the first term is discharge variation due to the decline of water table from its initial position in fact this term shows the discharge variation of a qanat or horizontal drain after its outlet which was closed for a long time to establish the zero drawdown initial condition the late time approximation of the first term represents the base flow of a qanat it should be noted that the first term of eq 26 is equivalent to the discharge variation of a horizontal drain presented by samani et al 2006 the second term reflects the influences of pumping from the nearby well s on qanat discharge this is very important in determining the extraction wells location so that the discharge of qanat will not be affected finally the last term illustrates the effects of areal recharge on qanat discharge hydrograph this term the last term can be used to obtain the hydraulic parameters of aquifer and the amount of recharge using the discharge variation data of the qanat after eliminating the base flow term 2 5 discharge solution of qanat well screen segmentation to simulate the qanat the entire wellbore is better treated as a uniform head boundary rather than a uniform flux boundary it can be done numerically by discretizing the wellbore to finite segments with each of them with a constant flux the reader may consult the following papers for more discussion on the well segmentation chang and chen 2003 penmatcha and aziz 1998 wang and zhan 2017a wang and zhan 2017b to obtain the solution of the discharge of each segment the following equation should be considered obtained from eq 22 27 s wd p q qd p f q x d y d z d q wd p f w x d y d z d r p f r z d where xd yd and zd represent the location of the fixed head point on each segment lxdi 2 rq d zqd and lxdi is the length of the segment i above equation eq 27 is organized into the following matrix wang and zhan 2017a 28 f q 1 1 f q 1 2 f q 1 n f q 2 1 f q 2 2 f q 2 n f qn 1 f qn 2 f qn n q q d 1 p q q d 2 p q qdn p s wd p q wd p f w 1 r p f r s wd p q wd p f w 2 r p f r s wd p q wd p f wn r p f r where f qi j term calculates the drawdown in well segment i created by flow into well segment j from the aquifer and f wi term calculated the drawdown in well segment i created by flow into the nearby pumping well the above matrix should be solved for q qdi for each segment the total discharge of qanat is obtained as 29 q qd p i 1 n l xdi q qdi p where l xdi is the length of each segment that is uniform 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical evaluation of the solution the laplace domain matrix of eq 28 is solved using matlab the stehfest 1970 or de hoog et al 1982 algorithm can be utilized to obtain time domain discharge data the de hoog et al 1982 is more stable and works well when a periodic function is used to simulate the areal recharge or the discharge variations of the pumping well it is however slower than the stehfest 1970 algorithm that is used to prepare type curves in this work we discretize qanat into 16 segments as it is sufficient for graphical presentation of the results wang and zhan 2017b increasing the number of segments does not increase the accuracy of the solution but significantly increases the computational time and may lead to unstable results chang and chen 2003 3 2 components of the discharge eliminating the pumping due to the nearby well and the recharge eq 26 is reduced to the discharge equation presented by samani et al 2006 the right hand side of eq 28 consists of three terms that represent the influences of the initial condition base flow pumping of the nearby wells and areal recharge respectively to illustrate effects of these terms on discharge variation of a qanat fig 2 is constructed using the default parameters introduced in table 2 samani et al 2006 sedghi and zhan 2019b the following function is used to simulate the constant recharge 30 r d t d r 0 d h t d t d r 1 h t d t d r 2 where h is the heaviside step function and r 0 d is the dimensionless constant recharge rate applied to the water table during the dimensionless time from tdr 1 to tdr 2 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 30 is 31 r d p r 0 d exp p t d r 1 p exp p t d r 2 p following the same manner the discharge of the nearby pumping well can be modelled using the following function 32 q wd t d q 0 w d h t d t std where q 0 w d is the constant rate discharge per unit length started from the dimensionless time of tstd the laplace domain counterpart of eq 32 is 33 q wd p q 0 w d exp p t std p eqs 31 and 33 are substituted into eq 28 to prepare fig 2 two dimensionless elevations of qanat are considered zqd 0 1 black lines and zqd 0 9 red lines this figure for deep qanat zqd 0 1 illustrates the three components of the qanat discharge as shown in the figure the discharge due to falling of the water table from its initial position shows three stages during the first stage the discharge decreases as the head in the aquifer decreases due to release of water from the aquifer storage the gravity drainage of the water table stabilizes the drawdown in the aquifer and maintains the hydraulic gradient toward the qanat during the second stage when the discharge levels off during the third stage the discharge of the qanat decreases again with the lower slope and reaches the quasi steady state condition samani et al 2006 the dimensionless discharge of the shallow qanat zqd 0 9 is significantly less than that of the deep one zqd 0 1 due to the lower hydraulic gradient toward it furthermore discharge variation of the shallow qanat is markedly less than that of the deep qanat as it is close to the water table during the early time all curves follow a common curve this is due to the fact that the water recharged to aquifer does not significantly affect the drawdown furthermore the cone of depression does not reach the qanat to reduce its discharge therefore the discharge of qanat is solely affected by the falling of water table from its initial position during the early time recharge to the water table from the dimensionless time of 10 to 10 000 increases the discharge of qanat as is evident in fig 2 extraction from the pumped well from the dimensionless time of 350 decreases the discharge of the qanat as expected it should be noted that the qanat is considered as a constant head source sink thus if the water table falls below the qanat elevation the discharge of the qanat becomes negative and is no longer valid we further compare the discharge that is obtained using the segmented qanat utilizing eq 28 black lines and the case with a single constant head point on qanat periphery utilizing eq 26 hollow circles the figure shows that the deviation of the case with the non segmented qanat from the segmented case are significant when the nearby pumping well is considered in other case the deviation of discharge is not significant it should be noted that the segmented qanat is considered in preparing the curves that are presented in this work 3 3 influences of the hydraulic and the geometric parameters in this subsection the influences of the specific yield sy and the dimensionless length of qanat on the discharge variation are explored the default parameters given in table 2 are used to prepare the curves presented here fig 3 illustrates the effects of the specific yield sy of the aquifer on the dimensionless discharge of the qanat we eliminate the first and the second right hand side terms of eq 28 therefore it only shows the influences of the areal recharge the recharge is applied from the dimensionless time of 10 to 10000 the figure shows that increasing the specific yield decreases the discharge due to the areal recharge it is due to the fact that as the specific yield increases the water table rises due to the recharge and the hydraulic gradient toward the qanat decreases resulting in a reduction of discharge of the qanat the influence of recharge is diminished over time after the recharge to the aquifer stopped as expected the effects of sy on the first right hand side term of eq 28 are examined by eliminating the second and third right hand side terms of eq 28 fig 4 in fact this figure shows the dimensionless discharge variation of the qanat due to the declining of water table from its initial position as shown in the figure increasing the specific yield increases the dimensionless discharge the reason for this is that the water table decline is reduced by increasing sy and this maintains the hydraulic gradient toward the qanat and leads to a higher discharge fig 5 depicts the amount of decreases of the dimensionless discharge due to the effects of a nearby pumping well this figure is prepared eliminating the first and the third right hand side terms of eq 28 different values of sy as in fig 3 are tested this figure shows that increasing sy decreases the effects of nearby wells on the dimensionless discharge of the qanat for the same reason explained in fig 4 this effects increases overtime as the cone of depression expands toward the qanat to investigate the effects of the dimensionless length of the qanat on the dimensionless discharge variation fig 6 is prepared as expected increasing the dimensionless length of the qanat increases the discharge of the qanat due to the areal recharge as it increases the area of the influence of the qanat it is worth noting that the dimensionless length of the qanat is proportional with the length of the qanat and the square root of the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and inversely proportional with the square root of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer table 1 thus the influences of the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer are also reflected in fig 6 increasing the dimensionless length of the qanat increasing the dimensionless discharge due to the declining of water table from its initial position and reduces the effects of nearby wells on the discharge figs 7 and 8 moreover the definition of the dimensionless discharge and time table 1 should be considered utilizing figs 6 7 and 8 to explore the effects of hydraulic conductivities according to the definition of lxd table 1 increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer will increase the dimensionless length and therefore increase the discharge of the qanat based on the definition of the dimensionless time table 1 increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer reduces the time that is needed for the qanat to response to the areal recharge and effects of nearby wells increasing the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh of the aquifer reduces the dimensionless length of the qanat this however increases the dimensional discharge of the qanat as q q d k h d 2 the influences of kh on increasing the discharge of qanat due to the areal recharge dominate its effects on decreasing the dimensionless length of the qanat figs 6 7 and 8 3 4 influences of the nearby pumping well overexploitation of aquifers dry out many qanats in iran thus it is very important to explore the effects of nearby pumping wells on the discharge of the qanat in this subsection we explore the influences of distance partial penetration and the screen depth on the discharge of the qanat again default parameters values given in table 2 are used to prepare figures of this subsection the second and third right hand side parts of eq 28 are eliminated to prepare figures the vertical axis of these figures are the amount of decreases in the discharge of the qanat due to the effects of a nearby pumping well to investigate the effects of the distance along the y axis on the discharge variation of the qanat fig 9 is prepared this figure shows that increasing the distance from the qanat decreases the discharge of the qanat this decrease occurs in three stages for the pumping well close to the qanat this is due to the gravity drainage that contributes to the pumped water from the pumping well during the intermediate time we explore the effects of the partial penetration of the nearby pumping well on the discharge of the qanat the results are presented in fig 10 as shown in this figure increasing the screen length of the pumping well decreases the discharge of the qanat during the intermediate time as the horizontal component of flow becomes more significant comparing to the case with a shorter screen the influences of the elevation of the screen are tested in fig 11 as depicted in this figure increasing the depth of the screen decreasing its elevation will decrease the discharge of the qanat as it decreases the contribution of the water table drainage to the pumped water from the well and increases the expansion of the cone of depression during the intermediate time 3 5 horton s infiltration equation as the recharge function the presented solution can be used to evaluate the discharge variation of qanat subjected to an arbitrary areal recharge to demonstrate this the horton s equation of infiltration is considered as the recharge function r t 34 r t f c f 0 f c exp k t 1 h t t e where fc is the final recharge rate lt 1 f0 is the initial recharge rate lt 1 k is a coefficient to simulate the rate of the recharge variation over time t 1 te is the end time of recharge t it should be note that the horton s equation of infiltration is multiplied by 1 h t t e to stop the recharge at time of te the dimensionless form of eq 34 is obtained as 35 r d t d f c d f 0 d f cd exp k d t d 1 h t d t ed where fcd and f 0 d are respectively the dimensionless forms of fc and f0 ted is the dimensionless form of te presented in table 1 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 35 is 36 r d p f c d exp t ed p 1 p f 0 d f cd exp t ed p k d 1 p k d inserting r d p into eq 26 for the case with no well segmentation or eq 28 for the case with the well segmentation the discharge variation of a qanat due to the areal recharge simulated by eq 34 is obtained to show the effects of recharge simulated by eq 34 on the discharge variation of the qanat fig 12 is prepared the following default parameters are used f 0 2 7 10 5 m s 1 two dimensionless elevations of the qanat zqd 0 1 and zqd 0 9 are considered as illustrated in the figure increasing the elevation of the qanat from the base of the aquifer increases its discharge due to the areal f c 2 7 10 6 m s 1 recharge as shallower qanat is closer to the water table where the areal recharge is imposed 3 6 qanat depletion volume the following equation can be used to calculate the cumulative depletion volume of the qanat 37 q d v t d 0 t d q q τ d τ where qdv is the cumulative qanat depletion volume l3 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 37 is 38 q d v p

qdv for two qanat lengths of 50 and 100 m with the result illustrated in fig 13 as expected increasing the length of the qanat increases the depletion volume it should be noted that the late time decrease in qdv is not valid and it is caused by the lowering of the water table below the qanat periphery due to pumping from the nearby wells eqs 39 and 40 are applicable to calculate the water budget of the aquifer depleted by qanat 4 summary and conclusions the laplace domain solution of the discharge variation of a qanat in an unconfined aquifer due to the aquifer depletion areal recharge and a nearby pumping well is obtained the aquifer is anisotropic with an infinite extent the time domain discharge is obtained using numerical inverse laplace transformation the applicability of the presented solution to simulate the horton s infiltration equation as the recharge function is demonstrated and the qanat depletion volume that is applicable to the aquifer budget calculation is presented as well the following results are drawn from this research 1 increasing the specific yield of the aquifer will a decrease the discharge of the qanat due to the areal recharge b increase the dimensionless discharge due to the declining of the water table from its initial position and c decrease the effects of nearby wells on the dimensionless discharge of the qanat increasing the dimensionless length of the qanat will have similar findings 2 increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer will increase the dimensionless length and therefore increases the discharge of the qanat increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer reduces the time that is needed for the qanat to response to the areal recharge and effects of nearby wells the influences of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer on increasing the dimensional discharge of the qanat dominates its effects on decreasing the dimensionless length of the qanat thus it increases the discharge of the qanat 3 increasing the screen length of the vertical pumping well decreases the discharge of the qanat during the intermediate time as the horizontal component of flow becomes more significant comparing to the case with a shorter screen increasing the depth of the screen will decrease the discharge of the qanat as it decreases the contribution of the water table drainage to the pumped water from the well and increases the expansion of the cone of depression during the intermediate time 4 discharge of the shallow qanats are more sensitive to the areal

5638,qanat is a type of drain that extract water from aquifers by gravity significant amount of fresh water used in middle east and other parts of the world are supplied by qanats despite their importance discharge variation of these type of wells received almost no attention the aim of this research is to obtain a laplace domain solution of discharge variation of a qanat installed in an anisotropic unconfined aquifer subjected to arbitrary areal recharge and nearby pumping well s discharge a new semi analytical solution of drawdown is obtained first to implement the effects of arbitrary areal recharge and nearby pumping well s using the principle of superposition then the discharge variation solution of the qanat is obtained from the drawdown solution to establish a constant head boundary condition at the qanat periphery the qanat is discretized into several segments the results of this study are presented in dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curves the effects of hydraulic as well as geometric parameters on the discharge variation of the qanat due to arbitrary areal recharge falling of water table from its initial position and discharge of nearby wells are explored we also investigate the influences of distance and screen depth and location of the nearby well on the discharge variation of the qanat the results of this study can be utilized for multiple purposes 1 to predict discharge of qanat in response to rainfall and nearby pumping well s 2 to estimate the aquifer parameters using hydrograph of the qanat 3 to determine optimal location and pumping pattern of the nearby wells to minimize their influences on the discharge of the qanat 4 to calculate water budget of aquifers drained by a qanat the equation presented in this work can also be used to estimate discharge of a horizontal drain installed in cropland subjected to arbitrary irrigation pattern keywords analytical solution laplace domain screen segmentation qanat areal recharge constant head 1 introduction qanat is a gently sloping drain that extract water from the aquifer by gravity and is invented by persians 2500 years ago ahmadi et al 2010 and has been subsequently utilized broadly in middle east and other parts of the world wulff 1968 stated that there were 50 000 chain of qanat in iran with a total length of 360 000 km and a total discharge of 500 m3 s 1 kowsar and kowsar 2012 these days in iran 22 000 qanats supply 75 of all water used in the country samani et al 2006 todd and mays 2005 also there are many qanats in other parts of the world such as western china and spain allen jr 2016 avni 2018 charloux et al 2018 gerrard and gutiérrez 2018 the amount and origin of the water recharged the aquifer and drained by qanat were considered in some studies moghadam et al 2019 determined the origin of groundwater of some qanats in northeastern of iran groundwater flow models were utilized by joodavi et al 2016 to estimate the recharge to aquifer drained by spring and qanats many qanats were dried in the middle east due to drought and overexploitation of the aquifers and have become a grave public concern ahmadi et al 2010 goes et al 2017 yazdi and khaneiki 2017 despite their importance there are few analytical solutions of head or discharge variation due to the qanat in the literature qanat can be regarded as a type of horizontal or slightly inclined or slanted wells analytical models of groundwater flow to this type of wells were subject of many researches a uniform flux horizontal well in an anisotropic confined aquifer was considered by zhan et al 2001 groundwater flow to this type of well in leaky sun and zhan 2006 zhan and park 2003 fractured park and zhan 2003 and unconfined aquifers zhan and zlotnik 2002 were also investigated a single horizontal pumping well in an unconfined aquifer parallel to a fully penetrating stream was considered by huang et al 2011 groundwater head distribution and stream depletion rate due to a radial collector well were investigated by huang et al 2012 a general well configurations in an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured bedrock were also considered by sedghi and zhan 2019b in all above mentioned solutions uniform flux boundary condition at the pumping well were considered and the pumping well discharge was constant sometimes pumping tests are performed in aquifers under constant head conditions rather than the constant discharge condition the analytical solutions for this type of test in low permeability aquifers are useful when the rate of discharge is too small or too difficult to measure accurately within a perceivable test duration murdoch and franco 1994 analytical solution of constant head discharge in a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer was obtained by jacob and lohman 1952 a similar solution was obtained by bennett and patten 1962 for the case in which a well penetrates several aquifers murdoch and franco 1994 analyzed constant drawdown well using an instantaneous source function their analysis was based on drawdown solution in laplace domain which is a multiplication of source function and green s function chang and chen 2003 obtained semi analytical solution of discharge of a constant head vertical well they discretized the well screen into a finite number of segments with a constant drawdown and obtained the discharge of each segment the well screen discretization was also considered by wang and zhan 2017b to simulate the mixed type and uniform head boundary conditions at the horizontal well in a confined aquifer they stated that 16 segments were usually sufficient for the well screen discretization for the computational purpose a similar problem with a vertical well segmentation was done by wang and zhan 2017a samani et al 2006 obtained laplace domain solution of head and discharge of a horizontal drain in an unconfined aquifer qanat they obtained their solution based on the solution presented by zhan and zlotnik 2002 their discharge solution was applicable when a qanat outlet was closed for a long time to establish the zero drawdown initial condition the long time approximation of their solution also was applicable to analyze the base flow of a qanat however the discharge solution presented by samani et al 2006 could not address important issues such as effects of areal recharge due to rainfall and extraction from nearby pumping well s on the discharge variations of a qanat thus there is a need to consider these practical issues in developing analytical solutions of discharge of a qanat the aim of this research is therefore obtaining analytical solutions of discharge variation of a qanat in an unconfined aquifer subjected to arbitrary areal recharge and pumping from nearby wells with arbitrary discharge variations in this work the qanat is segmented according to wang and zhan 2017b for accurate simulation of the constant head condition along the qanat the presented solution is applicable in groundwater management prediction of the discharge variation of a qanat and estimation of the aquifer hydraulic parameters using a qanat hydrograph among others as stated by hill 1998 and hill and tiedeman 2006 the hydraulic conductivity that are estimated using flow data e g the hydrograph of a qanat are more accurate comparing to those estimated using drawdown or head data 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem statement fig 1 is a schematic reperesentation of the unconfineed aquifer with a qanat the saturated part of the qanat is considered both the initial water table and the qanat are horizontal the origin of the coordinate system is located at the base of the unconfined aquifer under the central point of the qanat the z axis is positive upward the depth of the unconfined aquifer is d and it has infinite horizontal extent the qanat is positioned along the x axis from lx 2 to lx 2 where lx is the screen length of the qanat the elevation of the qanat from the base of the aquifer is zq a vertical pumping well is located at the xw and yw with the screen from zw 1 to zw 2 the general areal recharge is imposed at the top of the unconfined aquifer in this work first the point source sink solution of the problem is obtained then the line source sink solution is obtained from the point source sink one integrating along the horizontal direction finally the constant head

introduced in notations it should be noted the u part of the solution is similar to problem solved by zhan and zlotnik 2002 and the v part considers the areal recharge to the aquifer 2 2 point source

the rate of pumping for a second point sink source l3t 1 that will be used to derive the drawdown for a vertical pumping well later and q wd p is the laplace domain dimensionless counterpart of qw it should be noted that the dimensionless parameters used here are different from that of zhan and zlotnik 2002 and are presented in table 1 eq 8 with respect to initial and boundary conditions of eqs 10

be computed in the following section 2 4 discharge solution of qanat fixed head point the same procedure as in carslaw and jaeger 1959 murdoch and franco 1994 samani et al 2006 is followed to obtain solution of discharge of the qanat using eq 22 as 26 q qd p l xd q qd p l xd s wd p f q 0 34 l xd r q d z qd q wd p l xd f w 0 34 l xd r q d z qd f q 0 34 l xd r q d z qd r p l xd f r z qd f q 0 34 l

represents the radius of the qanat and is set to 0 05 m it should be noted that the location of a fixed head point on the periphery of qanat is selected based as suggestion by samani et al 2006 for more discussion on the location of the fixed head point the readers are referred to the following papers rosa and carvalho 1989 samani et al 2006 eq 26 consists of three terms the first term is discharge variation due to the decline of water table from its initial position in fact this term shows the discharge variation of a qanat or horizontal drain after its outlet which was closed for a long time to establish the zero drawdown initial condition the late time approximation of the first term represents the base flow of a qanat it should be noted that the first term of eq 26 is equivalent to the discharge variation of a horizontal drain presented by samani et al 2006 the second term reflects the influences of pumping from the nearby well s on qanat discharge this is very important in determining the extraction wells location so that the discharge of qanat will not be affected finally the last term illustrates the effects of areal recharge on qanat discharge hydrograph this term the last term can be used to obtain the hydraulic parameters of aquifer and the amount of recharge using the discharge variation data of the qanat after eliminating the base flow term 2 5 discharge solution of qanat well screen segmentation to simulate the qanat the entire wellbore is better treated as a uniform head boundary rather than a uniform flux boundary it can be done numerically by discretizing the wellbore to finite segments with each of them with a constant flux the reader may consult the following papers for more discussion on the well segmentation chang and chen 2003 penmatcha and aziz 1998 wang and zhan 2017a wang and zhan 2017b to obtain the solution of the discharge of each segment the following equation should be considered obtained from eq 22 27 s

above equation eq 27 is organized into the following matrix wang and zhan 2017a 28 f q 1 1 f q 1 2 f q 1 n f q 2 1 f q 2 2 f q 2 n f qn 1 f qn 2 f qn n q q d 1 p q q d 2 p q qdn p s wd p q wd p f w 1

the drawdown in well segment i created by flow into the nearby pumping well the above matrix should be solved for q qdi for each segment the total discharge of qanat is obtained as 29 q qd p i 1 n l xdi q qdi p where l xdi is the length of each segment that is uniform 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical evaluation of the solution the laplace domain matrix of eq 28 is solved using matlab the stehfest 1970 or de hoog et al 1982 algorithm can be utilized to obtain time domain discharge data the de hoog et al 1982 is more stable and works well when a periodic function is used to simulate the areal recharge or the discharge variations of the pumping well it is however slower than the stehfest 1970 algorithm that is used to prepare type curves in this work we discretize qanat into 16 segments as it is sufficient for graphical presentation of the results wang and zhan 2017b increasing the number of segments does not increase the accuracy of the solution but significantly increases the computational time and may lead to unstable results chang and chen 2003 3 2 components of the discharge eliminating the pumping due to the nearby well and the recharge eq 26 is reduced to the discharge equation presented by samani et al 2006 the right hand side of eq 28 consists of three terms that represent the influences of the initial condition base flow pumping of the nearby wells and areal recharge respectively to illustrate effects of these terms on discharge variation of a qanat fig 2 is constructed using the default parameters introduced in table 2 samani et al 2006 sedghi and zhan 2019b the following function is used to simulate the constant recharge 30 r d t d r 0 d h t d t d r 1 h t d t d r 2 where h is the heaviside step function and r 0 d is the dimensionless constant recharge rate applied to the water table during the dimensionless time from tdr 1 to tdr 2 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 30 is 31 r d p r 0 d exp p t d r 1 p exp p t d r 2 p following the same manner the discharge of the nearby pumping well can be modelled using the following function 32 q wd t d q 0 w d h t d t std where q 0 w d is the constant rate discharge per unit length started from the dimensionless time of tstd the laplace domain counterpart of eq 32 is 33 q wd p q 0 w d exp p t std p eqs 31 and 33 are substituted into eq 28 to prepare fig 2 two dimensionless elevations of qanat are considered zqd 0 1 black lines and zqd 0 9 red lines this figure for deep qanat zqd 0 1 illustrates the three components of the qanat discharge as shown in the figure the discharge due to falling of the water table from its initial position shows three stages during the first stage the discharge decreases as the head in the aquifer decreases due to release of water from the aquifer storage the gravity drainage of the water table stabilizes the drawdown in the aquifer and maintains the hydraulic gradient toward the qanat during the second stage when the discharge levels off during the third stage the discharge of the qanat decreases again with the lower slope and reaches the quasi steady state condition samani et al 2006 the dimensionless discharge of the shallow qanat zqd 0 9 is significantly less than that of the deep one zqd 0 1 due to the lower hydraulic gradient toward it furthermore discharge variation of the shallow qanat is markedly less than that of the deep qanat as it is close to the water table during the early time all curves follow a common curve this is due to the fact that the water recharged to aquifer does not significantly affect the drawdown furthermore the cone of depression does not reach the qanat to reduce its discharge therefore the discharge of qanat is solely affected by the falling of water table from its initial position during the early time recharge to the water table from the dimensionless time of 10 to 10 000 increases the discharge of qanat as is evident in fig 2 extraction from the pumped well from the dimensionless time of 350 decreases the discharge of the qanat as expected it should be noted that the qanat is considered as a constant head source sink thus if the water table falls below the qanat elevation the discharge of the qanat becomes negative and is no longer valid we further compare the discharge that is obtained using the segmented qanat utilizing eq 28 black lines and the case with a single constant head point on qanat periphery utilizing eq 26 hollow circles the figure shows that the deviation of the case with the non segmented qanat from the segmented case are significant when the nearby pumping well is considered in other case the deviation of discharge is not significant it should be noted that the segmented qanat is considered in preparing the curves that are presented in this work 3 3 influences of the hydraulic and the geometric parameters in this subsection the influences of the specific yield sy and the dimensionless length of qanat on the discharge variation are explored the default parameters given in table 2 are used to prepare the curves presented here fig 3 illustrates the effects of the specific yield sy of the aquifer on the dimensionless discharge of the qanat we eliminate the first and the second right hand side terms of eq 28 therefore it only shows the influences of the areal recharge the recharge is applied from the dimensionless time of 10 to 10000 the figure shows that increasing the specific yield decreases the discharge due to the areal recharge it is due to the fact that as the specific yield increases the water table rises due to the recharge and the hydraulic gradient toward the qanat decreases resulting in a reduction of discharge of the qanat the influence of recharge is diminished over time after the recharge to the aquifer stopped as expected the effects of sy on the first right hand side term of eq 28 are examined by eliminating the second and third right hand side terms of eq 28 fig 4 in fact this figure shows the dimensionless discharge variation of the qanat due to the declining of water table from its initial position as shown in the figure increasing the specific yield increases the dimensionless discharge the reason for this is that the water table decline is reduced by increasing sy and this maintains the hydraulic gradient toward the qanat and leads to a higher discharge fig 5 depicts the amount of decreases of the dimensionless discharge due to the effects of a nearby pumping well this figure is prepared eliminating the first and the third right hand side terms of eq 28 different values of sy as in fig 3 are tested this figure shows that increasing sy decreases the effects of nearby wells on the dimensionless discharge of the qanat for the same reason explained in fig 4 this effects increases overtime as the cone of depression expands toward the qanat to investigate the effects of the dimensionless length of the qanat on the dimensionless discharge variation fig 6 is prepared as expected increasing the dimensionless length of the qanat increases the discharge of the qanat due to the areal recharge as it increases the area of the influence of the qanat it is worth noting that the dimensionless length of the qanat is proportional with the length of the qanat and the square root of the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and inversely proportional with the square root of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer table 1 thus the influences of the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer are also reflected in fig 6 increasing the dimensionless length of the qanat increasing the dimensionless discharge due to the declining of water table from its initial position and reduces the effects of nearby wells on the discharge figs 7 and 8 moreover the definition of the dimensionless discharge and time table 1 should be considered utilizing figs 6 7 and 8 to explore the effects of hydraulic conductivities according to the definition of lxd table 1 increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer will increase the dimensionless length and therefore increase the discharge of the qanat based on the definition of the dimensionless time table 1 increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer reduces the time that is needed for the qanat to response to the areal recharge and effects of nearby wells increasing the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh of the aquifer reduces the dimensionless length of the qanat this however increases the dimensional discharge of the qanat as q q d k h d 2 the influences of kh on increasing the discharge of qanat due to the areal recharge dominate its effects on decreasing the dimensionless length of the qanat figs 6 7 and 8 3 4 influences of the nearby pumping well overexploitation of aquifers dry out many qanats in iran thus it is very important to explore the effects of nearby pumping wells on the discharge of the qanat in this subsection we explore the influences of distance partial penetration and the screen depth on the discharge of the qanat again default parameters values given in table 2 are used to prepare figures of this subsection the second and third right hand side parts of eq 28 are eliminated to prepare figures the vertical axis of these figures are the amount of decreases in the discharge of the qanat due to the effects of a nearby pumping well to investigate the effects of the distance along the y axis on the discharge variation of the qanat fig 9 is prepared this figure shows that increasing the distance from the qanat decreases the discharge of the qanat this decrease occurs in three stages for the pumping well close to the qanat this is due to the gravity drainage that contributes to the pumped water from the pumping well during the intermediate time we explore the effects of the partial penetration of the nearby pumping well on the discharge of the qanat the results are presented in fig 10 as shown in this figure increasing the screen length of the pumping well decreases the discharge of the qanat during the intermediate time as the horizontal component of flow becomes more significant comparing to the case with a shorter screen the influences of the elevation of the screen are tested in fig 11 as depicted in this figure increasing the depth of the screen decreasing its elevation will decrease the discharge of the qanat as it decreases the contribution of the water table drainage to the pumped water from the well and increases the expansion of the cone of depression during the intermediate time 3 5 horton s infiltration equation as the recharge function the presented solution can be used to evaluate the discharge variation of qanat subjected to an arbitrary areal recharge to demonstrate this the horton s equation of infiltration is considered as the recharge function r t 34 r t f c f 0 f c exp k t 1 h t t e where fc is the final recharge rate lt 1 f0 is the initial recharge rate lt 1 k is a coefficient to simulate the rate of the recharge variation over time t 1 te is the end time of recharge t it should be note that the horton s equation of infiltration is multiplied by 1 h t t e to stop the recharge at time of te the dimensionless form of eq 34 is obtained as 35 r d t d f c d f 0 d f cd exp k d t d 1 h t d t ed where fcd and f 0 d are respectively the dimensionless forms of fc and f0 ted is the dimensionless form of te presented in table 1 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 35 is 36 r d p f c d exp t ed p 1 p f 0 d f cd exp t ed p k d 1 p k d inserting r d p into eq 26 for the case with no well segmentation or eq 28 for the case with the well segmentation the discharge variation of a qanat due to the areal recharge simulated by eq 34 is obtained to show the effects of recharge simulated by eq 34 on the discharge variation of the qanat fig 12 is prepared the following default parameters are used f 0 2 7 10 5 m s 1 two dimensionless elevations of the qanat zqd 0 1 and zqd 0 9 are considered as illustrated in the figure increasing the elevation of the qanat from the base of the aquifer increases its discharge due to the areal f c 2 7 10 6 m s 1 recharge as shallower qanat is closer to the water table where the areal recharge is imposed 3 6 qanat depletion volume the following equation can be used to calculate the cumulative depletion volume of the qanat 37 q d v t d 0 t d q q τ d τ where qdv is the cumulative qanat depletion volume l3 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 37 is 38 q d v p

qdv for two qanat lengths of 50 and 100 m with the result illustrated in fig 13 as expected increasing the length of the qanat increases the depletion volume it should be noted that the late time decrease in qdv is not valid and it is caused by the lowering of the water table below the qanat periphery due to pumping from the nearby wells eqs 39 and 40 are applicable to calculate the water budget of the aquifer depleted by qanat 4 summary and conclusions the laplace domain solution of the discharge variation of a qanat in an unconfined aquifer due to the aquifer depletion areal recharge and a nearby pumping well is obtained the aquifer is anisotropic with an infinite extent the time domain discharge is obtained using numerical inverse laplace transformation the applicability of the presented solution to simulate the horton s infiltration equation as the recharge function is demonstrated and the qanat depletion volume that is applicable to the aquifer budget calculation is presented as well the following results are drawn from this research 1 increasing the specific yield of the aquifer will a decrease the discharge of the qanat due to the areal recharge b increase the dimensionless discharge due to the declining of the water table from its initial position and c decrease the effects of nearby wells on the dimensionless discharge of the qanat increasing the dimensionless length of the qanat will have similar findings 2 increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer will increase the dimensionless length and therefore increases the discharge of the qanat increasing the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer reduces the time that is needed for the qanat to response to the areal recharge and effects of nearby wells the influences of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer on increasing the dimensional discharge of the qanat dominates its effects on decreasing the dimensionless length of the qanat thus it increases the discharge of the qanat 3 increasing the screen length of the vertical pumping well decreases the discharge of the qanat during the intermediate time as the horizontal component of flow becomes more significant comparing to the case with a shorter screen increasing the depth of the screen will decrease the discharge of the qanat as it decreases the contribution of the water table drainage to the pumped water from the well and increases the expansion of the cone of depression during the intermediate time 4 discharge of the shallow qanats are more sensitive to the areal

5639,the contamination of groundwater with dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl can pose long term risks to human health due to the complexity of geological environments and the properties of dnapl a key step in human health risk hhr assessment is the establishment of a reliable dnapl transport model in this study we evaluate the impact of the model structure uncertainty on dnapl transport modeling for hhr assessment first gaussian process regression gpr was used to learn the structure error of the dnapl transport model through statistical simulations and then markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation was used to calibrate the parameters of the physical model and gpr on the basis of two case studies namely a sandbox experiment and a synthetic dnapl transport model investigation the results demonstrated that ignoring the model structure error will lead to deviations during parameter calibrations and model predictions this is because the model parameters could be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error during the calibration process results of variance decomposition verified that the model structure error was the main uncertainty source in dnapl transport modeling for both of the case studies the dnapl transport modeling and hhr assessment conducted by quantifying the uncertainties of the model parameters and structure simultaneously was found to be more reliable than that by calibrating only the model parameters in addition the hhr assessment of groundwater dnapl contamination without considering the model structure error could lead to misleading depictions of the key risk zone we propose that gpr is an effective technique to quantitatively describe the structure error of dnapl transport models keywords model structure uncertainty gaussian process regression human health risk dnapl transport markov chain monte carlo simulation 1 introduction in many regions around the world groundwater is an important source of water for humans and the ecological environment presently along with rapid industrialization the contamination of groundwater is threatening the water security of many communities burri et al 2019 rodríguez lado et al 2013 the groundwater contaminants are diverse such as heavy metal ions pesticide residues and industrial organic compounds lapworth et al 2012 teh et al 2016 teijon et al 2010 some of these contaminants are soluble in groundwater while some are insoluble the insoluble liquid contaminants are also called non aqueous phase liquids napls if the contamination is heavier than water it is referred to as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls kueper et al 1993 some dnapls e g perchloroethylene pce are toxic and these can pose serious hazards to human health and the ecological environment henri et al 2016 a key step in assessing human health risk hhr is to calculate the contaminant concentration that an individual is exposed to de barros and fiori 2014 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 teh et al 2016 it is difficult to monitor dnapl transport in groundwater because it can pass through the unsaturated zone and downward by gravity in the saturated zone until it reaches the bottom of an aquifer kueper et al 1993 moreno barbero 2005 moreover some dnapls can be transferred into the aqueous phase as a dissolution component and these chemicals can be transported in groundwater as solutes the dnapl transport process involves the transport of dnapl components and associated dissolved solutes in the aqueous phase as well as dnapl vapors in the gas phase falta et al 1995 lehame et al 2003 presently numerical models are often used to quantitatively delineate the process of dnapl transport in groundwater giraud et al 2018 parker and park 2004 tatti et al 2019 the reliability of dnapl transport numerical models especially in regard to the dnapl component and dissolved solutes in the aqueous phase has attracted widespread concerns among the groundwater hydrology community quantifying the modeling uncertainty of a dnapl transport model is necessary for assessing the distribution of dnapl and hhr over the past several decades a large number of researchers have focused their attention on uncertainty quantifications of water resources and environmental models dai et al 2019 hamraz et al 2015 højberg and refsgaard 2005 mustafa et al 2018 generally this research has involved quantifying the modeling uncertainty caused by two types of sources namely the model parameters and structure the model parameter uncertainty is concerning because model outputs are sensitive to some model parameters currently several methods are commonly used to deal with parameter uncertainty e g the least square regression lsr method doherty et al 2010 hill and tiedeman 2007 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 hassan et al 2008 and markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation hassan et al 2009 zeng et al 2016a in practice the groundwater model structure e g aquifer structure boundary conditions and chemical reactions of the contaminants is always complex and unknown to the model users neuman and wierenga 2003 troldborg et al 2007 because of the limited observational information these model conditions are often simplified when establishing a dnapl transport model refsgaard et al 2012 the simplification of the model structure can cause a discrepancy between the model results and the actual hydrogeological conditions which will lead to unreliable model outputs e g dnapl concentrations moreover if the model structure uncertainty is not considered during model calibration the model parameters could be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error gaganis 2009 the study of model structure uncertainty has received attention in the past decade enemark et al 2019 currently two types of methods are usually used to treat and quantify the model structure uncertainty i e bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 and data driven error modeling kennedy and o hagan 2001 in bma the modeling uncertainty is quantified through assembling the outputs of all plausible model structures that are weighted based on their performance on reproducing observations raftery et al 2005 zeng et al 2018 the predictions of bma are more reliable than that of a single model because bma incorporates the information on both model parameters and the structure troldborg et al 2010 used four groundwater conceptual models to account for the uncertainty caused by the source zone and geological structure and then the mass discharge of a contaminated site was estimated using bma however the implementation of bma is limited to several aspects e g the assignment of prior weights building sufficient and independent model structures and the accurate estimation of model weights cao et al 2018 lu et al 2015 the data driven error modeling method aims to build a statistical model to represent the model structure error through machine learning algorithms e g gaussian process regression gpr kennedy and o hagan 2001 integrated bayesian calibration and gpr to calibrate the parameter uncertainty and model inadequacy and the prediction uncertainty was quantified by the inferred posterior mean and variance xu and valocchi 2015 developed a bayesian approach to calibrate the parameter uncertainty and gaussian process error model simultaneously for a groundwater flow model and they demonstrated that integrating the gaussian process error model could effectively reduce the predictive bias because of the low demand for prior information on the model structure the data driven error modeling method shows great flexibility in the uncertainty quantification of the model structure xu et al 2017a the results of hhr assessment depend on the estimation of the contamination s distribution thus it is necessary to quantify the groundwater model structure error to obtain a reliable concentration distribution and scientifically sound hhr assessment in this study we integrate the model structure uncertainty quantification into the hhr assessment of groundwater dnapl contamination and the model structure error is described by a data driven error modeling method i e gpr in addition the impact of the model structure uncertainty on dnapl transport modeling and the hhr assessment was also evaluated through two case studies a two dimension dnapl sandbox experiment and a synthetic three dimension dnapl transport model the two case studies verified the validity of the gpr method moreover the bayesian theory based uncertainty quantification often requires tens of thousands of model executions to calibrate the model parameters and structure and the resulting heavy computation time becomes an obstacle to hhr assessment in order to overcome this burden the sparse grid stochastic collocation technique bungartz and dirnstorfer 2003 was used to build cheap to run surrogates for dnapl transport models in this study furthermore the hhr assessment framework proposed in this study is independent of the specific groundwater dnapl transport model and thus it is applicable to any water environmental model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the framework of the hhr assessment dnapl transport model mcmc simulation gpr variance decomposition and sparse grid surrogate technique are briefly introduced in section 2 section 3 describes the settings of the two case studies namely a sandbox experiment and a synthetic model section 4 describes the implementation of the methods the results and discussion of the two case studies are presented in section 5 and the conclusions are given in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 human health risk assessment we applied the u s environmental protection agency epa risk assessment guidance for superfund rags to assess the hhr epa 2009 the contaminant pce is carcinogenic and long term intake can lead to human endocrine system and immune system dysfunction liver and kidney function damage and even death guyton et al 2014 in the rags model carcinogenic risk is quantified by estimating the increased probability of an individual suffering from cancer in a lifetime kumar et al 2015 saleh et al 2019 the risk is calculated as follows 1 r i s k x 1 e cpf a d d x where cpf represents the cancer potency factor kg d mg and add represents the average daily dose mg kg d x represents the control plane at the flow direction as shown in fig 1 control planes represent the environmentally sensitive locations that are densely populated or contain human inhabitants henri et al 2016 the epa defines acceptable risk as values between 10 4 and 10 6 epa 2009 and we set the acceptable risk value as 10 6 in this work for clarity that is to say if the risk is higher than 10 6 an individual would be subjected to unacceptable threats from the contaminant in the rags model the add is an important parameter that is related to many factors such as the contaminant concentration and individual exposure level the exposure pathways are various e g dermal sorption from showering ingestion of tap water inhalation of air de barros and rubin 2008 kumar et al 2015 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 this work focuses on the impact of transport modeling of dnapl in groundwater on the hhr assessment thus only the ingestion of tap water was considered in this study and the add was calculated as follows 2 a d d x c x ir bw ed e f at where ir represents the ingestion rate of water l d bw represents the body weight kg ed

work the parameters in eqs 1 and 2 except c were set to experience values 2 2 dnapl transport simulation t2voc tough2 volatile organic compound is a module of the tough2 family code it is based on the integral finite difference method and has been widely used to solve multiphase contaminant transport problems mccray and falta 1997 niessner and helmig 2007 generally t2voc assumes a multiphase system with the following three mass components ω air a water w and organic chemicals n these chemicals are distributed in one or more of the following three phases γ gas g aqueous w and napl n the balance equation for danpl transport is written as follows falta et al 1995 4 d dt v n m ω d v n γ n f ω n d γ n v n q ω d v n where mω represents the mass of component ω in the unit pore volume kg vn represents the arbitrary flow region γn represents the surface area m2 fω represents the flux of component ω into volume vn n represents the inward unit normal vector and qω represents the rate of heat generation in the unit pore volume the motion of each phase of the fluid is under the influence of pressure gravity effective permeability and phase viscosity following the multiphase extension

ηγ represents the γ phase dynamic viscosity cp pγ is the fluid pressure in phase γ pa and g is the gravitational acceleration vector m s2 moreover the dnapl transport process is also affected by the relative permeability and capillary pressure between the phases in this work we apply the stone function to describe the relationship between the relative permeability and saturation the parker and lenhard function can be used to illustrate the relationship between the capillary pressure and saturation the relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is written as follows stone

parameter in t2voc hydrodynamic dispersion is neglected and molecular diffusion is simulated for the gas phase only basu et al 2008 falta et al 1995 mass transfer is depicted by advection in all phases bennett et al 1998 james and oldenburg 1997 fluid phases are assumed to be in local chemical equilibrium for each element so that interphase mass transfer among all phases can be described by equilibrium partitioning relations gudbjerg et al 2005 neriah and paster 2019 the water in the napl phase is neglected the model accounts for a interphase mass transfer b adsorption of napls to the solid phase and c decay of napls by biodegradation falta et al 1995 the relevant mechanisms of interphase mass transfer for napl include napl evaporation dissolution and gaseous aqueous mass transfer dafny 2017 in this work we only considered dnapl transport in a saturated aquifer so we were only concerned with the dnapl component and dnapl dissolution transport in the aqueous phase for the dnapl dissolution transport in the aqueous phase t2voc produces a velocity dependent numerical dispersion it has a comparable effect to hydrodynamic dispersion dafny 2017 t2voc has been successfully implemented in the modeling of dnapl transport and dissolution processes in many research projects bennett et al 1998 james and oldenburg 1997 2 3 markov chain monte carlo simulation the relationship between the model f and the observations d can be written as 11 d f θ ε where ε represents the residuals errors based on bayes theorem the posterior distribution p θ d of model parameters θ is described as 12 p θ d l θ d p θ l θ d p θ d θ where l θ d represents the joint likelihood function of observation data d and parameters θ θ θ 1 θ 2 θ d represent d dimensional model parameters p θ represents the prior distribution of parameters θ and it is usually specified by the user according to expert experience or pilot experiments because the likelihood function of nonlinear model f is very complicated it is intractable to derive the analytical expression of the posterior distribution p θ d yet the mcmc method provides an effective way to construct the posterior distribution via markov chain samples haario et al 2001 it builds a single or parallel markov chains to search for the probability space of parameters markov chain samples evolve from the prior parameter distribution to posterior distribution gradually by incorporating all information in this work the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs algorithm was used to perform mcmc simulation and this algorithm has been widely used to calibrate model parameters in high dimensional and complex hydrology problems wöhling et al 2012 zeng et al 2016a the details of this algorithm can be found in earlier studies laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt et al 2009 the gaussian likelihood function is often chosen as the expression of the joint likelihood 13 l θ d 2 π n 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 d f θ t σ 1 d f θ where n represents the number of observations σ represents the residual s covariance matrix and f θ represents the output of a nonlinear model f e g dnapl transport model 2 4 gaussian process regression as mentioned in section 2 3 the residuals error ε represents the deviation between model output and observation generally this deviation is derived from three sources including observation error biased model parameters θ and defected model structure the uncertainty derived from observation and model parameters is well calibrated through assuming the error structure of residuals and bayesian inference respectively in mcmc in order to quantify the model structure error explicitly the relationship between observation d and model f is expressed as 14 d f θ b m φ δ where b m φ represents the model structure error m represents the inputs of the model φ represents tuning parameters and δ represents the observation error the data driven machine learning provides an effective way to characterize model structure errors and the gpr method is used in this study kennedy and o hagan 2001 xu et al 2014 the prior distribution of the gaussian process function b m φ obeys a multivariate gaussian distribution n μ c the gaussian process is specified by a mean function μ m e b m and a covariance function q m m e b m μ m b m μ m in this work the squared exponential covariance function is applied 15 c i j q m i m j σ 2 exp m i m j t m i m j λ 2 σ δ 2 ψ i j 1 2 n where ψ represents the indicator function when i j ψ equals one and otherwise it equals zero λ σ2 and σδ 2 are three hyper parameters λ represents the characteristic length scale σ2 controls the marginal variance of b m and σδ 2 describes the errors except for the model structure error such as the measurement error generally the prior mean μ is assumed as zero and the uncorrelated errors obey independent and identical normal distributions the model parameters θ and gaussian process model hyper parameters φ λ σ2 σδ 2 are jointly calibrated through bayesian inference in addition the prior probability is specified as p θ φ p θ p φ and the prior distributions of θ and φ are assumed to be independent according to bayes theorem the posterior probability is formed as 16 p θ φ d p d θ φ p θ p φ where p d θ φ represents the likelihood function here we chose the logarithmic form to describe 17 log p d θ φ 1 2 d f θ μ t c 1 d f θ μ 1 2 log c n 2 log 2 π the same as described in section 2 3 we applied mcmc simulation to estimate the posterior distributions of θ and φ jointly after the posterior samples of θ and φ are generated the predictions of f θ and b m φ for a new input x denoted as f θ and b m φ respectively can be obtained the probability distribution of b m φ obeys the normal distribution n b c b b and 18 b e b d f θ φ μ c t c 1 d f θ μ 19 c b b c c t c 1 c here the asterisk superscript represents the variable associated with x μ means μ x φ c is the prior covariance matrix c is calculated as c i j k x i x j and c is calculated as c i j k x i x j as a result the predicted output at x is expressed as follows 20 d f b δ in summary the implementation of the gpr based model structure uncertainty analysis can be summarized as follows i define the prior distribution of the unknown hyper parameters φ and model parameters θ ii use mcmc simulation to obtain the posterior distribution of φ and θ and then calculate f c c and c based on the obtained posterior samples and eqs 15 and 17 iii use multivariate normal sampling to attain b i and δ i and then calculate the predicted d i by using eqs 18 20 2 5 variance decomposition the variance decomposition method can be used to quantify the contributions of uncertainty sources e g model parameter and structure error measurement error to the total predictive uncertainty kumar et al 2019 xu et al 2017b according to the law of total variance the variance of the prediction d can be calculated as 21 v d e θ b σ δ v δ θ b σ δ d θ b σ δ e θ v b θ e σ δ δ θ b d θ b v θ e b σ δ δ θ d θ where v represents the variance and e represents the expectation the other notations are the same as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 the left side of eq 21 is the variance of d i i 1 m which means the total predictive uncertainty and the posterior predictive samples are obtained by eq 20 the first term of the right side of eq 21 represents the measurement uncertainty the second and third terms represent the uncertainty of the model structure and parameters respectively more details about variance decomposition and the calculation process can be found in xu et al 2017a dai and ye 2015 and hoeting et al 1999 2 6 sparse grid surrogate technique because of the massive number of computations required during the model calibration process we implemented sparse grid stochastic collocation to construct a surrogate model thereby replacing the original dnapl transport numerical model sparse grid sg surrogate models are built from a series of lagrange interpolants for a nonlinear function e g the dnapl transport model f θ the one dimensional hierarchical lagrange interpolant lr is defined as 22 l r l f θ i 0 l δ l r i f θ i 0 l j 0 m i c o j i φ j i θ i 0 l where l represents the resolution level δlr represents the incremental interpolation operator mi represents the number of sg nodes for level i coj i represents the corresponding interpolation coefficient and φi i θ represents the interpolation basis function for a multi dimension model f θ θ θ 1 θ 2 θ d the multi dimensional hierarchical interpolation mlr is performed similarly to that of a one dimensional function and the sg nodes are generated in the manner of the smolyak rule smolyak 1963 the required sg nodes are significantly less than those of a full tensor product grid in order to further reduce the number of sg nodes i e the costs of building the surrogate some adaptive sg node refinement strategies have been developed e g local adaptive sg ma and zabaras 2009b zeng et al 2016b dimensional adaptive sg gerstner and griebel 2003 zeng et al 2012 local dimensional adaptive sg jakeman and roberts 2011 jakeman and roberts 2013 in this study local dimensional adaptive refinement was used more details about the construction of the adaptive sg surrogate e g calculating sg coefficients defining the sg basis function can be found in ma and zabaras 2009a pflüger et al 2010 and zhang et al 2013 3 descriptions of the two case studies two case studies were used in this study namely a sandbox dnapl transport experiment and a synthetic groundwater dnapl transport model investigation for each case study the true model structure and the defective model structure caused by oversimplification or limited information respectively are both described 3 1 dnapl transport sandbox experiment in this section a two dimensional sandbox experiment model is used to simulate dnapl transport fig 2 a the sandbox was 60 0 cm in length 45 0 cm in height and 1 6 cm in thickness the left and right boundaries were set to a neumann boundary and the flow velocity was kept at 1 5 m d by use of a peristaltic pump the sandbox was filled with quartz with a particle size of 0 60 0 85 mm sand a moreover five rectangular lenses consisting of low permeability quartz with a particle size of 0 18 0 22 mm sand b were placed in the sandbox the injection point was located above the uppermost lenses at x 30 0 cm y 40 0 cm and z 0 8 cm the pce injection rate was 0 5 ml min and the total amount of pce in the sandbox was 40 ml we monitored pce saturation in the sandbox for the observations and these data were measured by the light transmission method ltm based on the ltm image fig 2 b we can see that the pce bypassed the four lenses and was transported to the bottom of the box the experiment observation period was 80 min and the sampling interval was 5 min we used the observations before 60th min to calibrate the numerical transport model and used the latter observations from 61th min to 80th to validate this model in practice it is difficult to accurately characterize the structure of a groundwater aquifer this study assumes that the established groundwater conceptual model deviates from the true aquifer structure i e the left lense was missed by the conceptual model due to inadequate geological drilling fig 2 c and this defective model structure was used to simulate the transport of dnapl 3 2 synthetic dnapl transport model the synthetic three dimensional groundwater model had three aquifers as shown in fig 3 a the model domain was 1000 m long 100 m wide and 20 m thick we set three sands for the three aquifers respectively e g sand 1 sand 2 and sand 3 the permeability of three sands was ranked as follows sand 1 sand 2 sand 3 as shown in fig 3 the upper sand 1 and lower sand 2 aquifers were separated by an uneven and thin aquitard sand 3 e g a mudstone aquitard the distribution of the middle model layer was discontinuous and the thickness was not uniform for each layer the porous medium was regarded as homogenous and isotropic the left and right boundaries were constant water heads with hydraulic gradients of 0 01 the other model boundaries were all set to impermeable when assessing the hhr we assumed a scenario that a total of 85 kg pce had been poured into the aquifers 50 days earlier the pour site was around x 50 m y 50 m at the top of the first layer therefore the aquifers had already been contaminated by pce before the hhr assessment fig 4 exhibits the initial pce concentration distribution in aquifer in actual situations we are unable to attain sufficient information on the distribution of groundwater aquifers especially for thin and discontinuous layers as a result a defective model structure is often used to represent such groundwater systems in this case study we assumed that the all aquifers were simplified to uniform layers because of the limited borehole information on the thin aquitard this simplified model structure had the same model domain and boundary conditions with that of the true model structure as presented in fig 3 b in addition the thicknesses of the three even model layers were set to 9 0 m 2 0 m and 9 0 m respectively from top to bottom in this case study the observation data were generated by running the true model two observation wells were placed in the aquifer to monitor the concentration of pce and these were equipped with screens at the first layer obs1 and the third layer obs2 as shown in fig 4 a and c the concentrations in the wells were recorded once a month over five years thus for each well there were 60 concentration records as terminology we use obs1 1 to obs1 60 to present the 60 observations monitored in obs1 and similar codes for the data for obs2 the total number of observations was 120 these observations were eroded with gaussian random error with a mean of 0 and variance of 3 in relation to the observed data and then the results were used as conditional data for each observation well the conditional data were divided into two parts the former 50 observations were used for model calibration and the latter 10 observations were used for model validation 4 implementation of the methodology the dnapl transport modeling based on the defective model structure was conducted for each groundwater dnapl transport case the sandbox experiment and the synthetic model for each case study the dnapl transport model s parameter uncertainty was quantified by mcmc and the gpr method was used for quantifying the model structure uncertainty the variance decomposition method was used to quantify different uncertainty sources contributions to the total predictive uncertainty this uncertainty quantification method was verified by the two groundwater examples and then the synthetic model was implemented to conduct the hhr assessment 4 1 uncertainty quantification of the sandbox dnapl transport model in this case study the dnapl s saturation distribution of the sandbox experiment was predicted in two ways the first was to quantify only the parameter uncertainty of the dnapl transport model and the second was to quantify both the model parameter and structure uncertainty according to section 3 1 we applied t2voc to simulate the pce transport in the sandbox the simulation was generalized into a two dimensional x z section the x and z directions were uniformly discretized into 30 and 45 grids respectively for the uncertainty quantification of model parameters five important model parameters were regarded as random variables including the permeability of sand a k a and sand b k b the residual napl phase saturations of sand a snr a and sand b snr b and the viscosity of pce ηn the meaning of these parameters can be found in section 2 2 the prior distributions of these parameters were defined as uniform distributions and the distribution ranges were defined as 2 0 10 10 5 0 10 10 for k a 8 0 10 12 3 5 10 11 for k b 0 05 0 12 for snr a 0 05 0 12 for snr b and 0 6 1 2 for ηn the mcmc simulations were used to infer posterior parameters distributions through bayes theory and dreamzs was used as the searching algorithm three parallel chains were applied to conduct the mcmc simulations and the iteration length of each chain was set to 12 000 with a burn in period of 3000 after the mcmc simulations were completed the generated posterior distributions of the model parameters were used for predicting the dnapl saturation distribution for the uncertainty quantification of the model structure in addition to quantifying the model parameters uncertainty the gpr method was used to describe the model structure error the random model parameters and their prior distributions were the same as those described above in addition the squared exponential covariance function was used to build the gpr error model in this study eq 15 including three hyper parameters i e the characteristic length scale λ the standard deviation σ and the standard deviation of measurement error σδ the prior distribution was defined as a gamma distribution g 5 0 5 0 for λ and the range was set to 0 2 2 0 an exponential distribution with a mean of 0 25 was defined as the prior distribution of σ and the range was set to 0 0002 2 0 the σδ follows a uniform prior distribution on 0 002 0 5 the model parameters and gpr model s hyper parameters were jointly calibrated through mcmc simulations moreover the mcmc simulations were implemented with the same setting to that used for the parameter uncertainty quantification above after the posterior predictive samples were obtained by the mcmc method we conduct variance decomposition to quantify the contributions of model parameters model structure and measurement error to the predictive uncertainty generally one forward run of this dnapl transport model by t2voc code takes more than 100 s on a personal computer pc 8 core i7 6700 3 40 ghz processors in order to overcome the problem of heavy time consumption caused by the large number of model executions in mcmc simulations i e 72 000 forward model runs would have been required for this case study the sg technique was used to build surrogate models specifically we built an sg surrogate model to emulate the response relationship between the model output pce saturation and model input five random model parameters the original dnapl transport model was executed for 4801 times to build this surrogate model i e the cost of building this sg surrogate model was 4801 forward model runs after the surrogate model was constructed we tested the surrogate accuracy by comparing the outputs pce saturation of the surrogate model and the original dnapl transport model with 150 random model parameter sets fig 5 illustrates the comparison between them the rmse root mean square error between the outputs of these two models was approximately 1 0 10 3 in addition the r2 coefficient of determination between the outputs of these two models was more than 0 997 obviously the sg surrogate model showed sufficient accuracy in emulating the response relationship between pce saturation and model parameters the performance of each dnapl transport modeling was quantitatively measured by the log score metric hoeting et al 1999 which was defined as 23 log s c o r e i 1 n log p δ i d where δ i means a predictive quantity e g dnapl concentration p δ i d is the posterior predictive probability of δ i i 1 n under observation d and n means the number of validation observations or model parameters in this study a smaller log score value indicates a better predictive performance 4 2 uncertainty quantification of the synthetic dnapl transport model in this case study the hhr of synthetic groundwater dnapl contamination was assessed with two approaches i e the dnapl transport was modeled by only considering the model parameter uncertainty and by considering both the model parameter and structure uncertainty respectively the metric of log score was used to measure the performance of each dnapl transport modeling effort according to section 3 2 we built a three dimensional pce transport model by using t2voc the x y and z directions were uniformly discretized into 30 8 and 11 grids respectively the procedures for applying the mcmc and gpr methods were similar to those in section 4 1 the unknown model parameters in the synthetic model included the permeability and pce water inlet pressure reciprocal of the two model layers sand 1 and sand 2 the meanings of these parameters are described in section 2 2 the prior ranges of these four model parameters were specified as 1 0 10 10 5 0 10 10 for the permeability of sand 1 k1 40 60 for the pce water inlet pressure reciprocal of sand 1 αnw 1 8 0 10 11 2 0 10 10 for the permeability of sand 1 k2 and 20 40 for the pce water inlet pressure reciprocal of sand 2 αnw 2 in addition the prior uniform distributions were assumed for these parameters three parallel markov chains were set in the mcmc simulations and the iteration length and burn in length were set to 9000 and 3000 respectively for each chain the three hyper parameters of the gpr model had the same prior probability functions to those described in section 4 1 and the distribution ranges were defined as 0 2 4 0 for λ 0 0002 0 2 for σ and 0 002 0 5 for σδ moreover the setting of mcmc simulations was the same as that used for the parameter uncertainty analysis above after that the dnapl concentration distribution was generated based on the obtained parameters posterior distributions and gpr and then these data were used for the hhr assessment the variance decomposition method was used to quantify the contributions of uncertainty sources e g model parameters model structure and measurement error to the predictive uncertainty for the two hhr assessments i e with and without gpr respectively of this synthetic case study some parameters of the hhr model were set to constants according to earlier research de barros et al 2009 henri et al 2016 e g the cancer potency factor cpf was 0 0002 kg d mg the ingestion rate ir was 1 6 l d the body weight bw was 70 kg the exposure duration ed was 30 year the exposure frequency ef was 350 d year the average time of the expected lifetime at was 25 550 d moreover 27 control planes were equally spaced along the direction the 1st control plane was located at x 67 m which was close to the contaminant source zone and the interval of each control plane was 33 m the hhrs were assessed at these planes based on eqs 1 and 2 a complete mcmc simulation would have demanded 27 000 iterations to generate posterior parameter samples for each hhr assessment as a result a total of 54 000 dnapl transport model executions would have been required for this case study one forward run of this dnapl transport model by t2voc code would take more than 2 min on a pc 8 core i7 6700 3 40 ghz processors similar to section 4 1 we constructed a cheap to run surrogate model based on the sg technique for the original time consuming dnapl transport model to overcome the computational burden we built the response relationship between the pce concentration and the four model parameters the original dnapl transport model was executed a total of 2206 times at the sg nodes the results of the surrogate accuracy tests are displayed in fig 6 the rmse between the outputs of these two models pce concentration was always smaller than 1 0 10 4 in addition the r2 between the outputs of these two models was always higher than 0 9999 as a result the sg surrogate model had sufficient accuracy to replace the original model 5 results and discussion in this section the dnapl transport modeling and or hhr assessments are evaluated in two ways i e according to whether the model structure uncertainty was quantified or not for each case study moreover the contributions of dnapl transport modeling uncertainty sources to model predictions e g dnapl concentrations were quantified based on variance decomposition 5 1 dnapl transport modeling of the sandbox experiment the dnapl transport modeling of the sandbox experiment was conducted in two ways i e according to whether the model structure error i e the simplification of left lense was considered or not then the inferred dnapl saturation predictions were evaluated and compared at some observation points those not used for model calibration 5 1 1 posterior distributions of model parameters the blue lines in fig 7 present the posterior distributions of model parameters inferred by mcmc simulations without considering the model structure error the horizontal axis denotes the parameter s prior range hereafter the same clearly the high probability density region was distributed in the middle of the prior range for each parameter in addition due to the sandbox experiment being a real case the true values of the model parameters were not available thus it was infeasible to evaluate the accuracy of posterior parameter distributions the red lines in fig 7 present the posterior distributions of five model parameters and three hyper parameters by incorporating the gpr error model into mcmc simulations we found that these five model parameters posterior distributions were apparently different from those inferred by only quantifying the model parameter uncertainty the blue line in addition some parameters posterior distributions e g k a k b snr a displayed the characteristics of a multi modal distribution which indicates that the parameter space was very complex therefore model structure error had a significant impact on the parameter calibration hence ignoring the model structure error may lead to deviations in parameter calibrations this is because the model parameters could be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error moreover the plots of fig 7 f h illustrate that the posterior distributions of three hyper parameters converged to narrower ranges compared to their prior distributions 5 1 2 dnapl transport modeling in order to evaluate the accuracy of dnapl saturation predictions the inferred posterior distributions of dnapl saturation at the validation observations were compared with their true values the vertical black dash dot line the blue lines of fig 8 exhibit the predictions of dnapl saturation at six validation observations without considering the model structure error we found that only one observation x 37 cm y 21 cm t 80 min was predicted with high accuracy i e the predicted distribution had a high probability density at the observed saturation the other five observations were predicted with apparent deviations i e the predicted distribution had a low probability density at these observed saturations in addition the prediction of dnapl saturation showed similar performance at other validation observations and these data are not shown here because of the limited space the log score was equal to 0 79 for all of the validation observations therefore the dnapl saturation distribution cannot be reliably predicted by only accounting for the model parameter uncertainty the red lines of fig 8 present the dnapl saturation predictions inferred by incorporating the gpr results we found that all of the validation observations were predicted with high accuracy i e high predictive probability compared with the blue lines in fig 8 it was obvious that the performance of dnapl saturation predictions was improved significantly by quantifying the dnapl transport model s structural uncertainty except for one observation x 37 cm y 21 cm t 80 min moreover the log score was equal to 9 98 for all validation observations which was much smaller than that without considering the model structure error log score 0 79 therefore it was effective to improve the predictive performance of the dnapl transport model by quantifying the model structure error 5 1 3 variance decomposition for the sandbox experiment fig 9 exhibits the contribution fractions of uncertainty sources model parameter model structure and measurement error to the dnapl transport predictive uncertainty at 20 observations clearly the model structure error was the major uncertainty source in the sandbox experiment model and it accounted for more than 80 of the total uncertainty the measurement error contributed generally less than 1 to the predictive uncertainty the model parameters contributed less than 5 to the predictive uncertainty for most observations except at o 5 and o 12 where the fractions were larger than 10 noteworthy according to fig 8 we can see that the prediction distributions at o 5 and o 12 showed better performance than the other observations when ignoring the model structure error this was because model parameters made more contributions to the predictive uncertainty for these two observations while ignoring the model structure error had less of a negative impact on model predictions moreover the model structure error could be partly compensated by calibrating the model parameters 5 2 hhr assessments of the synthetic case study the dnapl transport modeling and hhr assessment for the synthetic case were conducted in two ways i e according to whether the model structure error i e the simplification of the middle aquifer was quantified or not then the inferred dnapl predictions and hhrs were evaluated and compared 5 2 1 posterior distributions of model parameters fig 10 presents the posterior distributions of the model parameters by mcmc simulations without incorporating the gpr results the vertical black dash line marks the true parameter value hereafter the same the horizontal axis denotes the parameter s prior range clearly all of the model parameters except for αnw 1 were calibrated with apparent deviations by the corresponding posterior distributions and these parameters posterior distributions showed very low probability densities at the corresponding true values the log score was equal to 4 17 for all of the model parameters thus these model parameters cannot be calibrated reliably by using the defective model structure and only considering the model parameter s uncertainty as gpr was used to describe the model structure error the seven parameters which included four model parameters and three hyper parameters were calibrated by mcmc simulations the posterior distributions of these seven parameters are described in fig 11 compared with fig 10 we found that the parameters posterior distributions were closer to their true values and these posterior distributions showed relatively higher probability densities at the corresponding true values the log score was equal to 17 12 for all of the model parameters which was smaller than that without considering the model structure error log score 4 17 therefore ignoring the model structure error could lead to deviations in the model parameters calibrations and these parameters can be better identified by quantifying the model structure uncertainty in addition the posterior distributions of the three hyper parameters converged to much narrower ranges than their corresponding prior distributions 5 2 2 dnapl transport modeling fig 12 shows the obtained predictive distributions of pce concentrations without considering the model structure error the performance of dnapl transport modeling was evaluated at validation observations that were not used for model calibration obs1 1 denotes the 1st observation well at the 1st observation moment hereafter the same because of limited space only six typical observations and their predictions are displayed in this case study the results clearly showed that all of the observations could not be effectively predicted by the simulations and these predictive distributions always deviated significantly from the true values in addition the predictions of dnapl concentrations at other observations displayed similar features to fig 12 the log score was equal to 0 for all of the validation observations 0 log0 0 which means all observations were predicted with a zero probability density at their true values therefore it is inadvisable to describe the dnapl concentration based on a dnapl transport model with structure error although parameter uncertainty quantification is performed the parameter calibration cannot fully compensate for the uncertainty caused by the model structure error fig 13 presents the obtained predictive distributions of pce concentrations when considering the model structure uncertainty the results clearly showed that all of these predictive distributions were concentrated at the true values of observations compared with fig 12 the accuracy of these predictions was improved significantly by incorporating the gpr error model and these predictive distributions showed apparently higher probability densities at the corresponding true values the log score was equal to 14 67 for all of the validation observations which was smaller than that without quantifying the model structure uncertainty log score 0 thus it is more reliable to simulate the transport of dnapl contamination by quantifying the uncertainties of model parameters and structure simultaneously than that by calibrating only model parameters in addition the gpr model was found to be an effective technique to describe the model structure error generally the predictive distributions with the uncertainty quantification of the model structure had wider ranges than those with only quantifying the model parameters uncertainty and some distributions even had a minimum value less than zero this was because the addition of the model structure error term brought about an increase in the prediction variance 5 2 3 variance decomposition for the synthetic model fig 14 illustrates the contribution fractions of uncertainty sources to the predictive uncertainty of the synthetic model at 20 observations obs1 51 60 obs2 51 60 we found that the model structure error accounted for more than 90 of the total uncertainty for all observations of both of the two wells as a result the model structure error dominated the predictive uncertainty of the synthetic model and the model parameters calibration had a limited effect on model predictions this is why the model parameters and predictions were calibrated with significant deviations by ignoring the model structure error as shown by fig 12 5 2 4 hhr assessment the predictive distributions of groundwater contaminant concentrations obtained were used for the hhr assessment the increased probability of an individual suffering from cancer in a lifetime was calculated as shown in eq 1 according to the rags epa 2009 the acceptable risk value was defined as 10 6 in this work fig 15 presents the probability densities of hhr assessed by using the pce concentration distributions without addressing the model structure uncertainty the vertical black line represents the acceptable risk value 10 6 the control planes were numbered from 1 to 27 in the order of distance from the contaminant source plane 1 was closest to the source and plane 27 was farthest from the source because of space limitations here we only display six of the control planes e g from 11th to 16th obviously the hhr decreased as the distance of the control plane from the contaminant source increased in addition for the control plane that was closer to the contaminant source than the 13th control plane the hhr value with the highest probability density was always higher than 10 6 this indicates that necessary actions must be taken to prevent this contamination for the control plane that was farther away from the source than the 13th control plane the hhr value decreased gradually and was less than 10 6 therefore the 13th control plane was called the critical control plane based on this hhr assessment fig 16 exhibits the probability densities of hhrs assessed with the gpr results similar to the tendency shown in fig 15 the hhr decreased as the distance of the control plane from the contaminant source increased however the hhrs assessed by incorporating gpr results were usually slightly higher than those obtained by neglecting the model structure error moreover the ranges of distributions were much wider which indicates that hhr assessed with considering the model structure error had a larger variance based on the assessment of hhr the critical control plane was the 15th control plane compared with the results of fig 15 the critical control plane had changed from the 13th to the 15th control plane when quantifying the results by considering the model structure error although it is not feasible to perform a straightforward evaluation of which way of hhr assessment e g with or without the uncertainty quantification of the model structure is more reasonable we believe that more reliable contaminant concentration predictions will results in more reliable hhr assessments thus the hhr assessed by quantifying the model structure uncertainty is more reliable than that obtained by neglecting the model structure error and in this study the difference between the two ways of hhr assessments was not negligible specifically in the synthetic case study if the hhr is assessed by neglecting the model structure error this would result in underestimation of the risk and misleading depictions of the key risk zone e g the 13th and 14th control planes would be regarded as safe but these areas were actually at high risk to human health according to the rags model eqs 1 and 2 hhr is affected by physiological behavioral and hydrogeological factors the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of the model structure error on the hhr assessment for groundwater dnapl contamination and only hydrogeological factors were evaluated in this research currently some studies have evaluated physiological and behavioral factors in hhr assessment e g de barros and rubin 2008 found that at lower risk values and longer travel times hhr is less sensitive to physiological parameters physiological and behavioral factors can be incorporated in the model parameters uncertainty in a future study moreover the degradation of pce was not considered in this study the pce would degrade into trichloroethylene tce dichloroethylene dce and vinyl chloride vc and finally the contaminants would transform into non toxic ethane in effect henri et al 2015 all of these sub products except ethane could pose hhr and hhr assessment would be improved if the degradation of pce was taken into account in groundwater models 6 conclusion the hhr caused by dnapl contamination in groundwater has aroused widespread public attention we evaluated the impact of the model structure uncertainty on dnapl transport modeling and an hhr assessment by using a data driven error model to describe the model structure uncertainty based on two case studies namely a sandbox experiment and synthetic dnapl transport model the key findings are summarized as follows 1 ignoring the model structure error will lead to deviations in the model parameters posterior distributions and the model parameter will be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error the predictions of dnapl transport model through quantifying the uncertainties of model parameters and structure simultaneously are more reliable than those obtained by calibrating only the model parameters 2 the hhr assessment of groundwater dnapl contamination without considering the model structure error may lead to misleading depictions of the key risk zone it is more reliable to assess hhr by considering the model structure uncertainty than by neglecting the model structure error 3 the gpr method is an effective technique to quantitatively describe the structure error of the dnapl transport model the proposed hhr assessment framework in this study is independent of any specific case studies e g the gpr based model structure error quantification the stochastic collocation sg surrogate method and thus the proposed approach can be used for any complex water environmental models the gpr method was used to learn the model structure error by means of data driven statistical simulations certainly other machine learning methods e g support vector regression xu et al 2014 artificial neural networks lu and ricciuto 2019 can also be used for this purpose the squared exponential se covariance function was applied to perform the gpr and the learning performance of the gpr in regard to the structure error of the dnapl transport model potentially could be improved by using other forms of covariance functions e g the combination of se and rational quadratic covariance functions williams and rasmussen 2006 in addition the mass balance of the gpr based dnapl transport modeling was not enforced during mcmc simulation in this study and a recalibration strategy xu and valocchi 2015 would be an effective way to address this problem this will be

5639,the contamination of groundwater with dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl can pose long term risks to human health due to the complexity of geological environments and the properties of dnapl a key step in human health risk hhr assessment is the establishment of a reliable dnapl transport model in this study we evaluate the impact of the model structure uncertainty on dnapl transport modeling for hhr assessment first gaussian process regression gpr was used to learn the structure error of the dnapl transport model through statistical simulations and then markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation was used to calibrate the parameters of the physical model and gpr on the basis of two case studies namely a sandbox experiment and a synthetic dnapl transport model investigation the results demonstrated that ignoring the model structure error will lead to deviations during parameter calibrations and model predictions this is because the model parameters could be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error during the calibration process results of variance decomposition verified that the model structure error was the main uncertainty source in dnapl transport modeling for both of the case studies the dnapl transport modeling and hhr assessment conducted by quantifying the uncertainties of the model parameters and structure simultaneously was found to be more reliable than that by calibrating only the model parameters in addition the hhr assessment of groundwater dnapl contamination without considering the model structure error could lead to misleading depictions of the key risk zone we propose that gpr is an effective technique to quantitatively describe the structure error of dnapl transport models keywords model structure uncertainty gaussian process regression human health risk dnapl transport markov chain monte carlo simulation 1 introduction in many regions around the world groundwater is an important source of water for humans and the ecological environment presently along with rapid industrialization the contamination of groundwater is threatening the water security of many communities burri et al 2019 rodríguez lado et al 2013 the groundwater contaminants are diverse such as heavy metal ions pesticide residues and industrial organic compounds lapworth et al 2012 teh et al 2016 teijon et al 2010 some of these contaminants are soluble in groundwater while some are insoluble the insoluble liquid contaminants are also called non aqueous phase liquids napls if the contamination is heavier than water it is referred to as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls kueper et al 1993 some dnapls e g perchloroethylene pce are toxic and these can pose serious hazards to human health and the ecological environment henri et al 2016 a key step in assessing human health risk hhr is to calculate the contaminant concentration that an individual is exposed to de barros and fiori 2014 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 teh et al 2016 it is difficult to monitor dnapl transport in groundwater because it can pass through the unsaturated zone and downward by gravity in the saturated zone until it reaches the bottom of an aquifer kueper et al 1993 moreno barbero 2005 moreover some dnapls can be transferred into the aqueous phase as a dissolution component and these chemicals can be transported in groundwater as solutes the dnapl transport process involves the transport of dnapl components and associated dissolved solutes in the aqueous phase as well as dnapl vapors in the gas phase falta et al 1995 lehame et al 2003 presently numerical models are often used to quantitatively delineate the process of dnapl transport in groundwater giraud et al 2018 parker and park 2004 tatti et al 2019 the reliability of dnapl transport numerical models especially in regard to the dnapl component and dissolved solutes in the aqueous phase has attracted widespread concerns among the groundwater hydrology community quantifying the modeling uncertainty of a dnapl transport model is necessary for assessing the distribution of dnapl and hhr over the past several decades a large number of researchers have focused their attention on uncertainty quantifications of water resources and environmental models dai et al 2019 hamraz et al 2015 højberg and refsgaard 2005 mustafa et al 2018 generally this research has involved quantifying the modeling uncertainty caused by two types of sources namely the model parameters and structure the model parameter uncertainty is concerning because model outputs are sensitive to some model parameters currently several methods are commonly used to deal with parameter uncertainty e g the least square regression lsr method doherty et al 2010 hill and tiedeman 2007 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 hassan et al 2008 and markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation hassan et al 2009 zeng et al 2016a in practice the groundwater model structure e g aquifer structure boundary conditions and chemical reactions of the contaminants is always complex and unknown to the model users neuman and wierenga 2003 troldborg et al 2007 because of the limited observational information these model conditions are often simplified when establishing a dnapl transport model refsgaard et al 2012 the simplification of the model structure can cause a discrepancy between the model results and the actual hydrogeological conditions which will lead to unreliable model outputs e g dnapl concentrations moreover if the model structure uncertainty is not considered during model calibration the model parameters could be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error gaganis 2009 the study of model structure uncertainty has received attention in the past decade enemark et al 2019 currently two types of methods are usually used to treat and quantify the model structure uncertainty i e bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 and data driven error modeling kennedy and o hagan 2001 in bma the modeling uncertainty is quantified through assembling the outputs of all plausible model structures that are weighted based on their performance on reproducing observations raftery et al 2005 zeng et al 2018 the predictions of bma are more reliable than that of a single model because bma incorporates the information on both model parameters and the structure troldborg et al 2010 used four groundwater conceptual models to account for the uncertainty caused by the source zone and geological structure and then the mass discharge of a contaminated site was estimated using bma however the implementation of bma is limited to several aspects e g the assignment of prior weights building sufficient and independent model structures and the accurate estimation of model weights cao et al 2018 lu et al 2015 the data driven error modeling method aims to build a statistical model to represent the model structure error through machine learning algorithms e g gaussian process regression gpr kennedy and o hagan 2001 integrated bayesian calibration and gpr to calibrate the parameter uncertainty and model inadequacy and the prediction uncertainty was quantified by the inferred posterior mean and variance xu and valocchi 2015 developed a bayesian approach to calibrate the parameter uncertainty and gaussian process error model simultaneously for a groundwater flow model and they demonstrated that integrating the gaussian process error model could effectively reduce the predictive bias because of the low demand for prior information on the model structure the data driven error modeling method shows great flexibility in the uncertainty quantification of the model structure xu et al 2017a the results of hhr assessment depend on the estimation of the contamination s distribution thus it is necessary to quantify the groundwater model structure error to obtain a reliable concentration distribution and scientifically sound hhr assessment in this study we integrate the model structure uncertainty quantification into the hhr assessment of groundwater dnapl contamination and the model structure error is described by a data driven error modeling method i e gpr in addition the impact of the model structure uncertainty on dnapl transport modeling and the hhr assessment was also evaluated through two case studies a two dimension dnapl sandbox experiment and a synthetic three dimension dnapl transport model the two case studies verified the validity of the gpr method moreover the bayesian theory based uncertainty quantification often requires tens of thousands of model executions to calibrate the model parameters and structure and the resulting heavy computation time becomes an obstacle to hhr assessment in order to overcome this burden the sparse grid stochastic collocation technique bungartz and dirnstorfer 2003 was used to build cheap to run surrogates for dnapl transport models in this study furthermore the hhr assessment framework proposed in this study is independent of the specific groundwater dnapl transport model and thus it is applicable to any water environmental model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the framework of the hhr assessment dnapl transport model mcmc simulation gpr variance decomposition and sparse grid surrogate technique are briefly introduced in section 2 section 3 describes the settings of the two case studies namely a sandbox experiment and a synthetic model section 4 describes the implementation of the methods the results and discussion of the two case studies are presented in section 5 and the conclusions are given in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 human health risk assessment we applied the u s environmental protection agency epa risk assessment guidance for superfund rags to assess the hhr epa 2009 the contaminant pce is carcinogenic and long term intake can lead to human endocrine system and immune system dysfunction liver and kidney function damage and even death guyton et al 2014 in the rags model carcinogenic risk is quantified by estimating the increased probability of an individual suffering from cancer in a lifetime kumar et al 2015 saleh et al 2019 the risk is calculated as follows 1 r i s k x 1 e cpf a d d x where cpf represents the cancer potency factor kg d mg and add represents the average daily dose mg kg d x represents the control plane at the flow direction as shown in fig 1 control planes represent the environmentally sensitive locations that are densely populated or contain human inhabitants henri et al 2016 the epa defines acceptable risk as values between 10 4 and 10 6 epa 2009 and we set the acceptable risk value as 10 6 in this work for clarity that is to say if the risk is higher than 10 6 an individual would be subjected to unacceptable threats from the contaminant in the rags model the add is an important parameter that is related to many factors such as the contaminant concentration and individual exposure level the exposure pathways are various e g dermal sorption from showering ingestion of tap water inhalation of air de barros and rubin 2008 kumar et al 2015 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 this work focuses on the impact of transport modeling of dnapl in groundwater on the hhr assessment thus only the ingestion of tap water was considered in this study and the add was calculated as follows 2 a d d x c x ir bw ed e f at where ir represents the ingestion rate of water l d bw represents the body weight kg ed

1999 siirila and maxwell 2012 the term c is calculated as follows 3 c x max t 0 1 ed t t e d c t x d τ where c t x represents the flux averaged concentration at the control plane position x in this work the parameters in eqs 1 and 2 except c were set to experience values 2 2 dnapl transport simulation t2voc tough2 volatile organic compound is a module of the tough2 family code it is based on the integral finite difference method and has been widely used to solve multiphase contaminant transport problems mccray and falta 1997 niessner and helmig 2007 generally t2voc assumes a multiphase system with the following three mass components ω air a water w and organic chemicals n these chemicals are distributed in one or more of the following three phases γ gas g aqueous w and napl n the balance equation for danpl transport is written as follows falta et al 1995 4 d dt v n m ω d v n γ n f ω n d γ n v n q ω d v n where mω represents the mass of component ω in the unit pore volume kg vn represents the arbitrary flow region γn represents the surface area m2 fω represents the flux of component ω into volume vn n represents the inward unit normal vector and qω represents the rate of heat generation in the unit pore volume the motion of each phase of the fluid is under the influence of pressure gravity effective permeability and phase viscosity following the multiphase extension of darcy s law 5 f ω γ f ω γ γ k k r γ ρ γ η γ p γ ρ γ g where k represents the absolute permeability m2 krγ represents the relative permeability of phase γ m2 ργ represents the γ phase density kg m3 ηγ represents the γ phase dynamic viscosity cp pγ is the fluid pressure in phase γ pa and g is the gravitational acceleration vector m s2 moreover the dnapl transport process is also affected by the relative permeability and capillary pressure between the phases in this work we apply the stone function to describe the relationship between the relative permeability and saturation the parker and lenhard function can be used to illustrate the relationship between the capillary pressure and saturation the relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is written as follows stone 1970 6 k rn 1 s g s w s nr 1 s g s wr s nr 1 s wr s nr 1 s w s nr 1 s g s wr s nr 1 s w 1 s wr m 7 k rw s w s wr 1 s wr m 8 k rg s g s gr 1 s wr m where sγ represents the saturation occupied by the γ phase and sγr represents the residual saturation occupied by the γ phase the relationship between the capillary pressure and saturation is written as follows parker and lenhard 1987 9 p cgn ρ w g α gn

parameter in t2voc hydrodynamic dispersion is neglected and molecular diffusion is simulated for the gas phase only basu et al 2008 falta et al 1995 mass transfer is depicted by advection in all phases bennett et al 1998 james and oldenburg 1997 fluid phases are assumed to be in local chemical equilibrium for each element so that interphase mass transfer among all phases can be described by equilibrium partitioning relations gudbjerg et al 2005 neriah and paster 2019 the water in the napl phase is neglected the model accounts for a interphase mass transfer b adsorption of napls to the solid phase and c decay of napls by biodegradation falta et al 1995 the relevant mechanisms of interphase mass transfer for napl include napl evaporation dissolution and gaseous aqueous mass transfer dafny 2017 in this work we only considered dnapl transport in a saturated aquifer so we were only concerned with the dnapl component and dnapl dissolution transport in the aqueous phase for the dnapl dissolution transport in the aqueous phase t2voc produces a velocity dependent numerical dispersion it has a comparable effect to hydrodynamic dispersion dafny 2017 t2voc has been successfully implemented in the modeling of dnapl transport and dissolution processes in many research projects bennett et al 1998 james and oldenburg 1997 2 3 markov chain monte carlo simulation the relationship between the model f and the observations d can be written as 11 d f θ ε where ε represents the residuals errors based on bayes theorem the posterior distribution p θ d of model parameters θ is described as 12 p θ d l θ d p θ l θ d p θ d θ where l θ d represents the joint likelihood function of observation data d and parameters θ θ θ 1 θ 2 θ d represent d dimensional model parameters p θ represents the prior distribution of parameters θ and it is usually specified by the user according to expert experience or pilot experiments because the likelihood function of nonlinear model f is very complicated it is intractable to derive the analytical expression of the posterior distribution p θ d yet the mcmc method provides an effective way to construct the posterior distribution via markov chain samples haario et al 2001 it builds a single or parallel markov chains to search for the probability space of parameters markov chain samples evolve from the prior parameter distribution to posterior distribution gradually by incorporating all information in this work the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs algorithm was used to perform mcmc simulation and this algorithm has been widely used to calibrate model parameters in high dimensional and complex hydrology problems wöhling et al 2012 zeng et al 2016a the details of this algorithm can be found in earlier studies laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt et al 2009 the gaussian likelihood function is often chosen as the expression of the joint likelihood 13 l θ d 2 π n 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 d f θ t σ 1 d f θ where n represents the number of observations σ represents the residual s covariance matrix and f θ represents the output of a nonlinear model f e g dnapl transport model 2 4 gaussian process regression as mentioned in section 2 3 the residuals error ε represents the deviation between model output and observation generally this deviation is derived from three sources including observation error biased model parameters θ and defected model structure the uncertainty derived from observation and model parameters is well calibrated through assuming the error structure of residuals and bayesian inference respectively in mcmc in order to quantify the model structure error explicitly the relationship between observation d and model f is expressed as 14 d f θ b m φ δ where b m φ represents the model structure error m represents the inputs of the model φ represents tuning parameters and δ represents the observation error the data driven machine learning provides an effective way to characterize model structure errors and the gpr method is used in this study kennedy and o hagan 2001 xu et al 2014 the prior distribution of the gaussian process function b m φ obeys a multivariate gaussian distribution n μ c the gaussian process is specified by a mean function μ m e b m and a covariance function q m m e b m μ m b m μ m in this work the squared exponential covariance function is applied 15 c i j q m i m j σ 2 exp m i m j t m i m j λ 2 σ δ 2 ψ i j 1 2 n where ψ represents the indicator function when i j ψ equals one and otherwise it equals zero λ σ2 and σδ 2 are three hyper parameters λ represents the characteristic length scale σ2 controls the marginal variance of b m and σδ 2 describes the errors except for the model structure error such as the measurement error generally the prior mean μ is assumed as zero and the uncorrelated errors obey independent and identical normal distributions the model parameters θ and gaussian process model hyper parameters φ λ σ2 σδ 2 are jointly calibrated through bayesian inference in addition the prior probability is specified as p θ φ p θ p φ and the prior distributions of θ and φ are assumed to be independent according to bayes theorem the posterior probability is formed as 16 p θ φ d p d θ φ p θ p φ where p d θ φ represents the likelihood function here we chose the logarithmic form to describe 17 log p d θ φ 1 2 d f θ μ t c 1 d f θ μ 1 2 log c n 2 log 2 π the same as described in section 2 3 we applied mcmc simulation to estimate the posterior distributions of θ and φ jointly after the posterior samples of θ and φ are generated the predictions of f θ and b m φ for a new input x denoted as f θ and b m φ respectively can be obtained the probability distribution of b m φ obeys the normal distribution n b c b b and 18 b e b d f θ φ μ c t c 1 d f θ μ 19 c b b c c t c 1 c here the asterisk superscript represents the variable associated with x μ means μ x φ c is the prior covariance matrix c is calculated as c i j k x i x j and c is calculated as c i j k x i x j as a result the predicted output at x is expressed as follows 20 d f b δ in summary the implementation of the gpr based model structure uncertainty analysis can be summarized as follows i define the prior distribution of the unknown hyper parameters φ and model parameters θ ii use mcmc simulation to obtain the posterior distribution of φ and θ and then calculate f c c and c based on the obtained posterior samples and eqs 15 and 17 iii use multivariate normal sampling to attain b i and δ i and then calculate the predicted d i by using eqs 18 20 2 5 variance decomposition the variance decomposition method can be used to quantify the contributions of uncertainty sources e g model parameter and structure error measurement error to the total predictive uncertainty kumar et al 2019 xu et al 2017b according to the law of total variance the variance of the prediction d can be calculated as 21 v d e θ b σ δ v δ θ b σ δ d θ b σ δ e θ v b θ e σ δ δ θ b d θ b v θ e b σ δ δ θ d θ where v represents the variance and e represents the expectation the other notations are the same as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 the left side of eq 21 is the variance of d i i 1 m which means the total predictive uncertainty and the posterior predictive samples are obtained by eq 20 the first term of the right side of eq 21 represents the measurement uncertainty the second and third terms represent the uncertainty of the model structure and parameters respectively more details about variance decomposition and the calculation process can be found in xu et al 2017a dai and ye 2015 and hoeting et al 1999 2 6 sparse grid surrogate technique because of the massive number of computations required during the model calibration process we implemented sparse grid stochastic collocation to construct a surrogate model thereby replacing the original dnapl transport numerical model sparse grid sg surrogate models are built from a series of lagrange interpolants for a nonlinear function e g the dnapl transport model f θ the one dimensional hierarchical lagrange interpolant lr is defined as 22 l r l f θ i 0 l δ l r i f θ i 0 l j 0 m i c o j i φ j i θ i 0 l where l represents the resolution level δlr represents the incremental interpolation operator mi represents the number of sg nodes for level i coj i represents the corresponding interpolation coefficient and φi i θ represents the interpolation basis function for a multi dimension model f θ θ θ 1 θ 2 θ d the multi dimensional hierarchical interpolation mlr is performed similarly to that of a one dimensional function and the sg nodes are generated in the manner of the smolyak rule smolyak 1963 the required sg nodes are significantly less than those of a full tensor product grid in order to further reduce the number of sg nodes i e the costs of building the surrogate some adaptive sg node refinement strategies have been developed e g local adaptive sg ma and zabaras 2009b zeng et al 2016b dimensional adaptive sg gerstner and griebel 2003 zeng et al 2012 local dimensional adaptive sg jakeman and roberts 2011 jakeman and roberts 2013 in this study local dimensional adaptive refinement was used more details about the construction of the adaptive sg surrogate e g calculating sg coefficients defining the sg basis function can be found in ma and zabaras 2009a pflüger et al 2010 and zhang et al 2013 3 descriptions of the two case studies two case studies were used in this study namely a sandbox dnapl transport experiment and a synthetic groundwater dnapl transport model investigation for each case study the true model structure and the defective model structure caused by oversimplification or limited information respectively are both described 3 1 dnapl transport sandbox experiment in this section a two dimensional sandbox experiment model is used to simulate dnapl transport fig 2 a the sandbox was 60 0 cm in length 45 0 cm in height and 1 6 cm in thickness the left and right boundaries were set to a neumann boundary and the flow velocity was kept at 1 5 m d by use of a peristaltic pump the sandbox was filled with quartz with a particle size of 0 60 0 85 mm sand a moreover five rectangular lenses consisting of low permeability quartz with a particle size of 0 18 0 22 mm sand b were placed in the sandbox the injection point was located above the uppermost lenses at x 30 0 cm y 40 0 cm and z 0 8 cm the pce injection rate was 0 5 ml min and the total amount of pce in the sandbox was 40 ml we monitored pce saturation in the sandbox for the observations and these data were measured by the light transmission method ltm based on the ltm image fig 2 b we can see that the pce bypassed the four lenses and was transported to the bottom of the box the experiment observation period was 80 min and the sampling interval was 5 min we used the observations before 60th min to calibrate the numerical transport model and used the latter observations from 61th min to 80th to validate this model in practice it is difficult to accurately characterize the structure of a groundwater aquifer this study assumes that the established groundwater conceptual model deviates from the true aquifer structure i e the left lense was missed by the conceptual model due to inadequate geological drilling fig 2 c and this defective model structure was used to simulate the transport of dnapl 3 2 synthetic dnapl transport model the synthetic three dimensional groundwater model had three aquifers as shown in fig 3 a the model domain was 1000 m long 100 m wide and 20 m thick we set three sands for the three aquifers respectively e g sand 1 sand 2 and sand 3 the permeability of three sands was ranked as follows sand 1 sand 2 sand 3 as shown in fig 3 the upper sand 1 and lower sand 2 aquifers were separated by an uneven and thin aquitard sand 3 e g a mudstone aquitard the distribution of the middle model layer was discontinuous and the thickness was not uniform for each layer the porous medium was regarded as homogenous and isotropic the left and right boundaries were constant water heads with hydraulic gradients of 0 01 the other model boundaries were all set to impermeable when assessing the hhr we assumed a scenario that a total of 85 kg pce had been poured into the aquifers 50 days earlier the pour site was around x 50 m y 50 m at the top of the first layer therefore the aquifers had already been contaminated by pce before the hhr assessment fig 4 exhibits the initial pce concentration distribution in aquifer in actual situations we are unable to attain sufficient information on the distribution of groundwater aquifers especially for thin and discontinuous layers as a result a defective model structure is often used to represent such groundwater systems in this case study we assumed that the all aquifers were simplified to uniform layers because of the limited borehole information on the thin aquitard this simplified model structure had the same model domain and boundary conditions with that of the true model structure as presented in fig 3 b in addition the thicknesses of the three even model layers were set to 9 0 m 2 0 m and 9 0 m respectively from top to bottom in this case study the observation data were generated by running the true model two observation wells were placed in the aquifer to monitor the concentration of pce and these were equipped with screens at the first layer obs1 and the third layer obs2 as shown in fig 4 a and c the concentrations in the wells were recorded once a month over five years thus for each well there were 60 concentration records as terminology we use obs1 1 to obs1 60 to present the 60 observations monitored in obs1 and similar codes for the data for obs2 the total number of observations was 120 these observations were eroded with gaussian random error with a mean of 0 and variance of 3 in relation to the observed data and then the results were used as conditional data for each observation well the conditional data were divided into two parts the former 50 observations were used for model calibration and the latter 10 observations were used for model validation 4 implementation of the methodology the dnapl transport modeling based on the defective model structure was conducted for each groundwater dnapl transport case the sandbox experiment and the synthetic model for each case study the dnapl transport model s parameter uncertainty was quantified by mcmc and the gpr method was used for quantifying the model structure uncertainty the variance decomposition method was used to quantify different uncertainty sources contributions to the total predictive uncertainty this uncertainty quantification method was verified by the two groundwater examples and then the synthetic model was implemented to conduct the hhr assessment 4 1 uncertainty quantification of the sandbox dnapl transport model in this case study the dnapl s saturation distribution of the sandbox experiment was predicted in two ways the first was to quantify only the parameter uncertainty of the dnapl transport model and the second was to quantify both the model parameter and structure uncertainty according to section 3 1 we applied t2voc to simulate the pce transport in the sandbox the simulation was generalized into a two dimensional x z section the x and z directions were uniformly discretized into 30 and 45 grids respectively for the uncertainty quantification of model parameters five important model parameters were regarded as random variables including the permeability of sand a k a and sand b k b the residual napl phase saturations of sand a snr a and sand b snr b and the viscosity of pce ηn the meaning of these parameters can be found in section 2 2 the prior distributions of these parameters were defined as uniform distributions and the distribution ranges were defined as 2 0 10 10 5 0 10 10 for k a 8 0 10 12 3 5 10 11 for k b 0 05 0 12 for snr a 0 05 0 12 for snr b and 0 6 1 2 for ηn the mcmc simulations were used to infer posterior parameters distributions through bayes theory and dreamzs was used as the searching algorithm three parallel chains were applied to conduct the mcmc simulations and the iteration length of each chain was set to 12 000 with a burn in period of 3000 after the mcmc simulations were completed the generated posterior distributions of the model parameters were used for predicting the dnapl saturation distribution for the uncertainty quantification of the model structure in addition to quantifying the model parameters uncertainty the gpr method was used to describe the model structure error the random model parameters and their prior distributions were the same as those described above in addition the squared exponential covariance function was used to build the gpr error model in this study eq 15 including three hyper parameters i e the characteristic length scale λ the standard deviation σ and the standard deviation of measurement error σδ the prior distribution was defined as a gamma distribution g 5 0 5 0 for λ and the range was set to 0 2 2 0 an exponential distribution with a mean of 0 25 was defined as the prior distribution of σ and the range was set to 0 0002 2 0 the σδ follows a uniform prior distribution on 0 002 0 5 the model parameters and gpr model s hyper parameters were jointly calibrated through mcmc simulations moreover the mcmc simulations were implemented with the same setting to that used for the parameter uncertainty quantification above after the posterior predictive samples were obtained by the mcmc method we conduct variance decomposition to quantify the contributions of model parameters model structure and measurement error to the predictive uncertainty generally one forward run of this dnapl transport model by t2voc code takes more than 100 s on a personal computer pc 8 core i7 6700 3 40 ghz processors in order to overcome the problem of heavy time consumption caused by the large number of model executions in mcmc simulations i e 72 000 forward model runs would have been required for this case study the sg technique was used to build surrogate models specifically we built an sg surrogate model to emulate the response relationship between the model output pce saturation and model input five random model parameters the original dnapl transport model was executed for 4801 times to build this surrogate model i e the cost of building this sg surrogate model was 4801 forward model runs after the surrogate model was constructed we tested the surrogate accuracy by comparing the outputs pce saturation of the surrogate model and the original dnapl transport model with 150 random model parameter sets fig 5 illustrates the comparison between them the rmse root mean square error between the outputs of these two models was approximately 1 0 10 3 in addition the r2 coefficient of determination between the outputs of these two models was more than 0 997 obviously the sg surrogate model showed sufficient accuracy in emulating the response relationship between pce saturation and model parameters the performance of each dnapl transport modeling was quantitatively measured by the log score metric hoeting et al 1999 which was defined as 23 log s c o r e i 1 n log p δ i d where δ i means a predictive quantity e g dnapl concentration p δ i d is the posterior predictive probability of δ i i 1 n under observation d and n means the number of validation observations or model parameters in this study a smaller log score value indicates a better predictive performance 4 2 uncertainty quantification of the synthetic dnapl transport model in this case study the hhr of synthetic groundwater dnapl contamination was assessed with two approaches i e the dnapl transport was modeled by only considering the model parameter uncertainty and by considering both the model parameter and structure uncertainty respectively the metric of log score was used to measure the performance of each dnapl transport modeling effort according to section 3 2 we built a three dimensional pce transport model by using t2voc the x y and z directions were uniformly discretized into 30 8 and 11 grids respectively the procedures for applying the mcmc and gpr methods were similar to those in section 4 1 the unknown model parameters in the synthetic model included the permeability and pce water inlet pressure reciprocal of the two model layers sand 1 and sand 2 the meanings of these parameters are described in section 2 2 the prior ranges of these four model parameters were specified as 1 0 10 10 5 0 10 10 for the permeability of sand 1 k1 40 60 for the pce water inlet pressure reciprocal of sand 1 αnw 1 8 0 10 11 2 0 10 10 for the permeability of sand 1 k2 and 20 40 for the pce water inlet pressure reciprocal of sand 2 αnw 2 in addition the prior uniform distributions were assumed for these parameters three parallel markov chains were set in the mcmc simulations and the iteration length and burn in length were set to 9000 and 3000 respectively for each chain the three hyper parameters of the gpr model had the same prior probability functions to those described in section 4 1 and the distribution ranges were defined as 0 2 4 0 for λ 0 0002 0 2 for σ and 0 002 0 5 for σδ moreover the setting of mcmc simulations was the same as that used for the parameter uncertainty analysis above after that the dnapl concentration distribution was generated based on the obtained parameters posterior distributions and gpr and then these data were used for the hhr assessment the variance decomposition method was used to quantify the contributions of uncertainty sources e g model parameters model structure and measurement error to the predictive uncertainty for the two hhr assessments i e with and without gpr respectively of this synthetic case study some parameters of the hhr model were set to constants according to earlier research de barros et al 2009 henri et al 2016 e g the cancer potency factor cpf was 0 0002 kg d mg the ingestion rate ir was 1 6 l d the body weight bw was 70 kg the exposure duration ed was 30 year the exposure frequency ef was 350 d year the average time of the expected lifetime at was 25 550 d moreover 27 control planes were equally spaced along the direction the 1st control plane was located at x 67 m which was close to the contaminant source zone and the interval of each control plane was 33 m the hhrs were assessed at these planes based on eqs 1 and 2 a complete mcmc simulation would have demanded 27 000 iterations to generate posterior parameter samples for each hhr assessment as a result a total of 54 000 dnapl transport model executions would have been required for this case study one forward run of this dnapl transport model by t2voc code would take more than 2 min on a pc 8 core i7 6700 3 40 ghz processors similar to section 4 1 we constructed a cheap to run surrogate model based on the sg technique for the original time consuming dnapl transport model to overcome the computational burden we built the response relationship between the pce concentration and the four model parameters the original dnapl transport model was executed a total of 2206 times at the sg nodes the results of the surrogate accuracy tests are displayed in fig 6 the rmse between the outputs of these two models pce concentration was always smaller than 1 0 10 4 in addition the r2 between the outputs of these two models was always higher than 0 9999 as a result the sg surrogate model had sufficient accuracy to replace the original model 5 results and discussion in this section the dnapl transport modeling and or hhr assessments are evaluated in two ways i e according to whether the model structure uncertainty was quantified or not for each case study moreover the contributions of dnapl transport modeling uncertainty sources to model predictions e g dnapl concentrations were quantified based on variance decomposition 5 1 dnapl transport modeling of the sandbox experiment the dnapl transport modeling of the sandbox experiment was conducted in two ways i e according to whether the model structure error i e the simplification of left lense was considered or not then the inferred dnapl saturation predictions were evaluated and compared at some observation points those not used for model calibration 5 1 1 posterior distributions of model parameters the blue lines in fig 7 present the posterior distributions of model parameters inferred by mcmc simulations without considering the model structure error the horizontal axis denotes the parameter s prior range hereafter the same clearly the high probability density region was distributed in the middle of the prior range for each parameter in addition due to the sandbox experiment being a real case the true values of the model parameters were not available thus it was infeasible to evaluate the accuracy of posterior parameter distributions the red lines in fig 7 present the posterior distributions of five model parameters and three hyper parameters by incorporating the gpr error model into mcmc simulations we found that these five model parameters posterior distributions were apparently different from those inferred by only quantifying the model parameter uncertainty the blue line in addition some parameters posterior distributions e g k a k b snr a displayed the characteristics of a multi modal distribution which indicates that the parameter space was very complex therefore model structure error had a significant impact on the parameter calibration hence ignoring the model structure error may lead to deviations in parameter calibrations this is because the model parameters could be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error moreover the plots of fig 7 f h illustrate that the posterior distributions of three hyper parameters converged to narrower ranges compared to their prior distributions 5 1 2 dnapl transport modeling in order to evaluate the accuracy of dnapl saturation predictions the inferred posterior distributions of dnapl saturation at the validation observations were compared with their true values the vertical black dash dot line the blue lines of fig 8 exhibit the predictions of dnapl saturation at six validation observations without considering the model structure error we found that only one observation x 37 cm y 21 cm t 80 min was predicted with high accuracy i e the predicted distribution had a high probability density at the observed saturation the other five observations were predicted with apparent deviations i e the predicted distribution had a low probability density at these observed saturations in addition the prediction of dnapl saturation showed similar performance at other validation observations and these data are not shown here because of the limited space the log score was equal to 0 79 for all of the validation observations therefore the dnapl saturation distribution cannot be reliably predicted by only accounting for the model parameter uncertainty the red lines of fig 8 present the dnapl saturation predictions inferred by incorporating the gpr results we found that all of the validation observations were predicted with high accuracy i e high predictive probability compared with the blue lines in fig 8 it was obvious that the performance of dnapl saturation predictions was improved significantly by quantifying the dnapl transport model s structural uncertainty except for one observation x 37 cm y 21 cm t 80 min moreover the log score was equal to 9 98 for all validation observations which was much smaller than that without considering the model structure error log score 0 79 therefore it was effective to improve the predictive performance of the dnapl transport model by quantifying the model structure error 5 1 3 variance decomposition for the sandbox experiment fig 9 exhibits the contribution fractions of uncertainty sources model parameter model structure and measurement error to the dnapl transport predictive uncertainty at 20 observations clearly the model structure error was the major uncertainty source in the sandbox experiment model and it accounted for more than 80 of the total uncertainty the measurement error contributed generally less than 1 to the predictive uncertainty the model parameters contributed less than 5 to the predictive uncertainty for most observations except at o 5 and o 12 where the fractions were larger than 10 noteworthy according to fig 8 we can see that the prediction distributions at o 5 and o 12 showed better performance than the other observations when ignoring the model structure error this was because model parameters made more contributions to the predictive uncertainty for these two observations while ignoring the model structure error had less of a negative impact on model predictions moreover the model structure error could be partly compensated by calibrating the model parameters 5 2 hhr assessments of the synthetic case study the dnapl transport modeling and hhr assessment for the synthetic case were conducted in two ways i e according to whether the model structure error i e the simplification of the middle aquifer was quantified or not then the inferred dnapl predictions and hhrs were evaluated and compared 5 2 1 posterior distributions of model parameters fig 10 presents the posterior distributions of the model parameters by mcmc simulations without incorporating the gpr results the vertical black dash line marks the true parameter value hereafter the same the horizontal axis denotes the parameter s prior range clearly all of the model parameters except for αnw 1 were calibrated with apparent deviations by the corresponding posterior distributions and these parameters posterior distributions showed very low probability densities at the corresponding true values the log score was equal to 4 17 for all of the model parameters thus these model parameters cannot be calibrated reliably by using the defective model structure and only considering the model parameter s uncertainty as gpr was used to describe the model structure error the seven parameters which included four model parameters and three hyper parameters were calibrated by mcmc simulations the posterior distributions of these seven parameters are described in fig 11 compared with fig 10 we found that the parameters posterior distributions were closer to their true values and these posterior distributions showed relatively higher probability densities at the corresponding true values the log score was equal to 17 12 for all of the model parameters which was smaller than that without considering the model structure error log score 4 17 therefore ignoring the model structure error could lead to deviations in the model parameters calibrations and these parameters can be better identified by quantifying the model structure uncertainty in addition the posterior distributions of the three hyper parameters converged to much narrower ranges than their corresponding prior distributions 5 2 2 dnapl transport modeling fig 12 shows the obtained predictive distributions of pce concentrations without considering the model structure error the performance of dnapl transport modeling was evaluated at validation observations that were not used for model calibration obs1 1 denotes the 1st observation well at the 1st observation moment hereafter the same because of limited space only six typical observations and their predictions are displayed in this case study the results clearly showed that all of the observations could not be effectively predicted by the simulations and these predictive distributions always deviated significantly from the true values in addition the predictions of dnapl concentrations at other observations displayed similar features to fig 12 the log score was equal to 0 for all of the validation observations 0 log0 0 which means all observations were predicted with a zero probability density at their true values therefore it is inadvisable to describe the dnapl concentration based on a dnapl transport model with structure error although parameter uncertainty quantification is performed the parameter calibration cannot fully compensate for the uncertainty caused by the model structure error fig 13 presents the obtained predictive distributions of pce concentrations when considering the model structure uncertainty the results clearly showed that all of these predictive distributions were concentrated at the true values of observations compared with fig 12 the accuracy of these predictions was improved significantly by incorporating the gpr error model and these predictive distributions showed apparently higher probability densities at the corresponding true values the log score was equal to 14 67 for all of the validation observations which was smaller than that without quantifying the model structure uncertainty log score 0 thus it is more reliable to simulate the transport of dnapl contamination by quantifying the uncertainties of model parameters and structure simultaneously than that by calibrating only model parameters in addition the gpr model was found to be an effective technique to describe the model structure error generally the predictive distributions with the uncertainty quantification of the model structure had wider ranges than those with only quantifying the model parameters uncertainty and some distributions even had a minimum value less than zero this was because the addition of the model structure error term brought about an increase in the prediction variance 5 2 3 variance decomposition for the synthetic model fig 14 illustrates the contribution fractions of uncertainty sources to the predictive uncertainty of the synthetic model at 20 observations obs1 51 60 obs2 51 60 we found that the model structure error accounted for more than 90 of the total uncertainty for all observations of both of the two wells as a result the model structure error dominated the predictive uncertainty of the synthetic model and the model parameters calibration had a limited effect on model predictions this is why the model parameters and predictions were calibrated with significant deviations by ignoring the model structure error as shown by fig 12 5 2 4 hhr assessment the predictive distributions of groundwater contaminant concentrations obtained were used for the hhr assessment the increased probability of an individual suffering from cancer in a lifetime was calculated as shown in eq 1 according to the rags epa 2009 the acceptable risk value was defined as 10 6 in this work fig 15 presents the probability densities of hhr assessed by using the pce concentration distributions without addressing the model structure uncertainty the vertical black line represents the acceptable risk value 10 6 the control planes were numbered from 1 to 27 in the order of distance from the contaminant source plane 1 was closest to the source and plane 27 was farthest from the source because of space limitations here we only display six of the control planes e g from 11th to 16th obviously the hhr decreased as the distance of the control plane from the contaminant source increased in addition for the control plane that was closer to the contaminant source than the 13th control plane the hhr value with the highest probability density was always higher than 10 6 this indicates that necessary actions must be taken to prevent this contamination for the control plane that was farther away from the source than the 13th control plane the hhr value decreased gradually and was less than 10 6 therefore the 13th control plane was called the critical control plane based on this hhr assessment fig 16 exhibits the probability densities of hhrs assessed with the gpr results similar to the tendency shown in fig 15 the hhr decreased as the distance of the control plane from the contaminant source increased however the hhrs assessed by incorporating gpr results were usually slightly higher than those obtained by neglecting the model structure error moreover the ranges of distributions were much wider which indicates that hhr assessed with considering the model structure error had a larger variance based on the assessment of hhr the critical control plane was the 15th control plane compared with the results of fig 15 the critical control plane had changed from the 13th to the 15th control plane when quantifying the results by considering the model structure error although it is not feasible to perform a straightforward evaluation of which way of hhr assessment e g with or without the uncertainty quantification of the model structure is more reasonable we believe that more reliable contaminant concentration predictions will results in more reliable hhr assessments thus the hhr assessed by quantifying the model structure uncertainty is more reliable than that obtained by neglecting the model structure error and in this study the difference between the two ways of hhr assessments was not negligible specifically in the synthetic case study if the hhr is assessed by neglecting the model structure error this would result in underestimation of the risk and misleading depictions of the key risk zone e g the 13th and 14th control planes would be regarded as safe but these areas were actually at high risk to human health according to the rags model eqs 1 and 2 hhr is affected by physiological behavioral and hydrogeological factors the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of the model structure error on the hhr assessment for groundwater dnapl contamination and only hydrogeological factors were evaluated in this research currently some studies have evaluated physiological and behavioral factors in hhr assessment e g de barros and rubin 2008 found that at lower risk values and longer travel times hhr is less sensitive to physiological parameters physiological and behavioral factors can be incorporated in the model parameters uncertainty in a future study moreover the degradation of pce was not considered in this study the pce would degrade into trichloroethylene tce dichloroethylene dce and vinyl chloride vc and finally the contaminants would transform into non toxic ethane in effect henri et al 2015 all of these sub products except ethane could pose hhr and hhr assessment would be improved if the degradation of pce was taken into account in groundwater models 6 conclusion the hhr caused by dnapl contamination in groundwater has aroused widespread public attention we evaluated the impact of the model structure uncertainty on dnapl transport modeling and an hhr assessment by using a data driven error model to describe the model structure uncertainty based on two case studies namely a sandbox experiment and synthetic dnapl transport model the key findings are summarized as follows 1 ignoring the model structure error will lead to deviations in the model parameters posterior distributions and the model parameter will be overfitted to compensate for the model structure error the predictions of dnapl transport model through quantifying the uncertainties of model parameters and structure simultaneously are more reliable than those obtained by calibrating only the model parameters 2 the hhr assessment of groundwater dnapl contamination without considering the model structure error may lead to misleading depictions of the key risk zone it is more reliable to assess hhr by considering the model structure uncertainty than by neglecting the model structure error 3 the gpr method is an effective technique to quantitatively describe the structure error of the dnapl transport model the proposed hhr assessment framework in this study is independent of any specific case studies e g the gpr based model structure error quantification the stochastic collocation sg surrogate method and thus the proposed approach can be used for any complex water environmental models the gpr method was used to learn the model structure error by means of data driven statistical simulations certainly other machine learning methods e g support vector regression xu et al 2014 artificial neural networks lu and ricciuto 2019 can also be used for this purpose the squared exponential se covariance function was applied to perform the gpr and the learning performance of the gpr in regard to the structure error of the dnapl transport model potentially could be improved by using other forms of covariance functions e g the combination of se and rational quadratic covariance functions williams and rasmussen 2006 in addition the mass balance of the gpr based dnapl transport modeling was not enforced during mcmc simulation in this study and a recalibration strategy xu and valocchi 2015 would be an effective way to address this problem this will be
