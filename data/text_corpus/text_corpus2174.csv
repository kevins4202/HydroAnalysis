10870,oats avena sativa l and hairy vetch vicia villosa are well adapted crop species for production in semi arid environments such as in inner mongolia china where due to variable rainfall farmers do not apply fertilizer we hypothesized that the use of a mixture of a cereal and a legume could enhance yields under these low input conditions because integrating an n fixing legume in the system could mitigate n limitation for the cereal and enhance its growth a nine year 2008 2016 field experiment was set up with three treatments sole oats sole vetch and oats vetch strip intercropping these cropping systems were grown continuously in the same plots to allow accrual of long term effects yields and water use were quantified in years 7 9 of the experiment 2014 to 2016 with a 50 50 ratio of the area sown to the two species the intercropped oats had a relative yield of 0 59 and intercropped vetch had a relative yield of 0 45 oats was the dominant crop characterized by a relative yield per plant of 1 18 compared to a relative yield per plant of vetch of 0 89 however the land equivalent ratio ler expressing the comparative efficiency of land use in intercropping and the water equivalent ratio wer the comparative system level water use efficiency of the intercrop relative to sole crops were both not significantly different from one thus we reject the hypothesis that oat vetch intercropping increases land productivity and water use efficiency from differences in results in years with more rainfall and years with less rainfall we infer that yields of both species are mostly limited by water availability on average over the three years the yield disadvantage of vetch was fully compensated by the yield advantage of oats due to a lack of complementarity for water acquisition this conclusion can be generalized to the testable prediction that species selection for productive intercropping should focus on achieving complementarity for traits that interact with the factor most constraining productivity which was rainfall in this particular crop system under the conditions of the study keywords productivity land equivalent ratio water use efficiency water equivalent ratio daily water use 1 introduction crop yields in semi arid areas are sensitively affected by variation in rainfall this is also the case in the agro pastoral ecotone of inner mongolia china in this area farmers do not fertilize their crops because the benefits of fertilization are uncertain due to the variable rainfall under this zero n input condition the use of legumes in mixed cropping systems can provide advantages for soil fertility and crop production bedoussac et al 2015 hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 jensen 1996 cereal legume mixtures are in general considered to provide yield advantages under low input growing conditions the land equivalent ratio was significantly enhanced by wheat soybean li et al 2001 wheat mungbean chowdhury and rosario 1994 sorghum soybean elmore and jackobs 1986 maize faba bean fan et al 2006 maize barley li et al 2011a 2011b and maize chickpea xia et al 2013 intercropping systems either under drought or non drought conditions this increase of productivity in cereal legume intercropping compared to sole crops can be due to increases in resource use efficiency and improved soil fertility in the long term resulting from biological n fixation by the legume rivest et al 2013 or to complementarity for nitrogen acquisition zhang and li 2003 intercropping increases the use efficiencies of land light water and nutrients brooker et al 2015 intercropping conserves soil water by reducing wind speed young 1997 the water use efficiency in legume non legume mixtures is greater than that in sole stands mao et al 2012 ren et al 2019 this high water use efficiency may be caused by complementarily water uptake due to differences in root distribution in the soil profile of the component crops sillon et al 2000 by decreasing evaporation loss because of better vegetation cover ghanbari et al 2010 inner mongolia is an agro pastoral ecotone ape in which both crop production and livestock farming are practiced by farmers the ape is characterized by low and highly variable precipitation and relatively unfertile soils that are susceptible to wind erosion zhao et al 2017 tang et al 2018 there is a need for a responsible use of this fragile arable land and an efficient use of the scarce water resources oats avena sativa l is an important cereal crop in rain fed cool regions because of its tolerance to drought and high nutritive value akcura and ceri 2011 inner mongolia accounts for around 30 of the total oats production in china however oats yield is low not only due to drought and unreliable rainfall yuan et al 2013 but also due to n limitation hairy vetch vicia villosa is a popular high yield and high quality annual forage crop in inner mongolian stock farming lanyasunya et al 2007 vetch performs well under cool drought and less fertile conditions seyedeh et al 2010 vetch usually grows as a sole crop in this region however vetch can also be grown in mixtures with small grains papastylianou 2004 caballero et al 1995 oats is a suitable companion cereal for intercropping with vetch thomson et al 1990 caballero and goicoechea 1986 in mixtures oats can provide support for climbing vetch improve vetch light interception and reducing rotting of vetch hay if conditions are humid roberts et al 1989 thomson et al 1990 vetch in mixtures enhances the quality of forage by increasing protein concentration vasilakoglou et al 2008 therefore oats vetch intercropping might be a practical strategy for enhancing land productivity and resource use efficiency in the ape of inner mongolia however there is little quantitative information on yield performance of oats vetch intercropping in semiarid regions we hypothesized that an intercrop of oats and vetch would be able to increase crop yields and water use efficiencies especially if continued over multiple years allowing n accumulation in the soil li et al 2011a 2011b to test this hypothesis we conducted long term field experiments from 2008 to 2016 with fixed plots and started three year measurements 6 years later 2014 2016 when the time for building long term effects was considered sufficient the objectives of this study were to a quantify land productivity of oats and vetch in the oats vetch intercropping system and b quantify water use and water use efficiencies in the oats vetch intercropping system and compare them with the sole crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were carried out at the scientific and observing experimental station of the agro environment ministry of agriculture in wuchuan county 111 41 e 40 49 n inner mongolia china the site is situated in a region with rain fed agriculture under typical semi arid and cool conditions representing a region of agricultural and pastoral ecotone the soil bulk density of 0 100 cm soil layer is 1 45 g cm3 with a field capacity of 23 0 cm3 cm 3 the soil total n is 1 09 g kg 1 available p is 4 96 mg kg 1 available k is 105 27 mg kg 1 and organic matter contents is 13 4 g kg 1 the historical mean annual rainfall was 348 80 mm from 1961 to 2015 and the annual mean air temperature during this period was 3 6 1 0 c the climate is temperate continental with warm summers and cold and dry winters the climate allows one crop per year air temperature and precipitation data for the experimental years during the growing season from may to september are provided in fig 1 2 2 experimental design a long term field experiment with three treatments was initiated in 2008 the treatments were three cropping systems 2 monocultures i sole oats so and ii sole vetch sv and the intercrop iii oats vetch strip intercropping with 4 rows of oats and 4 rows of vetch the experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates we used permanent plots over nine years to enable accumulation of long term effects of the crop systems measurements were made from 2014 because we aimed to test crop yields and water use after sufficient accumulation of long term effects on soil fertility from the two monoculture treatments and the small rotation of the intercrop with alternating strip positions each year aboveground dry matter and yield of each crop were measured from 2014 to 2016 soil moisture content was measured from 2015 to 2016 thus the experimental results in this study included long term effects of the intercrop and the sole systems the oats cultivar was the commonly used variety caoyou 1 the overall plant density i e per unit area of the total crop system both in sole crops and intercrops was 128 plants m 2 in the monoculture and 64 plants m 2 in the intercrop the vetch cultivar was the commonly used mengshao 1 its overall plant density was 134 plants m 2 in the monoculture and 67 plants m 2 in the intercrop the row spacing of oats and vetch was 25 cm in both monoculture and intercrop systems the distance between adjacent oats and vetch rows was 25 cm in the intercrop fig 2 the relative densities i e density in the intercrop divided by density in the sole crop and land sowing proportions of both crops in the intercropping system were 0 5 plot area was 48 m2 8 m length 6 m width oats and vetch were sown and harvested on the same date sowing was on may 8 in 2014 may 20 in 2015 may 9 in 2016 and harvest was on september 1 in all years weeds were removed by hand no fertilizer or irrigation were given as in farmers practice the reason for the lack fertilization in this rain fed condition is the low and unreliable rainfall all aboveground biomass of vetch was harvested for animal feed the stubble of oats was cut at 15 cm height and remained in the field until spring the experimental plots were spring ploughed to approximately 10 cm depth every year before sowing incorporating the crop remains into the ground 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 crop yields and aboveground dry matter to determine final yield the oats was harvested from a sub sampling area of 8 m2 1 m in width 8 m in length in the center of each plot the grain was sun dried until water content was 14 the final dry matter was measured using 3 randomly selected plants from the same sub sampling area after measuring fresh matter the samples were oven dried at 80 c for 2 days until they reached a constant weight harvest index hi was calculated as the ratio of grain yield 14 water to aboveground dry matter 2 3 2 soil moisture content and water use soil moisture content was measured every 10 cm from 0 to 100 cm soil depth using neutron probe cpn 503 dr cpn international inc america the measurements were made seven times during the growing season in 2015 on may 20 june 15 july 12 july 25 august 11 august 27 and august 29 and five times during the growing season in 2016 on may 9 june 9 july 1 august 2 and september 1 in the intercrop one tube was installed in the middle between adjacent oats and vetch rows in sole crops one tube was installed in the middle of each plot water use wu mm in the 1 m root zone at three development stages during the crop growing season was calculated using the water balance method allen et al 1998 there was no irrigation in our study surface runoff did not occur because each plot was flat and enclosed by a 15 cm high ridge capillary rise water was negligible because of a deep underground water table deep drainage was also negligible because there were no heavy rains in experimental period thus the water balance equation was simplified to allen et al 1998 moiwo and tao 2015 1 wu p sini sfin where p is the amount of precipitation mm during the crop growing season or different stages sini and sfin are soil water content mm within the 0 100 cm root zone at starting and ending time for a stage for whole growing season at the sowing and harvesting time 2 3 3 soil available nitrogen and organic matter contents after harvesting soil samples were taken in the top 20 cm soil layer in each plot to measure soil available nitrogen alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen and organic matter contents in 2016 the alkaline hydrolysis diffusion method was used to determine the available nitrogen content lu 2000 soil organic matter contents were measured using the h2so4 k2cr2o7 method bao 2000 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 plant level relative yield per plant and index for aggressivity the species yield responses in intercropping were analyzed comparing actual yield yint and expected yield ymono considering the land use proportion the relative yield per plant rypp and the relative yield loss δy at plant level banik et al 2006 xu et al 2008 were calculated for each component crop in the intercrop as 2 r y p p y i n t p y m o n o 3 δ y r y p p 1 100 where yint and ymono are the crop yields in the intercrop and the sole crop respectively p is the relative density of each crop in the intercrop in this case 0 5 for both species because the number of plants of each species in the intercrop was half of that in the sole crop as the intercrop consisted of strips of each species consisting of four rows with a fixed row distance of 50 cm over all treatments in this intercrop land use proportion of both species is 0 5 aggressivity a is an index that represents a simple measure of how much the relative yield increase in one species is greater or smaller than that of the other species in an intercropping system ghosh 2004 it is calculated as the difference between the relative yields per plant of the two species rao and willey 1980 4 aov ryppo ryppv where aov is the aggressivity of oats to vetch in the intercrop a positive value of aov indicates that oats is dominant and vetch dominated 2 4 2 species level water use efficiency water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated by dividing the yield y by the water use wu during the whole growing season from sowing to harvest 5 w u e y wu where y g m 2 is crop yield in the intercrop or sole system and wu mm is the actual water use evapotranspiration per unit area of the whole system during the growing season wu is not partitioned to different crop species in an intercropping system because they cannot be separately identified without modelling mao et al 2012 2 4

when ler 1 the intercropping system has a disadvantage in land productivity compared to the monocultures when the ler 1 0 there is a land use advantage in intercropping the water equivalent ratio wer was used to quantify system level water use efficiency mao et al 2012 the wer is defined by analogy with ler by determining the total water use that is needed in sole crops to produce the equivalent of the species yields on a unit area of intercrop with the associated water use the formula contains the relative areas of sole crops needed to produce the intercrop yields lero and lerv and 2 the

water use efficiencies of oats and vetch in the monocultures the water use efficiencies per crop species in the intercrop in above formula 7b are based on total system water use the alternative interpretation with water use efficiencies allows the interpretation that the wer is a sum of two ratios of water use efficiencies however the first interpretation in terms of the water used to produce the intercrop yields using sole crops is more intuitive and insightful the two formulations are equivalent the relative water saving δwu originally proposed by morris and garrity 1993 later modified by mao et al 2012 was used to evaluate if intercropping takes up more or less water considering the component crop yields than would be expected water use by producing unit yield in monocultures δwu takes the difference between the actual water use in intercropping wuint and the expected water use in intercropping considering the product output 8 δ w u w u i n t w u i n t e x p e

differences lsd were used to separate treatment means at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 weather variability soil nitrogen and organic matter total rainfall during the growing season from sowing to harvest was 298 mm in 2014 188 mm in 2015 and 245 2 mm in 2016 in the wettest year 2014 rainfall during kernel formation in july and august was 209 mm while in the drought year 2015 rainfall during this time was only 115 7 mm and 134 5 mm in wet 2016 fig 1 overall 2014 was the wettest year with an even rainfall distribution while 2016 was also a moderately wet year but with an uneven distribution pattern the year 2015 was comparatively dry we did not find significant differences in soil available n between intercropping and sole systems in 2016 after 8 years fixed plot experiment fig 3 a the soil organic matter soil fertility only showed a small but not significant increase in the intercropping comparing with sole systems fig 3b 3 2 relative yield and aggressivity at plant level the relative yield per plant of oats was 1 18 across the three years being highest in the years with the highest rainfall 1 28 in 2014 relative yield per plant of vetch in the intercrop was 0 89 across the three years table 1 and also being highest 1 08 in the wettest year 2014 across three years the oats grain yield per plant in the intercropping was 18 higher than in the sole stand while the biomass yield per plant of intercropped vetch was 11 lower than that of sole vetch the aggressivity aov was 0 20 in 2014 0 12 in 2015 and 0 55 in 2016 with an average of 0 3 in 3 years fig 4 this shows that oats was always the dominant species while vetch was dominated oats was more competitive in the wet years 2014 and 2016 than in the dry year 2015 indicating the competitive balance between the species was affected by weather 3 3 crop yields at species level oats yields per unit area of the whole crop system were significantly affected by year in both intercropping and sole stand yield was 1 53 t ha 1 in 2014 wettest 0 96 t ha 1 in 2015 dry and 0 97 t ha 1 in 2016 wet but uneven distribution pattern table 1 in the monoculture and 0 92 t ha 1 in 2014 0 48 t ha 1 in 2015 and 0 57 t ha 1 in 2016 in the intercrop the harvest index hi of sole oats did not significantly differ over years while the hi of the intercropped oats was not significant different from that of sole oats in 2015 and 2016 but significantly higher in 2014 table 1 due to high rainfall during kernel formation in july and august in this year fig 1 overall the hi of oats was 11 higher in the intercrop than in the monoculture vetch biomass yield per unit area of the whole system in the intercrop and the sole stand was significantly affected by year the yield in sole vetch was 2 86 t ha 1 in wettest 2014 1 69 t ha 1 in dry 2015 and 2 20 t ha 1 in 2016 the yield in intercropped vetch was 1 48 t ha 1 in 2014 0 71 t ha 1 in 2015 and 0 68 t ha 1in 2016 in the intercropping table 1 vetch yields in both the intercrop and the sole stand were lower in the moderately wet year 2016 than in the wettest year 2014 3 4 water use and water use efficiency at species level the rainfall during crop seasons in 2015 2016 was 216 mm on average this amount of rainfall often resulted in low soil moisture content ranging from 4 to 16 and mostly around 50 60 of field capacity figs 5 and 6 the moisture content in the soil profile of the intercrop was always lower than in sole oats and in sole vetch in both 2015 fig 5 and 2016 fig 6 especially in the deep layer 60 100 cm in dry 2015 the soil moisture content was similar in sole vetch and sole oats the very low soil moisture content in the top soil 0 10 cm in fig 5 and 6 was mainly caused by a high evaporation demand due to high wind speed in this region that might also be due to a slight systematic error because the measurement soil depth of 10 cm was less than the width of neutron probe reflection 15 cm radius soil the intercrop and sole crops consumed the same amount of water wu on average 235 mm during the whole growing season table 2 water use wu of sole vetch was more than that of sole oats and intercrop during early growth especially in the wet 2016 in other growth stages there was little difference in wu between systems the wue of intercropped oats and vetch oats and vetch yield per unit of total system water extraction was significantly lower than that of the sole stand table 2 considering that the intercrop had only 50 oats and 50 vetch we would expect that if the species were equally competitive for water each would account for half of the water use by the system if the water use was partitioned equally between oats and vetch we would expect that the wue of both species in the intercrop would be 50 of the value in the corresponding sole crop in the case of oats the wue in the intercrop was equal to or slightly but not significantly above this expected value however for vetch the wue in the intercrop was considerably and significantly less than 50 of the value in the sole crop table 2 thus the results on water use indicate that oats was dominant with respect to vetch in the acquisition of water however this did not result in a higher than expected wue for oats in the wetter year 2016 the wues of both oats and vetch were lower than in the drought year 2015 in both the sole crop and the intercrop 3 5 land equivalent ratio the land equivalent ratio ler was 1 04 on average with a standard error of 0 07 not significantly different from 1 0 over 3 years table 3 showing no significant land use advantage for oats vetch intercropping the partial ler of oats lero in the intercropping system was 0 59 across three years which is higher than the land use proportion of 0 5 while the partial ler of vetch 0 45 was lower than the land use proportion the yield advantage of oats in the intercropping was thus almost offset by the yield loss of intercropped vetch 3 6 water equivalent ratio the system level water use efficiency wer in the intercropping was on average 0 97 indicating no change in system level water use efficiency in intercropping the partial wer of oats was 0 57 on average which was higher than the land proportion 0 5 while that of vetch 0 4 was less than its sowing proportion of 0 5 the partial wers for both oats and vetch in the intercropping was slightly lower than partial lers of oats and vetch the high partial wer for oats and the low partial wer for vetch indicates that within the intercropping system oats captured a greater portion of the water than the vetch overall the intercrop did not consume more water δ wu in the relative dry year of 2015 but it consumed 8 7 less water in the relative wet 2016 for producing the same yields compared with sole stands 4 discussion the land equivalent ratio of oats vetch intercropping was 1 04 over three years not significantly different from 1 while the water equivalent ratio was 0 97 also not significantly different from 1 these metrics indicate that the oats vetch intercrop did not represent an improvement over sole crops in terms of the inputs land and water the partial ler of oats was 0 59 while the partial wer was 0 57 indicating that oats yield in the intercrop represented a greater proportion of the equivalent land area in sole crops lero 0 59 vs lerv 0 45 and it also represented a greater proportion of the equivalent water amount required in sole crop production wero 0 57 vs werv 0 40 these metrics point the same direction as the relative yields per plant 1 18 for oats and 0 89 for vetch and the aggressivity of oats vs vetch 0 3 as an average over three years oats encroached on vetch and the yield advantage of oats 18 at the per plant level and 0 59 when measured as partial ler was offset by a yield loss of vetch 11 at the per plant level and 0 45 when measured as partial ler the system has thus characteristics of a zero sum game this finding does not confirm the hypothesis that a yield advantage would result from complementarity for n acquisition this intercrop showed no advantage in a dry year 2015 or a wet year with uneven rainfall distribution pattern 2016 however the crop yields of both component crops in oats vetch intercropping was significantly higher than yields in sole stands in the wet and even rainfall distribution year 2014 thus the potential for complementarity was realized in the year with the smallest constraint on crop growth from low water availability but not in the other two years a global meta analysis revealed the ler of cereal legume mixtures was 1 17 on average indicating land and resource use advantages resulting from the combination of cereals with legumes yu et al 2016 in contrast in our study oats vetch intercropping did not show a significant land and water use advantage the key explanation for this phenomenon may be that water shortage was the key constraint a conclusion that is supported by the favourable ler and wer in the year 2014 which had a higher rainfall and better distribution of rainfall than the other years the results suggest that there is a trade off between the yields of the cereal and the legume consistent with findings of bedoussac et al 2015 and yu et al 2016 the increase of oats yield in the intercrop in a good year 2014 was mainly caused by an increase of harvest index likely due to a border row effect which results in higher light and water capture zhang et al 2007 border row effects are a major mechanism for yield advantage in intercrops e g mao et al 2012 these border row effects may be enhanced by plant plasticity zhu et al 2015 on the other hand when the taller oats gains competitive dominance over time in oats vetch intercropping shaded vetch gets less incident radiation osman et al 1998 dufour et al 2013 and would have smaller and thinner leaves in border rows because of the competition for light wang et al 2017 that would affect light interception and light use efficiency of vetch border row plants and then product less biomass oats competed for water more strongly than vetch in oats vetch intercropping especially in 2016 with a highest aggressivity aov however vetch is a drought sensitive species with a high water requirement yuan et al 2013 in a study on potato vetch intercropping in the same region we found that vetch is more competitive for water than potato and obtains partial ler and wer greater than 0 8 resulting an in overall high ler and wer of 1 3 ren et al 2019 the results indicate that the productive intercropping in semi arid rainfed condition may be achieved by the combination of one crop that requires less water and another that requires more i e by complementarity for water use if the fodder demand for husbandry is not taken into account a suitable legume crop for intercropping with oats might be faba bean which consumes less water than vetch yuan et al 2013 in our study crop yields of both oats and vetch were highly related to not only yearly precipitation but also to the seasonal distribution pattern especially during the kernel filling stage of crop growth from july to august in study region overall oats vetch intercropping in semi arid rain fed conditions does not lose in unfavorable climate 2015 but will gain more in favourable years 2014 in which ler is 1 18 in studied region in our study we did not find any significant differences in soil available n and organic matter contents between intercropping and sole systems in 2016 after 8 years fixed plot experiment fig 3 this result contrasts with findings of cong et al 2015 who found increases in soil organic c and n in intercropping over 8 years the possible reason for a small increase if any in organic matter due to intercropping might be the low productivity of the site due to low rainfall and the small straw return amount which both limits the accumulation of soil n and c our results show lack of significant improvements of soil c and n by intercropping under semi arid conditions in nine years this indicates that it is realistic to have low expectations on organic matter increases by intercropping under the study conditions addition or organic supplements such as compost or manure are likely more effective pathways to increase soil organic matter celik et al 2004 the results of the current study suggest that complementarity for a certain trait in this case a trait for n acquisition is not expressed as an advantage at system level if other traits are constraining system performance substantially more strongly this result in a useful suggestion for intercropping systems the complementarity should be sought for the factor that is most constraining the productivity e g for water use in water limited regions the complementary for water use could be achieved by relay intercropping rahman et al 2017 and or by selecting species that have differences in root distribution and in water acquisition ren et al 2019 5 conclusions our hypothesis that intercropping oats with vetch can improve land productivity and water use efficiency was rejected because of severe water competition between two component crops under the water limited conditions of the study intercropping oats with vetch with no fertilization and irrigation showed on average no significant advantage in both land and water use in semi arid region however it is still a rational cropping system for both grain production and animal husbandry in the agriculture and pasture ecotone because this intercropping does not lose yield in unfavourable years and it might win in favourable years with more rainfall or a better rainfall distribution this system covers the soil better than the sole vetch during the fallow period and may therefore reduce the risk of wind erosion our results show an interesting evidence that not all intercropping combinations achieve land and resource use advantage advantageous intercropping in semi arid region might be achieved by the combination of one crop that requires less water and another that requires more this finding contributes to the understanding of agricultural system design and sustainability under climate change

10870,oats avena sativa l and hairy vetch vicia villosa are well adapted crop species for production in semi arid environments such as in inner mongolia china where due to variable rainfall farmers do not apply fertilizer we hypothesized that the use of a mixture of a cereal and a legume could enhance yields under these low input conditions because integrating an n fixing legume in the system could mitigate n limitation for the cereal and enhance its growth a nine year 2008 2016 field experiment was set up with three treatments sole oats sole vetch and oats vetch strip intercropping these cropping systems were grown continuously in the same plots to allow accrual of long term effects yields and water use were quantified in years 7 9 of the experiment 2014 to 2016 with a 50 50 ratio of the area sown to the two species the intercropped oats had a relative yield of 0 59 and intercropped vetch had a relative yield of 0 45 oats was the dominant crop characterized by a relative yield per plant of 1 18 compared to a relative yield per plant of vetch of 0 89 however the land equivalent ratio ler expressing the comparative efficiency of land use in intercropping and the water equivalent ratio wer the comparative system level water use efficiency of the intercrop relative to sole crops were both not significantly different from one thus we reject the hypothesis that oat vetch intercropping increases land productivity and water use efficiency from differences in results in years with more rainfall and years with less rainfall we infer that yields of both species are mostly limited by water availability on average over the three years the yield disadvantage of vetch was fully compensated by the yield advantage of oats due to a lack of complementarity for water acquisition this conclusion can be generalized to the testable prediction that species selection for productive intercropping should focus on achieving complementarity for traits that interact with the factor most constraining productivity which was rainfall in this particular crop system under the conditions of the study keywords productivity land equivalent ratio water use efficiency water equivalent ratio daily water use 1 introduction crop yields in semi arid areas are sensitively affected by variation in rainfall this is also the case in the agro pastoral ecotone of inner mongolia china in this area farmers do not fertilize their crops because the benefits of fertilization are uncertain due to the variable rainfall under this zero n input condition the use of legumes in mixed cropping systems can provide advantages for soil fertility and crop production bedoussac et al 2015 hauggaard nielsen et al 2001 jensen 1996 cereal legume mixtures are in general considered to provide yield advantages under low input growing conditions the land equivalent ratio was significantly enhanced by wheat soybean li et al 2001 wheat mungbean chowdhury and rosario 1994 sorghum soybean elmore and jackobs 1986 maize faba bean fan et al 2006 maize barley li et al 2011a 2011b and maize chickpea xia et al 2013 intercropping systems either under drought or non drought conditions this increase of productivity in cereal legume intercropping compared to sole crops can be due to increases in resource use efficiency and improved soil fertility in the long term resulting from biological n fixation by the legume rivest et al 2013 or to complementarity for nitrogen acquisition zhang and li 2003 intercropping increases the use efficiencies of land light water and nutrients brooker et al 2015 intercropping conserves soil water by reducing wind speed young 1997 the water use efficiency in legume non legume mixtures is greater than that in sole stands mao et al 2012 ren et al 2019 this high water use efficiency may be caused by complementarily water uptake due to differences in root distribution in the soil profile of the component crops sillon et al 2000 by decreasing evaporation loss because of better vegetation cover ghanbari et al 2010 inner mongolia is an agro pastoral ecotone ape in which both crop production and livestock farming are practiced by farmers the ape is characterized by low and highly variable precipitation and relatively unfertile soils that are susceptible to wind erosion zhao et al 2017 tang et al 2018 there is a need for a responsible use of this fragile arable land and an efficient use of the scarce water resources oats avena sativa l is an important cereal crop in rain fed cool regions because of its tolerance to drought and high nutritive value akcura and ceri 2011 inner mongolia accounts for around 30 of the total oats production in china however oats yield is low not only due to drought and unreliable rainfall yuan et al 2013 but also due to n limitation hairy vetch vicia villosa is a popular high yield and high quality annual forage crop in inner mongolian stock farming lanyasunya et al 2007 vetch performs well under cool drought and less fertile conditions seyedeh et al 2010 vetch usually grows as a sole crop in this region however vetch can also be grown in mixtures with small grains papastylianou 2004 caballero et al 1995 oats is a suitable companion cereal for intercropping with vetch thomson et al 1990 caballero and goicoechea 1986 in mixtures oats can provide support for climbing vetch improve vetch light interception and reducing rotting of vetch hay if conditions are humid roberts et al 1989 thomson et al 1990 vetch in mixtures enhances the quality of forage by increasing protein concentration vasilakoglou et al 2008 therefore oats vetch intercropping might be a practical strategy for enhancing land productivity and resource use efficiency in the ape of inner mongolia however there is little quantitative information on yield performance of oats vetch intercropping in semiarid regions we hypothesized that an intercrop of oats and vetch would be able to increase crop yields and water use efficiencies especially if continued over multiple years allowing n accumulation in the soil li et al 2011a 2011b to test this hypothesis we conducted long term field experiments from 2008 to 2016 with fixed plots and started three year measurements 6 years later 2014 2016 when the time for building long term effects was considered sufficient the objectives of this study were to a quantify land productivity of oats and vetch in the oats vetch intercropping system and b quantify water use and water use efficiencies in the oats vetch intercropping system and compare them with the sole crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were carried out at the scientific and observing experimental station of the agro environment ministry of agriculture in wuchuan county 111 41 e 40 49 n inner mongolia china the site is situated in a region with rain fed agriculture under typical semi arid and cool conditions representing a region of agricultural and pastoral ecotone the soil bulk density of 0 100 cm soil layer is 1 45 g cm3 with a field capacity of 23 0 cm3 cm 3 the soil total n is 1 09 g kg 1 available p is 4 96 mg kg 1 available k is 105 27 mg kg 1 and organic matter contents is 13 4 g kg 1 the historical mean annual rainfall was 348 80 mm from 1961 to 2015 and the annual mean air temperature during this period was 3 6 1 0 c the climate is temperate continental with warm summers and cold and dry winters the climate allows one crop per year air temperature and precipitation data for the experimental years during the growing season from may to september are provided in fig 1 2 2 experimental design a long term field experiment with three treatments was initiated in 2008 the treatments were three cropping systems 2 monocultures i sole oats so and ii sole vetch sv and the intercrop iii oats vetch strip intercropping with 4 rows of oats and 4 rows of vetch the experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates we used permanent plots over nine years to enable accumulation of long term effects of the crop systems measurements were made from 2014 because we aimed to test crop yields and water use after sufficient accumulation of long term effects on soil fertility from the two monoculture treatments and the small rotation of the intercrop with alternating strip positions each year aboveground dry matter and yield of each crop were measured from 2014 to 2016 soil moisture content was measured from 2015 to 2016 thus the experimental results in this study included long term effects of the intercrop and the sole systems the oats cultivar was the commonly used variety caoyou 1 the overall plant density i e per unit area of the total crop system both in sole crops and intercrops was 128 plants m 2 in the monoculture and 64 plants m 2 in the intercrop the vetch cultivar was the commonly used mengshao 1 its overall plant density was 134 plants m 2 in the monoculture and 67 plants m 2 in the intercrop the row spacing of oats and vetch was 25 cm in both monoculture and intercrop systems the distance between adjacent oats and vetch rows was 25 cm in the intercrop fig 2 the relative densities i e density in the intercrop divided by density in the sole crop and land sowing proportions of both crops in the intercropping system were 0 5 plot area was 48 m2 8 m length 6 m width oats and vetch were sown and harvested on the same date sowing was on may 8 in 2014 may 20 in 2015 may 9 in 2016 and harvest was on september 1 in all years weeds were removed by hand no fertilizer or irrigation were given as in farmers practice the reason for the lack fertilization in this rain fed condition is the low and unreliable rainfall all aboveground biomass of vetch was harvested for animal feed the stubble of oats was cut at 15 cm height and remained in the field until spring the experimental plots were spring ploughed to approximately 10 cm depth every year before sowing incorporating the crop remains into the ground 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 crop yields and aboveground dry matter to determine final yield the oats was harvested from a sub sampling area of 8 m2 1 m in width 8 m in length in the center of each plot the grain was sun dried until water content was 14 the final dry matter was measured using 3 randomly selected plants from the same sub sampling area after measuring fresh matter the samples were oven dried at 80 c for 2 days until they reached a constant weight harvest index hi was calculated as the ratio of grain yield 14 water to aboveground dry matter 2 3 2 soil moisture content and water use soil moisture content was measured every 10 cm from 0 to 100 cm soil depth using neutron probe cpn 503 dr cpn international inc america the measurements were made seven times during the growing season in 2015 on may 20 june 15 july 12 july 25 august 11 august 27 and august 29 and five times during the growing season in 2016 on may 9 june 9 july 1 august 2 and september 1 in the intercrop one tube was installed in the middle between adjacent oats and vetch rows in sole crops one tube was installed in the middle of each plot water use wu mm in the 1 m root zone at three development stages during the crop growing season was calculated using the water balance method allen et al 1998 there was no irrigation in our study surface runoff did not occur because each plot was flat and enclosed by a 15 cm high ridge capillary rise water was negligible because of a deep underground water table deep drainage was also negligible because there were no heavy rains in experimental period thus the water balance equation was simplified to allen et al 1998 moiwo and tao 2015 1 wu p sini sfin where p is the amount of precipitation mm during the crop growing season or different stages sini and sfin are soil water content mm within the 0 100 cm root zone at starting and ending time for a stage for whole growing season at the sowing and harvesting time 2 3 3 soil available nitrogen and organic matter contents after harvesting soil samples were taken in the top 20 cm soil layer in each plot to measure soil available nitrogen alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen and organic matter contents in 2016 the alkaline hydrolysis diffusion method was used to determine the available nitrogen content lu 2000 soil organic matter contents were measured using the h2so4 k2cr2o7 method bao 2000 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 plant level relative yield per plant and index for aggressivity the species yield responses in intercropping were analyzed comparing actual yield yint and expected yield ymono considering the land use proportion the relative yield per plant rypp and the relative yield loss δy at plant level banik et al 2006 xu et al 2008 were calculated for each component crop in the intercrop as 2 r y p p y i n t p y m o n o 3 δ y r y p p 1 100 where yint and ymono are the crop yields in the intercrop and the sole crop respectively p is the relative density of each crop in the intercrop in this case 0 5 for both species because the number of plants of each species in the intercrop was half of that in the sole crop as the intercrop consisted of strips of each species consisting of four rows with a fixed row distance of 50 cm over all treatments in this intercrop land use proportion of both species is 0 5 aggressivity a is an index that represents a simple measure of how much the relative yield increase in one species is greater or smaller than that of the other species in an intercropping system ghosh 2004 it is calculated as the difference between the relative yields per plant of the two species rao and willey 1980 4 aov ryppo ryppv where aov is the aggressivity of oats to vetch in the intercrop a positive value of aov indicates that oats is dominant and vetch dominated 2 4 2 species level water use efficiency water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated by dividing the yield y by the water use wu

the whole system during the growing season wu is not partitioned to different crop species in an intercropping system because they cannot be separately identified without modelling mao et al 2012 2 4

when ler 1 the intercropping system has a disadvantage in land productivity compared to the monocultures when the ler 1 0 there is a land use advantage in intercropping the water equivalent ratio wer was used to quantify system level water use efficiency mao et al 2012 the wer is defined by analogy with ler by determining the total water use that is needed in sole crops to produce the equivalent of the species yields on a unit area of intercrop with the associated water use the formula contains the relative areas of sole crops needed to produce the intercrop yields lero and lerv and 2 the

interpretation with water use efficiencies allows the interpretation that the wer is a sum of two ratios of water use efficiencies however the first interpretation in terms of the water used to produce the intercrop yields using sole crops is more intuitive and insightful the two formulations are equivalent the relative water saving δwu originally proposed by morris and garrity 1993 later modified by mao et al 2012 was used to evaluate if intercropping takes up more or less water considering the component crop yields than would be expected water use by producing unit yield in

differences lsd were used to separate treatment means at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 weather variability soil nitrogen and organic matter total rainfall during the growing season from sowing to harvest was 298 mm in 2014 188 mm in 2015 and 245 2 mm in 2016 in the wettest year 2014 rainfall during kernel formation in july and august was 209 mm while in the drought year 2015 rainfall during this time was only 115 7 mm and 134 5 mm in wet 2016 fig 1 overall 2014 was the wettest year with an even rainfall distribution while 2016 was also a moderately wet year but with an uneven distribution pattern the year 2015 was comparatively dry we did not find significant differences in soil available n between intercropping and sole systems in 2016 after 8 years fixed plot experiment fig 3 a the soil organic matter soil fertility only showed a small but not significant increase in the intercropping comparing with sole systems fig 3b 3 2 relative yield and aggressivity at plant level the relative yield per plant of oats was 1 18 across the three years being highest in the years with the highest rainfall 1 28 in 2014 relative yield per plant of vetch in the intercrop was 0 89 across the three years table 1 and also being highest 1 08 in the wettest year 2014 across three years the oats grain yield per plant in the intercropping was 18 higher than in the sole stand while the biomass yield per plant of intercropped vetch was 11 lower than that of sole vetch the aggressivity aov was 0 20 in 2014 0 12 in 2015 and 0 55 in 2016 with an average of 0 3 in 3 years fig 4 this shows that oats was always the dominant species while vetch was dominated oats was more competitive in the wet years 2014 and 2016 than in the dry year 2015 indicating the competitive balance between the species was affected by weather 3 3 crop yields at species level oats yields per unit area of the whole crop system were significantly affected by year in both intercropping and sole stand yield was 1 53 t ha 1 in 2014 wettest 0 96 t ha 1 in 2015 dry and 0 97 t ha 1 in 2016 wet but uneven distribution pattern table 1 in the monoculture and 0 92 t ha 1 in 2014 0 48 t ha 1 in 2015 and 0 57 t ha 1 in 2016 in the intercrop the harvest index hi of sole oats did not significantly differ over years while the hi of the intercropped oats was not significant different from that of sole oats in 2015 and 2016 but significantly higher in 2014 table 1 due to high rainfall during kernel formation in july and august in this year fig 1 overall the hi of oats was 11 higher in the intercrop than in the monoculture vetch biomass yield per unit area of the whole system in the intercrop and the sole stand was significantly affected by year the yield in sole vetch was 2 86 t ha 1 in wettest 2014 1 69 t ha 1 in dry 2015 and 2 20 t ha 1 in 2016 the yield in intercropped vetch was 1 48 t ha 1 in 2014 0 71 t ha 1 in 2015 and 0 68 t ha 1in 2016 in the intercropping table 1 vetch yields in both the intercrop and the sole stand were lower in the moderately wet year 2016 than in the wettest year 2014 3 4 water use and water use efficiency at species level the rainfall during crop seasons in 2015 2016 was 216 mm on average this amount of rainfall often resulted in low soil moisture content ranging from 4 to 16 and mostly around 50 60 of field capacity figs 5 and 6 the moisture content in the soil profile of the intercrop was always lower than in sole oats and in sole vetch in both 2015 fig 5 and 2016 fig 6 especially in the deep layer 60 100 cm in dry 2015 the soil moisture content was similar in sole vetch and sole oats the very low soil moisture content in the top soil 0 10 cm in fig 5 and 6 was mainly caused by a high evaporation demand due to high wind speed in this region that might also be due to a slight systematic error because the measurement soil depth of 10 cm was less than the width of neutron probe reflection 15 cm radius soil the intercrop and sole crops consumed the same amount of water wu on average 235 mm during the whole growing season table 2 water use wu of sole vetch was more than that of sole oats and intercrop during early growth especially in the wet 2016 in other growth stages there was little difference in wu between systems the wue of intercropped oats and vetch oats and vetch yield per unit of total system water extraction was significantly lower than that of the sole stand table 2 considering that the intercrop had only 50 oats and 50 vetch we would expect that if the species were equally competitive for water each would account for half of the water use by the system if the water use was partitioned equally between oats and vetch we would expect that the wue of both species in the intercrop would be 50 of the value in the corresponding sole crop in the case of oats the wue in the intercrop was equal to or slightly but not significantly above this expected value however for vetch the wue in the intercrop was considerably and significantly less than 50 of the value in the sole crop table 2 thus the results on water use indicate that oats was dominant with respect to vetch in the acquisition of water however this did not result in a higher than expected wue for oats in the wetter year 2016 the wues of both oats and vetch were lower than in the drought year 2015 in both the sole crop and the intercrop 3 5 land equivalent ratio the land equivalent ratio ler was 1 04 on average with a standard error of 0 07 not significantly different from 1 0 over 3 years table 3 showing no significant land use advantage for oats vetch intercropping the partial ler of oats lero in the intercropping system was 0 59 across three years which is higher than the land use proportion of 0 5 while the partial ler of vetch 0 45 was lower than the land use proportion the yield advantage of oats in the intercropping was thus almost offset by the yield loss of intercropped vetch 3 6 water equivalent ratio the system level water use efficiency wer in the intercropping was on average 0 97 indicating no change in system level water use efficiency in intercropping the partial wer of oats was 0 57 on average which was higher than the land proportion 0 5 while that of vetch 0 4 was less than its sowing proportion of 0 5 the partial wers for both oats and vetch in the intercropping was slightly lower than partial lers of oats and vetch the high partial wer for oats and the low partial wer for vetch indicates that within the intercropping system oats captured a greater portion of the water than the vetch overall the intercrop did not consume more water δ wu in the relative dry year of 2015 but it consumed 8 7 less water in the relative wet 2016 for producing the same yields compared with sole stands 4 discussion the land equivalent ratio of oats vetch intercropping was 1 04 over three years not significantly different from 1 while the water equivalent ratio was 0 97 also not significantly different from 1 these metrics indicate that the oats vetch intercrop did not represent an improvement over sole crops in terms of the inputs land and water the partial ler of oats was 0 59 while the partial wer was 0 57 indicating that oats yield in the intercrop represented a greater proportion of the equivalent land area in sole crops lero 0 59 vs lerv 0 45 and it also represented a greater proportion of the equivalent water amount required in sole crop production wero 0 57 vs werv 0 40 these metrics point the same direction as the relative yields per plant 1 18 for oats and 0 89 for vetch and the aggressivity of oats vs vetch 0 3 as an average over three years oats encroached on vetch and the yield advantage of oats 18 at the per plant level and 0 59 when measured as partial ler was offset by a yield loss of vetch 11 at the per plant level and 0 45 when measured as partial ler the system has thus characteristics of a zero sum game this finding does not confirm the hypothesis that a yield advantage would result from complementarity for n acquisition this intercrop showed no advantage in a dry year 2015 or a wet year with uneven rainfall distribution pattern 2016 however the crop yields of both component crops in oats vetch intercropping was significantly higher than yields in sole stands in the wet and even rainfall distribution year 2014 thus the potential for complementarity was realized in the year with the smallest constraint on crop growth from low water availability but not in the other two years a global meta analysis revealed the ler of cereal legume mixtures was 1 17 on average indicating land and resource use advantages resulting from the combination of cereals with legumes yu et al 2016 in contrast in our study oats vetch intercropping did not show a significant land and water use advantage the key explanation for this phenomenon may be that water shortage was the key constraint a conclusion that is supported by the favourable ler and wer in the year 2014 which had a higher rainfall and better distribution of rainfall than the other years the results suggest that there is a trade off between the yields of the cereal and the legume consistent with findings of bedoussac et al 2015 and yu et al 2016 the increase of oats yield in the intercrop in a good year 2014 was mainly caused by an increase of harvest index likely due to a border row effect which results in higher light and water capture zhang et al 2007 border row effects are a major mechanism for yield advantage in intercrops e g mao et al 2012 these border row effects may be enhanced by plant plasticity zhu et al 2015 on the other hand when the taller oats gains competitive dominance over time in oats vetch intercropping shaded vetch gets less incident radiation osman et al 1998 dufour et al 2013 and would have smaller and thinner leaves in border rows because of the competition for light wang et al 2017 that would affect light interception and light use efficiency of vetch border row plants and then product less biomass oats competed for water more strongly than vetch in oats vetch intercropping especially in 2016 with a highest aggressivity aov however vetch is a drought sensitive species with a high water requirement yuan et al 2013 in a study on potato vetch intercropping in the same region we found that vetch is more competitive for water than potato and obtains partial ler and wer greater than 0 8 resulting an in overall high ler and wer of 1 3 ren et al 2019 the results indicate that the productive intercropping in semi arid rainfed condition may be achieved by the combination of one crop that requires less water and another that requires more i e by complementarity for water use if the fodder demand for husbandry is not taken into account a suitable legume crop for intercropping with oats might be faba bean which consumes less water than vetch yuan et al 2013 in our study crop yields of both oats and vetch were highly related to not only yearly precipitation but also to the seasonal distribution pattern especially during the kernel filling stage of crop growth from july to august in study region overall oats vetch intercropping in semi arid rain fed conditions does not lose in unfavorable climate 2015 but will gain more in favourable years 2014 in which ler is 1 18 in studied region in our study we did not find any significant differences in soil available n and organic matter contents between intercropping and sole systems in 2016 after 8 years fixed plot experiment fig 3 this result contrasts with findings of cong et al 2015 who found increases in soil organic c and n in intercropping over 8 years the possible reason for a small increase if any in organic matter due to intercropping might be the low productivity of the site due to low rainfall and the small straw return amount which both limits the accumulation of soil n and c our results show lack of significant improvements of soil c and n by intercropping under semi arid conditions in nine years this indicates that it is realistic to have low expectations on organic matter increases by intercropping under the study conditions addition or organic supplements such as compost or manure are likely more effective pathways to increase soil organic matter celik et al 2004 the results of the current study suggest that complementarity for a certain trait in this case a trait for n acquisition is not expressed as an advantage at system level if other traits are constraining system performance substantially more strongly this result in a useful suggestion for intercropping systems the complementarity should be sought for the factor that is most constraining the productivity e g for water use in water limited regions the complementary for water use could be achieved by relay intercropping rahman et al 2017 and or by selecting species that have differences in root distribution and in water acquisition ren et al 2019 5 conclusions our hypothesis that intercropping oats with vetch can improve land productivity and water use efficiency was rejected because of severe water competition between two component crops under the water limited conditions of the study intercropping oats with vetch with no fertilization and irrigation showed on average no significant advantage in both land and water use in semi arid region however it is still a rational cropping system for both grain production and animal husbandry in the agriculture and pasture ecotone because this intercropping does not lose yield in unfavourable years and it might win in favourable years with more rainfall or a better rainfall distribution this system covers the soil better than the sole vetch during the fallow period and may therefore reduce the risk of wind erosion our results show an interesting evidence that not all intercropping combinations achieve land and resource use advantage advantageous intercropping in semi arid region might be achieved by the combination of one crop that requires less water and another that requires more this finding contributes to the understanding of agricultural system design and sustainability under climate change

10871,brazil has been experiencing a trend of increased mechanization although there are no studies addressing the relationship between tillage and cover crops which affects soil physical attributes cover crop dry biomass roots dry biomass yield soil water content and the influence on the least limiting water range llwr defined as the range of volumetric soil water content in which limitations to plant growth occur this study aimed to i assess llwr during two cycles in a sugarcane area using different cover crops and soil tillage systems ii correlate the llwr with different soil physical attributes soil bulk density macroporosity and soil penetration resistance and iii evaluate the potential use of llwr as an index of soil and crop quality the study was conducted under field conditions in a sugarcane culture in the municipality of ibitinga são paulo brazil we used four cover crops sunn hemp millet peanut and sorghum and three soil tillage systems no tillage nt minimum tillage mt and minimum tillage with deep subsoiling mt ds and compared them with a control treatment conventional tillage with lack of plant cover ct using an experimental design with split plot scheme the soil physical attributes were more affected during the cane cycle by the soil tillages and cover plants regarding soil water content sunn hemp and sorghum obtained the highest soil water content over time with the use of mt ds also because the soil bulk density values using sunn hemp and sorghum mt ds 1 64 and 1 59 kg dm 3 respectively are 8 lower than the ct for the layer 0 15 0 30 m for the cane plant cycle in what concerns llwr the treatments that maintained their soil water contents within the range for more than 3 months in a row were sunn hemp and millet mt ds llwr was an important indicator showing that the treatments that obtained llwr equal to zero even with high root growth and low penetration resistance were not enough to express differences in productivity this proved that the index aggregates all the information and produces satisfying results keywords diviner 2000 no tillage soil penetration resistance conservationist agriculture 1 introduction worldwide especially in brazil there is a gradual elimination of sugarcane fields by slash and burn before harvest this has resulted in an increase of areas with mechanical harvesting leading to soil compaction chagas et al 2016 due to this problem management practices which ensure the production throughout the cultivation cycle are essential for the success of sugarcane production white and johnson 2018 the alternatives found for the sector include more conservationist management systems which principles involve the reduction of tillage operations with permanent soil cover using cover crops bertioli júnior et al 2012 so that soil compaction is reduced throughout the growing cycle the use of cover crops during sugarcane implantation or renewal has advantages such as lower loss rate of soil moisture by evaporation carvalho et al 2017 protection of soil against erosion especially during the rainy season increased soil organic matter de figueiredo et al 2015 and lower ground temperature derpsch et al 2014 all of these favoring the maintenance of adequate soil water content additionally the tillage system employed also affects soil moisture and conservationist systems are more beneficial to soil water retention than conventional tillage systems by promoting higher water infiltration in the soil almeida et al 2018 therefore the use of these systems in agricultural areas has been increasing such as no tillage were the soil is not tilled use of cover crops and soil covered maintenance panachuki et al 2010 however the mechanisms involving the maintenance of soil water contents suitable for systems that use cover crops and conservationist tillage systems are yet to be fully understood especially in sugarcane areas thus the least limiting water range llwr defined as the range of water content in the soil at which the limitations to plant growth associated with water potential aeration and soil resistance to root penetration are minimal tormena et al 1999 is an interesting tool for minimizing the compacting effects on soil structure gonçalves et al 2014 induced by different management systems in addition the quantification of lower and higher llwr limits can be useful to assess the periods in which the culture was subject to deficit or excess of water availability and consequently subjected to stress in terms of available water aeration and soil penetration resistance blainski et al 2012 using this index along with the attributes that directly interfere with the llwr such as the soil physical attributes soil bulk density and macroporosity and soil water content in addition to using as reference the values of dry biomass production of the cover crops root dry biomass and productivity allows evaluating whether the llwr produces effective results for sugarcane in brazil there is no reference of using llwr as broadly as in this study comparing it with this many crop attributes which may bring a new level of responses thus there are no studies evaluating as many cover crops and conservationist soil tillage system in the same research hence our objectives were to i assess llwr during two cycles in a sugarcane area using different cover crops and soil tillage systems ii correlate the llwr with different soil physical attributes soil bulk density macroporosity and soil penetration resistance and iii evaluate the potential use of llwr as an index of soil and crop quality 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted under field conditions at santa fé mill in an experimental area in the municipality of ibitinga sp 21 45 s and 48 49 w at an altitude of 455 m above sea level the region s climate is classified as tropical with dry season aw according to the köppen climate classification alvares et al 2013 with a cold and dry winter as well as a hot and rainy summer mean annual temperature of 23 c and annual precipitation of 1260 mm cepagri 2015 temperature and precipitation were measured using an anova technology weather station configured to take measurements every five minutes which provided data for monitoring these attributes in the experimental area shown in fig 1 soil was classified as ultisol udult according to the soil taxonomy system soil survey staff 1998 particle size distribution of the soil was obtained by pipette method according to teixeira et al 2017 and values are shown in table 1 the experiment occurred on rows with cover crops planted in horizontal rows in february 2015 sunn hemp crotalaria juncea millet pennisetum glaucum l peanut arachis hypogaea l and sorghum sorghum bicolor l for biomass production of cover plants table 2 upon reaching the maximum flowering point the cover plants were sampled for dry mass production dm analysis in an area of two square meters per plot in which the plants were cut close to the ground subsequently the samples were dried at 65 c for 72 h weighed and the results expressed as mg ha 1 and then the carbon and nitrogen contents table 2 determined by dry combustion in an elemental analyzer truspec model the soil tillage managements were no tillage nt minimum tillage with subsoiling at 0 40 m depth mt and minimum tillage with deep subsoiling at 0 70 m depth mt ds for both mt and mt ds subsoiling operations were carried out using five rod subsoiler operations shown in fig 2 the treatments of soil tillage management were disposed in vertical rows with three repetitions established after cover crops in may 2015 each plot was composed of six rows of sugarcane variety ctc4 with spacing of 1 5 m and 30 m in length encompassing an area of 300 m2 per plot for the control conventional tillage ct was used consisting of soil tillage for sugarcane using two light harrows applied in the plot without cover the stalks were distributed through john deere tractors models 7205 j and a 205 hp and a dmb pcp 6000 chopped cane planter assessments were carried out throughout the plant cycle 2015 2016 and measured every three months as well as at harvesting time the same procedure was followed during the first ratoon cycle 2016 2017 root dry biomass samples were taken at the time of sugarcane harvest for both cycles together with undisturbed soil samples which were collected according to the methodology proposed by otto et al 2009 results are shown in the table 3 and yield in table 4 2 2 soil water content measures of soil water content started from the sugarcane planting may 2016 always close to the fifteenth day of the each month all the readings taken on the same day for a better standardization of results the same procedure was followed for the second year of cultivation in the first ratoon cycle may 2016 may 2017 soil water contents were measured by the method of frequency domain reflectrometry fdr using the equipment diviner 2000 sentek 2001 which consists of a display with keyboard data collector datalogger coupled to a probe by cable monitoring the soil water content was held up to one meter deep with ranges subdivided at every 0 10 m according to equipment configuration and shown in fig 3 reading frequency in diviner 2000 is stored by the datalogger at a fixed time 1 s resulting in readings around 120 000 mhz water fw and 160 000 mhz air fa depending on the soil moisture content the equipment was standardized before the measurements were taken due to differences between probes the values of fa and fw were 175 69 mhz and 123 33 mhz respectively the procedure was performed to record readings inside a pvc pipe exposed separately to air and water the output of the data provided by the datalogger is called relative frequency fr defined by eq 1 1 f r f a f s f a f w where fa frequency reading in the pvc pipe totally suspended in the air fs frequency reading in the pvc pipe in the soil fw frequency reading in the pvc pipe immersed in water even though the manufacturer supplies a global calibration curve the manufacturer recommends an in situ equipment calibration for comparison of the obtained relative frequency with volumetric soil moisture therefore equipment calibration was carried out in the experimental area using a single cover plant sunn hemp under different soil tillage systems this allowed us to isolate the cover crop effect on soil structure since the cover crops affect soil structure only at shallow depth eq 2 was used to transform the relative frequency into volumetric moisture 2 θ f r a b where θw soil volumetric moisture a b constants of the soil calibration equation table 5 presents the constants associated with the regression curve resulting from calibrating the diviner 2000 equipment for each tillage system 2 3 soil physical attributes unaltered soil samples were collected to characterize the area before the implementation of the experiment before the first harvest cane plant and after the second harvest of sugarcane first ratoon cycle aiming to evaluate the effect of cover crops and soil tillage systems on the soil physical attributes soil samples were collected in the layers at 0 00 0 15 and 0 15 0 30 m of depth with three replicates using metallic cylinders of 0 05 0 05 m soil bulk density bd was obtained by the ratio between dry soil mass and soil sample volume macroporosity map was obtained by the difference between water content of the saturated sample total porosity and water content after submitted to tension table at 6 0 kpa teixeira et al 2017 soil penetration resistance pr was estimated in laboratory using undisturbed samples guedes filho et al 2014 using an ma 933 benchmark electronic penetrometer marconi with a 4 0 mm tip and constant penetration speed of 10 mms 1 to eliminate the effect of the variation of soil water content the samples were saturated by capillarity and submitted to a matric potential of 6 0 kpa 2 4 least limiting water range llwr llwr m3 m 3 was determined using the methodology described by silva et al 1994 soil samples were collected in metallic cylinders of 0 05 0 05 m with three replicates which were submitted to a matric potential of 2 4 6 kpa on a tension table according to teixeira et al 2017 and 8 10 33 100 500 and 1500 kpa using richard s extractor richards and fireman 1943 after each sample reached the equilibrium they were weighed and then soil penetration resistance pr was determined using the procedures described in tormena et al 1998 after pr assessments the samples were kiln dried at 105 c for 24 h for determination of water content θ and soil bulk density bd to determine the llwr the soil penetration resistance curve was adjusted based on the model proposed by busscher 1990 described by eq 3 3 pr a θb bdc where pr soil penetration resistance mpa θ volumetric water content m3 m 3 bd soil bulk density mg m 3 and a b c model adjustment parameters through a logarithmic transformation we obtained eq 4 4 ln pr ln a b ln θ c ln bd the curve used to calculate the llwr is expressed by the relation between θ and bd being described mathematically by a nonlinear function according to eq 5 5 θ d ψe where θ volumetric water content m3 m 3 ψ matric potential kpa d e equation adjustment coefficients with a logarithmic transformation we obtained eq 6 6 in θ in d e in ψ the values of θ associated with ψ pr and aeration porosity ap limiting to plant growth were field capacity θfc or

and siemer 1968 2 5 statistical analysis significant differences between the treatments were assessed by analysis of variance anova using t test on subdivided plots with significance assessed through a tukey s test at 5 significance level a block test was subsequently performed using dunnett s test 5 significance level including the control treatment ct for the statistical analysis of llwr we used excel s solver for fitting linear models analysis of variance was performed by f test for the regression and the coefficients were analyzed using student s t test both at 5 significance level 3 results 3 1 soil physical attributes in the cane plant cycle alone 2015 2016 there was a significant effect of soil tillage systems on bd for the two soil layers table 6 and in the 0 00 0 15 m layer the mt ds treatment presented the lowest mean value 1 61 kg dm 3 when compared to mt and nt 1 69 kg dm 3 for the 0 15 0 30 m layer a double interaction between the cover crops and soil tillage systems was observed and the mt ds treatment showed the lowest bd mean value 1 62 kg dm 3 while nt obtained the highest value 1 68 kg dm 3 regarding cover crops peanut presented the lowest bd 1 60 kg dm 3 whereas sorghum and sunn hemp presented the highest bd values 1 68 kg dm 3 and 1 67 kg dm 3 respectively when compared to ct 1 72 kg dm 3 the treatments peanut mt 1 61 kg dm 3 and mt ds 1 56 kg dm 3 millet mt 1 61 kg dm 3 and sorghum mt ds 1 59 kg dm 3 obtained lower values of bd during the production cycle of ratoon sugarcane 2016 2017 there was no double interaction between cover crops and soil tillage systems in any of the soil layers evaluated however in the 0 00 0 15 m layer the mean bd values for sunn hemp 1 68 kg dm 3 sorghum 1 77 kg dm 3 and peanut 1 78 kg dm 3 were higher we highlight that the bd for the treatment peanut mt 1 82 kg dm 3 differed from the ct 1 71 kg dm 3 macroporosity map showed double interaction between treatments and cover crops in the sugarcane plant for the two soil layers table 7 for the 0 00 0 15 m layer the combination of peanut nt presented higher map 0 16 m3 m 3 and peanut mt millet mt ds and ct showed map values lower than 0 10 m3 m 3 in the same layer values higher than 0 12 m3 m 3 were considered significantly different from ct by dunnett s test p 0 05 contrary to the behavior found in bd millet 0 15 m3 m 3 and sunn hemp 0 12 m3 m 3 obtained the highest values of map while also unlike bd nt 0 13 m3 m 3 obtained a higher map followed by mt 0 11 m3 m 3 and finally mt ds 0 10 m3 m 3 obtained the lowest mean for the 0 15 0 30 m layer there was a reduction in map compared to the superficial layer table 7 for the sugarcane plant cycle a double interaction between soil tillage and cover crops was observed as was the case for the superficial layer the highest macroporosity value in the sugarcane plant was for millet 0 15 m3 m 3 followed by sunn hemp mt 0 14 m3 m 3 which were the only treatments that obtained higher values than ct 0 08 m3 m 3 by dunnett s test at 5 significance level table 7 in the first ratoon cycle there were differences between soil tillage system for the subsurface and superficial layers table 7 mt had a higher map in the subsurface layer 0 07 m3 m 3 than in the surface layer 0 05 m3 m 3 nt was equal in both 0 06 m3 m 3 and mt ds presented a lower value in the subsurface layer 0 05 m3 m 3 compared to the superficial 0 06 m3 m 3 all the values found are below the value considered as limiting for an adequate aeration of the soil 0 10 m3 m 3 and did not differ from ct it can be observed that the treatment with mt which used sunn hemp and millet as cover crops differed from ct both in the superficial layer and in the 0 15 0 30 m layer during the sugarcane plant cycle results regarding cover crops were opposite to those for bd but proved that mt was better for both physical attributes soil penetration resistance pr presented a similar behavior to map with double interactions for both depths during the sugarcane plant culture but not for ratoon sugarcane table 8 the superficial layer of the sugarcane cycle showed no difference between cover crops but differences were observed between soil tillage systems with the highest pr obtained by nt 1 54 mpa followed by mt 1 07 mpa and mt ds 0 97 mpa the highest pr value between the treatments was 1 88 mpa for peanut nt whereas the lowest was 0 57 mpa for peanut mt ds and values lower than 0 97 mpa differed statistically from ct 1 56 mpa by dunnett s test p 0 05 table 8 the first ratoon cycle presented difference between the soil tillage systems with the highest pr obtained by mt 1 60 mpa followed by mt ds 1 31 mpa and nt 1 22 mpa for the 0 15 0 30 m layer the pr had a double interaction between tillage and cover crop with the highest value of 2 14 mpa for sunn hemp mt and the lowest of 0 69 mpa for sorghum mt ds table 8 differences in soil tillage were found with mt and nt 1 49 mpa higher than mt ds 1 08 mpa while for cover crops the highest pr occurred for sunn hemp 1 64 mpa followed by millet 1 30 mpa peanut 1 24 mpa and sorghum 1 23 mpa for the first ratoon cycle in the subsurface layer only differences in soil tillage were found for pr with mt 1 57 mpa higher than nt 1 25 mpa and mt ds 1 18 mpa following the same classification as the sugarcane cycle and for the superficial layer of the first ratoon cycle table 8 during the sugarcane ratoon cycle the pr values for the treatments were not statistically different from ct in any layer the pr values were the only ones to show statistical differences between soil tillage systems in all the cycles evaluated 3 2 least limiting water range llwr for the 0 00 0 15 m depth the llwr did not reach a critical bulk density value density in which it becomes null fig 4 a however the bulk density would be close to 1 80 mg m 3 while for the 0 15 0 30 m depth b the critical density would be 1 70 mg m 3 for the superficial layer the lower limit was soil penetration resistance pr and the higher limit was field capacity fc up to the density 1 57 mg m 3 fig 4 over this value the higher limit became aeration porosity ap for the 0 15 0 30 m layer the higher limit throughout the llwr was field capacity fc but the lower limit was the permanent wilting point pwp up to the density 1 40 mg m 3 being replaced by pr after this value for the plant cycle the llwr was higher for the first layer when compared to the second fig 5 a and b respectively in which there was a less pronounced decrease during the fc performance as higher limit and a more pronounced decrease when aeration porosity became the higher limit for the 0 15 0 30 m layer the llwr presented a continuous decrease because pr was the lower limiting factor for almost all the density values evaluated and 50 were outside the range limit llwr 0 for the ratoon cycle peanut mt obtained a llwr equal to zero in the superficial depth for the 0 15 0 30 m depth the highest llwr values were found for millet mt 0 04 m3 m 3 followed by millet mt ds 0 02 m3 m 3 and ct 0 01 m3 m 3 with the other treatments presenting llwr equal to zero fig 5b ct presented a llwr equal to zero in the cane plant cycle and 0 10 m3 m 3 in the ratoon cycle fig 5a 3 3 distribution of soil water content at critical llwr limits fig 6 shows the soil water content obtained during the two sugarcane production cycles plant and first ratoon sugarcane with their higher and lower limits established according to the intervals obtained in fig 4 fig 6 also presents the phenological phases namely phase i sprouting and establishment 0 30 days after planting dap phase ii establishment and tillering 31 109 dap phase iii maximum growth 109 347 dap and phase iv maturation 348 389 dap phases ii and iii need more water compared to the others and for both cycles the phases obtained the highest soil water contents at both depths figs 4 and 5 phase i is the one that requires the least amount of water although achieved high levels of soil water content in all treatments in phase iv the lowest water contents occured at both depths but it is a phase which requires low water contents for the plants because it is already established for peanut in the ratoon cycle the higher limit was not reached at any time during the evaluation period fig 6 however the lower limit was reached by all treatments when compared to the same period in other treatments mt ds had a longer period within the llwr and higher water content reaching soil water content of 0 25 m3 m 3 in february 2016 nt obtained soil water content within the llwr for the same period as mt ds but with lower soil water content for the first ratoon cycle only mt ds obtained llwr above zero but at no time did it exibit soil water content within the intervals sunn hemp presented the highest values for soil water content compared to the other cover crops assessed fig 6 for the sugarcane plant the higher limit was not reached and the soil water content remained above the lower limit for a longer period of time during the evaluated crop cycles for mt ds and nt as occurred with peanut it reached 0 27 m3 m 3 in february 2016 which is higher than the maximum value found for peanut 0 25 m3 m 3 also for mt ds during the first ratoon cycle mt ds was also moister compared to the other treatments remaining within the llwr for over half of the cycle a period longer than that of the plant cycle for the same treatment but acquiring lower water content with a maximum of 0 15 m3 m 3 for millet s plant cycle the higher limit was not reached by any treatment the lower limit was reached in august 2015 and april 2016 by mt ds and mt and in may 2016 by all treatments fig 6 as was observed with sunn hemp and peanut for mt ds in this case opposed to the other cover crops mt completed a longer period within the llwr when compared to mt ds although the latter reached higher values in february 0 25 m3 m 3 this result was found for both peanut and sunn hemp with the same tillage regarding ratoon cane between august 2016 and february 2017 all treatments were below the lower limits and nt remained within the llwr between may and august for sorghum during the plant cycle the higher limit was reached with mt ds and mt during january when the soil water content for these two treatments was 70 higher 0 25 m3 m 3 than the maximum values found for peanut 0 15 m3 m 3 sunn hemp 0 17 m3 m 3 and millet 0 17 m3 m 3 fig 6 the lower limits were reached for the most part of the evaluation period especially for nt which presented a low amplitude of llwr due to of its high bd however even for the other treatments such as mt ds which obtained the highest amplitude the limits were achieved in some periods such as from march to may 2016 for the 0 15 0 30 m layer where the llwr amplitude was lower certain treatments in addition to ct did not present llwr and were within the critical limits of llwr fig 7 the soil tillage system that remained for a longer period of time within the critical limits of llwr was mt ds fig 7 because it was the only treatment to obtain soil water content for peanut sunn hemp and sorghum during the plant cycle while for millet it was mt in the deeper layer the restrictive conditions were more pronounced since the soil water content was outside the critical limits of llwr for a longer period mainly due to the higher bd that caused shorter limits making it more difficult for moisture to conform also despite the higher bd and lower map higher soil water contents were found reaching 0 30 m3 m 3 for millet mt in november it is notable that the treatments of millet nt and mt ds as well as sorghum mt and nt obtained a llwr of zero therefore it is not possible to relate moisture to llwr for the 0 15 0 30 m layer in the ratoon cycle the soil water content for all the cover crops were below the higher limit for all the treatments fig 7 except for millet mt which obtained water content in the intervals july august 2016 and december 2016 march 2017 this treatment also obtained higher water content throughout the cycle as in december in which it obtained water content of 0 20 m3 m 3 while peanut sunn hemp and sorghum obtained 0 10 0 15 and 0 12 m3 m 3 respectively during the ratoon cycle peanut and sorghum were not within the limits of llwr in any soil tillage system fig 7 in turn sunn hemp obtained soil water content only for mt and millet for all the treatments the highest amplitude of llwr was observed for mt this resulted in the water content being within the adequate moisture range for the full development of the plants during a longer evaluation period despite the low amplitude of llwr presented in the 0 15 0 30 m layer the soil water content was higher than that of the superficial layer highlighting the treatment with mt ds during the ratoon cycle fig 7 both with peanuts sunn hemp and millet during which water content was above the remaining treatments 4 discussion 4 1 physical attributes of the soil and its effect on llwr soil bulk density bd is important for the least limiting water range llwr because the intervals were evaluated from bd values and it was observed that bd reduces the llwr fig 5 during the plant cycle bd was affected by soil tillage in both layers and by cover crops only in the subsurface layer 0 15 0 30 m while in the first ratoon cycle there was only influence of cover crops on the superficial layer 0 00 0 15 m this is a consequence of a reduction in the effect of soil tillage for the passage of the sugarcane harvester due to its high weight vischi filho et al 2015a while cover crops have their effect maximized in the first ratoon cycle because of the decomposition of the root system one of the hypothesis of this study was that sorghum would obtain lower bd values due to its high dry biomass production table 2 as well as higher root system biomass table 3 but this result was not obtained because the fibrous roots could not decompact the soil leading to a more superficial root development not reaching higher depths for nutrients the lowest bd values table 6 were observed for millet and sunn hemp in the latter due to the fact that it is a legume with higher nitrogen fixation high c n ratio table 2 and consequent delay in decomposition protecting the soil for a longer time giacomini et al 2003 the use of mt ds provided lower bd values during the plant cycle in both depths certainly the disruption of restrictive layers by the subsoiler in deeper layers 0 70 m contributed to this result since the use of deep subsoilers affects soil respiration which added to the break of the compacted layer increases porosity and reduces bd shukla et al 2017 in spite of this torres et al 2008 when studying several cover crops also found that sunn hemp and millet obtained lower bd and higher map compared to sorghum in what concerns the soil tillage system the high degree of soil disturbance caused by ct tends to generate lower density values in the superficial layer however in the 0 15 0 30 m layer bd increases because the tillage is not effective in these depths cherubin et al 2016 the increase in bd caused negative effects on llwr because of its influence on both the higher and lower limits promoting lower water storage higher bd values may promote restrictive conditions to plant growth mainly due to the proximity of the high values with critical density values considered 1 60 mg dm 3 by silva and rosolem 2001 in this study most treatments presented bd values above this value for both cycles indicating soil compaction macroporosity map for the plant cycle at both depths was affected by the different tillage systems evaluated but only the 0 15 0 30 m layer was affected by the cover crops this effect was also found by cherubin et al 2016 who evaluated areas cultivated with sugarcane in several latitudes in brazil and found values below the one considered restrictive for plant respiration of 0 10 m3 m 3 for the ratoon cycle the map values at both depths were below the recommended limiting value which may cause restrictions on root development xu et al 1992 and aerobic respiration higher map values were observed in the treatments with mt and nt by everton et al 2015 who justified the results by the greater contribution of organic matter that these systems offer to the soil despite the short period of time there is also greater accumulation of roots in the superficial layer mainly up to 0 20 m blackburn 1984 and of roots from the previous cycle plant sugarcane faroni and trivelin 2006 favoring the formation of macropores from the decomposition of these roots by soil microorganisms as occurred for bd the root system of sorghum did not affect map in depth but only in the superficial layer table 7 where it concentrates due to compaction the reduction of macroporosity is a reflex of soil compaction resulting from the increase in bd which consequently impairs the llwr because of the decrease in aeration chen et al 2014 a reduced macroporosity leads to an increased microporosity which in turn tends to affect penetration resistance pr the results of bd and map relate to those obtained by pr table 8 in this case the most influential factor were soil tillage systems because they are directly related to soil compaction and decompaction due to the different levels of tillage that occurred in the experiment thus the higher pr values for the 0 15 0 30 m layer also occur because of the presence of cultural residues on the soil surface generated by the cover crops during the plant cycle there is a consequent increase in organic matter content and stability of aggregates reducing pr prado et al 2014 mt ds resulted in lower prs even in the first ratoon cycle in which there was no influence of cover crops on any of the depths this is an effect of a moderate tillage applied in the already compacted area for decompaction producing positive effects excessive tillage as in ct cause soil disruption and reduce fauna and flora carvalho et al 2017 leaving the soil more susceptible to compaction table 8 despite this it is expected that with several cycles of sugarcane nt will become more viable because it reinforces long term positive effects constant tillage even if in a localized way as in mt ds disrupts the soil to the point of degradation silva et al 2012a b mainly due to the fact that during the transformation of the pasture into sugarcane several soil disruptions take place causing a long term negative effect and affecting the tillage systems used in sugarcane oliveira et al 2019 cherubin et al 2016 found that soil tillage brings benefits in the short term but in the long run reduces the soil capacity to resist degradation due to erosion sugarcane is one of the main brazilian crops and the state of são paulo where the experiment was carried out is its main national producer the fact that the soils are already compacted raises concern regarding the ways in which the soil is used in the long term and it is important to adopt more conservationist managements to maintain the productivity of são paulo soils in the long run the solutions include along with the use of cover crops and soil tillage field traffic control aguilera esteban et al 2019 souza et al 2015 and straw retention in the soil satiro et al 2017 leading to a more sustainable culture in these regions 4 2 least limiting water range pr was the lower limit in both depths indicating the degree of compaction in these areas when pr and bd increase there is an increase in cohesion caused by the action of soil moisture between the particles which become closer as the soil is compacted or becomes denser tormena et al 2007 the limiting density was about 1 80 mg m 3 for the most superficial layer and 1 70 mg m 3 in lower depth these values were higher than those observed by other authors who have conducted studies on sugarcane gonçalves et al 2014 souza et al 2015 however this is an expected result given that this is a soil with a history of compaction for the cane s plant cycle in both depths the highest values for llwr were found using mt ds with sorghum sunn hemp and peanut while the treatment that presented the lowest intervals was nt because of the high bd values ct generated results below the other treatments for its high bd and in the subsurface layer its llwr was equal to zero the use of straw on the soil surface reduces soil density and penetration resistance in the superficial layer mishra et al 2015 thus the use of this management practice added to deep subsoiling was beneficial for the treatments bd is positively correlated with fc and pr and negatively correlated with ap this proves that the soil evaluated is compacted mainly on the superficial layer 0 00 0 15 m since from the moment ap becomes the higher limit there is a physical limitation of aeration nevertheless the llwr interval for the superficial layer was still higher than that found for the subsurface layer fig 4 proving that the organic matter originated from the straw decomposition table 2 had positive effects on llwr the organic matter also affected the llwr in the superficial layer in the study by ferreira et al 2017 who analyzed potato cultures with different irrigation regimes throughout the sugarcane cycles there is an increase in compaction caused by machines vischi filho et al 2015b in our experiment this hypothesis can be proved by the increased density and consequent reduction of llwr causing development problems for the plant which develop in the root system table 3 for the ratoon cycle root production became homogeneous in all the treatments gonçalves et al 2014 evaluating the effects of traffic on llwr found that after 20 machines crossings without differentiating them in an oxisol with sugarcane its interval reaches zero we highlight the performance of the treatments sunn hemp and sorghum mt ds for the superficial layer in the plant cycle which were the only ones to remain in the region where field capacity is the limiting feature and llwr is higher this fact translates into greater advantages compared to the other treatments that have ap as restriction resulting in higher root growth table 3 in these treatments 4 3 soil water content the soil water contents were strongly influenced by the precipitations occurring in the area fig 1 taking into consideration that sugarcane in brazil is planted from march to may that is the beginning of the dry season thus during the development of the cane plant the soil must remain moist for the longest possible period in case of water scarcity especially in areas without irrigation as is the reality of most sugarcane cultures in the state of são paulo for all soil tillage systems there was a peak during rainy periods in areas using mt ds due to a higher map table 7 which has a significant contribution to the total porosity however in times of drought it presented lower soil water content and mt began to stand out due to subsoiling at 0 70 m there is a higher formation of initial macropores caused by the physical deformation of the soil leading to an accumulation of more water in times of saturation affecting both layers evaluated in this study after the machine traffic this effect was maintained in the plant cycle showing that although the physical attributes are homogenized tables 6 and 7 caused by the lower pr table 8 this demonstrates that the soil is less compacted with water accumulation over time due to the conversion of macropores into micropores silva et al 2012 using the penta implement which performs deep subsoiling in areas of sugarcane also found that this treatment brings benefits in the short term but that this effect decreases over time mt generated lower water content than mt ds but was stable throughout the cycles mainly in the subsurface layer for the plant cycle for the first ratoon cycle in the surface layer mt was higher for millet and sorghum while in the subsurface layer it was higher for sunn hemp millet and sorghum because this treatment has a moderate tillage of the soil it tends to generated the best results in the medium term during the period without stabilization of nt sorghum was expected to have the best performance in soil water content because of its higher dry biomass production table 2 which resulted in a higher root dry biomass table 3 however this result occurred only for the plant cycle in the 0 00 0 15 m layer and in rainy periods because its high densities table 6 and low map table 7 led to a less expressive effect on the soil water content compared to millet and sunn hemp among the coverage crops evaluated sunn hemp obtained the best results because of the high amount of straw produced table 2 a result also found by ambrosano et al 2014 in addition to its more aggressive root system also found by ambrosano et al 2013 rosolem et al 2002 evaluating the roots of several cover crops found that sunn hemp generated a larger root diameter at the depth of four compaction levels which when decomposing generate a greater amount of large biopores which then become macropores table 7 peanut was the cover crop with the lowest soil water content because its characteristics are the opposite of sunn hemp that is less root biomass table 3 and amount of straw table 2 moreover its harvest causes greater disturbance of the soil compared to the tillage systems favoring its degradation miura et al 2016 this degradation is also observed in ct also characterized by excessive soil disturbance in which it generated lower water content higher bd table 6 and lower map table 7 compromising the root development of sugarcane table 3 thus this proves that soil tilling before or during the culture of sugarcane should be avoided because it negatively affects several aspects for the two sugarcane cycles the alternation between excess and scarcity of water resulted in uneven distribution of soil water contents which may affect the sugarcane phenological cycle silva et al 2012a b the sugarcane plant in phase 1 suffered an excess of water according to fritche and iriarte 2015 the excess in phase 1 can be beneficial because it allows a high growth of the plant and higher accumulation of sucrose for the dry period as long as it is not accompanied by soil erosion through which the seedlings or tails move in place destroying the already developed root system for phase 3 and 4 of the first cycle the amount of water supplied was enough on the other hand in the second cycle the excess occurred only in phase 1 this fact can be harmful to the plant because it is in phases 2 and 3 that the most pronounced development of the root system and production of dry matter occur hence the water deficit may be considered the major cause of world productivity problems rampino et al 2006 according to machado et al 2009 stress in these phases causes problems in the stem growth and leaf elongation which are essential for plant photosynthesis in addition medeiros et al 2016 found out that sunn hemp is very resistant to water stress being recommended for saline waters millet was also suggested as a drought resistant plant by yamane et al 2018 when intercropped with rice it causes its roots to search for deep water and can also be used in semi arid areas sorghum is also a drought resistant plant according to assefa et al 2010 especially when using selected varieties for this resistance bandyopadhyay et al 2005 found that peanuts need high amounts of water and recommended their use in irrigated areas with that the peanut is the least drought resistant plant as a cover crop obtaining less soil water contents 4 4 soil water content and its relationship with the least limiting water range based on the data obtained for the llwr it was possible to follow the periods in which the soil water contents were ideal and with this evaluate when there was excess or lack of water for the sugarcane culture for the superficial layer all cover crops obtained positive llwr above zero during the plant cycle among the treatments evaluated sorghum was the cover plant that provided the maintenance of the soil water content within the llwr limits for a longer period fig 7 because of its low densities during the plant cycle table 6 the other cover crops sunn hemp millet and peanut maintained their soil water contents below the lower limit of llwr indicating that the content achieved in this period was not enough for the full development of the culture the lack of water for the full development of the culture causes problems in its development and consequently in juice quality and productivity which are important attributes for the industry ferreira et al 2017 cover crops affect the soil water content because of the amount of dry mass produced which protects the soil from the direct incidence of solar rays and helps maintain the water content as a result of the lower soil temperature variations both in the extreme summer and extreme winter straw positively affects the soil water content and temperature awe et al 2015 however as the crop residues of the cover crops remained on the soil surface only during the plant cycle one can say that they directly affected the soil water content only for this cycle for the other treatments sorghum millet peanut and ct during most of the evaluation period the soil water contents were below the lower critical limit of llwr only for millet and mt ds the water content remained above the higher critical limit for a few months of the plant cycle which can be harmful due to excess water resulting in lack of oxygen for root respiration both water excess and deficit cause problems in the development of the plant in the case of deficit there is reduction of antioxidants boaretto et al 2014 while the excess can impair root respiration iamaguti et al 2015 and promote the percolation of nutrients santos et al 2016 most treatments resulted in llwr equal to zero during the ratoon cycle due to the structural degradation of the treatments such as increased density and reduced macroporosity among the treatments that obtained positive llwr none can be considered as limit references because they are below 0 05 m3 m 3 a value below the limit considered critical in the literature of 0 10 m3 m 3 which means that for ratoon sugarcane llwr cannot be used as a parameter for analysis xu et al 1992 the results obtained from the physical attributes such as bd and map in addition to an evaluation only considering soil water content would lead us to the belief that their effects on crop productivity would be manifold however there was no statistical difference for productivity table 4 proving the importance of the analysis of llwr as an index for evaluating crop quality from the results found it was possible to see that there was a depletion of the soil physical attributes with increase of bd reduction of map and increase of pr although the llwr is fixed for the evaluated soil for each layer the result of these physical attributes over time by plotting the reduction of bd reduced the llwr found for the treatments due to their high bd despite the balanced water content throughout the crop the treatments did not differ in any of the productivity cycles and there was a reduction in productivity with the evolution of the productive cycles also the productivity of ct which for all the other indices was more degraded was above some treatments such as peanut mt ds in the plant cycle and only below sorghum mt and mt ds millet nt and sunn hemp mt ds this proves that the treatments by not fitting within the llwr significantly affected crop productivity which is the most important factor for the producer thus llwr intervals must be considered and measures should be taken to mitigate their effects on productivity these results in addition to the values of the llwr limits show that appropriate soil management cover crops and tillage systems with less tilling increase soil water content the soil tillage system that generated water content within the llwr limits was mt ds along with the use of cover crops such as sunn hemp and millet which obtained better results in this study the incorrect use of soil management can bring losses to crops which can be evaluated from the first harvest resulting in soil degradation due to water stresses that the plant may suffer and directly affecting productivity the importance of soil conservationist managements should be disclosed not only to the scientific community but also to producers this has been the first study on sugarcane which denotes the importance of the interaction between physical attributes such as density and macroporosity dry biomass of the cover plant root system soil water content productivity and their effect on llwr in sugarcane areas proving by several variables the advantages of conservationist management systems which are an innovation in the area long term studies are recommended to evaluate these systems and their future inter relationships for studying the long term effect of cover crops and tillage system in various crop cycles the authors expect that this study will encourage other authors to research further physical chemical and biological characteristics to contributing to improve these new management systems 5 conclusions we aimed to evaluate the ability of the llwr index to represent soil degradation by comparing conventional soil tillage systems and conservation managements this index was important for interpreting soil physical attributes root system and water content combined leading to the belief that if the treatment does not obtain water contents within the intervals there is a good chance of reducing productivity the conservationist soil tillage systems such as minimum tillage and cover crops increase soil water ranges when compared to the conventional system millet and sunn hemp used as cover crops improve soil structure and consequently also the soil water content when compared to peanut and sorghum in comparison with conservationist tillage systems the conventional system provides the soil with lower water content higher soil bulk density and lower least limiting water range

10871,brazil has been experiencing a trend of increased mechanization although there are no studies addressing the relationship between tillage and cover crops which affects soil physical attributes cover crop dry biomass roots dry biomass yield soil water content and the influence on the least limiting water range llwr defined as the range of volumetric soil water content in which limitations to plant growth occur this study aimed to i assess llwr during two cycles in a sugarcane area using different cover crops and soil tillage systems ii correlate the llwr with different soil physical attributes soil bulk density macroporosity and soil penetration resistance and iii evaluate the potential use of llwr as an index of soil and crop quality the study was conducted under field conditions in a sugarcane culture in the municipality of ibitinga são paulo brazil we used four cover crops sunn hemp millet peanut and sorghum and three soil tillage systems no tillage nt minimum tillage mt and minimum tillage with deep subsoiling mt ds and compared them with a control treatment conventional tillage with lack of plant cover ct using an experimental design with split plot scheme the soil physical attributes were more affected during the cane cycle by the soil tillages and cover plants regarding soil water content sunn hemp and sorghum obtained the highest soil water content over time with the use of mt ds also because the soil bulk density values using sunn hemp and sorghum mt ds 1 64 and 1 59 kg dm 3 respectively are 8 lower than the ct for the layer 0 15 0 30 m for the cane plant cycle in what concerns llwr the treatments that maintained their soil water contents within the range for more than 3 months in a row were sunn hemp and millet mt ds llwr was an important indicator showing that the treatments that obtained llwr equal to zero even with high root growth and low penetration resistance were not enough to express differences in productivity this proved that the index aggregates all the information and produces satisfying results keywords diviner 2000 no tillage soil penetration resistance conservationist agriculture 1 introduction worldwide especially in brazil there is a gradual elimination of sugarcane fields by slash and burn before harvest this has resulted in an increase of areas with mechanical harvesting leading to soil compaction chagas et al 2016 due to this problem management practices which ensure the production throughout the cultivation cycle are essential for the success of sugarcane production white and johnson 2018 the alternatives found for the sector include more conservationist management systems which principles involve the reduction of tillage operations with permanent soil cover using cover crops bertioli júnior et al 2012 so that soil compaction is reduced throughout the growing cycle the use of cover crops during sugarcane implantation or renewal has advantages such as lower loss rate of soil moisture by evaporation carvalho et al 2017 protection of soil against erosion especially during the rainy season increased soil organic matter de figueiredo et al 2015 and lower ground temperature derpsch et al 2014 all of these favoring the maintenance of adequate soil water content additionally the tillage system employed also affects soil moisture and conservationist systems are more beneficial to soil water retention than conventional tillage systems by promoting higher water infiltration in the soil almeida et al 2018 therefore the use of these systems in agricultural areas has been increasing such as no tillage were the soil is not tilled use of cover crops and soil covered maintenance panachuki et al 2010 however the mechanisms involving the maintenance of soil water contents suitable for systems that use cover crops and conservationist tillage systems are yet to be fully understood especially in sugarcane areas thus the least limiting water range llwr defined as the range of water content in the soil at which the limitations to plant growth associated with water potential aeration and soil resistance to root penetration are minimal tormena et al 1999 is an interesting tool for minimizing the compacting effects on soil structure gonçalves et al 2014 induced by different management systems in addition the quantification of lower and higher llwr limits can be useful to assess the periods in which the culture was subject to deficit or excess of water availability and consequently subjected to stress in terms of available water aeration and soil penetration resistance blainski et al 2012 using this index along with the attributes that directly interfere with the llwr such as the soil physical attributes soil bulk density and macroporosity and soil water content in addition to using as reference the values of dry biomass production of the cover crops root dry biomass and productivity allows evaluating whether the llwr produces effective results for sugarcane in brazil there is no reference of using llwr as broadly as in this study comparing it with this many crop attributes which may bring a new level of responses thus there are no studies evaluating as many cover crops and conservationist soil tillage system in the same research hence our objectives were to i assess llwr during two cycles in a sugarcane area using different cover crops and soil tillage systems ii correlate the llwr with different soil physical attributes soil bulk density macroporosity and soil penetration resistance and iii evaluate the potential use of llwr as an index of soil and crop quality 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted under field conditions at santa fé mill in an experimental area in the municipality of ibitinga sp 21 45 s and 48 49 w at an altitude of 455 m above sea level the region s climate is classified as tropical with dry season aw according to the köppen climate classification alvares et al 2013 with a cold and dry winter as well as a hot and rainy summer mean annual temperature of 23 c and annual precipitation of 1260 mm cepagri 2015 temperature and precipitation were measured using an anova technology weather station configured to take measurements every five minutes which provided data for monitoring these attributes in the experimental area shown in fig 1 soil was classified as ultisol udult according to the soil taxonomy system soil survey staff 1998 particle size distribution of the soil was obtained by pipette method according to teixeira et al 2017 and values are shown in table 1 the experiment occurred on rows with cover crops planted in horizontal rows in february 2015 sunn hemp crotalaria juncea millet pennisetum glaucum l peanut arachis hypogaea l and sorghum sorghum bicolor l for biomass production of cover plants table 2 upon reaching the maximum flowering point the cover plants were sampled for dry mass production dm analysis in an area of two square meters per plot in which the plants were cut close to the ground subsequently the samples were dried at 65 c for 72 h weighed and the results expressed as mg ha 1 and then the carbon and nitrogen contents table 2 determined by dry combustion in an elemental analyzer truspec model the soil tillage managements were no tillage nt minimum tillage with subsoiling at 0 40 m depth mt and minimum tillage with deep subsoiling at 0 70 m depth mt ds for both mt and mt ds subsoiling operations were carried out using five rod subsoiler operations shown in fig 2 the treatments of soil tillage management were disposed in vertical rows with three repetitions established after cover crops in may 2015 each plot was composed of six rows of sugarcane variety ctc4 with spacing of 1 5 m and 30 m in length encompassing an area of 300 m2 per plot for the control conventional tillage ct was used consisting of soil tillage for sugarcane using two light harrows applied in the plot without cover the stalks were distributed through john deere tractors models 7205 j and a 205 hp and a dmb pcp 6000 chopped cane planter assessments were carried out throughout the plant cycle 2015 2016 and measured every three months as well as at harvesting time the same procedure was followed during the first ratoon cycle 2016 2017 root dry biomass samples were taken at the time of sugarcane harvest for both cycles together with undisturbed soil samples which were collected according to the methodology proposed by otto et al 2009 results are shown in the table 3 and yield in table 4 2 2 soil water content measures of soil water content started from the sugarcane planting may 2016 always close to the fifteenth day of the each month all the readings taken on the same day for a better standardization of results the same procedure was followed for the second year of cultivation in the first ratoon cycle may 2016 may 2017 soil water contents were measured by the method of frequency domain reflectrometry fdr using the equipment diviner 2000 sentek 2001 which consists of a display with keyboard data collector datalogger coupled to a probe by cable monitoring the soil water content was held up to one meter deep with ranges subdivided at every 0 10 m according to equipment configuration and shown in fig 3 reading frequency in diviner 2000 is stored by the datalogger at a fixed time 1 s resulting in readings around 120 000 mhz water fw and 160 000 mhz air fa depending on the soil moisture content the equipment was standardized before the measurements were taken due to differences between probes the values of fa and fw were 175 69 mhz and 123 33 mhz respectively the procedure was performed to record readings inside a pvc pipe exposed separately to air and water the output of the data provided by the datalogger is called relative frequency fr defined by eq 1 1 f r f a f s f a f w where fa frequency reading in the pvc pipe totally suspended in the air fs frequency reading in the pvc pipe in the soil fw frequency reading in the pvc pipe immersed in water even though the manufacturer supplies a global calibration curve the manufacturer recommends an in situ equipment calibration for comparison of the obtained relative frequency with volumetric soil moisture therefore equipment calibration was carried out in the experimental area using a single cover plant sunn hemp under different soil tillage systems this allowed us to isolate the cover crop effect on soil structure since the cover crops affect soil structure only at shallow depth eq 2 was used to transform the relative frequency into volumetric moisture 2 θ f r a b where θw soil volumetric moisture a b constants of the soil calibration equation table 5 presents the constants associated with the regression curve resulting from calibrating the diviner 2000 equipment for each tillage system 2 3 soil physical attributes unaltered soil samples were collected to characterize the area before the implementation of the experiment before the first harvest cane plant and after the second harvest of sugarcane first ratoon cycle aiming to evaluate the effect of cover crops and soil tillage systems on the soil physical attributes soil samples were collected in the layers at 0 00 0 15 and 0 15 0 30 m of depth with three replicates using metallic cylinders of 0 05 0 05 m soil bulk density bd was obtained by the ratio between dry soil mass and soil sample volume macroporosity map was obtained by the difference between water content of the saturated sample total porosity and water content after submitted to tension table at 6 0 kpa teixeira et al 2017 soil penetration resistance pr was estimated in laboratory using undisturbed samples guedes filho et al 2014 using an ma 933 benchmark electronic penetrometer marconi with a 4 0 mm tip and constant penetration speed of 10 mms 1 to eliminate the effect of the variation of soil water content the samples were saturated by capillarity and submitted to a matric potential of 6 0 kpa 2 4 least limiting water range llwr llwr m3 m 3 was determined using the methodology described by silva et al 1994 soil samples were collected in metallic cylinders of 0 05 0 05 m with three replicates which were submitted to a matric potential of 2 4 6 kpa on a tension table according to teixeira et al 2017 and 8 10 33 100 500 and 1500 kpa using richard s extractor richards and fireman 1943 after each sample reached the equilibrium they were weighed and then soil penetration resistance pr was determined using the procedures described in tormena et al 1998 after pr assessments the samples were kiln dried at 105 c for 24 h for determination of water content θ and soil bulk density bd to determine the llwr the soil penetration resistance curve was adjusted based on the model proposed by busscher 1990 described by eq 3 3 pr a θb bdc where pr soil penetration resistance mpa θ volumetric water content m3 m 3 bd soil bulk density mg m 3 and a b c model adjustment parameters through a logarithmic transformation we obtained eq 4 4 ln pr ln a b ln θ c ln bd the curve used to calculate the llwr is expressed by the relation between θ and bd being described mathematically by a nonlinear function according to eq 5 5 θ d ψe where θ volumetric water content m3 m 3 ψ matric potential kpa d e equation adjustment

and siemer 1968 2 5 statistical analysis significant differences between the treatments were assessed by analysis of variance anova using t test on subdivided plots with significance assessed through a tukey s test at 5 significance level a block test was subsequently performed using dunnett s test 5 significance level including the control treatment ct for the statistical analysis of llwr we used excel s solver for fitting linear models analysis of variance was performed by f test for the regression and the coefficients were analyzed using student s t test both at 5 significance level 3 results 3 1 soil physical attributes in the cane plant cycle alone 2015 2016 there was a significant effect of soil tillage systems on bd for the two soil layers table 6 and in the 0 00 0 15 m layer the mt ds treatment presented the lowest mean value 1 61 kg dm 3 when compared to mt and nt 1 69 kg dm 3 for the 0 15 0 30 m layer a double interaction between the cover crops and soil tillage systems was observed and the mt ds treatment showed the lowest bd mean value 1 62 kg dm 3 while nt obtained the highest value 1 68 kg dm 3 regarding cover crops peanut presented the lowest bd 1 60 kg dm 3 whereas sorghum and sunn hemp presented the highest bd values 1 68 kg dm 3 and 1 67 kg dm 3 respectively when compared to ct 1 72 kg dm 3 the treatments peanut mt 1 61 kg dm 3 and mt ds 1 56 kg dm 3 millet mt 1 61 kg dm 3 and sorghum mt ds 1 59 kg dm 3 obtained lower values of bd during the production cycle of ratoon sugarcane 2016 2017 there was no double interaction between cover crops and soil tillage systems in any of the soil layers evaluated however in the 0 00 0 15 m layer the mean bd values for sunn hemp 1 68 kg dm 3 sorghum 1 77 kg dm 3 and peanut 1 78 kg dm 3 were higher we highlight that the bd for the treatment peanut mt 1 82 kg dm 3 differed from the ct 1 71 kg dm 3 macroporosity map showed double interaction between treatments and cover crops in the sugarcane plant for the two soil layers table 7 for the 0 00 0 15 m layer the combination of peanut nt presented higher map 0 16 m3 m 3 and peanut mt millet mt ds and ct showed map values lower than 0 10 m3 m 3 in the same layer values higher than 0 12 m3 m 3 were considered significantly different from ct by dunnett s test p 0 05 contrary to the behavior found in bd millet 0 15 m3 m 3 and sunn hemp 0 12 m3 m 3 obtained the highest values of map while also unlike bd nt 0 13 m3 m 3 obtained a higher map followed by mt 0 11 m3 m 3 and finally mt ds 0 10 m3 m 3 obtained the lowest mean for the 0 15 0 30 m layer there was a reduction in map compared to the superficial layer table 7 for the sugarcane plant cycle a double interaction between soil tillage and cover crops was observed as was the case for the superficial layer the highest macroporosity value in the sugarcane plant was for millet 0 15 m3 m 3 followed by sunn hemp mt 0 14 m3 m 3 which were the only treatments that obtained higher values than ct 0 08 m3 m 3 by dunnett s test at 5 significance level table 7 in the first ratoon cycle there were differences between soil tillage system for the subsurface and superficial layers table 7 mt had a higher map in the subsurface layer 0 07 m3 m 3 than in the surface layer 0 05 m3 m 3 nt was equal in both 0 06 m3 m 3 and mt ds presented a lower value in the subsurface layer 0 05 m3 m 3 compared to the superficial 0 06 m3 m 3 all the values found are below the value considered as limiting for an adequate aeration of the soil 0 10 m3 m 3 and did not differ from ct it can be observed that the treatment with mt which used sunn hemp and millet as cover crops differed from ct both in the superficial layer and in the 0 15 0 30 m layer during the sugarcane plant cycle results regarding cover crops were opposite to those for bd but proved that mt was better for both physical attributes soil penetration resistance pr presented a similar behavior to map with double interactions for both depths during the sugarcane plant culture but not for ratoon sugarcane table 8 the superficial layer of the sugarcane cycle showed no difference between cover crops but differences were observed between soil tillage systems with the highest pr obtained by nt 1 54 mpa followed by mt 1 07 mpa and mt ds 0 97 mpa the highest pr value between the treatments was 1 88 mpa for peanut nt whereas the lowest was 0 57 mpa for peanut mt ds and values lower than 0 97 mpa differed statistically from ct 1 56 mpa by dunnett s test p 0 05 table 8 the first ratoon cycle presented difference between the soil tillage systems with the highest pr obtained by mt 1 60 mpa followed by mt ds 1 31 mpa and nt 1 22 mpa for the 0 15 0 30 m layer the pr had a double interaction between tillage and cover crop with the highest value of 2 14 mpa for sunn hemp mt and the lowest of 0 69 mpa for sorghum mt ds table 8 differences in soil tillage were found with mt and nt 1 49 mpa higher than mt ds 1 08 mpa while for cover crops the highest pr occurred for sunn hemp 1 64 mpa followed by millet 1 30 mpa peanut 1 24 mpa and sorghum 1 23 mpa for the first ratoon cycle in the subsurface layer only differences in soil tillage were found for pr with mt 1 57 mpa higher than nt 1 25 mpa and mt ds 1 18 mpa following the same classification as the sugarcane cycle and for the superficial layer of the first ratoon cycle table 8 during the sugarcane ratoon cycle the pr values for the treatments were not statistically different from ct in any layer the pr values were the only ones to show statistical differences between soil tillage systems in all the cycles evaluated 3 2 least limiting water range llwr for the 0 00 0 15 m depth the llwr did not reach a critical bulk density value density in which it becomes null fig 4 a however the bulk density would be close to 1 80 mg m 3 while for the 0 15 0 30 m depth b the critical density would be 1 70 mg m 3 for the superficial layer the lower limit was soil penetration resistance pr and the higher limit was field capacity fc up to the density 1 57 mg m 3 fig 4 over this value the higher limit became aeration porosity ap for the 0 15 0 30 m layer the higher limit throughout the llwr was field capacity fc but the lower limit was the permanent wilting point pwp up to the density 1 40 mg m 3 being replaced by pr after this value for the plant cycle the llwr was higher for the first layer when compared to the second fig 5 a and b respectively in which there was a less pronounced decrease during the fc performance as higher limit and a more pronounced decrease when aeration porosity became the higher limit for the 0 15 0 30 m layer the llwr presented a continuous decrease because pr was the lower limiting factor for almost all the density values evaluated and 50 were outside the range limit llwr 0 for the ratoon cycle peanut mt obtained a llwr equal to zero in the superficial depth for the 0 15 0 30 m depth the highest llwr values were found for millet mt 0 04 m3 m 3 followed by millet mt ds 0 02 m3 m 3 and ct 0 01 m3 m 3 with the other treatments presenting llwr equal to zero fig 5b ct presented a llwr equal to zero in the cane plant cycle and 0 10 m3 m 3 in the ratoon cycle fig 5a 3 3 distribution of soil water content at critical llwr limits fig 6 shows the soil water content obtained during the two sugarcane production cycles plant and first ratoon sugarcane with their higher and lower limits established according to the intervals obtained in fig 4 fig 6 also presents the phenological phases namely phase i sprouting and establishment 0 30 days after planting dap phase ii establishment and tillering 31 109 dap phase iii maximum growth 109 347 dap and phase iv maturation 348 389 dap phases ii and iii need more water compared to the others and for both cycles the phases obtained the highest soil water contents at both depths figs 4 and 5 phase i is the one that requires the least amount of water although achieved high levels of soil water content in all treatments in phase iv the lowest water contents occured at both depths but it is a phase which requires low water contents for the plants because it is already established for peanut in the ratoon cycle the higher limit was not reached at any time during the evaluation period fig 6 however the lower limit was reached by all treatments when compared to the same period in other treatments mt ds had a longer period within the llwr and higher water content reaching soil water content of 0 25 m3 m 3 in february 2016 nt obtained soil water content within the llwr for the same period as mt ds but with lower soil water content for the first ratoon cycle only mt ds obtained llwr above zero but at no time did it exibit soil water content within the intervals sunn hemp presented the highest values for soil water content compared to the other cover crops assessed fig 6 for the sugarcane plant the higher limit was not reached and the soil water content remained above the lower limit for a longer period of time during the evaluated crop cycles for mt ds and nt as occurred with peanut it reached 0 27 m3 m 3 in february 2016 which is higher than the maximum value found for peanut 0 25 m3 m 3 also for mt ds during the first ratoon cycle mt ds was also moister compared to the other treatments remaining within the llwr for over half of the cycle a period longer than that of the plant cycle for the same treatment but acquiring lower water content with a maximum of 0 15 m3 m 3 for millet s plant cycle the higher limit was not reached by any treatment the lower limit was reached in august 2015 and april 2016 by mt ds and mt and in may 2016 by all treatments fig 6 as was observed with sunn hemp and peanut for mt ds in this case opposed to the other cover crops mt completed a longer period within the llwr when compared to mt ds although the latter reached higher values in february 0 25 m3 m 3 this result was found for both peanut and sunn hemp with the same tillage regarding ratoon cane between august 2016 and february 2017 all treatments were below the lower limits and nt remained within the llwr between may and august for sorghum during the plant cycle the higher limit was reached with mt ds and mt during january when the soil water content for these two treatments was 70 higher 0 25 m3 m 3 than the maximum values found for peanut 0 15 m3 m 3 sunn hemp 0 17 m3 m 3 and millet 0 17 m3 m 3 fig 6 the lower limits were reached for the most part of the evaluation period especially for nt which presented a low amplitude of llwr due to of its high bd however even for the other treatments such as mt ds which obtained the highest amplitude the limits were achieved in some periods such as from march to may 2016 for the 0 15 0 30 m layer where the llwr amplitude was lower certain treatments in addition to ct did not present llwr and were within the critical limits of llwr fig 7 the soil tillage system that remained for a longer period of time within the critical limits of llwr was mt ds fig 7 because it was the only treatment to obtain soil water content for peanut sunn hemp and sorghum during the plant cycle while for millet it was mt in the deeper layer the restrictive conditions were more pronounced since the soil water content was outside the critical limits of llwr for a longer period mainly due to the higher bd that caused shorter limits making it more difficult for moisture to conform also despite the higher bd and lower map higher soil water contents were found reaching 0 30 m3 m 3 for millet mt in november it is notable that the treatments of millet nt and mt ds as well as sorghum mt and nt obtained a llwr of zero therefore it is not possible to relate moisture to llwr for the 0 15 0 30 m layer in the ratoon cycle the soil water content for all the cover crops were below the higher limit for all the treatments fig 7 except for millet mt which obtained water content in the intervals july august 2016 and december 2016 march 2017 this treatment also obtained higher water content throughout the cycle as in december in which it obtained water content of 0 20 m3 m 3 while peanut sunn hemp and sorghum obtained 0 10 0 15 and 0 12 m3 m 3 respectively during the ratoon cycle peanut and sorghum were not within the limits of llwr in any soil tillage system fig 7 in turn sunn hemp obtained soil water content only for mt and millet for all the treatments the highest amplitude of llwr was observed for mt this resulted in the water content being within the adequate moisture range for the full development of the plants during a longer evaluation period despite the low amplitude of llwr presented in the 0 15 0 30 m layer the soil water content was higher than that of the superficial layer highlighting the treatment with mt ds during the ratoon cycle fig 7 both with peanuts sunn hemp and millet during which water content was above the remaining treatments 4 discussion 4 1 physical attributes of the soil and its effect on llwr soil bulk density bd is important for the least limiting water range llwr because the intervals were evaluated from bd values and it was observed that bd reduces the llwr fig 5 during the plant cycle bd was affected by soil tillage in both layers and by cover crops only in the subsurface layer 0 15 0 30 m while in the first ratoon cycle there was only influence of cover crops on the superficial layer 0 00 0 15 m this is a consequence of a reduction in the effect of soil tillage for the passage of the sugarcane harvester due to its high weight vischi filho et al 2015a while cover crops have their effect maximized in the first ratoon cycle because of the decomposition of the root system one of the hypothesis of this study was that sorghum would obtain lower bd values due to its high dry biomass production table 2 as well as higher root system biomass table 3 but this result was not obtained because the fibrous roots could not decompact the soil leading to a more superficial root development not reaching higher depths for nutrients the lowest bd values table 6 were observed for millet and sunn hemp in the latter due to the fact that it is a legume with higher nitrogen fixation high c n ratio table 2 and consequent delay in decomposition protecting the soil for a longer time giacomini et al 2003 the use of mt ds provided lower bd values during the plant cycle in both depths certainly the disruption of restrictive layers by the subsoiler in deeper layers 0 70 m contributed to this result since the use of deep subsoilers affects soil respiration which added to the break of the compacted layer increases porosity and reduces bd shukla et al 2017 in spite of this torres et al 2008 when studying several cover crops also found that sunn hemp and millet obtained lower bd and higher map compared to sorghum in what concerns the soil tillage system the high degree of soil disturbance caused by ct tends to generate lower density values in the superficial layer however in the 0 15 0 30 m layer bd increases because the tillage is not effective in these depths cherubin et al 2016 the increase in bd caused negative effects on llwr because of its influence on both the higher and lower limits promoting lower water storage higher bd values may promote restrictive conditions to plant growth mainly due to the proximity of the high values with critical density values considered 1 60 mg dm 3 by silva and rosolem 2001 in this study most treatments presented bd values above this value for both cycles indicating soil compaction macroporosity map for the plant cycle at both depths was affected by the different tillage systems evaluated but only the 0 15 0 30 m layer was affected by the cover crops this effect was also found by cherubin et al 2016 who evaluated areas cultivated with sugarcane in several latitudes in brazil and found values below the one considered restrictive for plant respiration of 0 10 m3 m 3 for the ratoon cycle the map values at both depths were below the recommended limiting value which may cause restrictions on root development xu et al 1992 and aerobic respiration higher map values were observed in the treatments with mt and nt by everton et al 2015 who justified the results by the greater contribution of organic matter that these systems offer to the soil despite the short period of time there is also greater accumulation of roots in the superficial layer mainly up to 0 20 m blackburn 1984 and of roots from the previous cycle plant sugarcane faroni and trivelin 2006 favoring the formation of macropores from the decomposition of these roots by soil microorganisms as occurred for bd the root system of sorghum did not affect map in depth but only in the superficial layer table 7 where it concentrates due to compaction the reduction of macroporosity is a reflex of soil compaction resulting from the increase in bd which consequently impairs the llwr because of the decrease in aeration chen et al 2014 a reduced macroporosity leads to an increased microporosity which in turn tends to affect penetration resistance pr the results of bd and map relate to those obtained by pr table 8 in this case the most influential factor were soil tillage systems because they are directly related to soil compaction and decompaction due to the different levels of tillage that occurred in the experiment thus the higher pr values for the 0 15 0 30 m layer also occur because of the presence of cultural residues on the soil surface generated by the cover crops during the plant cycle there is a consequent increase in organic matter content and stability of aggregates reducing pr prado et al 2014 mt ds resulted in lower prs even in the first ratoon cycle in which there was no influence of cover crops on any of the depths this is an effect of a moderate tillage applied in the already compacted area for decompaction producing positive effects excessive tillage as in ct cause soil disruption and reduce fauna and flora carvalho et al 2017 leaving the soil more susceptible to compaction table 8 despite this it is expected that with several cycles of sugarcane nt will become more viable because it reinforces long term positive effects constant tillage even if in a localized way as in mt ds disrupts the soil to the point of degradation silva et al 2012a b mainly due to the fact that during the transformation of the pasture into sugarcane several soil disruptions take place causing a long term negative effect and affecting the tillage systems used in sugarcane oliveira et al 2019 cherubin et al 2016 found that soil tillage brings benefits in the short term but in the long run reduces the soil capacity to resist degradation due to erosion sugarcane is one of the main brazilian crops and the state of são paulo where the experiment was carried out is its main national producer the fact that the soils are already compacted raises concern regarding the ways in which the soil is used in the long term and it is important to adopt more conservationist managements to maintain the productivity of são paulo soils in the long run the solutions include along with the use of cover crops and soil tillage field traffic control aguilera esteban et al 2019 souza et al 2015 and straw retention in the soil satiro et al 2017 leading to a more sustainable culture in these regions 4 2 least limiting water range pr was the lower limit in both depths indicating the degree of compaction in these areas when pr and bd increase there is an increase in cohesion caused by the action of soil moisture between the particles which become closer as the soil is compacted or becomes denser tormena et al 2007 the limiting density was about 1 80 mg m 3 for the most superficial layer and 1 70 mg m 3 in lower depth these values were higher than those observed by other authors who have conducted studies on sugarcane gonçalves et al 2014 souza et al 2015 however this is an expected result given that this is a soil with a history of compaction for the cane s plant cycle in both depths the highest values for llwr were found using mt ds with sorghum sunn hemp and peanut while the treatment that presented the lowest intervals was nt because of the high bd values ct generated results below the other treatments for its high bd and in the subsurface layer its llwr was equal to zero the use of straw on the soil surface reduces soil density and penetration resistance in the superficial layer mishra et al 2015 thus the use of this management practice added to deep subsoiling was beneficial for the treatments bd is positively correlated with fc and pr and negatively correlated with ap this proves that the soil evaluated is compacted mainly on the superficial layer 0 00 0 15 m since from the moment ap becomes the higher limit there is a physical limitation of aeration nevertheless the llwr interval for the superficial layer was still higher than that found for the subsurface layer fig 4 proving that the organic matter originated from the straw decomposition table 2 had positive effects on llwr the organic matter also affected the llwr in the superficial layer in the study by ferreira et al 2017 who analyzed potato cultures with different irrigation regimes throughout the sugarcane cycles there is an increase in compaction caused by machines vischi filho et al 2015b in our experiment this hypothesis can be proved by the increased density and consequent reduction of llwr causing development problems for the plant which develop in the root system table 3 for the ratoon cycle root production became homogeneous in all the treatments gonçalves et al 2014 evaluating the effects of traffic on llwr found that after 20 machines crossings without differentiating them in an oxisol with sugarcane its interval reaches zero we highlight the performance of the treatments sunn hemp and sorghum mt ds for the superficial layer in the plant cycle which were the only ones to remain in the region where field capacity is the limiting feature and llwr is higher this fact translates into greater advantages compared to the other treatments that have ap as restriction resulting in higher root growth table 3 in these treatments 4 3 soil water content the soil water contents were strongly influenced by the precipitations occurring in the area fig 1 taking into consideration that sugarcane in brazil is planted from march to may that is the beginning of the dry season thus during the development of the cane plant the soil must remain moist for the longest possible period in case of water scarcity especially in areas without irrigation as is the reality of most sugarcane cultures in the state of são paulo for all soil tillage systems there was a peak during rainy periods in areas using mt ds due to a higher map table 7 which has a significant contribution to the total porosity however in times of drought it presented lower soil water content and mt began to stand out due to subsoiling at 0 70 m there is a higher formation of initial macropores caused by the physical deformation of the soil leading to an accumulation of more water in times of saturation affecting both layers evaluated in this study after the machine traffic this effect was maintained in the plant cycle showing that although the physical attributes are homogenized tables 6 and 7 caused by the lower pr table 8 this demonstrates that the soil is less compacted with water accumulation over time due to the conversion of macropores into micropores silva et al 2012 using the penta implement which performs deep subsoiling in areas of sugarcane also found that this treatment brings benefits in the short term but that this effect decreases over time mt generated lower water content than mt ds but was stable throughout the cycles mainly in the subsurface layer for the plant cycle for the first ratoon cycle in the surface layer mt was higher for millet and sorghum while in the subsurface layer it was higher for sunn hemp millet and sorghum because this treatment has a moderate tillage of the soil it tends to generated the best results in the medium term during the period without stabilization of nt sorghum was expected to have the best performance in soil water content because of its higher dry biomass production table 2 which resulted in a higher root dry biomass table 3 however this result occurred only for the plant cycle in the 0 00 0 15 m layer and in rainy periods because its high densities table 6 and low map table 7 led to a less expressive effect on the soil water content compared to millet and sunn hemp among the coverage crops evaluated sunn hemp obtained the best results because of the high amount of straw produced table 2 a result also found by ambrosano et al 2014 in addition to its more aggressive root system also found by ambrosano et al 2013 rosolem et al 2002 evaluating the roots of several cover crops found that sunn hemp generated a larger root diameter at the depth of four compaction levels which when decomposing generate a greater amount of large biopores which then become macropores table 7 peanut was the cover crop with the lowest soil water content because its characteristics are the opposite of sunn hemp that is less root biomass table 3 and amount of straw table 2 moreover its harvest causes greater disturbance of the soil compared to the tillage systems favoring its degradation miura et al 2016 this degradation is also observed in ct also characterized by excessive soil disturbance in which it generated lower water content higher bd table 6 and lower map table 7 compromising the root development of sugarcane table 3 thus this proves that soil tilling before or during the culture of sugarcane should be avoided because it negatively affects several aspects for the two sugarcane cycles the alternation between excess and scarcity of water resulted in uneven distribution of soil water contents which may affect the sugarcane phenological cycle silva et al 2012a b the sugarcane plant in phase 1 suffered an excess of water according to fritche and iriarte 2015 the excess in phase 1 can be beneficial because it allows a high growth of the plant and higher accumulation of sucrose for the dry period as long as it is not accompanied by soil erosion through which the seedlings or tails move in place destroying the already developed root system for phase 3 and 4 of the first cycle the amount of water supplied was enough on the other hand in the second cycle the excess occurred only in phase 1 this fact can be harmful to the plant because it is in phases 2 and 3 that the most pronounced development of the root system and production of dry matter occur hence the water deficit may be considered the major cause of world productivity problems rampino et al 2006 according to machado et al 2009 stress in these phases causes problems in the stem growth and leaf elongation which are essential for plant photosynthesis in addition medeiros et al 2016 found out that sunn hemp is very resistant to water stress being recommended for saline waters millet was also suggested as a drought resistant plant by yamane et al 2018 when intercropped with rice it causes its roots to search for deep water and can also be used in semi arid areas sorghum is also a drought resistant plant according to assefa et al 2010 especially when using selected varieties for this resistance bandyopadhyay et al 2005 found that peanuts need high amounts of water and recommended their use in irrigated areas with that the peanut is the least drought resistant plant as a cover crop obtaining less soil water contents 4 4 soil water content and its relationship with the least limiting water range based on the data obtained for the llwr it was possible to follow the periods in which the soil water contents were ideal and with this evaluate when there was excess or lack of water for the sugarcane culture for the superficial layer all cover crops obtained positive llwr above zero during the plant cycle among the treatments evaluated sorghum was the cover plant that provided the maintenance of the soil water content within the llwr limits for a longer period fig 7 because of its low densities during the plant cycle table 6 the other cover crops sunn hemp millet and peanut maintained their soil water contents below the lower limit of llwr indicating that the content achieved in this period was not enough for the full development of the culture the lack of water for the full development of the culture causes problems in its development and consequently in juice quality and productivity which are important attributes for the industry ferreira et al 2017 cover crops affect the soil water content because of the amount of dry mass produced which protects the soil from the direct incidence of solar rays and helps maintain the water content as a result of the lower soil temperature variations both in the extreme summer and extreme winter straw positively affects the soil water content and temperature awe et al 2015 however as the crop residues of the cover crops remained on the soil surface only during the plant cycle one can say that they directly affected the soil water content only for this cycle for the other treatments sorghum millet peanut and ct during most of the evaluation period the soil water contents were below the lower critical limit of llwr only for millet and mt ds the water content remained above the higher critical limit for a few months of the plant cycle which can be harmful due to excess water resulting in lack of oxygen for root respiration both water excess and deficit cause problems in the development of the plant in the case of deficit there is reduction of antioxidants boaretto et al 2014 while the excess can impair root respiration iamaguti et al 2015 and promote the percolation of nutrients santos et al 2016 most treatments resulted in llwr equal to zero during the ratoon cycle due to the structural degradation of the treatments such as increased density and reduced macroporosity among the treatments that obtained positive llwr none can be considered as limit references because they are below 0 05 m3 m 3 a value below the limit considered critical in the literature of 0 10 m3 m 3 which means that for ratoon sugarcane llwr cannot be used as a parameter for analysis xu et al 1992 the results obtained from the physical attributes such as bd and map in addition to an evaluation only considering soil water content would lead us to the belief that their effects on crop productivity would be manifold however there was no statistical difference for productivity table 4 proving the importance of the analysis of llwr as an index for evaluating crop quality from the results found it was possible to see that there was a depletion of the soil physical attributes with increase of bd reduction of map and increase of pr although the llwr is fixed for the evaluated soil for each layer the result of these physical attributes over time by plotting the reduction of bd reduced the llwr found for the treatments due to their high bd despite the balanced water content throughout the crop the treatments did not differ in any of the productivity cycles and there was a reduction in productivity with the evolution of the productive cycles also the productivity of ct which for all the other indices was more degraded was above some treatments such as peanut mt ds in the plant cycle and only below sorghum mt and mt ds millet nt and sunn hemp mt ds this proves that the treatments by not fitting within the llwr significantly affected crop productivity which is the most important factor for the producer thus llwr intervals must be considered and measures should be taken to mitigate their effects on productivity these results in addition to the values of the llwr limits show that appropriate soil management cover crops and tillage systems with less tilling increase soil water content the soil tillage system that generated water content within the llwr limits was mt ds along with the use of cover crops such as sunn hemp and millet which obtained better results in this study the incorrect use of soil management can bring losses to crops which can be evaluated from the first harvest resulting in soil degradation due to water stresses that the plant may suffer and directly affecting productivity the importance of soil conservationist managements should be disclosed not only to the scientific community but also to producers this has been the first study on sugarcane which denotes the importance of the interaction between physical attributes such as density and macroporosity dry biomass of the cover plant root system soil water content productivity and their effect on llwr in sugarcane areas proving by several variables the advantages of conservationist management systems which are an innovation in the area long term studies are recommended to evaluate these systems and their future inter relationships for studying the long term effect of cover crops and tillage system in various crop cycles the authors expect that this study will encourage other authors to research further physical chemical and biological characteristics to contributing to improve these new management systems 5 conclusions we aimed to evaluate the ability of the llwr index to represent soil degradation by comparing conventional soil tillage systems and conservation managements this index was important for interpreting soil physical attributes root system and water content combined leading to the belief that if the treatment does not obtain water contents within the intervals there is a good chance of reducing productivity the conservationist soil tillage systems such as minimum tillage and cover crops increase soil water ranges when compared to the conventional system millet and sunn hemp used as cover crops improve soil structure and consequently also the soil water content when compared to peanut and sorghum in comparison with conservationist tillage systems the conventional system provides the soil with lower water content higher soil bulk density and lower least limiting water range

10872,global crop yields are limited by the shortage of water resources and nutrient availability mulching technology can effectively modify the crop growth environment and crop production due to differences in climatic conditions spatial distribution characteristics and cropping systems hence we conducted a meta analysis to evaluate the eﬀ ects of plastic mulching pm and straw mulching sm on the yield and water use eﬃciency wue of maize cropping in china using data obtained from 176 peer reviewed publications the results showed that plastic mulching signiﬁcantly increased maize yield 29

can signiﬁcantly increase maize yield and wue the adoption of mulching practices and management practices has more application prospects keywords plastic mulching straw mulching maize yield wue meta analysis 1 introduction about 41 of the surface area of drylands supports 44 of the agricultural planting system throughout the world valipour et al 2014 wu et al 2016 in rapidly developing countries such as china the expanded urbanization the decreasing land availability for agriculture the change of climate and water shortages are increasingly threatening agricultural development day by day passioura 2007 as the largest of the world s three major grains maize is one of the most widely grown crops because of its wide use li et al 2002 meanwhile the dry area of the maize planting area accounts for 70 in china he 2012 the rain fed farming systems to produce maize are predominantly used by farmers in china but are restricted by water and nutrient supply tavakkoli and oweis 2004 thus the levels of water and nutrient inputs are important for the stability of crop productivity therefore it is necessary to adopt reasonable and effective farming measures to ensure the food security and economic development of china to solve the problem of water shortages caused by drought and uneven distribution by rainfall fluctuations mulching has been widely practiced through economic benefits and long term tillage experience unger et al 2012 for example plastic mulching has achieved a coverage area of 18 4 million hectares in recent years gao et al 2019 meanwhile the use of plastic film in 2017 reached 1 47 million tons because of its low economic cost good effect of increasing temperatures and preserving soil moisture and the increases of crops yield by 20 50 makes a great contribution to the grain production in china xue et al 2017 recently it has been reported that about 90 of harvested wheat residues in northern china are used as mulching fang et al 2010 straw mulching also plays an active role in grain production because of its full utilization of resources and improvement of field ecological microclimate abouziena et al 2008 fang et al 2010 li et al 2018a meanwhile plastic and straw mulching successfully reduce the impact of raindrops on the soil surface thereby reducing soil dispersion and sealing compared with non mulched surfaces this effect will increase water inﬁltration into soil reduce runoff and increase water storage in the soil proﬁle li et al 2013 further strengthening germination efficiency liu et al 2014 however plastic mulching could more effectively retain water promote the water use efficiency of crops and inhibit the growth of weeds by cutting off contact between the ground and the air directly wang et al 2001 thereby improving the growth environment of crops and achieving the purpose of increasing crop yield and income feng et al 2017 li et al 2013 because of the long term application and extensive use of plastic film the low standard of plastic film production and the low attention to recovery plastic residues in soil have become an important environmental problem the residual amount of mulching film in long term mulching farmlands reaches 72 259 kg ha 1 yan et al 2014 that study found that a large amount of plastic film residues destroys the soil structure and affects the quality of sowing resulting in gradual decreases in soil permeability and soil porosity and ultimately affects the water and fertilizer migration in soil and crop growth and development bai et al 2015 gong et al 2015 ibarra jiménez et al 2011 li et al 2007 maize yield was found to decrease by 11 23 when the amount of residues reached 58 5 kg ha 1 ma et al 2008 straw mulching is often considered to be a strategy for sustainable agricultural development because of the accumulation of the soil organic material that is easily decomposed thus the farmer saves the economic costs bakht et al 2009 in recent years a growing number of farmers have tried straw mulching practices with the support of the local government liu et al 2017 yin et al 2017 jin et al 2007 su et al 2007 however the straw mulching technology has its disadvantages such as reducing the solar radiation reaching the soil surface increasing the temperature is more difﬁcult than that with low water content and delaying the plant development affects the production chen et al 2005 in recent years there have been a number of studies looking for the best mulching technology to use in china however a heated debate about mulching agriculture with respect to both its effects on crops yield and wue has emerged in the published literature the data showed reduced tillage with no mulch cover leads to lower yields in semi arid areas of southern africa rusinamhodzi et al 2011 the tillage and crop residues significantly increased the yield and wue of maize and wheat in north china wang et al 2012 however there was no significant difference between straw mulching and no mulching in crop yield or water use decrease in dry land gao and li 2005 lafond et al 2009 in the semi arid areas of china a system of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching has been widely used and the crop yields have been increased by more than 30 however where this technology has been applied for several years in a row the annual balance of soil moisture has been aﬀ ected and the risk of soil desiccation increased negatively affecting crop yields li et al 2001a wang et al 2018 recent reviews have suggested that most plastics including many biodegradable plastics actually break down more easily into microplastics plastic 5 mm including nanoplastics which are 0 1 μm instead of undergoing complete degradation de souza machado et al 2018 gonzález pleiter et al 2019 also because the cost of the biodegradable plastic ﬁlm is higher the quality of biodegradable plastic ﬁlm needs to improve and the underlying mechanisms of how the biodegradable plastic mulch ﬁlm residue affect the crop growing environment need to be clarified gao et al 2019 therefore the current mulching technology is likely to still be applied for a long time so there is a major need to explore the best soil mulching method to improve crop production quality in china due to the influence of regions and local environment the results of single ﬁeld experiments cannot evaluate the comprehensive effects of mulching at regional or larger scales therefore we carried out a meta analysis to evaluate the systematic contribution of mulching methods on maize yield and wue based on macroregional perspectives and independent experiments meta analysis uses a quantitative approach to systematically compare and integrate the results of previous research to arrive at the conclusions about general patterns that occur on various scales of time and space hedges et al 1999 reasonable choices need to be made based on all available data to comprehensively assess the economic and environmental sustainability of agricultural mulching in this communication the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze plastic mulching and straw mulching in terms of improving maize yield as well as relevant wue 2 to quantify the effects of regions mulching management practices and different soil fertility and fertilizer application rates in china and 3 to screen the appropriate mulching methods in china our results can help to quantitatively evaluate different mulching technologies develop water saving strategies in semi arid regions and strengthen field management practices of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and classification in our research a detailed collection was made of the literature published from 1990 to 2018 that compared yield or wue with either plastic mulching or straw mulching we searched the literature by using several online databases including the web of science http accesss webofknowledge com the google scholar http www scholar google

conducted at 138 sites fig 1 met the criteria of our selection for the meta analysis only ﬁeld scale studies were included in the current research original documented information in early study should include average yield or average wue standard deviations sample sizes of the variables test sites types of mulching and climate additionally the means standard deviations and sample sizes of the variables must be either directly available or able to be calculated from the data already obtained zhao et al 2015 we improved the accuracy of our results by excluding articles that lack valid data daryanto et al 2017 however when we encountered articles that met our research criteria but lacked valid data we contacted the authors and in some cases were able to obtain the useful data the detailed information and relevant literatures were contained in appendix a as part of data collection and analysis we classified several aspects for each study in our database according to cultivar

responses of yield and wue between the mulching and no mulching treatments using meta win 2 1 chen et al 2012 the mean values of the experimental group under the mulching condition zt and the mean

other and when the 95 cis overlap there is no significant difference between 95 cis and zero curtis and wang 1998 in this study we used two analytical methods to verify the statistical significance of the meta analysis first we verified it in the original methods for example random effect models was adopted in case of moderate to heterogeneity literature bias introduces the analysis method of fail safe number according to the rosenberg s method and we calculated the fail safe number of yield 128380 1 and wue 289515 0 second we verified the robustness of the meta analysis process by using the sensitivity analysis method for eliminating outliers and comparing the results with the results of the original meta analysis li et al 2018a b shan and yan 2013 additionally the frequency distribution of the size of the effect is plotted to reflect the distribution law of individual research studies meanwhile the frequency of the effect is fitted to a gaussian distribution function to test the uniformity of observed data the frequency distributions of eﬀ ect sizes were found to follow gaussian normal distributions for the yield and wue of maize indicating that the datasets were homogeneous fig 2 in conclusion our study provides the quantitative analysis of results from previous studies investigating the effects of mulching on maize yield and wue the dataset consisted of 1956 comparisons yield for 1269 and wue for 387 from 176 studies there were 814 comparisons for plastic mulching yield for 600 and wue for 214 and 1142 for straw mulching yield for 669 and wue for 473 3 results 3 1 overview the grain yield and wue as affected by mulching meta analysis showed that yield and wue of maize were significantly increased by both plastic mulching and straw mulching compared to the reference values no mulching fig 3 in terms of maize yield compared to the effect of straw mulching 12 02 the increase with plastic mulching was significantly enhanced 29 24 similarly the mean effect of plastic mulching on maize wue 29 45 was also significantly higher than that of straw mulching 11 43 the plastic mulching effect was about three times as much as the straw mulching effect in terms of yield and wue fig 3 3 2 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching in different regions 3 2 1 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching in different planting regions in this study our results showed that the responses of maize yield and wue to mulching varied among different planting regions on average yield and wue of maize were significantly increased by both plastic mulching and straw mulching in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region of china in addition straw mulching significantly increased maize yield in the southern hilly maize region however plastic mulching and straw mulching had no significant effects in other planting regions for increasing yield the highest increase was found in the north maize region with plastic mulching 31 38 fig 4 a besides yield data we only analyzed the response of wue with different mulching types in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region while in the southern hilly maize region and the northwest inland maize region of china only one pair of comparisons mulching treatment and no mulching were included in published papers from these two regions for increasing wue the highest increase was found in the north maize region with plastic mulching 28 42 followed by the huanghuaihai maize region with plastic mulching 42 76 fig 4b 3 2 2 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching at different temperature and water input levels the effects of mulching were also affected by different temperature and water input levels precipitation irrigation during the maize growing season fig 5 the results showed plastic mulching had significantly increased maize yield and wue at mean water input level of 370 mm and 370 mm under the same water input level conditions plastic mulching performed better in increasing maize yield with the low temperature but plastic mulching had no significant difference in increasing maize wue with different temperature similarly straw mulching had significantly increased maize yield and wue except when the water input level was 370 mm and temperature was 19 1 c but straw mulching had no significant difference with different temperature and water input level the plastic mulching effect on maize yield was significantly better than straw mulching under the same condition temperature and water input levels we could find that plastic mulching performed best in increasing maize yield 46 90 when water input level was 370 mm and temperature was 19 1 c growth water input level 370 mm had a higher significant influence on maize wue under plastic mulching than that straw mulching fig 5 3 3 grain yield and wue as affected by different mulching management practices 3 3 1 grain yield and wue as affected with different mulching time the effects of maize yield and wue with mulching varied with different mulching times our results show that plastic mulching increased maize yield and wue no matter when the surface was covered fig 6 there were however significantly different yield and wue increases when compared with straw mulching in the mulching in growth period plastic mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 59 56 and wue 29 91 at mulching in fallow period whereas the opposite was found with the effects of straw mulching on maize yield 12 43 and wue 13 21 at mulching in the growth period in addition straw mulching did not significantly enhance maize yield and wue with mulching applied 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage fig 6 3 3 2 grain yield and wue as affected by different amounts of mulching full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield 42 06 compared with partial plastic mulching 21 98 but they were not significantly different in terms of wue fig 7 straw mulching with 0 5 t ha 1 5 10 t ha 1 and 10 15 t ha 1 amount classification could significantly increase maize yield by 10 14 12 49 and 13 35 and wue by 11 25 11 04 and 12 68 respectively however there was no significant enhancement in maize yield and wue at the rate of 15 t ha 1 where plastic mulching was better than straw mulching in increasing yield and wue fig 7 3 3 3 grain yield and wue as affected by different mulching methods among the maize mulching method treatments since there were relatively few papers on straw mulching methods only the responses of diﬀ erent plastic mulching methods on maize yield and wue were assessed our results show that ridge row mulching could significantly enhance maize yield 33 64 compared with flat row mulching 21 76 but they were not significant in terms of wue with the increase of temperature or water input the maize yield and wue tended to decrease gradually with either flat row mulching or ridge row mulching meanwhile ridge row mulching had the best effect on maize yield when either the temperature was 19 1 c or the water input was 370 mm during the growing period of maize fig 8 3 3 4 grain yield and wue as affected by plastic mulching between transparent and opaque colors a comprehensive review of the literature revealed few studies reporting different colors of plastic film mulch other than transparent and opaque black plastic film mulch for this reason the plastic film color was divided only into transparent plastic film mulch and opaque plastic film mulch in this study the responses of maize were inﬂuenced by the color of the plastic ﬁlm in china different colors of plastic mulching signiﬁcantly increased mean crop yield transparent plastic film mulch 29 89 opaque plastic film mulch 22 99 and mean wue transparent plastic film mulch 29 08 opaque plastic film mulch 33 82 but there were no signiﬁcant effects between the mulching types the eﬀ ects of transparent and opaque ﬁlm on maize yield and wue varied with either the mean air temperature or water input during the maize growing season but they had no significant difference fig 9 3 4 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching with diﬀ erent soil fertility and fertilizer application rates the responses of maize were also inﬂuenced by soil fertility and inorganic fertilizer application rates plastic mulching performed better at all npk rates fig 10 speciﬁcally the increase in maize yield was higher for plastic mulching than straw mulching at moderate n rate 200 kg ha 1 when soil available n was below 50 mg kg 1 with high soil available n 50 mg kg 1 plastic mulching exerted a greater influence on maize yield at n rates of 100 kg ha 1 fig 10a b plastic mulching performed better at a low p rate 100 200 kg ha 1 with low basic soil p fertility 20 mg kg 1 and at a moderate p rate 100 200 kg ha 1 with high basic soil p fertility 20 mg kg 1 respectively increases in maize yield were higher at a relatively low k application rate 100 kg ha 1 similarly straw mulching performed better at different relative npk rates with diﬀ erent soil basic fertilities fig 10 4 discussion the goal of this meta analysis was to evaluate the maize yield and wue responses to different mulching conditions under different planting regions climatic conditions and agricultural management and tillage practices in china we addressed the broad practice of replacing bare fallows with mulching plastic mulching and straw mulching which are known to improve maize production efficiency by altering a range of ecosystem processes dong et al 2018a we discuss the findings in detail below 4 1 different planting regions affecting the mulching improvement our research based on a variety of regional conditions showed that the regional maize benefit economic and ecological responses of mulching were closely associated with the agricultural cropping systems and climatic conditions during the growing season daryanto et al 2017 gao et al 2019 we found that plastic mulching could significantly improve yield in low temperature environments 19 1 c and low water input levels 370 mm compared with other ranges respectively however straw mulching was insensitive to these different environmental conditions when increasing yield and wue spring maize is one of the most popular grain crops in the north region and the huanghuaihai region of china liu et al 2010 but low temperature drought and frost events from april to may often lead to delays in sowing dates and seed emergence times resulting in differences in plant growth and harvest indexes gourdji et al 2015 hlavinka et al 2009 liu et al 2009 ren et al 2017 tsimba et al 2013 as a kind of crop maize needs relatively high photosynthesis efficiency so it usually grows in summer with high temperature and precipitation long et al 2006 which is the key factor for restricting maize planting and production in northwest china and high altitude localities therefore the application of mulching technology is particularly important in these areas it was found that plastic mulching could increase the topsoil temperature and moisture accelerate the speeds of germination and emergence in the early growth period and thus promote the germination advancement and establishment of the plant wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018b but there were reports that straw mulching had a signiﬁcant cooling effect liang et al 2011 and low soil temperature could extend the emergence period of crop gan et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 and ultimately straw mulching could affected crop yield chen et al 2005 in addition straw mulching preserved the topsoil structure and maintained rain water infiltration barton et al 2004 increased soil organic carbon improved the physicochemical properties of soil jordán et al 2010 and provided a good living environment for crop growth thus straw mulching had a small but positive effect on maize yield and wue ocio et al 1991 the paper qin et al 2015 summarized published data from around the world on the effect of water input levels on wheat and maize yield and wue and their conclusions were similar to ours but in some areas low temperatures and rainfall below 10 mm induced the decrease of yield liang et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 therefore under the conditions of water input and temperatures that did not meet the demand in the growing season 19 c the yield and wue of maize under mulching conditions have been significantly improved and the plastic mulching was better than straw mulching figs 6 7 bu et al 2013 liu and siddique 2015 wang et al 2016 yi et al 2010 meanwhile we found that plastic mulching performed best in the north china region while straw mulching performed best in the southern china hilly region mulching measures have failed to increase maize yield and wue in the northwest china inland which are likely to be related to the severe water shortage and excessive evaporation in the region therefore we propose to reduce the cultivation of maize crops in the northwest china inland region based on environmental protection and sustainable development considerations at present how farmers choose mulching materials is mainly based on direct consideration of economic benefits 4 2 different mulching management practices affecting the mulching improvement we analyzed the mulching management methods and found that the functions and effects of mulching were different for the different management methods plastic mulching in growth and fallow period is the best for maize production while straw mulching in the growth period is the best many studies have demonstrated that mulching during the fallow period could allow water flow from deep layers to surface layers thus improving the environment of the tilling layer and effectively increasing crop production huang et al 2005 li et al 1999 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2014a plastic mulching was not suitable for use in the fallow period because of reduced rainwater infiltration and an increased runoff rate qin et al 2013 however it has been found that rainfall was much lower than evaporation during the fallow period in arid areas and the plastic mulching performed better than straw mulching on suppressing evaporation in the present research zhang et al 2014 therefore maize did not effectively use the soil water stored wu et al 2016 so that the plastic mulching in different periods was better than straw mulching in terms of yield and wue fig 8 we found that maize growth with straw mulching was the worst when applied 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage this phenomenon might be caused by the straw mulching significantly reducing the soil temperature so that there was not enough heat energy in the early growth period of the crops fernandez et al 2008 subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 in addition mulch application during the fallow period or 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage might influence farm operations feng et al 2013 so it is important to choose the right mulching period from an economic and ecological perspective the full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield compared with partial plastic mulching because full mulching could harvest more rainfall evaporate less water and channel more rainwater to the maize root zones gao et al 2014 it could thus enhance the amount of nitrogen accumulation in the maize kernel and yield chalker scott 2007 kunzová and hejcman 2009 ramakrishna et al 2006 compared to the partial plastic mulching but different amounts of mulching were not significant in terms of maize wue this result might be related to the increased biomass and respiration and diminished soil evaporation by full plastic mulching zhou et al 2018 however fully mulched maize had a higher biomass and soil water consumption thus easily leading to a soil water deﬁcit li et al 1999 in addition our results showed that straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 amount has the best effect on increasing maize yield and wue fig 7 some experiments have also found that crops would have the best growing environment soil water content heat energy nutrient status and the highest yield when straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 blanco canqui and lal 2007 chakraborty et al 2008 döring et al 2005 but the results of cai et al cai et al 2016 showed that a straw rate of 9000 kg ha was preferable for the loess plateau of china and this may be related to the climatic conditions during the crop growth period for example if the precipitation was at a high level during the growing period of crops it might not be conducive to the collection of straw mulching however straw mulching at a level that was too high over 15 t ha 1 would have negative effects such as poor light transmittance and interception of rainwater zhang et al 2015 the ridge row plastic film mulching at low temperature 19 1 c and low water input level 370 mm could significantly increase maize yield compared with flat row plastic film mulching many studies showed that the ridge row mulching has various functions which enhance the crops growing environment such as reducing unproductive evaporation zhang et al 2011 improving the temperature difference between day and night in soil gan et al 2013 harvesting rainwater zhou et al 2009 and increasing the water flow to the roots li et al 2001b in addition jiang et al jiang et al 2015 suggested that the ridge row mulching was suitable in the semi arid areas of china by restraining the formation of the dry soil layer but when the precipitation or temperature of crop growth was high in the semi arid area of southern china the function of ridge row mulching might not be obvious the functions and effects of plastic were different for different levels of transparency transparent plastic film has good light transmittance so the surface temperature rose rapidly bu et al 2013 and thus delayed the soil temperature decrease after sunset sreedevi et al 2017 however zhao et al zhao et al 2014b found that crops with transparent plastic mulching during the whole growth period easily suffered from heat stress because of the high temperature increases in midsummer those effects were particularly greater when the temperature was low in the early growing season wang et al 2018 black plastic film strongly absorbs light and thus weeds were killed by the high temperature when in contact with the film liakatas et al 1986 but there was no significant difference in potato production between transparent plastic mulching and black plastic mulching when the average temperature was 20 c in growth period ibarra jiménez et al 2011 jia et al jia et al 2017 found that transparent plastic mulching performed better at increasing soil water and temperature when the crops suffered from drought and low temperature in summary there is a need to reasonably choose the type of plastic mulch according to the cropping system climatic conditions and the degree of adaptation to the function of different transparencies of plastic mulches in crops 4 3 diﬀ erent soil fertility and fertilizer application rates affecting the mulching improvement it is very important to define the relationships between soil fertility fertilizer application rates and crop yield and the sustainability of agricultural systems responses to plastic and straw mulching in maize yield also varied with diﬀ erent soil basic fertility and fertilizer application rates our research found that mulching treatments provided higher enhancements to maize yield at relatively low or moderate fertilizer rates fig 10 some experiments showed that the effect of low nitrogen fertilizer 0 75 kg n ha 1 on wheat yield was higher than that of high nitrogen fertilizer 150 225 kg n ha 1 under plastic mulching conditions fan et al 2005 li et al 2018a qin et al 2015 tang et al tang et al 2013 also found that straw mulching improved wheat yield by increasing soil fertility on the chengdu plain of china mulching could improve the use efficiency of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium by changing water utilization promoting absorption of soil available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium by plants and thus increasing crop yields ahamefule and peter 2014 liu et al 2016 wilson and jefferies 1996 wilson et al 1995 with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer crop yields could increase significantly hu et al 2013 zand parsa et al 2006 however the irrational use of nitrogen fertilizer not only causes a huge waste of resources and economic losses but also has adverse effects on the environment thus affecting human safety godfray et al 2010 therefore rational consideration of soil fertility and fertilizer application has great advantages for the improvement of maize yield 5 conclusions our analyses based on reported studies conducted in china showed that mulching signiﬁcantly increased the yield and wue of maize compared with no mulching practices the eﬀ ects of mulching varied with diﬀ erent growing season planting regions mulching management practices soil fertility and fertilizer application rates the mean eﬀ ects of plastic mulching on the yield and wue of maize were generally greater than those of straw mulching plastic mulching performed better in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region of china while straw mulching performed better in the southern hilly maize region plastic mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 59 56 and wue 29 91 with mulching in fallow period while straw mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 12 43 and wue 13 21 with mulching in the growth period full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield 42 06 and straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 classification amounts performed best increasing maize yield by 13 35 transparent ﬁlm and ridge row mulching were more favorable to maize growth and increased crop yield and wue in arid and low temperature areas of china in addition considering the environmental side eﬀ ects of plastic mulching and the fact that straw materials are not always available in some regions other mulching methods such as biodegradable ﬁlm mulching may be used using a combination of integrated farm managements such as non till fertilization intercropping and crop rotation crop yield and wue under mulching practices is expected to further improve in the future thus the adoption of promising mulching practices for maize production should be site speciﬁc and consider the commonly adopted ﬁeld management practices in china acknowledgements this research was supported by science

10872,global crop yields are limited by the shortage of water resources and nutrient availability mulching technology can effectively modify the crop growth environment and crop production due to differences in climatic conditions spatial distribution characteristics and cropping systems hence we conducted a meta analysis to evaluate the eﬀ ects of plastic mulching pm and straw mulching sm on the yield and water use eﬃciency wue of maize cropping in china using data obtained from 176 peer reviewed publications the results showed that plastic mulching signiﬁcantly increased maize yield 29 24 and wue 29 45 the eﬀ ects of mulching on maize were also improved by 12 02 yield and 11 43 wue at the regional scale maize yield and wue were inﬂuenced by diﬀ erent planting regions and mulching management practices plastic mulching performed best in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region of china while straw mulching performed better in the southern hilly maize region of china plastic mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 59 56 and wue 29 91 with mulching in fallow period and straw mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 12 43 and wue 13 21 with mulching in the growth period full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield 42 06 and among different amounts of straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 performed the best boosting the maize yield by 13 35 transparent ﬁlm and ridge row mulching were more favorable to maize growth and increased crop yield and wue in the arid and low temperature areas of china in conclusion plastic mulching can signiﬁcantly increase maize yield and wue the adoption of mulching practices and management practices has more application prospects keywords plastic mulching straw mulching maize yield wue meta analysis 1 introduction about 41 of the surface area of drylands supports 44 of the agricultural planting system throughout the world valipour et al 2014 wu et al 2016 in rapidly developing countries such as china the expanded urbanization the decreasing land availability for agriculture the change of climate and water shortages are increasingly threatening agricultural development day by day passioura 2007 as the largest of the world s three major grains maize is one of the most widely grown crops because of its wide use li et al 2002 meanwhile the dry area of the maize planting area accounts for 70 in china he 2012 the rain fed farming systems to produce maize are predominantly used by farmers in china but are restricted by water and nutrient supply tavakkoli and oweis 2004 thus the levels of water and nutrient inputs are important for the stability of crop productivity therefore it is necessary to adopt reasonable and effective farming measures to ensure the food security and economic development of china to solve the problem of water shortages caused by drought and uneven distribution by rainfall fluctuations mulching has been widely practiced through economic benefits and long term tillage experience unger et al 2012 for example plastic mulching has achieved a coverage area of 18 4 million hectares in recent years gao et al 2019 meanwhile the use of plastic film in 2017 reached 1 47 million tons because of its low economic cost good effect of increasing temperatures and preserving soil moisture and the increases of crops yield by 20 50 makes a great contribution to the grain production in china xue et al 2017 recently it has been reported that about 90 of harvested wheat residues in northern china are used as mulching fang et al 2010 straw mulching also plays an active role in grain production because of its full utilization of resources and improvement of field ecological microclimate abouziena et al 2008 fang et al 2010 li et al 2018a meanwhile plastic and straw mulching successfully reduce the impact of raindrops on the soil surface thereby reducing soil dispersion and sealing compared with non mulched surfaces this effect will increase water inﬁltration into soil reduce runoff and increase water storage in the soil proﬁle li et al 2013 further strengthening germination efficiency liu et al 2014 however plastic mulching could more effectively retain water promote the water use efficiency of crops and inhibit the growth of weeds by cutting off contact between the ground and the air directly wang et al 2001 thereby improving the growth environment of crops and achieving the purpose of increasing crop yield and income feng et al 2017 li et al 2013 because of the long term application and extensive use of plastic film the low standard of plastic film production and the low attention to recovery plastic residues in soil have become an important environmental problem the residual amount of mulching film in long term mulching farmlands reaches 72 259 kg ha 1 yan et al 2014 that study found that a large amount of plastic film residues destroys the soil structure and affects the quality of sowing resulting in gradual decreases in soil permeability and soil porosity and ultimately affects the water and fertilizer migration in soil and crop growth and development bai et al 2015 gong et al 2015 ibarra jiménez et al 2011 li et al 2007 maize yield was found to decrease by 11 23 when the amount of residues reached 58 5 kg ha 1 ma et al 2008 straw mulching is often considered to be a strategy for sustainable agricultural development because of the accumulation of the soil organic material that is easily decomposed thus the farmer saves the economic costs bakht et al 2009 in recent years a growing number of farmers have tried straw mulching practices with the support of the local government liu et al 2017 yin et al 2017 jin et al 2007 su et al 2007 however the straw mulching technology has its disadvantages such as reducing the solar radiation reaching the soil surface increasing the temperature is more difﬁcult than that with low water content and delaying the plant development affects the production chen et al 2005 in recent years there have been a number of studies looking for the best mulching technology to use in china however a heated debate about mulching agriculture with respect to both its effects on crops yield and wue has emerged in the published literature the data showed reduced tillage with no mulch cover leads to lower yields in semi arid areas of southern africa rusinamhodzi et al 2011 the tillage and crop residues significantly increased the yield and wue of maize and wheat in north china wang et al 2012 however there was no significant difference between straw mulching and no mulching in crop yield or water use decrease in dry land gao and li 2005 lafond et al 2009 in the semi arid areas of china a system of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching has been widely used and the crop yields have been increased by more than 30 however where this technology has been applied for several years in a row the annual balance of soil moisture has been aﬀ ected and the risk of soil desiccation increased negatively affecting crop yields li et al 2001a wang et al 2018 recent reviews have suggested that most plastics including many biodegradable plastics actually break down more easily into microplastics plastic 5 mm including nanoplastics which are 0 1 μm instead of undergoing complete degradation de souza machado et al 2018 gonzález pleiter et al 2019 also because the cost of the biodegradable plastic ﬁlm is higher the quality of biodegradable plastic ﬁlm needs to improve and the underlying mechanisms of how the biodegradable plastic mulch ﬁlm residue affect the crop growing environment need to be clarified gao et al 2019 therefore the current mulching technology is likely to still be applied for a long time so there is a major need to explore the best soil mulching method to improve crop production quality in china due to the influence of regions and local environment the results of single ﬁeld experiments cannot evaluate the comprehensive effects of mulching at regional or larger scales therefore we carried out a meta analysis to evaluate the systematic contribution of mulching methods on maize yield and wue based on macroregional perspectives and independent experiments meta analysis uses a quantitative approach to systematically compare and integrate the results of previous research to arrive at the conclusions about general patterns that occur on various scales of time and space hedges et al 1999 reasonable choices need to be made based on all available data to comprehensively assess the economic and environmental sustainability of agricultural mulching in this communication the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze plastic mulching and straw mulching in terms of improving maize yield as well as relevant wue 2 to quantify the effects of regions mulching management practices and different soil fertility and fertilizer application rates in china and 3 to screen the appropriate mulching methods in china our results can help to quantitatively evaluate different mulching technologies develop water saving strategies in semi arid regions and strengthen field management practices of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and classification in our research a detailed collection was made of the literature published from 1990 to 2018 that compared yield or wue with either plastic mulching or straw mulching we searched the literature by using several online databases including the web of science http accesss webofknowledge com the google scholar http www scholar google

conducted at 138 sites fig 1 met the criteria of our selection for the meta analysis only ﬁeld scale studies were included in the current research original documented information in early study should include average yield or average wue standard deviations sample sizes of the variables test sites types of mulching and climate additionally the means standard deviations and sample sizes of the variables must be either directly available or able to be calculated from the data already obtained zhao et al 2015 we improved the accuracy of our results by excluding articles that lack valid data daryanto et al 2017 however when we encountered articles that met our research criteria but lacked valid data we contacted the authors and in some cases were able to obtain the useful data the detailed information and relevant literatures were contained in appendix a as part of data collection and analysis we classified several aspects for each study in our database according to cultivar

methods for maize straw resources the main ones were returning to soil feeding livestock and using as fuel wang et al 2011 the maize cultivating regions and some general climatic information is shown in table 1 the locations of maize cropping field experiments and six geographic regions in the meta analysis of china are shown in fig 1 the classification of mulching structures tillage practices and climatic conditions in china can be divided into the following categories qin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a kader et al 2017 1 the mulching materials plastic mulching transparent and black and straw

n p and k 100 kg ha 1 100 200 kg ha 1 and 200 kg ha 1 since only some of the studies reported basic soil fertility and fertilizer application only the effect of mulching on maize yield was evaluated because there was no research available to the qinghai tibet plateau maize region our analysis only considered the other regions 2 2 data processing a meta analysis was adopted to analyze the responses of yield and wue between the mulching and no mulching treatments using meta win 2 1 chen et al 2012 the mean values of the experimental group under the mulching condition zt and the mean value of corresponding control treatment zc were used to calculate the mean effect size as the response ratio m e s l n z t l n z c luo et al 2010 in order to directly explain the effects on maize yield and wue we calculated the results as m e x p m e s 1 100 hedges et al 1999 we conducted an unweighted meta analysis because of the lack of literature reporting variances chen et al 2013 and we improved the statistical significance of the unweighted meta analysis by calculating the conﬁdence intervals cis rosenberg et al 2000 differences in mean effect size among groups were calculated using random effects models hedges et al 2009 a bias corrected 95 confidence interval was generated by a bootstrapping procedure 9999 iterations to improve the probability of calculating the confidence interval near the cumulative mean effect size of each classification variable daryanto et al 2017 means were considered to be significantly different from one another if their 95 cis were non overlapping and were considered significantly different from zero if the 95 ci did not overlap zero when 95 cis do not overlap the mean values are considered to be significantly different from each other and when the 95 cis overlap there is no significant difference between 95 cis and zero curtis and wang 1998 in this study we used two analytical methods to verify the statistical significance of the meta analysis first we verified it in the original methods for example random effect models was adopted in case of moderate to heterogeneity literature bias introduces the analysis method of fail safe number according to the rosenberg s method and we calculated the fail safe number of yield 128380 1 and wue 289515 0 second we verified the robustness of the meta analysis process by using the sensitivity analysis method for eliminating outliers and comparing the results with the results of the original meta analysis li et al 2018a b shan and yan 2013 additionally the frequency distribution of the size of the effect is plotted to reflect the distribution law of individual research studies meanwhile the frequency of the effect is fitted to a gaussian distribution function to test the uniformity of observed data the frequency distributions of eﬀ ect sizes were found to follow gaussian normal distributions for the yield and wue of maize indicating that the datasets were homogeneous fig 2 in conclusion our study provides the quantitative analysis of results from previous studies investigating the effects of mulching on maize yield and wue the dataset consisted of 1956 comparisons yield for 1269 and wue for 387 from 176 studies there were 814 comparisons for plastic mulching yield for 600 and wue for 214 and 1142 for straw mulching yield for 669 and wue for 473 3 results 3 1 overview the grain yield and wue as affected by mulching meta analysis showed that yield and wue of maize were significantly increased by both plastic mulching and straw mulching compared to the reference values no mulching fig 3 in terms of maize yield compared to the effect of straw mulching 12 02 the increase with plastic mulching was significantly enhanced 29 24 similarly the mean effect of plastic mulching on maize wue 29 45 was also significantly higher than that of straw mulching 11 43 the plastic mulching effect was about three times as much as the straw mulching effect in terms of yield and wue fig 3 3 2 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching in different regions 3 2 1 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching in different planting regions in this study our results showed that the responses of maize yield and wue to mulching varied among different planting regions on average yield and wue of maize were significantly increased by both plastic mulching and straw mulching in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region of china in addition straw mulching significantly increased maize yield in the southern hilly maize region however plastic mulching and straw mulching had no significant effects in other planting regions for increasing yield the highest increase was found in the north maize region with plastic mulching 31 38 fig 4 a besides yield data we only analyzed the response of wue with different mulching types in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region while in the southern hilly maize region and the northwest inland maize region of china only one pair of comparisons mulching treatment and no mulching were included in published papers from these two regions for increasing wue the highest increase was found in the north maize region with plastic mulching 28 42 followed by the huanghuaihai maize region with plastic mulching 42 76 fig 4b 3 2 2 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching at different temperature and water input levels the effects of mulching were also affected by different temperature and water input levels precipitation irrigation during the maize growing season fig 5 the results showed plastic mulching had significantly increased maize yield and wue at mean water input level of 370 mm and 370 mm under the same water input level conditions plastic mulching performed better in increasing maize yield with the low temperature but plastic mulching had no significant difference in increasing maize wue with different temperature similarly straw mulching had significantly increased maize yield and wue except when the water input level was 370 mm and temperature was 19 1 c but straw mulching had no significant difference with different temperature and water input level the plastic mulching effect on maize yield was significantly better than straw mulching under the same condition temperature and water input levels we could find that plastic mulching performed best in increasing maize yield 46 90 when water input level was 370 mm and temperature was 19 1 c growth water input level 370 mm had a higher significant influence on maize wue under plastic mulching than that straw mulching fig 5 3 3 grain yield and wue as affected by different mulching management practices 3 3 1 grain yield and wue as affected with different mulching time the effects of maize yield and wue with mulching varied with different mulching times our results show that plastic mulching increased maize yield and wue no matter when the surface was covered fig 6 there were however significantly different yield and wue increases when compared with straw mulching in the mulching in growth period plastic mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 59 56 and wue 29 91 at mulching in fallow period whereas the opposite was found with the effects of straw mulching on maize yield 12 43 and wue 13 21 at mulching in the growth period in addition straw mulching did not significantly enhance maize yield and wue with mulching applied 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage fig 6 3 3 2 grain yield and wue as affected by different amounts of mulching full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield 42 06 compared with partial plastic mulching 21 98 but they were not significantly different in terms of wue fig 7 straw mulching with 0 5 t ha 1 5 10 t ha 1 and 10 15 t ha 1 amount classification could significantly increase maize yield by 10 14 12 49 and 13 35 and wue by 11 25 11 04 and 12 68 respectively however there was no significant enhancement in maize yield and wue at the rate of 15 t ha 1 where plastic mulching was better than straw mulching in increasing yield and wue fig 7 3 3 3 grain yield and wue as affected by different mulching methods among the maize mulching method treatments since there were relatively few papers on straw mulching methods only the responses of diﬀ erent plastic mulching methods on maize yield and wue were assessed our results show that ridge row mulching could significantly enhance maize yield 33 64 compared with flat row mulching 21 76 but they were not significant in terms of wue with the increase of temperature or water input the maize yield and wue tended to decrease gradually with either flat row mulching or ridge row mulching meanwhile ridge row mulching had the best effect on maize yield when either the temperature was 19 1 c or the water input was 370 mm during the growing period of maize fig 8 3 3 4 grain yield and wue as affected by plastic mulching between transparent and opaque colors a comprehensive review of the literature revealed few studies reporting different colors of plastic film mulch other than transparent and opaque black plastic film mulch for this reason the plastic film color was divided only into transparent plastic film mulch and opaque plastic film mulch in this study the responses of maize were inﬂuenced by the color of the plastic ﬁlm in china different colors of plastic mulching signiﬁcantly increased mean crop yield transparent plastic film mulch 29 89 opaque plastic film mulch 22 99 and mean wue transparent plastic film mulch 29 08 opaque plastic film mulch 33 82 but there were no signiﬁcant effects between the mulching types the eﬀ ects of transparent and opaque ﬁlm on maize yield and wue varied with either the mean air temperature or water input during the maize growing season but they had no significant difference fig 9 3 4 grain yield and wue as affected by mulching with diﬀ erent soil fertility and fertilizer application rates the responses of maize were also inﬂuenced by soil fertility and inorganic fertilizer application rates plastic mulching performed better at all npk rates fig 10 speciﬁcally the increase in maize yield was higher for plastic mulching than straw mulching at moderate n rate 200 kg ha 1 when soil available n was below 50 mg kg 1 with high soil available n 50 mg kg 1 plastic mulching exerted a greater influence on maize yield at n rates of 100 kg ha 1 fig 10a b plastic mulching performed better at a low p rate 100 200 kg ha 1 with low basic soil p fertility 20 mg kg 1 and at a moderate p rate 100 200 kg ha 1 with high basic soil p fertility 20 mg kg 1 respectively increases in maize yield were higher at a relatively low k application rate 100 kg ha 1 similarly straw mulching performed better at different relative npk rates with diﬀ erent soil basic fertilities fig 10 4 discussion the goal of this meta analysis was to evaluate the maize yield and wue responses to different mulching conditions under different planting regions climatic conditions and agricultural management and tillage practices in china we addressed the broad practice of replacing bare fallows with mulching plastic mulching and straw mulching which are known to improve maize production efficiency by altering a range of ecosystem processes dong et al 2018a we discuss the findings in detail below 4 1 different planting regions affecting the mulching improvement our research based on a variety of regional conditions showed that the regional maize benefit economic and ecological responses of mulching were closely associated with the agricultural cropping systems and climatic conditions during the growing season daryanto et al 2017 gao et al 2019 we found that plastic mulching could significantly improve yield in low temperature environments 19 1 c and low water input levels 370 mm compared with other ranges respectively however straw mulching was insensitive to these different environmental conditions when increasing yield and wue spring maize is one of the most popular grain crops in the north region and the huanghuaihai region of china liu et al 2010 but low temperature drought and frost events from april to may often lead to delays in sowing dates and seed emergence times resulting in differences in plant growth and harvest indexes gourdji et al 2015 hlavinka et al 2009 liu et al 2009 ren et al 2017 tsimba et al 2013 as a kind of crop maize needs relatively high photosynthesis efficiency so it usually grows in summer with high temperature and precipitation long et al 2006 which is the key factor for restricting maize planting and production in northwest china and high altitude localities therefore the application of mulching technology is particularly important in these areas it was found that plastic mulching could increase the topsoil temperature and moisture accelerate the speeds of germination and emergence in the early growth period and thus promote the germination advancement and establishment of the plant wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018b but there were reports that straw mulching had a signiﬁcant cooling effect liang et al 2011 and low soil temperature could extend the emergence period of crop gan et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 and ultimately straw mulching could affected crop yield chen et al 2005 in addition straw mulching preserved the topsoil structure and maintained rain water infiltration barton et al 2004 increased soil organic carbon improved the physicochemical properties of soil jordán et al 2010 and provided a good living environment for crop growth thus straw mulching had a small but positive effect on maize yield and wue ocio et al 1991 the paper qin et al 2015 summarized published data from around the world on the effect of water input levels on wheat and maize yield and wue and their conclusions were similar to ours but in some areas low temperatures and rainfall below 10 mm induced the decrease of yield liang et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 therefore under the conditions of water input and temperatures that did not meet the demand in the growing season 19 c the yield and wue of maize under mulching conditions have been significantly improved and the plastic mulching was better than straw mulching figs 6 7 bu et al 2013 liu and siddique 2015 wang et al 2016 yi et al 2010 meanwhile we found that plastic mulching performed best in the north china region while straw mulching performed best in the southern china hilly region mulching measures have failed to increase maize yield and wue in the northwest china inland which are likely to be related to the severe water shortage and excessive evaporation in the region therefore we propose to reduce the cultivation of maize crops in the northwest china inland region based on environmental protection and sustainable development considerations at present how farmers choose mulching materials is mainly based on direct consideration of economic benefits 4 2 different mulching management practices affecting the mulching improvement we analyzed the mulching management methods and found that the functions and effects of mulching were different for the different management methods plastic mulching in growth and fallow period is the best for maize production while straw mulching in the growth period is the best many studies have demonstrated that mulching during the fallow period could allow water flow from deep layers to surface layers thus improving the environment of the tilling layer and effectively increasing crop production huang et al 2005 li et al 1999 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2014a plastic mulching was not suitable for use in the fallow period because of reduced rainwater infiltration and an increased runoff rate qin et al 2013 however it has been found that rainfall was much lower than evaporation during the fallow period in arid areas and the plastic mulching performed better than straw mulching on suppressing evaporation in the present research zhang et al 2014 therefore maize did not effectively use the soil water stored wu et al 2016 so that the plastic mulching in different periods was better than straw mulching in terms of yield and wue fig 8 we found that maize growth with straw mulching was the worst when applied 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage this phenomenon might be caused by the straw mulching significantly reducing the soil temperature so that there was not enough heat energy in the early growth period of the crops fernandez et al 2008 subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 in addition mulch application during the fallow period or 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage might influence farm operations feng et al 2013 so it is important to choose the right mulching period from an economic and ecological perspective the full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield compared with partial plastic mulching because full mulching could harvest more rainfall evaporate less water and channel more rainwater to the maize root zones gao et al 2014 it could thus enhance the amount of nitrogen accumulation in the maize kernel and yield chalker scott 2007 kunzová and hejcman 2009 ramakrishna et al 2006 compared to the partial plastic mulching but different amounts of mulching were not significant in terms of maize wue this result might be related to the increased biomass and respiration and diminished soil evaporation by full plastic mulching zhou et al 2018 however fully mulched maize had a higher biomass and soil water consumption thus easily leading to a soil water deﬁcit li et al 1999 in addition our results showed that straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 amount has the best effect on increasing maize yield and wue fig 7 some experiments have also found that crops would have the best growing environment soil water content heat energy nutrient status and the highest yield when straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 blanco canqui and lal 2007 chakraborty et al 2008 döring et al 2005 but the results of cai et al cai et al 2016 showed that a straw rate of 9000 kg ha was preferable for the loess plateau of china and this may be related to the climatic conditions during the crop growth period for example if the precipitation was at a high level during the growing period of crops it might not be conducive to the collection of straw mulching however straw mulching at a level that was too high over 15 t ha 1 would have negative effects such as poor light transmittance and interception of rainwater zhang et al 2015 the ridge row plastic film mulching at low temperature 19 1 c and low water input level 370 mm could significantly increase maize yield compared with flat row plastic film mulching many studies showed that the ridge row mulching has various functions which enhance the crops growing environment such as reducing unproductive evaporation zhang et al 2011 improving the temperature difference between day and night in soil gan et al 2013 harvesting rainwater zhou et al 2009 and increasing the water flow to the roots li et al 2001b in addition jiang et al jiang et al 2015 suggested that the ridge row mulching was suitable in the semi arid areas of china by restraining the formation of the dry soil layer but when the precipitation or temperature of crop growth was high in the semi arid area of southern china the function of ridge row mulching might not be obvious the functions and effects of plastic were different for different levels of transparency transparent plastic film has good light transmittance so the surface temperature rose rapidly bu et al 2013 and thus delayed the soil temperature decrease after sunset sreedevi et al 2017 however zhao et al zhao et al 2014b found that crops with transparent plastic mulching during the whole growth period easily suffered from heat stress because of the high temperature increases in midsummer those effects were particularly greater when the temperature was low in the early growing season wang et al 2018 black plastic film strongly absorbs light and thus weeds were killed by the high temperature when in contact with the film liakatas et al 1986 but there was no significant difference in potato production between transparent plastic mulching and black plastic mulching when the average temperature was 20 c in growth period ibarra jiménez et al 2011 jia et al jia et al 2017 found that transparent plastic mulching performed better at increasing soil water and temperature when the crops suffered from drought and low temperature in summary there is a need to reasonably choose the type of plastic mulch according to the cropping system climatic conditions and the degree of adaptation to the function of different transparencies of plastic mulches in crops 4 3 diﬀ erent soil fertility and fertilizer application rates affecting the mulching improvement it is very important to define the relationships between soil fertility fertilizer application rates and crop yield and the sustainability of agricultural systems responses to plastic and straw mulching in maize yield also varied with diﬀ erent soil basic fertility and fertilizer application rates our research found that mulching treatments provided higher enhancements to maize yield at relatively low or moderate fertilizer rates fig 10 some experiments showed that the effect of low nitrogen fertilizer 0 75 kg n ha 1 on wheat yield was higher than that of high nitrogen fertilizer 150 225 kg n ha 1 under plastic mulching conditions fan et al 2005 li et al 2018a qin et al 2015 tang et al tang et al 2013 also found that straw mulching improved wheat yield by increasing soil fertility on the chengdu plain of china mulching could improve the use efficiency of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium by changing water utilization promoting absorption of soil available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium by plants and thus increasing crop yields ahamefule and peter 2014 liu et al 2016 wilson and jefferies 1996 wilson et al 1995 with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer crop yields could increase significantly hu et al 2013 zand parsa et al 2006 however the irrational use of nitrogen fertilizer not only causes a huge waste of resources and economic losses but also has adverse effects on the environment thus affecting human safety godfray et al 2010 therefore rational consideration of soil fertility and fertilizer application has great advantages for the improvement of maize yield 5 conclusions our analyses based on reported studies conducted in china showed that mulching signiﬁcantly increased the yield and wue of maize compared with no mulching practices the eﬀ ects of mulching varied with diﬀ erent growing season planting regions mulching management practices soil fertility and fertilizer application rates the mean eﬀ ects of plastic mulching on the yield and wue of maize were generally greater than those of straw mulching plastic mulching performed better in the north maize region and the huanghuaihai maize region of china while straw mulching performed better in the southern hilly maize region plastic mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 59 56 and wue 29 91 with mulching in fallow period while straw mulching was the best way to increase maize yield 12 43 and wue 13 21 with mulching in the growth period full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield 42 06 and straw mulching with 10 15 t ha 1 classification amounts performed best increasing maize yield by 13 35 transparent ﬁlm and ridge row mulching were more favorable to maize growth and increased crop yield and wue in arid and low temperature areas of china in addition considering the environmental side eﬀ ects of plastic mulching and the fact that straw materials are not always available in some regions other mulching methods such as biodegradable ﬁlm mulching may be used using a combination of integrated farm managements such as non till fertilization intercropping and crop rotation crop yield and wue under mulching practices is expected to further improve in the future thus the adoption of promising mulching practices for maize production should be site speciﬁc and consider the commonly adopted ﬁeld management practices in china acknowledgements this research was supported by science

10873,identification of efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies for cotton gossypium hirsutum l can play a pivotal role in optimizing the use of available irrigation water in the southern high plains shp region which is facing severe challenges from rapidly declining groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer the objective of this study was to suggest efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies for cotton under nine different climate variability classes using the cropgro cotton module available in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm cotton growth stages considered in this study include i germination and seedling emergence gs1 ii squaring gs2 iii flower initiation early bloom gs3 iv peak bloom gs4 and v cutout late bloom and boll opening stage gs5 the amount of seasonal irrigation water applied was varied from 120 to 540 mm under eight different irrigation scheduling scenarios with four irrigation application rates of 3 6 8 and 9 mm d 1 using the subsurface drip irrigation method under each scenario six growth stage based irrigation treatments were adopted resulting in a total of 48 irrigation strategies results indicated that imposing water deficit in the initial gs1 to gs2 or final gs5 growth stages had little effect on seed cotton yield the peak bloom growth stage gs4 was found to be the most sensitive stage to water stress and imposing water deficit during this stage resulted in the lowest irrigation water use efficiency iwue and seed cotton yield under most climate variability classes application of higher than 420 mm irrigation did not significantly contribute to an increase in seed cotton yield and resulted in a decline in iwue the results from this study are useful for the shp producers to make appropriate crop growth stage based deficit irrigation management decisions for achieving higher seed cotton yield while conserving precious irrigation water resources from the ogallala aquifer keywords climate variability dssat irrigation water use efficiency iwue seed cotton yield subsurface drip irrigation 1 introduction about 40 of the world s population experience water shortages hamdy et al 2003 steduto et al 2017 and the misuse and mismanagement of available water resources pose serious threats to sustainable development kummu et al 2016 since about 70 of the world s freshwater resources are consumed for agricultural production schlosser et al 2014 fao 2016 improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue can lead to conservation of limited water resources while achieving optimum economic crop productivity abdelgadir et al 2012 himanshu et al 2013 cotton is the most important fiber crop for the textile industry and it is grown under irrigated conditions in many parts of the world out of worldwide production of about 25 8 million metric tons of cotton lint about 4 0 million metric tons were produced in the united states usa in the year 2018 dohlman et al 2019 the usa is the leading exporter of raw cotton covering about one third of the global trade macdonald 2000 a rapid growth in global population and changes in land use and climate have been affecting irrigation water availability and sustainability of cotton production the southern high plains shp region consisting of the eastern new mexico and northwestern texas is one of the major cotton producing regions of the usa mauget et al 2017 however cotton production in the shp faces a major challenge due to the region s summer climate which is water limited relative to the needs of cotton mauget et al 2013 2017 semi arid climate along with low levels of soil nitrogen and phosphorus are also leading factors affecting cotton production in the shp peng et al 1989 morrow and krieg 1990 these unfavorable conditions led to dependency of cotton production on irrigation from the underlying ogallala aquifer more than 90 of the irrigation water used in this region is pumped from the ogallala aquifer allen et al 2008 however due to increase in irrigated crop production groundwater in the ogallala aquifer was depleted by more than 50 since the starting of large scale irrigation in 1950s konikow 2015 this rapid decline of ground water levels has reduced irrigation capacities that supply irrigation for cotton production in the shp torell et al 1990 colaizzi et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 chaudhuri and ale 2014a b and increased risk of irrigation non availability during the growing season in order to prolong the usable lifetime of the ogallala aquifer groundwater conservation districts in this region have started imposing restrictions on groundwater pumping for irrigation purposes hpwd 2015 for example the high plains water district set the limit for annual allowable groundwater pumping for irrigation at 460 mm 18 in of depth declining groundwater levels and proposed restrictions on use of ground water for irrigation make it crucial to implement efficient irrigation water management practices in the shp to optimize the use of available irrigation water scheduling irrigation with appropriate deficits during crop growing season is a feasible practice that facilitates improvements in iwue kirda et al 2007 greaves and wang 2017 several field studies have been carried out in the shp region to assess the impacts of water deficit on cotton growth and yield howell et al 2004 snowden et al 2013 bordovsky et al 2015 stress due to water deficit is the most common and quantifiable problem in cotton production and it affects biomass accumulation node and boll development and crop maturity ritchie et al 2009 the size and number of bolls are affected by the amount and timing of irrigation dumka et al 2004 ritchie et al 2009 snowden et al 2013 sharma et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 many other field studies suggested that in case of limited availability of irrigation water the efficiency of its allocation can be increased by optimally allocating water among different critical growth stages snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 some of these studies reported large yield reduction when water deficit occurred during peak flowering period compared to earlier or later in the growing season butter et al 2007 snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 weather is also one of the most important factors affecting cotton growth and yield but limited attempts have been made to relate crop response to available irrigation and long term weather reddy et al 1996 1997 logan and gwathmey 2002 kothari et al 2019 cotton growth and yield is highly affected by the amount and distribution of rainfall throughout the growing season because average daily water requirement during different cotton growth stages varies within a range of 2 8 mm fisher and udeigwe 2012 on the other hand air temperature determines the duration of a crop growing season and it controls crop water requirement reddy et al 1997 assessing the impacts of growing season precipitation and average air temperature on seed cotton yield and iwue under different crop growth stage based deficit irrigation management practices could enable identification of efficient irrigation management strategies for the shp region identification of efficient irrigation strategies for productive use of irrigation water can be achieved through field experiments or use of crop growth simulation models however field experimentation is limited by the cost and time to examine a comprehensive number of potential irrigation strategies crop models are complementary to field experiments and after a thorough testing based on field data they allow a conjunctive evaluation of various crop growing environments and their long term effects on crop production geerts et al 2010 thorp et al 2014 attia et al 2016 crop models are also useful for identifying ideal irrigation management strategies in terms of timing and amount of irrigation application under different climatic conditions liu et al 2007 geerts et al 2010 greaves and wang 2017 in addition crop growth simulation models provide valuable information about different irrigation scenarios in terms of crop productivity and iwue and thus serve as decision support tools for irrigation management greaves and wang 2017 several cotton simulation models such as gossym cotco2 cotton2k ozcot csm cropgro cotton etc are available for effectively simulating cotton growth and development under different crop and irrigation management plans nair et al 2013 thorp et al 2014 attia et al 2016 these models differ in their scales of application complexity input variables and outputs among the cotton growth simulation models the cropgro cotton module within the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm has been increasingly used by researchers worldwide for various applications butter et al 2007 pathak et al 2007 ortiz et al 2009 pereira et al 2009 thorp et al 2014 modala et al 2015 adhikari et al 2016 2017 mauget et al 2017 loison et al 2017 amin et al 2018 kothari et al 2019 li et al 2019 in this study the dssat csm cropgro cotton model that was evaluated for the study site in a prior study adhikari et al 2016 was used to address three main objectives i assess the sensitivity of cotton crop to water stress during different growth stages and identify critical growth stages for irrigation application ii suggest efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies for cotton under limited irrigation water availability and iii assess the impact of climate variability on suggested efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area experimental site the shp region consists of 43 counties in northwest texas and 5 counties in eastern new mexico fig 1 this semi arid windy and flat region is one of the most intensively irrigated agricultural areas in the usa very dry conditions prevail in the shp during the winter from october to april and peak rainfall is generally received in the months of may and september allen et al 2008 cotton winter wheat triticum aestivum l corn zea mays l and sorghum sorghum bicolor l are the major crops grown in this region common soil types found in the shp region are sandy loams and clay loams the ogallala aquifer which underlies all shp counties is a major source of irrigation water for this region center pivot irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method in this region however subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems are gaining popularity in this region due to multiple advantages such as higher

operation within the high plains water district and they irrigate about 739 682 and 181 472 hectares respectively hpwd 2018 this study is focused on suggesting efficient crop growth stage based irrigation strategies for cotton fields irrigated with sdi systems measured data used for building dssat projects for this study and for evaluating the dssat cropgro cotton model in a prior study

growing seasons bordovsky et al 2015 the mean 1977 2018 annual and growing season may october rainfall at the study site was 463 mm and 344 mm respectively the months of march april and may are the windiest and the months from october to february are generally dry at halfway adhikari et al 2016 additional details about planting and harvesting dates tillage management fertilizers applied and irrigation management followed in these experiments can be found in bordovsky et al 2015 2 2 weather data classification daily weather data of precipitation mm minimum and maximum air temperature c wind speed m s 1 solar radiation mj m 2 and relative humidity for this study were obtained from weather measurements at the texas a m agrilife research center halfway tx for the period from 1977 to 2018 a summary of annual and growing season may october rainfall and average of daily high and low growing season air temperature is presented in fig 2 based on the growing season precipitation and average air temperature simulation period from 1977 to 2018 was divided into nine climate variability classes table 1 for climate variability impact assessment the years with growing season precipitation below 277 mm 33rd percentile were considered as dry years and those years with precipitation above 366 mm 66th percentile were considered as wet years similarly the years with average growing season temperature below 21 2 c 33rd percentile and above 21 8 c 66th percentile were classified as cold and warm years respectively table 1 the years that did not fall under any of the above classified categories were considered as normal years the thresholds chosen for classification of years in this study were the same as those used in kothari et al 2019 similar criteria of percentiles were also adopted by other researchers to classify climatic variables for example auer and böhm 1994 used the 40th and 60th percentile criteria whereas chmielewski and potts 1995 used the 25th and 75th percentile criteria for classification of simulation years into different climate variability classes 2 3 the crop simulation model used the csm cropgro cotton module distributed with the dssat model was used to assess the response of cotton crop to water stress at different growth stages under different climate variability classes dssat 4 7 version was used in this study the csm cropgro cotton model predicts cotton growth and yield soil water and carbon and nitrogen processes over time based on weather soil cultivar and crop management information jones et al 2003 thorp et al 2014 hoogenboom et al 2015 the model can expand the information gathered from field experiments by simulating crop responses under extensive experimental conditions the model requires soil parameters and crop management environment and cultivar related information as inputs required crop management parameters include tillage type tillage depth and dates cultivar characteristics planting date and method seeding depth plant population row spacing fertilizer application method fertilizer amount and application dates method of irrigation irrigation dates and amounts and harvesting method and date the required soil parameters include soil texture color slope albedo bulk density drainage hydraulic conductivity saturated water content drained upper limit drained lower limit organic carbon content and total soil nitrogen environmental variables such as daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and incoming solar radiation are also required inputs while wind speed and dew point temperature are optional inputs 2 4 model evaluation the csm cropgro cotton model was evaluated for the study site halfway tx in a prior study adhikari et al 2016 using the observed data from cotton iwue experiment over a period of four years from 2010 to 2013 the field experiment consisted of 27 irrigation treatments bordovsky et al 2015 and observed data from four high irrigation treatments a total of 16 treatment years were used for model calibration while observed data from the remaining 23 medium and low irrigation treatments a total of 92 treatment years were used for model evaluation a good agreement between the measured and simulated seed cotton yields and dates of onset of various cotton phenological stages were achieved during model calibration and evaluation as indicated by good model performance statistics adhikari et al 2016 the coefficient of determination average percent error and index of agreement were 0 94 0 1 and 0 90 during calibration and 0 94 6 5 and 0 83 during evaluation respectively for seed cotton yield prediction adhikari et al 2016 the evaluated model did an excellent job in responding well to various irrigation strategies implemented in 27 treatments over 4 growing seasons with varying amounts and distribution patterns of precipitation more details about the model evaluation can be found in adhikari et al 2016 2 5 simulation of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies long term simulations were run using weather data for the period from 1977 to 2018 to assess the impacts of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield and iwue based on the planting dates adopted in the field experiment at halfway during 2010 2013 growing seasons bordovsky et al 2015 planting date was assumed as may 11 for each year in the simulation period five critical cotton growth stages were considered for irrigation based on the recommendations made by various researchers oosterhuis 1990 ritchie et al 2007 perry and barnes 2012 table 2 the total amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season under eight different irrigation scenarios simulated in this study varied from 120 to 540 mm with four different irrigation application rates of 3 6 8 and 9 mm d 1 as shown in table 3 in general water use pattern of cotton varies widely between planting and harvesting and the daily water use ranges from 2 5 mm during the emergence to as high as 14 mm during the peak bloom period under extreme water stress boman and warren 2014 therefore depending on the water requirement low moderate high during the selected growth stages table 2 the total number of irrigation days table 3 were split proportionately among five growth stages and irrigation was then applied within the days after planting dap specified for each growth stage in table 2 for example the highest number of irrigation days were scheduled during the peak bloom stage because plants require the highest amount of water during this stage and water stress during this period could have a pronounced negative effect on cotton yield on rainy days when rainfall amount 1 mm irrigation was eliminated but the number of irrigation days specified for each growth stage were maintained the same by extending irrigation period each year s simulation was carried out independent of the previous years and soil initial conditions were reinitialized prior to planting this was done to evaluate the sensitivity of treatments to precipitation and temperature variability independently of any residual effects the treatments might have tovihoudji et al 2019 under each irrigation scenario six crop growth stage based irrigation strategies referred to as treatments were adopted table 4 among these six irrigation treatments irrigation was skipped in each of the identified five critical crop growth stages in five treatments and irrigation was applied in all growth stages in the sixth treatment as shown in table 4 however the same amount of irrigation water was applied for treatments t1 through t6 in each scenario and irrigation regimes were established in such a way that more irrigation water was applied during those growth stages in which water requirement was higher table 2 suggestions on efficient irrigation strategies for cotton production in the shp under different climate variability classes were finally made based on the simulated average seed cotton yield and iwue while keeping in view the hpwd annual groundwater pumping limits for irrigation 460 mm initially the irrigation treatment e g t1 that simulated the highest average seed cotton yield was identified for each irrigation scenario e g s6 under each climate variability class e g dry normal and that irrigation scenario irrigation treatment combination s6 t1 was designated as an efficient irrigation strategy for that irrigation scenario s6 in this example under that climate variability class dry normal in this example ideal irrigation strategy for each climate variability class was then identified using a criterion an irrigation strategy was considered as ideal for a climate variability class if the increase in average seed cotton yield from that irrigation strategy to the next higher irrigation water use strategy in that climate variability class was less than 5 for example if the percent increase in average seed cotton yield from an irrigation strategy s6 t1 to s7 t1 under dry normal class was less than 5 then s6 t1 was considered as an ideal irrigation strategy for a dry normal climate in this study the iwue kg m 3 was estimated using the following equation 1 i w u e y i e l d irr y i e l d dry i r r i g a t i o n where yieldirr irrigated seed cotton yield kg ha 1 yielddry dryland seed cotton yield kg ha 1 irrigation total amount of irrigation water applied seasonal plus preplant irrigation m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield and iwue simulated seed cotton yield and iwue under different crop growth stage based irrigation strategies are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively a substantial difference in simulated seed cotton yield and iwue was found under different irrigation strategies due to varying responses of cotton to water stress during different crop growth stages figs 3 and 4 water stress during certain critical cotton growth stages caused severe effect on physiological processes with consequent loss in yield and iwue snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 the reduction in seed cotton yield was not significant when water deficit was imposed in the initial gs1 to gs2 or final gs5 growth stages early season irrigation water applications during germination and seedling emergence stages can be lost via evaporation or result in undesirable excessive plant growth and diseases and hence they did not contribute towards increasing iwue and or cotton yield reduction in early season irrigation potentially increased cotton root growth and thereby enhanced water uptake and resilience to water shortage during the reproductive stage and resulted in an increase in iwue and seed cotton yield thorp et al 2017 similarly elimination of irrigation during the cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stage gs5 has also caused less effect on seed cotton yield and iwue the peak bloom growth stage gs4 was found to be the most sensitive stage for imposing water deficits resulted in the lowest seed cotton yield fig 3 and iwue fig 4 the growth and development of most of the reproductive structures occur during the peak bloom stage and hence plants require more water during this stage ritchie et al 2007 perry and barnes 2012 water stress during peak bloom stage in general increases shedding dropping of flower buds reduces boll retention and flowering rate the results of the simulations are consistent with several other studies which reported that water deficit imposed during peak bloom stage has significantly affected physiological processes and caused severe damage to crop development and thereby reduction in yield simao et al 2013 snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 however skipping irrigation during the peak bloom stage in case of high irrigation water scenarios s6 s7 and s8 had less effect on seed cotton yield fig 3 and iwue fig 4 possibly due to residual soil moisture from irrigation in the preceding growth stages as the amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season increased simulated seed cotton yield increased gradually until the irrigation amount reached 420 mm scenario 6 with additional irrigation resulting in stable or minor yield increases fig 3 in contrast as the amount of applied irrigation water increased simulated iwue increased until 300 mm irrigation had been applied scenario 4 and then decreased for the remaining irrigation scenarios fig 4 applying higher than 420 mm irrigation water during the growing season scenarios s7 and s8 did not improve seed cotton yield much when compared to s6 scenario and resulted in a decline in iwue these results reinforce the findings of other studies snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 and indicate that the producers in the shp could potentially achieve higher seed cotton yields without exceeding the hpwd s annual pumping limit of 460 mm by adopting appropriate crop growth stage based irrigation strategies within an irrigation scenario the trend in simulated iwue under different irrigation treatments was the same as that of simulated seed cotton yield because same amount of irrigation water was applied for all treatments fig 4 interestingly as the amount of applied irrigation water during the growing season increased variability in simulated seed cotton yield and hence iwue decreased figs 3 and 4 this was assumed to be caused by reduced water stress with the increase in seasonal applied irrigation water in order to better understand the impact of climate variability on seed cotton yield and iwue under crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies simulated results were further analyzed among nine different climate variability classes defined earlier 3 2 impacts of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield under different climate variability classes simulated average 1977 2018 seed cotton yield varied substantially under different climate variability classes fig 5 similar to the trends noticed in case of the entire simulation period fig 3 the peak bloom growth stage gs4 was found to be the most sensitive growth stage for water stress whereas growth stages gs1 gs2 and gs5 were found to be least sensitive stages to water stress under most climate variability classes fig 5 in addition under all climate variability classes as the amount of applied irrigation water during the growing season increased simulated seed cotton yield increased until a certain amounts e g until 360 mm scenario s5 in wet warm years fig 5g and then became almost stable fig 5 however the impact of crop growth stage based irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield was found to be minimal in case of higher irrigation water scenarios especially in wet years when moderate to high irrigation water was applied irrigation treatment t1 was found to be the best irrigation strategy for maximizing seed cotton yield under different climate variability classes except in dry cold and wet normal climatic conditions under which irrigation treatments t2 and t5 respectively were found to be the best irrigation treatments cooler temperatures resulted in fewer heat units and less time for crop development and hence there was either reduction in yield or no yield gain from late season irrigation irrigation treatment t4 resulted in comparatively lower yields in any irrigation scenario under all climate variability classes as expected simulated seed cotton yield was consistently higher under wet weather conditions than dry and normal weather conditions in case of low to moderate irrigation scenarios s1 through s5 however in case of high irrigation scenarios s6 through s8 simulated seed cotton yield did not vary much among dry normal and wet years fig 5 also maximum seed cotton yield was achieved with lesser amounts of irrigation water in wet years when compared to dry and normal years simulated seed cotton yield was found to be higher in warm weather than that under cold weather conditions especially in case of high irrigation scenarios s6 s7 and s8 simulated seed cotton yield was much less under wet normal fig 5h and wet cold fig 5i conditions than under wet warm fig 5g conditions among all irrigation scheduling scenarios the highest seed cotton yield was simulated under wet warm climatic conditions among all climate variability classes figs 5 these results are consistent with the findings of other researchers who reported that warm and humid climate is favorable for cotton production and hence most of the cotton farming is limited to warm and humid climatic conditions prevalent in countries such as china india usa pakistan brazil uzbekistan reddy et al 1996 1997 logan and gwathmey 2002 3 3 impacts of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on iwue under different climate variability classes simulated average 1978 2018 iwues for different crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes are shown in fig 6 like seed cotton yield a substantial difference in simulated iwue was found among different irrigation strategies and climate variability classes due to varying responses of cotton to water availability during different stages of crop growth snowden et al 2014 zonta et al 2017 once again simulated iwue was found to be the lowest in all irrigation treatments when irrigation was eliminated during the peak bloom growth stage gs4 conversely elimination of irrigation during the early and late season growth stages gs1 gs2 and gs5 did not greatly reduce iwue among the treatments fig 6 as the amount of applied irrigation water increased the differences in simulated iwue among different irrigation treatments within an irrigation scenario decreased substantially under all climate variability classes fig 6 for example in wet warm years substantial differences in simulated iwue were found among different treatments t1 through t6 under scenario s1 these differences decreased as the applied irrigation water increased from s1 to s8 and finally resulted in the minimum negligible difference in iwue among treatments under scenario s8 fig 6g like seed cotton yield in general irrigation treatments t1 and t4 were found to be the most and least efficient strategies respectively for maximizing iwue however under some climate variability classes in case of irrigation greater than 360 mm scenario s5 treatments t2 in dry cold years and t5 in wet normal years were found to be more efficient strategies for maximizing iwue as the applied seasonal irrigation water amount increased simulated iwue increased until a certain irrigation amount e g until 420 mm scenario s6 in dry warm years fig 6a and then decreased for the higher irrigation scenarios except in wet weather conditions fig 6 decline in simulated iwue with increasing irrigation was more rapid in wet years as compared to normal and dry years in case of wet years simulated iwue was the highest under s1 scenario 120 mm seasonal irrigation and then it decreased continuously with increase in the amount of applied irrigation water seasonal rainfall received during the wet years was very high 649 2 mm 450 8 mm and 443 4 mm in wet warm wet normal and wet cold climatic conditions respectively table 1 and this has resulted in a very high iwue under s1 scenario in spite of applying lower amounts of irrigation water these results are also supported by earlier findings that warm and humid climate is favorable for cotton production reddy et al 1996 1997 logan and gwathmey 2002 in case of low irrigation water scenarios s1 s2 and s3 simulated iwue was consistently lower in dry and normal years as compared to wet years fig 6 in contrast under moderate irrigation water scenarios s4 and s5 simulated iwue was higher in normal years as compared to dry and wet years in case of high irrigation scenarios s6 s7 and s8 simulated iwue in normal years was comparable to that in dry years but it was lower in wet years fig 6 overall applying moderate amounts of irrigation water scenarios s4 and s5 could potentially increase iwue while maintaining higher seed cotton yields as compared to applying lower scenarios s1 s2 and s3 and higher scenarios s6 s7 and s8 amounts of irrigation water however the effects of irrigation regimes deficits on iwue and seed cotton yield vary with weather conditions soil and crop management practices and hence suggestions from this study should be used only as a general guidance 3 4 efficient crop growth stage based irrigation strategies under different levels of irrigation water availability one of the goals of this simulation study was to answer a hypothetical question if annual irrigation depths are limited by policy to 120 180 240 360 or 420 mm at what cotton growth stage s should water be applied in order to maximize seed cotton yield iwue and how does that compare to more limited field studies in case of limited availability of irrigation water it is important to enhance irrigation efficiency by optimally allocating water among different growth stages snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 it could be inferred from the discussion in preceding sections and from previous studies that for a given level of annual irrigation some crop growth stage based irrigation strategies are better than others in addition as discussed earlier higher seasonal irrigation amounts 420 mm have not contributed to substantial increases in seed cotton yield and have decreased iwue for each of the simulated scenarios with 420 mm or less seasonal irrigation water s1 to s6 identified efficient irrigation strategies along with growth stage wise distribution of irrigation water that maximized seed cotton yield and iwue under different climate variability classes are presented in fig 7 irrigation treatment t1 was found to be the best irrigation treatment for maximizing seed cotton yield iwue under most of the irrigation scenarios followed by t3 t2 and t5 treatments fig 7 irrigation treatment t4 was found to be the worst in any irrigation scenario under any climate variability class therefore it is recommended to ensure irrigation application at the peak bloom growth stage of cotton gs4 even if there is a limited availability of irrigation water results from this study reinforce some of the outcomes from earlier studies butter et al 2007 snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 and these recommendations should be used with caution as producers in the shp apply pre plant and or at plant irrigations in some years to establish a good plant stand bordovsky et al 2015 which were not considered in these simulations 3 5 suggested ideal irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes ideal cotton irrigation strategies identified for different climate variability classes based on the criterion adopted in this study an irrigation strategy was considered as ideal if the increase in average seed cotton yield from that irrigation strategy to the next higher irrigation water use strategy was less than 5 are presented in fig 8 seasonal irrigation water application under the suggested efficient irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes was less than the annual groundwater pumping limit of 460 mm 18 in specified by the hpwd except in dry warm years fig 8 indicating that irrigating cotton according to these suggested crop growth stage based irrigation strategies enables producers to be compliant with the hpwd regulations in case of dry warm years it may not be possible to achieve the potential highest seed cotton yield without exceeding the hpwd s annual pumping limit however the hpwd allows producers to establish a conservation reserve and hence producers can save irrigation water in wet cold years and use it in subsequent dry warm years and thereby manage to comply with the hpwd pumping limits with careful irrigation planning adoption of suggested crop growth stage based irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes based on forecasted weather could potentially save considerable amount of irrigation water however depending on the changes in actual weather as the growing season progresses switching from one strategy to another strategy may be necessary 4 conclusion the dssat csm cropgro cotton model was used to assess the effects of crop growth stage based irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield and iwue under different climate variability classes and suggest efficient irrigation strategies for the shp region the results from this study indicated that the amount and distribution of irrigation water among different cotton growth stages had substantial effect on the seed cotton yield and iwue while elimination of irrigation during peak bloom stage gs4 resulted in the lowest seed cotton yield and iwue irrigation elimination during the initial gs1 to gs2 or final gs5 growth stages caused minimum effect on seed cotton yield and iwue in most of the climate variability classes wet warm climatic conditions were found to be most favorable among all climate variability classes for cotton growth and resulted in maximum seed cotton yield and iwue overall application of moderate amounts of irrigation water 300 to 360 mm in wet years and moderate to high amounts of irrigation water 360 to 420 mm in dry and normal years through appropriate crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies could enable achieving higher iwues while maintaining higher seed cotton yields application of more than 420 mm of irrigation water scenarios s7 and s8 during the growing season resulted in a decline in iwue and provided minimal if any increases in seed cotton yield suggestions were finally made on efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes and different levels of irrigation water availability the results from the present study are useful for shp producers to optimize the application of limited available irrigation water in achieving higher seed cotton yields without exceeding the hpwd s annual pumping limits future efforts will focus on considering larger number of irrigation

the southern high plains shp region which is facing severe challenges from rapidly declining groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer the objective of this study was to suggest efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies for cotton under nine different climate variability classes using the cropgro cotton module available in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm cotton growth stages considered in this study include i germination and seedling emergence gs1 ii squaring gs2 iii flower initiation early bloom gs3 iv peak bloom gs4 and v cutout late bloom and boll opening stage gs5 the amount of seasonal irrigation water applied was varied from 120 to 540 mm under eight different irrigation scheduling scenarios with four irrigation application rates of 3 6 8 and 9 mm d 1 using the subsurface drip irrigation method under each scenario six growth stage based irrigation treatments were adopted resulting in a total of 48 irrigation strategies results indicated that imposing water deficit in the initial gs1 to gs2 or final gs5 growth stages had little effect on seed cotton yield the peak bloom growth stage gs4 was found to be the most sensitive stage to water stress and imposing water deficit during this stage resulted in the lowest irrigation water use efficiency iwue and seed cotton yield under most climate variability classes application of higher than 420 mm irrigation did not significantly contribute to an increase in seed cotton yield and resulted in a decline in iwue the

can lead to conservation of limited water resources while achieving optimum economic crop productivity abdelgadir et al 2012 himanshu et al 2013 cotton is the most important fiber crop for the textile industry and it is grown under irrigated conditions in many parts of the world out of worldwide production of about 25 8 million metric tons of cotton lint about 4 0 million metric tons were produced in the united states usa in the year 2018 dohlman et al 2019 the usa is the leading exporter of raw cotton covering about one third of the global trade macdonald 2000 a rapid growth in global population and changes in land use and climate have been affecting irrigation water availability and sustainability of cotton production the southern high plains shp region consisting of the eastern new mexico and northwestern texas is one of the major cotton producing regions of the usa mauget et al 2017 however cotton production in the shp faces a major challenge due to the region s summer climate which is water limited relative to the needs of cotton mauget et al 2013 2017 semi arid climate along with low levels of soil nitrogen and phosphorus are also leading factors affecting cotton production in the shp peng et al 1989 morrow and krieg 1990 these unfavorable conditions led to dependency of cotton production on irrigation from the underlying ogallala aquifer more than 90 of the irrigation water used in this region is pumped from the ogallala aquifer allen et al 2008 however due to increase in irrigated crop production groundwater in the ogallala aquifer was depleted by more than 50 since the starting of large scale irrigation in 1950s konikow 2015 this rapid decline of ground water levels has reduced irrigation capacities that supply irrigation for cotton production in the shp torell et al 1990 colaizzi et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 chaudhuri and ale 2014a b and increased risk of irrigation non availability during the growing season in order to prolong the usable lifetime of the ogallala aquifer groundwater conservation districts in this region have started imposing restrictions on groundwater pumping for irrigation purposes hpwd 2015 for example the high plains water district set the limit for annual allowable groundwater pumping for irrigation at 460 mm 18 in of depth declining groundwater levels and proposed restrictions on use of ground water for irrigation make it crucial to implement efficient irrigation water management practices in the shp to optimize the use of available irrigation water scheduling irrigation with appropriate deficits during crop growing season is a feasible practice that facilitates improvements in iwue kirda et al 2007 greaves and wang 2017 several field studies have been carried out in the shp region to assess the impacts of water deficit on cotton growth and yield howell et al 2004 snowden et al 2013 bordovsky et al 2015 stress due to water deficit is the most common and quantifiable problem in cotton production and it affects biomass accumulation node and boll development and crop maturity ritchie et al 2009 the size and number of bolls are affected by the amount and timing of irrigation dumka et al 2004 ritchie et al 2009 snowden et al 2013 sharma et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 many other field studies suggested that in case of limited availability of irrigation water the efficiency of its allocation can be increased by optimally allocating water among different critical growth stages snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 some of these studies reported large yield reduction when water deficit occurred during peak flowering period compared to earlier or later in the growing season butter et al 2007 snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 weather is also one of the most important factors affecting cotton growth and yield but limited attempts have been made to relate crop response to available irrigation and long term weather reddy et al 1996 1997 logan and gwathmey 2002 kothari et al 2019 cotton growth and yield is highly affected by the amount and distribution of rainfall throughout the growing season because average daily water requirement during different cotton growth stages varies within a range of 2 8 mm fisher and udeigwe 2012 on the other hand air temperature determines the duration of a crop growing season and it controls crop water requirement reddy et al 1997 assessing the impacts of growing season precipitation and average air temperature on seed cotton yield and iwue under different crop growth stage based deficit irrigation management practices could enable identification of efficient irrigation management strategies for the shp region identification of efficient irrigation strategies for productive use of irrigation water can be achieved through field experiments or use of crop growth simulation models however field experimentation is limited by the cost and time to examine a comprehensive number of potential irrigation strategies crop models are complementary to field experiments and after a thorough testing based on field data they allow a conjunctive evaluation of various crop growing environments and their long term effects on crop production geerts et al 2010 thorp et al 2014 attia et al 2016 crop models are also useful for identifying ideal irrigation management strategies in terms of timing and amount of irrigation application under different climatic conditions liu et al 2007 geerts et al 2010 greaves and wang 2017 in addition crop growth simulation models provide valuable information about different irrigation scenarios in terms of crop productivity and iwue and thus serve as decision support tools for irrigation management greaves and wang 2017 several cotton simulation models such as gossym cotco2 cotton2k ozcot csm cropgro cotton etc are available for effectively simulating cotton growth and development under

three main objectives i assess the sensitivity of cotton crop to water stress during different growth stages and identify critical growth stages for irrigation application ii suggest efficient crop

irrigation strategies for cotton fields irrigated with sdi systems measured data used for building dssat projects for this study and for evaluating the dssat cropgro cotton model in a prior study

growing seasons bordovsky et al 2015 the mean 1977 2018 annual and growing season may october rainfall at the study site was 463 mm and 344 mm respectively the months of march april and may are the windiest and the months from october to february are generally dry at halfway adhikari et al 2016 additional details about planting and harvesting dates tillage management fertilizers applied and irrigation management followed in these experiments can be found in bordovsky et al 2015 2 2 weather data classification daily weather data of precipitation mm minimum and maximum air temperature c

2018 a summary of annual and growing season may october rainfall and average of daily high and low growing season air temperature is presented in fig 2 based on the growing season precipitation and average air temperature simulation period from 1977 to 2018 was divided into nine climate variability classes table 1 for climate variability impact assessment the years with growing season precipitation below 277 mm 33rd percentile were considered as dry years and those years with precipitation above 366 mm 66th percentile were considered as wet years similarly the years with average growing season temperature below 21 2 c 33rd percentile and above 21 8 c 66th percentile were classified as cold and warm years respectively table 1 the years that did not fall under any of the above classified categories were considered as normal years the thresholds chosen for classification of years in this study were the same as those used in kothari et al 2019 similar criteria of percentiles were also adopted by other researchers to classify climatic variables for example auer and böhm 1994 used the 40th and 60th percentile criteria whereas chmielewski and potts 1995 used the 25th and 75th percentile criteria for classification of simulation years into different climate variability classes 2 3 the crop simulation model used the csm cropgro cotton module distributed with the dssat model was used to assess the response of cotton crop to water stress at different growth stages under different climate variability classes dssat 4 7 version was used in this study the csm cropgro cotton model predicts cotton growth and yield soil water and carbon and nitrogen processes over time based on weather soil cultivar and crop management information jones et al 2003 thorp et al 2014 hoogenboom et al 2015 the model can expand the information gathered from field experiments by simulating crop responses under extensive experimental conditions the model requires soil parameters and crop management environment and cultivar related information as inputs required crop management parameters include tillage type tillage depth and dates cultivar characteristics planting date and method seeding depth plant population row spacing fertilizer application method fertilizer amount and application dates method of irrigation irrigation dates and amounts and harvesting method and date the required soil parameters include soil texture color slope albedo bulk density drainage hydraulic conductivity saturated water content drained upper limit drained lower limit organic carbon content and total soil nitrogen environmental variables such as daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and incoming solar radiation are also required inputs while wind speed and dew point temperature are optional inputs 2 4 model evaluation the csm cropgro cotton model was evaluated for the study site halfway tx in a prior study adhikari et al 2016 using the observed data from cotton iwue experiment over a period of four years from 2010 to 2013 the field experiment consisted of 27 irrigation treatments bordovsky et al 2015 and observed data from four high irrigation treatments a total of 16 treatment years were used for model calibration while observed data from the remaining 23 medium and low irrigation treatments a total of 92 treatment years were used for model evaluation a good agreement between the measured and simulated seed cotton yields and dates of onset of various cotton phenological stages were achieved during model calibration and evaluation as indicated by good model performance statistics adhikari et al 2016 the coefficient of determination average percent error and index of agreement were 0 94 0 1 and 0 90 during calibration and 0 94 6 5 and 0 83 during evaluation respectively for seed cotton yield prediction adhikari et al 2016 the evaluated model did an excellent job in responding well to various irrigation strategies implemented in 27 treatments over 4 growing seasons with varying amounts and distribution patterns of precipitation more details about the model evaluation can be found in adhikari et al 2016 2 5 simulation of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies long term simulations were run using weather data for the period from 1977 to 2018 to assess the impacts of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield and iwue based on the planting dates adopted in the field experiment at halfway during 2010 2013 growing seasons bordovsky et al 2015 planting date was assumed as may 11 for each year in the simulation period five critical cotton growth stages were considered for irrigation based on the recommendations made by various researchers oosterhuis 1990 ritchie et al 2007 perry and barnes 2012 table 2 the total amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season under eight different irrigation scenarios simulated in this study varied from 120 to 540 mm with four different irrigation application rates of 3 6 8 and 9 mm d 1 as shown in table 3 in general water use pattern of cotton varies widely between planting and harvesting and the daily water use ranges from 2 5 mm during the emergence to as high as 14 mm during the peak bloom period under extreme water stress boman and warren 2014 therefore depending on the water requirement low moderate high during the selected growth stages table 2 the total number of irrigation days table 3 were split proportionately among five growth stages and irrigation was then applied within the days after planting dap specified for each growth stage in table 2 for example the highest number of irrigation days were scheduled during the peak bloom stage because plants require the highest amount of water during this stage and water stress during this period could have a pronounced negative effect on cotton yield on rainy days when rainfall amount 1 mm irrigation was eliminated but the number of irrigation days specified for each growth stage were maintained the same by extending irrigation period each year s simulation was carried out independent of the previous years and soil initial conditions were reinitialized prior to planting this was done to evaluate the sensitivity of treatments to precipitation and temperature variability independently of any residual effects the treatments might have tovihoudji et al 2019 under each irrigation scenario six crop growth stage based irrigation strategies referred to as treatments were adopted table 4 among these six irrigation treatments irrigation was skipped in each of the identified five critical crop growth stages in five treatments and irrigation was applied in all growth stages in the sixth treatment as shown in table 4 however the same amount of irrigation water was applied for treatments t1 through t6 in each scenario and irrigation regimes were established in such a way that more irrigation water was applied during those growth stages in which water requirement was higher table 2 suggestions on efficient irrigation strategies for cotton production in the shp under different climate variability classes were finally made based on the simulated average seed cotton yield and iwue while keeping in view the hpwd annual groundwater pumping limits for irrigation 460 mm initially the irrigation treatment e g t1 that simulated the highest average seed cotton yield was identified for each irrigation scenario e g s6 under each climate variability class e g dry normal and that irrigation scenario irrigation treatment combination s6 t1 was designated as an efficient irrigation strategy for that irrigation scenario s6 in this example under that climate variability class dry normal in this example ideal irrigation strategy for each climate variability class was then identified using a criterion an irrigation strategy was considered as ideal for a climate variability class if the increase in average seed cotton yield from that irrigation strategy to the next higher irrigation water use strategy in that climate variability class was less than 5 for example if the percent increase in average seed cotton yield from an irrigation strategy s6 t1 to s7 t1 under dry normal class was less than 5 then s6 t1 was considered as an ideal irrigation strategy for a dry normal climate in this study the iwue kg m 3 was estimated using the following equation 1 i w u e y i e l d irr y i e l d dry i r r i g a t i o n where yieldirr irrigated seed cotton yield kg ha 1 yielddry dryland seed cotton yield kg ha 1 irrigation total amount of irrigation water applied seasonal plus preplant irrigation m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield and iwue simulated seed cotton yield and iwue under different crop growth stage based irrigation strategies are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively a substantial difference in simulated seed cotton yield and iwue was found under different irrigation strategies due to varying responses of cotton to water stress during different crop growth stages figs 3 and 4 water stress during certain critical cotton growth stages caused severe effect on physiological processes with consequent loss in yield and iwue snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 the reduction in seed cotton yield was not significant when water deficit was imposed in the initial gs1 to gs2 or final gs5 growth stages early season irrigation water applications during germination and seedling emergence stages can be lost via evaporation or result in undesirable excessive plant growth and diseases and hence they did not contribute towards increasing iwue and or cotton yield reduction in early season irrigation potentially increased cotton root growth and thereby enhanced water uptake and resilience to water shortage during the reproductive stage and resulted in an increase in iwue and seed cotton yield thorp et al 2017 similarly elimination of irrigation during the cutout late bloom and boll opening growth stage gs5 has also caused less effect on seed cotton yield and iwue the peak bloom growth stage gs4 was found to be the most sensitive stage for imposing water deficits resulted in the lowest seed cotton yield fig 3 and iwue fig 4 the growth and development of most of the reproductive structures occur during the peak bloom stage and hence plants require more water during this stage ritchie et al 2007 perry and barnes 2012 water stress during peak bloom stage in general increases shedding dropping of flower buds reduces boll retention and flowering rate the results of the simulations are consistent with several other studies which reported that water deficit imposed during peak bloom stage has significantly affected physiological processes and caused severe damage to crop development and thereby reduction in yield simao et al 2013 snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 however skipping irrigation during the peak bloom stage in case of high irrigation water scenarios s6 s7 and s8 had less effect on seed cotton yield fig 3 and iwue fig 4 possibly due to residual soil moisture from irrigation in the preceding growth stages as the amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season increased simulated seed cotton yield increased gradually until the irrigation amount reached 420 mm scenario 6 with additional irrigation resulting in stable or minor yield increases fig 3 in contrast as the amount of applied irrigation water increased simulated iwue increased until 300 mm irrigation had been applied scenario 4 and then decreased for the remaining irrigation scenarios fig 4 applying higher than 420 mm irrigation water during the growing season scenarios s7 and s8 did not improve seed cotton yield much when compared to s6 scenario and resulted in a decline in iwue these results reinforce the findings of other studies snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 and indicate that the producers in the shp could potentially achieve higher seed cotton yields without exceeding the hpwd s annual pumping limit of 460 mm by adopting appropriate crop growth stage based irrigation strategies within an irrigation scenario the trend in simulated iwue under different irrigation treatments was the same as that of simulated seed cotton yield because same amount of irrigation water was applied for all treatments fig 4 interestingly as the amount of applied irrigation water during the growing season increased variability in simulated seed cotton yield and hence iwue decreased figs 3 and 4 this was assumed to be caused by reduced water stress with the increase in seasonal applied irrigation water in order to better understand the impact of climate variability on seed cotton yield and iwue under crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies simulated results were further analyzed among nine different climate variability classes defined earlier 3 2 impacts of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield under different climate variability classes simulated average 1977 2018 seed cotton yield varied substantially under different climate variability classes fig 5 similar to the trends noticed in case of the entire simulation period fig 3 the peak bloom growth stage gs4 was found to be the most sensitive growth stage for water stress whereas growth stages gs1 gs2 and gs5 were found to be least sensitive stages to water stress under most climate variability classes fig 5 in addition under all climate variability classes as the amount of applied irrigation water during the growing season increased simulated seed cotton yield increased until a certain amounts e g until 360 mm scenario s5 in wet warm years fig 5g and then became almost stable fig 5 however the impact of crop growth stage based irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield was found to be minimal in case of higher irrigation water scenarios especially in wet years when moderate to high irrigation water was applied irrigation treatment t1 was found to be the best irrigation strategy for maximizing seed cotton yield under different climate variability classes except in dry cold and wet normal climatic conditions under which irrigation treatments t2 and t5 respectively were found to be the best irrigation treatments cooler temperatures resulted in fewer heat units and less time for crop development and hence there was either reduction in yield or no yield gain from late season irrigation irrigation treatment t4 resulted in comparatively lower yields in any irrigation scenario under all climate variability classes as expected simulated seed cotton yield was consistently higher under wet weather conditions than dry and normal weather conditions in case of low to moderate irrigation scenarios s1 through s5 however in case of high irrigation scenarios s6 through s8 simulated seed cotton yield did not vary much among dry normal and wet years fig 5 also maximum seed cotton yield was achieved with lesser amounts of irrigation water in wet years when compared to dry and normal years simulated seed cotton yield was found to be higher in warm weather than that under cold weather conditions especially in case of high irrigation scenarios s6 s7 and s8 simulated seed cotton yield was much less under wet normal fig 5h and wet cold fig 5i conditions than under wet warm fig 5g conditions among all irrigation scheduling scenarios the highest seed cotton yield was simulated under wet warm climatic conditions among all climate variability classes figs 5 these results are consistent with the findings of other researchers who reported that warm and humid climate is favorable for cotton production and hence most of the cotton farming is limited to warm and humid climatic conditions prevalent in countries such as china india usa pakistan brazil uzbekistan reddy et al 1996 1997 logan and gwathmey 2002 3 3 impacts of crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies on iwue under different climate variability classes simulated average 1978 2018 iwues for different crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes are shown in fig 6 like seed cotton yield a substantial difference in simulated iwue was found among different irrigation strategies and climate variability classes due to varying responses of cotton to water availability during different stages of crop growth snowden et al 2014 zonta et al 2017 once again simulated iwue was found to be the lowest in all irrigation treatments when irrigation was eliminated during the peak bloom growth stage gs4 conversely elimination of irrigation during the early and late season growth stages gs1 gs2 and gs5 did not greatly reduce iwue among the treatments fig 6 as the amount of applied irrigation water increased the differences in simulated iwue among different irrigation treatments within an irrigation scenario decreased substantially under all climate variability classes fig 6 for example in wet warm years substantial differences in simulated iwue were found among different treatments t1 through t6 under scenario s1 these differences decreased as the applied irrigation water increased from s1 to s8 and finally resulted in the minimum negligible difference in iwue among treatments under scenario s8 fig 6g like seed cotton yield in general irrigation treatments t1 and t4 were found to be the most and least efficient strategies respectively for maximizing iwue however under some climate variability classes in case of irrigation greater than 360 mm scenario s5 treatments t2 in dry cold years and t5 in wet normal years were found to be more efficient strategies for maximizing iwue as the applied seasonal irrigation water amount increased simulated iwue increased until a certain irrigation amount e g until 420 mm scenario s6 in dry warm years fig 6a and then decreased for the higher irrigation scenarios except in wet weather conditions fig 6 decline in simulated iwue with increasing irrigation was more rapid in wet years as compared to normal and dry years in case of wet years simulated iwue was the highest under s1 scenario 120 mm seasonal irrigation and then it decreased continuously with increase in the amount of applied irrigation water seasonal rainfall received during the wet years was very high 649 2 mm 450 8 mm and 443 4 mm in wet warm wet normal and wet cold climatic conditions respectively table 1 and this has resulted in a very high iwue under s1 scenario in spite of applying lower amounts of irrigation water these results are also supported by earlier findings that warm and humid climate is favorable for cotton production reddy et al 1996 1997 logan and gwathmey 2002 in case of low irrigation water scenarios s1 s2 and s3 simulated iwue was consistently lower in dry and normal years as compared to wet years fig 6 in contrast under moderate irrigation water scenarios s4 and s5 simulated iwue was higher in normal years as compared to dry and wet years in case of high irrigation scenarios s6 s7 and s8 simulated iwue in normal years was comparable to that in dry years but it was lower in wet years fig 6 overall applying moderate amounts of irrigation water scenarios s4 and s5 could potentially increase iwue while maintaining higher seed cotton yields as compared to applying lower scenarios s1 s2 and s3 and higher scenarios s6 s7 and s8 amounts of irrigation water however the effects of irrigation regimes deficits on iwue and seed cotton yield vary with weather conditions soil and crop management practices and hence suggestions from this study should be used only as a general guidance 3 4 efficient crop growth stage based irrigation strategies under different levels of irrigation water availability one of the goals of this simulation study was to answer a hypothetical question if annual irrigation depths are limited by policy to 120 180 240 360 or 420 mm at what cotton growth stage s should water be applied in order to maximize seed cotton yield iwue and how does that compare to more limited field studies in case of limited availability of irrigation water it is important to enhance irrigation efficiency by optimally allocating water among different growth stages snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 it could be inferred from the discussion in preceding sections and from previous studies that for a given level of annual irrigation some crop growth stage based irrigation strategies are better than others in addition as discussed earlier higher seasonal irrigation amounts 420 mm have not contributed to substantial increases in seed cotton yield and have decreased iwue for each of the simulated scenarios with 420 mm or less seasonal irrigation water s1 to s6 identified efficient irrigation strategies along with growth stage wise distribution of irrigation water that maximized seed cotton yield and iwue under different climate variability classes are presented in fig 7 irrigation treatment t1 was found to be the best irrigation treatment for maximizing seed cotton yield iwue under most of the irrigation scenarios followed by t3 t2 and t5 treatments fig 7 irrigation treatment t4 was found to be the worst in any irrigation scenario under any climate variability class therefore it is recommended to ensure irrigation application at the peak bloom growth stage of cotton gs4 even if there is a limited availability of irrigation water results from this study reinforce some of the outcomes from earlier studies butter et al 2007 snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 and these recommendations should be used with caution as producers in the shp apply pre plant and or at plant irrigations in some years to establish a good plant stand bordovsky et al 2015 which were not considered in these simulations 3 5 suggested ideal irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes ideal cotton irrigation strategies identified for different climate variability classes based on the criterion adopted in this study an irrigation strategy was considered as ideal if the increase in average seed cotton yield from that irrigation strategy to the next higher irrigation water use strategy was less than 5 are presented in fig 8 seasonal irrigation water application under the suggested efficient irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes was less than the annual groundwater pumping limit of 460 mm 18 in specified by the hpwd except in dry warm years fig 8 indicating that irrigating cotton according to these suggested crop growth stage based irrigation strategies enables producers to be compliant with the hpwd regulations in case of dry warm years it may not be possible to achieve the potential highest seed cotton yield without exceeding the hpwd s annual pumping limit however the hpwd allows producers to establish a conservation reserve and hence producers can save irrigation water in wet cold years and use it in subsequent dry warm years and thereby manage to comply with the hpwd pumping limits with careful irrigation planning adoption of suggested crop growth stage based irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes based on forecasted weather could potentially save considerable amount of irrigation water however depending on the changes in actual weather as the growing season progresses switching from one strategy to another strategy may be necessary 4 conclusion the dssat csm cropgro cotton model was used to assess the effects of crop growth stage based irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield and iwue under different climate variability classes and suggest efficient irrigation strategies for the shp region the results from this study indicated that the amount and distribution of irrigation water among different cotton growth stages had substantial effect on the seed cotton yield and iwue while elimination of irrigation during peak bloom stage gs4 resulted in the lowest seed cotton yield and iwue irrigation elimination during the initial gs1 to gs2 or final gs5 growth stages caused minimum effect on seed cotton yield and iwue in most of the climate variability classes wet warm climatic conditions were found to be most favorable among all climate variability classes for cotton growth and resulted in maximum seed cotton yield and iwue overall application of moderate amounts of irrigation water 300 to 360 mm in wet years and moderate to high amounts of irrigation water 360 to 420 mm in dry and normal years through appropriate crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies could enable achieving higher iwues while maintaining higher seed cotton yields application of more than 420 mm of irrigation water scenarios s7 and s8 during the growing season resulted in a decline in iwue and provided minimal if any increases in seed cotton yield suggestions were finally made on efficient crop growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies under different climate variability classes and different levels of irrigation water availability the results from the present study are useful for shp producers to optimize the application of limited available irrigation water in achieving higher seed cotton yields without exceeding the hpwd s annual pumping limits future efforts will focus on considering larger number of irrigation scenarios that are representative of reducing irrigation capacities in the shp region for identifying efficient crop growth stage based irrigation strategies declaration of competing interest the

10874,projected changes in global climate might make irrigation a more attractive option for farmers in historically rain fed agricultural regions if irrigation water becomes an economic input in field crop production in this type of region this would give rise to a derived demand for irrigation water by farmers many existing models of irrigation water use are based on estimated crop requirements but are not necessarily consistent with an economic approach to modeling the derived demand for an input the purpose of this paper is to develop an economic model of the demand for irrigation water treating irrigation as a damage control input the production economics of damage control inputs has been applied in pest management in crop production and was suggested as an approach to modeling the demand for irrigation water by fox and weersink 1995 but to date this extension has not been undertaken our model uses a two input approach with both a von liebig and a quadratic functional form of the relationship between inputs and yield we treat the damage agent water deficit and the control agent irrigation water as perfect substitutes as a result the control function is linear compared with a water requirements approach sometimes called an engineering method by economists our economic approach has the potential to increase net benefits to farmers and to encourage more efficient water use keywords derived demand for irrigation water field crop irrigation profit maximization alternative functional forms climate change damage control input 1 introduction projected global climate changes suggest that in future irrigation might be a more attractive option for farmers in historically rain fed production regions jacques et al 2018 li and troy 2018 singh et al 2017 turral et al 2008 if irrigation water becomes more important as an economic input in field crop production in these regions this would give rise to a derived demand for irrigation water by farmers the previous literature has focused primarily on the derived demand for irrigation water in arid regions such as wu and chen 2013 shen et al 2013 mehta et al 2013 amir and fisher 1999 and banerjee and obembe 2013 in these studies irrigation water is treated as a conventional crop production input and regular use of irrigation is assumed however in historically rain fed agriculture regions irrigation of common field crops has been limited in these circumstances it is more appropriate to treat irrigation water as a damage control input fox and weersink 1995 suggested that irrigation could be modeled as a damage control input in rain fed regions but they did not explore the implications of their suggestion damage control input models have been widely applied in modeling the economics of pest control robison and barry 1987 babcock et al 1992 fox and weersink 1995 and weed management pannell 1995 the production economics of damage control inputs includes a damage function a control function an incidence or level of the damage agent and a damage control input damage control inputs only affect output when a damage agent is present in this context the damage agent would be a water deficit for a growing crop resulting from a shortfall in precipitation fox and weersink 1995 showed that the optimality conditions for damage control inputs are subject to certain technical requirements that do not occur with conventional production inputs the relative curvatures of the damage and control functions can bring about corner solutions which take the form of all or nothing input applications with limited response to changes in relative prices many studies of the demand for irrigation water for example wu and chen 2013 shen et al 2013 and mehta et al 2013 use a water requirements approach or what economists sometimes call an engineering method to model irrigation these methods focus on hydrological balance and don t necessarily consider economic factors explicitly some studies have used an economic approach to investigate the irrigation water demand like amir and fisher 1999 and banerjee and obembe 2013 amir and fisher 1999 used a linear optimization model to analyze the agricultural demand for water in israel for field crops orchards vegetables and flowers they used their model to characterize irrigation water demand for varying water prices banerjee and obembe 2013 assumed constant irrigation water quantity per acre then they used an econometric model to estimate irrigation acreage with respect to crop prices and crop yields in georgia mississippi and alabama for corn soybeans cotton rice and peanuts although amir and fisher 1999 and banerjee and obembe 2013 include prices they didn t derive the irrigation water quantity per acre by considering potential crop yield precipitation crop price and farmers net profit the purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of the derived demand for irrigation water for field crops for historically rain fed agriculture 1 1 access to water sources for use in agricultural irrigation is subject to various institutional rules across locations it is beyond the scope of this paper to address the many governance arrangements that regulate access to both surface and groundwater for irrigation purposes the model treats irrigation water as a damage control input and takes into account the water from precipitation potential crop yield input prices crop price and farmers profit the elements of this model include damage function control function yield response function for both von liebig and quadratic functional forms variable costs and fixed costs of irrigation and the rate of time preference we treat the decision as a capital budget problem to realize its purpose this paper is organized into six sections section 2 develops a damage control model which treats irrigation water as a damage control input based on the model we discuss the effects of irrigation precipitation and potential yields on actual crop yields section 3 applies the damage control model developed in section 2 into the yield response function for both von liebig and quadratic functional forms section 4 uses the model from section 3 to derive the optimal demand of irrigation water based on profit maximization section 5 adds the fixed costs of irrigation section 6 discusses the implications of our results 2 the production economics of damage inputs 2 1 derivation of the control and damage functions a damage control production model consists of two elements the first element describes the effect of a damage control input on a damage agent the second element describes the effect of the incidence or level of the damage agent on output in the present context the damage control agent is the water deficit that arises when precipitation is insufficient to support the crop yield consistent with the optimal application of conventional inputs the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 is defined as the difference between the amount of water required for potential crop yield w and water obtained naturally from precipitation for one acre of cropland w p during the relevant growing season eq 1 shows the expression for calculating the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 1 z 0 w w p where w is the amount of water required to achieve potential crop yield for one acre of cropland when conventional crop inputs are applied optimally w p is the stochastic amount of water naturally obtained from precipitation for one acre of cropland when z 0 0 there is a water deficit z 0 could be negative z 0 0 which would constitute excess however we are focused on water shortage conditions excess precipitation might give rise to a need for tile drainage in the region we are studying but the economics of this decision for farmers is outside the scope of the present study the application of irrigation water in the face of a water deficit results in the controlled water deficit of z defined as the difference between the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 and the control function for irrigation c w i eq 2 models the damage agent as the controlled water deficit z as 2 z z 0 c w i where z is the remaining controlled water deficit after irrigation has been applied z 0 is the uncontrolled natural water deficit w i is the amount of the damage control input applied in this context irrigation water to one acre of cropland c w i is the control function of irrigation representing the treatment effect of irrigation on the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 when z z 0 c w i is zero and the controlled water deficit is equal to uncontrolled water deficit it means that water deficit is not treated by irrigation when z z 0 the controlled water deficit is less than uncontrolled water deficit it means that water deficit is partially treated by irrigation when z 0 controlled water deficit is zero it means that water deficit is completely treated by irrigation the first element of a damage control model is the control function c w i which describes how the application of the control input affects the incidence of the damage agent various functional forms are possible for the control function fox and weersink 1995 in the present context however the control function is linear since irrigation water and water from precipitation are treated as perfect substitutes 3 c w i w i when c w i 0 no irrigation is applied and the water deficit is not controlled z z 0 when c w i 0 irrigation is applied to treat water deficit when c w i w i u z 0 irrigation completely treats the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 the amount of irrigation water in this case w i u is the amount of irrigation water per acre that exactly offsets the water deficit the water deficit decreases at a constant rate with more irrigation water c w i w i 0 the second element of a damage control model is the damage function d representing the effect of the damage agent on output the remaining amount of the damage agent after the damage control input is applied in this case the remaining water deficit after irrigation is applied z reduces yield yield in the absence of the water deficit is y 0 called potential yield potential crop yield y 0 is influenced by other conventional crop production inputs such as technology and fertilizer the yield is potential yield multiplied by a proportionate reduction in yield the proportion is determined by the damage function d z which has the remaining damage agent as its argument in the present context this can be written as 4 y y 0 1 d z where y is yield at a given level of water deficit z y 0 is the potential yield that would be obtained in the absence of a water deficit and d z is the damage function which represents the proportion of the potential yield that is lost as a result of the remaining water deficit while a water deficit may decrease the crop quality we limit our attention to only reductions in yield quantity the damage function d z can be compared to a cumulative probability distribution in the interval of 0 1 fox and weersink 1995 with no water deficit z 0 there is no damage d z 0 and yield will be equal to potential yield y y 0 as the water deficit z becomes positive and increases to the total water needed for potential crop yields w the damage d z becomes positive and increases to 1 then actual yield y decreases to 0 so the first derivative of the damage function with respect to the damage agent is positive d z 0 however the damage function d z may have various curvature properties given the discussion of crop water production function in section 3 the sign of d z z is indeterminate and depends on the crop water production function fig 1 shows a 4 axis graph of the damage control model for irrigation water with three different signs of d z z in fig 1 we see that if the effect of water on crop yields is linear then the damage function is linear d z z 0 if the effect of water on crop yields is concave then the damage function is convex d z z 0 if the effect of water on crop yields is convex then the damage function is concave d z z 0 2 2 the structure of the damage control model to combine the two elements of the damage control model the remaining water deficit z in eq 2 is substituted into the second element eq 4 then the expressions of uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 in eq 1 and the control function c w i in eq 3 are substituted into an expanded damage control model this results in eq 5 5 y y 0 1 d z y 0 1 d z

the damage function potential crop yield y 0 is influenced by conventional crop production inputs such as technology and fertilizer in addition to water as potential yield y 0 increases due to better technology and more intensive use of non water inputs yield y increases eq 6 shows the first derivative for yield eq 5 with respect to potential yield y y 0 6 y y 0 d y d y 0 1 1 d z 1 d z 0 w h e r e 1 d z 0 eq 6 shows a positive relationship between yield y and potential yield y 0 that is yield y increases as potential yield y 0 increases water required to achieve potential crop yield w is variable across crop types but fixed for a specific type of crop the crop water requirement w here is from the estimation of a bio economic crop yield model of xu 2017 precipitation w p is stochastic with more precipitation yield y increases until the water deficit reduces to zero eq 7 shows the first derivative for yield eq 5 with respect to precipitation y w p 7 y w p d y d w p 0 y 0 0 d d z d z

precipitation w p irrigation w i as the damage control input has a positive relationship with yield y because irrigation reduces the water deficit the first derivative of yield eq 5 with respect to irrigation y w i is shown in the following eq 8 8 y w i d y d w i 0 y 0 0 d d z d z d z d w i y 0 d z 1 y 0 d z 0 w h e r e y 0 0 a n d d z 0 eq 8 shows a positive relationship between yield y and irrigation w i different than the more general results of fox and weersink 1995 this result is specific for irrigation water due to precipitation water and irrigation water being assumed to be perfect substitutes in the control function eq 3 eq 9 shows the second derivative for yield with respect to irrigation y w i w i 9 y w i w i d y w i d w i y 0 d d z d z 1 y 0 d z z where y 0 0 and sign of d zz is unknown in eq 9 we see that the sign of y w i w i depends on the sign of d z z as mentioned above the curvature property of the damage function d z z is indeterminate and depends on the crop water production function so the sign of y w i w i is indeterminate as well 3 yield response to irrigation 3 1 previous literature on crop production functions for irrigation the von liebig and the polynomial models are widely used functions to model crop yields in response to water and nutrients holloway and paris 2002 stated that the von liebig model is based on von liebig s law of the minimum von liebig s law of minimum states that the growth of a crop is determined by the availability of the most limiting input the von liebig model assumes a linear crop response to the most limiting input until a plateau is reached and then another input becomes the limiting factor according to heady and dillon 1961 the von liebig model has been used widely by agronomists and agricultural economists for over a century more recent applications include wang and baerenklau 2014 and llewelyn and featherstone 1997 agricultural economists have also used polynomial functions to model crop yield response examples include kloster and whittlesey 1971 hexem and heady 1978 kiani and abbasi 2009 quiroga et al 2011 jalota et al 2007 wang and baerenklau 2014 rickard and fox 1999 lobell et al 2007 tack et al 2012 and roberts et al 2012 huang 1990 and amon armah et al 2015 stated that the polynomial crop production model is widely used due to its simplicity and computational tractability as well as its ability to fit the relevant data well in addition a polynomial can be seen as a second order taylor approximation of a more general function 3 2 irrigation demand with a linear response plateau von liebig model in the linear response plateau von liebig model the yield response to input is linear and yield achieves a plateau when the input exceeds a certain amount we assume two crop production inputs in the discussion that follows one is a damage control input irrigation water w i the other input is a composite input x including labor seed machinery fertilizer and so on eq 10 shows the general crop water von liebig production function 10 y w x min a 0 a 1 w b 0 b 1 x y 0 w w p w i where y w x represents the yield function which depends on the quantities of water and of a composite input w is the total quantity of water for a type of crop per acre including precipitation w p and irrigation water w i x is the quantity of the composite input per acre a 0 and a 1 are the intercept and slope parameters respectively in the crop production function for water and b 0 and b 1 are the intercept and slope parameters respectively in the crop production function for the composite input the total quantity of water w includes precipitation w p and irrigation water w i eq 10 can be rewritten as 11 y w i x m i n a 0 a 1 w p w i b 0 b 1 x y 0 m i n y l a 1 w i b 0 b 1 x y 0 w h e r e y l a 0 a 1 w p where y w i x represents yield as a function of both irrigation water and a composite input y l is the crop yield without irrigation to obtain the potential crop yield the quantities of irrigation water and the composite input should comply with the following rule in eq 12 12 y l a 1 w i u b 0 b 1 x u y 0 a n d w w p w i u where w i u is the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates water deficit and achieves the potential crop yield x u is the quantity of the composite input to achieve the potential crop yield in eq 12 these quantities of irrigation water and the composite input could achieve the potential crop yield any quantities more than those amounts w i u a n d x u cannot increase yield but would increase the quantity and cost of inputs thus the net benefit for a farmer will decrease therefore the quantities of water and the composite input in eq 12 are the maximal quantities that a rational farmer would use if the quantities of irrigation water and the composite input cannot achieve the potential crop yield then the crop yield is determined by the most limiting input only increasing the quantity of the most limiting input would increase the crop yields 3 2 1 linear response plateau for irrigation water in this section we develop a version of the linear response plateau von liebig model in which only irrigation water can vary to present the characteristics of linear response plateau for irrigation water eq 11 is simplified by this assumption to give us 13 y w i m i n y l a 1 w i y 0 when precipitation is less than the water requirements for the potential crop yield w w a water deficit reduces crop yield given eq 4 we derive the damage function in eq 14 14 y y 0 1 d z y y 0 1 d z d z 1 y y 0 yield y in eq 13 and potential yield y 0 in eq 12 are substituted into eq 14 to obtain the following damage function with respect to the water deficit 15 d z 1 y y 0 1 y l a 1 w i y l a 1 w i u y l a 1 w i u y l a 1 w i y l a 1 w i u a 1 w i u w i y l a 1 w i u a 1 z y l a 1 w i u θ z w h e r e θ a 1 y l a 1 w i u a 1 y 0 the first and second derivatives of the damage function with respect to the water deficit are 16 d z θ a 1 y 0 0 a n d d z z 0 so the damage function is linear given the formula of the first and second derivative for yield in terms of irrigation water in eq 8 and eq 9 eq 17 shows the signs of the first and second derivative for yield y in terms of irrigation water w i 17 y w i y 0 d z y 0 a 1 y 0 a 1 0 a n d y w i w i y 0 d z z 0 where the first derivative y w i is positive and the second derivative y w i w i is zero so the effect of irrigation water w i on yield y is positive and linear when the crop needs more water w w based on the curvature property of the yield function the following describes the characteristics under three conditions of yield function in terms of irrigation water 1 w i 0 no irrigation 2 0 w i w i u some irrigation but not the extent of potential yield and 3 w i w i u sufficient water from irrigation to realize potential yield as fig 1 shows when irrigation is not applied w i 0 the water deficit is not controlled z z 0 in this case yield equals the yield without irrigation y l as shown in eq 13 when a crop receives some irrigation water but not to the extent that the potential yield is achieved 0 w i w i u the water deficit is partially controlled z z 0 in this case the yield is higher than the yield without irrigation y y l and depends on irrigation water as shown in eq 18 according to eq 13 18 y y l a 1 w i when a crop receives sufficient water from irrigation w i w i u to eliminate the water deficit z 0 the yield equals the potential yield y y 0 in this case irrigation water quantity reaches the maximum level w i u which is the difference between sufficient water quantity that croplands need w and precipitation w p given eq 12 19 w i u w w p z 0 0 where w i u is the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates water deficit 3 2 2 linear response plateau for irrigation water and composite input this section discusses the joint effect of irrigation water and the composite input on crop yield graphically based on eq 11 if the intercept coefficient for irrigation water is larger than that for the composite input b 0 y l then the composite input is limiting input and only increasing the amount of the composite input would increase crop yields in the beginning in contrast if the intercept coefficient for irrigation water is less than that for composite input b 0 y l then the irrigation water is limiting input and only increasing the amount of irrigation water would increase crop yields in the beginning the discussion of the joint effect is separated into two cases a the case of b 0 y l composite input is the limiting factor fig 2 and b the case of b 0 y l irrigation water is the limiting factor fig 3 figs 2 and 3 illustrate the joint effect of irrigation water and composite input on crop yield the horizontal axes represent quantities of irrigation water w i composite input x and the vertical axis represents yield y respectively fig 2 shows how irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield when b 0 y l in this case only increasing the composite input could increase crop yield initially irrigation water starts to be used when the composite input reaches x i r r x x i r r here x i r r is the quantity of the composite input that starts to jointly affect crop yield with irrigation water then irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield until yield reaches the potential yield y y 0 w i w i u a n d x x u fig 3 shows how irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield when b 0 y l in this case irrigation water is the limiting input and the composite input starts to be used when the irrigation water reaches w i c o m w i w i c o m here w i c o m is the quantity of irrigation water that starts to jointly affect crop yield with the composite input then irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield until yield reaches the potential yield y y 0 w i w i u a n d x x u 3 3 irrigation demand with the quadratic functional form eq 20 shows the general quadratic functional form for a two input yield function 20 y w x β 0 β 1 w β 2 w 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 w w p w i a s s u m e β 0 0 β 1 a n d β 3 0 β 2 a n d β 4 0 where y w x represents the yield as a function of both total available water w and the quantity of the composite input x and β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are parameters as the total available water includes water from precipitation and irrigation eq 20 could be rewritten as 21 y w i x β 0 β 1 w p w i β 2 w p w i 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 β 0 β 1 w p β 1 w i β 2 w p 2 β 2 w i 2 2 β 2 w p w

input γ 0 and γ 1 are the parameters in the quadratic functional form for irrigation water and composite input the expressions of γ 0 and γ 1 are presented in eq 21 thus the potential yield could be written as 22 y 0 γ 0 γ 1 w i u β 2 w i u 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 where w i u represents the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit for the quadratic functional form the maximum quantity of irrigation water w i u can be derived as 23 f o c d y d w i γ 1 2 β 2 w i u 0 w i u γ 1 2 β 2 the values of w i u for each crop could be determined by estimating the crop yield model in eq 20 with actual data as shown in xu 2017 given the expression for the damage function in eq 14 the damage function for water deficit in the quadratic functional form is derived by substituting eq 21 and eq 22 into the damage function in eq 14 to obtain eq 24 24 d z 1 y y 0 1 γ 0 γ 1 w i β 2 w i 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 y 0 γ 1 w i u w i β 2 w i u 2 w i 2 y 0 γ 1 z β 2 w i u 2 w i u z 2 y 0 γ 1 z β 2 z 2 2 β 2 w i u z y 0 β 2 y 0 z 2 γ 1 2 β 2 w i u y 0 z given the first derivative of yield with respect to the irrigation water in eq 23 the damage function can be simplified as 25 d z β 2 y 0 z 2 0 y 0 z β 2 y 0 z 2 eq 26 shows the first and second derivatives of the damage function d z in eq 25 with respect to water deficit z 26 d z 2 β 2 y 0 z 0 a n d d z z 2 β 2 y 0 0 w h e r e β 2 0 y 0 0 a n d z 0 where the first and second derivatives d z and d z z are both positive as the parameter β 2 is assumed negative in eq 20 the parameter β 2 is negative because there are diminishing returns from applying more irrigation water in the yield function eq 20 with more irrigation water marginal yield is positive but decreasing and all else constant so the damage function for a quadratic functional form is convex eq 27 shows the signs of the first and second derivatives for yield y in terms of irrigation water w i 27 y w i y 0 d z y 0 2 β 2 y 0 z 2 β 2 z 0 a n d y w i w i y 0 d z z y 0 2 β 2 y 0 2 β 2 0 where the first derivative y w i is positive and the second derivative y w i w i is negative as the parameter β 2 is assumed negative in eq 20 so the effect of irrigation water w i on yield y is concave in water deficit condition w w yield increases at a decreasing rate as more irrigation water is applied based on the curvature property of the yield function there are three situations with respect to the yield function in terms of irrigation water 1 w i 0 no irrigation 2 0 w i w i u some irrigation but not the extent of potential yield and 3 w i w i u sufficient water from irrigation to realize potential yield when irrigation is not applied w i 0 the water deficit is not controlled z z 0 in this case the yield equals the yield without irrigation y

irrigation water as shown in eq 29 according to eq 21 and eq 28 29 y γ 0 γ 1 w i β 2 w i 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 y l o w γ 1 w i β 2 w i 2 when crops obtain sufficient water from irrigation w i w i u there is no water deficit damage z 0 so yield equals the potential yield y y 0 in this case irrigation water quantity reaches the maximum level w i u as shown in eq 23 3 4 summary the agricultural irrigation literature makes frequent references to efficiency of water use economists invoke two definitions of efficiency that are relevant in this context technical efficiency and economic or allocative efficiency technical efficiency refers to a situation where the maximum output is obtained from a given quantity of inputs the technically efficient sets of input bundles are the production frontier that is the surface of the 3d production curve in figs 2 and 3 for von liebig model and the concave production curve in fig 1 for quadratic functional form economic efficiency refers to the situation where the marginal benefit of using a unit of an input is equal to the marginal cost of using that input a condition consistent with maximizing profit economic efficiency considers the price of output and the costs of inputs an economically efficient input bundle must be in the set of technically efficient production possibilities we now proceed to derive the profit maximizing conditions for input use for these two functional forms 4 profit maximization profit refers to the difference between total revenue and the cost of composite input plus the cost of irrigation water for the two input cases presented earlier eq 30 shows the maximization problem 30 m a x π p y t v c where π is profit per acre per year p is the price of the crop per unit of output t v c is the total variable cost of irrigation and the composite input eq 31 shows the total variable cost with respect to irrigation and the composite input per year 31 t v c x c x w i c p c a where c x is the price of the composite input c p is the cost of pumping irrigation water per unit c a is the additional cost if any of using irrigation water per unit this second irrigation water cost could arise as a marginal user cost an externality cost 2 2 the meaning of externality cost various depending on the water source for example if the irrigation water comes from groundwater then the externality cost refers to the reduction of the water table of neighbor farms if the irrigation water comes from surface water then it refers to the reduction in the availablility of water for downstream users or as a user fee for water the first term on the right side represents the cost of composite input and the second term represents the operation cost of irrigation 4 1 profit maximization in linear response plateau von liebig model 4 1 1 profit maximization in linear response plateau von liebig model for irrigation water and composite input the profit equation for the linear response plateau von liebig model for irrigation water and the composite input is 32 m a x π p min y l a 1 w i b 0 b 1 x y 0 x c x w i c p c a the first order condition with respect to irrigation water is 33 f o c π w i π w i p y w i c p c a 0 where π w i is the first derivative of profit with respect to irrigation water given the first order condition there are three mutually exclusive solutions two corner solutions and one interior solution for an interior solution the first order condition in eq 33 should be satisfied however since the production function in terms of irrigation is linear there are two corner solutions one corner solution would completely eliminate the water deficit we call this the upper corner solution another corner solution does not control water deficit at all we call this the lower corner solution table 1 shows the interior and corner solutions in the linear response plateau von liebig model it shows the quantity of irrigation water w i m by comparing the ratio of the marginal cost of irrigation to the crop price c p c a p with the slope of production function a 1 when the first order condition eq 33 is satisfied any value between zero and w i u could be the irrigation water quantity for profit maximization however if the price ratio c p c a p is larger than the rate of yield increase by adding irrigation water a 1 then it means that the marginal profit of adding one more unit of irrigation water is less than the marginal cost so rational farmers won t use irrigation w i m 0 if the price ratio c p c a p is less than the rate of yield increase by adding irrigation water a 1 then it means that the marginal profit of adding one more unit of irrigation water is more than the marginal cost so irrigation water will be used as much as possible thus reaching the maximum quantity w i m w i u a similar analysis is used with respect to the composite input table 2 shows the interior and corner solutions for the composite input x m in the linear response plateau von liebig model by comparing the ratio of the marginal cost of composite input to the crop price c x p and the rate of yield increase by adding composite input b 1 the profit maximizing combination of input bundles requires that both first order necessary and second order sufficiency conditions be satisfied for the von liebig model the first order condition for profit maximization is met but it is not the sufficient one as the von liebig model contains a minimum operator to achieve the profit maximization the first two elements inside the minimum operator should be equal as eq 34 34 y l a 1 w i b 0 b 1 x where w i is the optimal quantity of irrigation water and x is the optimal quantity of the composite input if an input bundle does not comply with the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 then one of the inputs is the limiting factor and the other input is overused the overuse of the second input won t change the crop yield and revenue but will increase the cost of inputs thus the profit of a farmer will decrease therefore all of the optimal input bundles must comply with the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 the bold dashed line in figs 2 and 3 shows all of the input bundles that comply with the fixed proportion rule we call them potential optimal input bundles the bold dashed line in fig 2 shows the potential optimal input bundles for irrigation water and composite input when b 0 y l initially the composite input is the limiting input so additional irrigation water will not increase crop yield in this segment the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points 0 0 0 to 0 x i r r y l in the second segment the ratio of irrigation water to the composite input must follow the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 to minimize the cost of input so the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points 0 x i r r y l to w i u x u y 0 in fig 2 the analysis is similar when b 0 y l the bold dashed line in fig 3 shows the potential optimal input bundles of irrigation water and the composite input when b 0 y l initially irrigation water is the limiting input so the composite input won t be used in this segment the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points 0 0 0 to w i c o m 0 b 0 in the second segment the ratio of irrigation water to the composite input must follow the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 to minimize the cost of input so the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points w i c o m 0 b 0 to w i u x u y 0 by considering the results in tables 1 and 2 as well as the potential optimal input bundles above table 3 shows the optimal input bundles and their yields for the linear response plateau von liebig model in table 3 the second and third columns show the relationship conditions from tables 1 and 2 the fourth and fifth columns present the corresponding profit maximization input quantity to each relationship condition from tables 1 and 2 the sixth column presents the optimal quantity of input bundles corresponding to the combined relationship conditions in addition the optimal input bundle complies with the rule in eq 34 the last column presents the yield with optimal input bundles y note that all these optimal bundles lie on the bold dashed lines in figs 2 and 3 it means that the profit maximization solutions for irrigation water w i must be less than or equal to the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit w i u in table 3 case 1 with the interior solutions for two inputs is the only case with multiple optimal input bundles as the price ratio equal to the rate of yield increases by adding one more unit of input for both irrigation water and composite input all of the input bundles satisfy the rule in eq 34 are the solutions in case 1 this is an unusual case and unlikely to ever happen even if this case happens it will not last long as price varies in cases 6 and 8 one input has a lower corner solution and the other input has an upper corner solution however the upper corner solution of the second input cannot be achieved as the lower corner solution of the first input limits the use of second input for example in case 6 irrigation water has a lower corner solution and the composite input has an upper corner solution but the composite input cannot achieve the upper corner solution because no use of irrigation water limits the use of composite input in this case the optimal quantity of the composite input should comply with the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 the amount should be as much as possible lies on the bold dashed line in figs 2 and 3 when irrigation water is zero that is x i r r in fig 2 or zero in fig 3 depends on the value of parameters otherwise the profit from crop production reduces because the cost of using more irrigation water is higher than the benefit in cases 2 and 4 one input has a lower corner solution and the other input has an interior solution for the same reason in cases 6 and 8 the optimal input bundles in cases 2 and 4 have low quantity as well thus the yields in these four cases are low compared to other cases such as cases 3 7 and 9 in table 3 cases 3 7 and 9 use the maximum amounts of irrigation water and the composite input thereby obtaining higher yield than other cases case 5 is the only case that does not use any input because the price ratio is larger than the rate of yield increases by adding input for both irrigation water and composite input thus using either irrigation water or the composite input will cost more than the benefit of increasing yields in table 3 some optimal bundles and yields are based on the value of b 0 and y l recall that y l is a 0 a 1 w p in eq 11 so some optimal input bundles and related yield depend on the value of parameters in the production function it is reasonable to think that yield will be zero when no water is available for a crop similarly it is reasonable to think that yield will be zero when no composite input is applied to crop production recall that the composite input includes seeds labor fertilizer machinery and all other inputs except for irrigation water so if there is no seed labor and machinery used for crop production then farmers gain nothing so i further assume that both a 0 and b 0 are zero a 0 0 a n d b 0 0 as a result eq 35 shows that y l must be no less than b 0 35 y l 0 a 1 w p 0 b 0 according to this additional assumption on parameters of the production functions the optimal input bundles in table 3 can be simplified the simplified results are shown in table 4 which shows the optimal input bundles when y l b 0 compared with the results in table 3 the results for cases 2 4 6 and 8 change in cases 2 and 8 the profit maximization solution does not use any inputs due to the high price ratio for composite input c x p as a result the yield is zero in cases 4 and 6 the profit maximization solution is no irrigation water but limited quantity of composite input to reach the yield y l 4 2 profit maximization in the quadratic functional form eq 36 is the profit equation for irrigation water and the composite input for the quadratic functional form 36 m a x π p y l γ 1 w i β 2 w i 2 x c x w i c p c a then the first order condition of profit with respect to irrigation water is 37 f o c π w i π w i p y w i c p c a 0 according to eq 37 interior solutions exist when the price ratio c p c a p is less than the slope of the quadratic production function with respect to irrigation water with no irrigation y w i 0 the interior solutions must satisfy the condition that the price ratio c p c a p is equal to the slope of the quadratic production function with respect to irrigation water y w i 38 y w i c p c a p w h e n c p c a p 0 y w i 0 where y w i is the slope of quadratic production function at the profit maximizing quantity of irrigation water y w i 0 is the slope of the quadratic production function when irrigation water is zero given the expression of y w i and z in eq 27 and eq 5 eq 38 could be expanded to obtain the optimal quantity of irrigation water 39 2 β 2 w w p w i c p c a p w w p w i c p c a 2 β 2 p w i w w p c p c a 2 β 2 p w i u c p c a 2 β 2 p if the price ratio c p c a p is higher than the slope of the quadratic production function when irrigation water is zero y w i 0 then the profit maximization solution is to use no irrigation water because the marginal cost of irrigation is higher than the marginal revenue eq 40 shows the corner solution 40 w i 0 w h e n c p c a p y w i 0 table 5 summarizes the optimal quantity of irrigation water for quadratic model by comparing the price ratio c p c a p and the slope of the quadratic production function when irrigation water is zero y w i 0 it shows both the interior and corner solutions from eq 39 and eq 40 due to the decreasing return from applying more irrigation water i e β 2 0 and positive pumping cost i e c p 0 in both solutions the profit maximization solution w i derived by economic method is less than the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit w i u 4 3 summary a water requirements approach sometimes called an engineering method by economists requires the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit and achieves the potential crop yield y 0 that is w i u however in tables 3 and 5 the results from our economic approach indicate that the optimal quantity of irrigation water is not always the maximum amount w i u for the von liebig model the results are discrete i e corner solution when the price ratio for either input is larger than the rate of yield increase by adding one unit of this input the optimal quantity of irrigation water could be a value less than w i u for the quadratic functional form the results are generally interior solutions depending on the price ratio when the price ratio for irrigation water is larger than zero the optimal quantity of irrigation water could be a value less than w i u fig 4 takes the quadratic functional form as an example the optimal quantity of irrigation water by economic approach not only reduce the demand for irrigation water w i w i u but also maximizes the profit of farmers π π u therefore compared with the engineering method our economic approach has the potential to increase net benefits to farmers and to encourage more efficient water use as mentioned in section 1 the damage control model has been used previously in the pest management literature that literature has examined two concepts called economic thresholds the fixed treatment economic threshold is used to calculate the minimum pest incidence that justifies from an economic point of view the application of a pest control input at a pre determined rate sometimes called the label rate the second economic threshold concept in the pest management literature is the optimal treatment economic threshold this applies when the level of pest control effort can be varied and the control input can be applied at a level that maximizes profit in the context of irrigation there is not general requirement to fix the quantity of the control input that is irrigation water so the fixed treatment economic threshold is generally not relevant our optimal irrigation water quantities constitute optimal treatment economic thresholds section 4 derived the profit maximization quantity of irrigation water for von liebig and quadratic production functions this analysis did not distinguish fixed cost from variable costs implicitly our marginal conditions have been based on variable costs only in historically rain fed agriculture however part of the farmer s decision has to do with incurring fixed costs for machinery and irrigation related infrastructure in section 5 we investigate the net benefit from irrigation to farmers when fixed costs are taken into account 5 consideration of fixed costs of irrigation irrigation involves fixed costs which is the capital cost of equipment and installation if the additional revenue from using irrigation is higher than the variable costs of irrigation it still might be uneconomic for farmers to irrigate if the additional net revenue is not sufficient to cover these fixed costs in present value terms the annual net benefit from irrigation in a year in which a water deficit occurs can be expressed as eq 41 41 δ π t π t i π t n i where the subscript t refers to the year the superscript i refers to irrigation the superscript n i refers to no irrigation δ π t is the net benefit from irrigation in year t π t i is the profit with irrigation in year t π t n i is the profit without irrigation in year t the profit from irrigation in year t π t i can be expressed as 42 π t i p y x c x w i c p c a where the right hand side of eq 42 means the total revenue of using irrigation with optimal input bundles discussed in section 4 minus the cost of composite input in the condition of using irrigation and the operation cost of irrigation with optimal input bundles the profit without irrigation in year t π t n i can be expressed as 43 π t n i p y n i x n i c x where y n i is the yield using optimal quantity of the composite input in the condition of no irrigation x n i is the optimal quantity of the composite input without using irrigation the fixed cost of irrigation is the capital cost of equipment and installation symbolized as f c t is the expected useful lifetime of the irrigation equipment the cumulative benefit from irrigation during the expected life of the irrigation system is defined as the sum of the present values of the benefit from irrigation for each year during the expected life period the present value is the current discounted value of the benefit from irrigation in future assuming a specific rate of time preference in a year with a water deficit the benefit from irrigation is calculated as eq 41 δ π t π t i π t n i in the year without a water deficit the benefit from irrigation is zero because irrigation won t be used δ π t 0 eq 44 shows the present value of the net benefit from irrigation during the expected life of the irrigation system 44 p v δ π t 1 t δ π t 1 i t where p v δ π is the present value of the net benefit from irrigation during the expected life of the irrigation system and i is the rate of time preference used to discount future benefits if the present value of the net benefit p v δ π is larger than the fixed cost f c then irrigation would be an attractive investment to the farmer otherwise the farmer would not install the irrigation system it would be good to acknowledge that this simple present value calculation is not the whole story the stream of benefits is stochastic and farmers may exhibit risk aversion so a more complete analysis would use a stochastic present value approach with farmer risk preferences or a risk rated present value in future study 6 conclusion this paper develops a theoretical model of the derived demand for irrigation water for field crops for historically rain fed agriculture the model treats irrigation water as a damage control input and takes into account the water from precipitation potential crop yield input prices crop price and farmers profit further development of the framework used a von liebig model and a quadratic functional form to study the optimality conditions for the application of irrigation water finally the present value of net benefit from irrigation and the fixed cost of an irrigation system are compared to determine the economic attractiveness of irrigation this paper contributes by filling two gaps in the literature first it explores the application of irrigation water in the damage control model second economic factors are included in the determination of the demand for irrigation water by taking into account the water from precipitation potential crop yield input prices and crop price which has not been previously done in literature we find that this study is a special case of the damage control model both the damage agent and control agent are assumed to be perfect substitutes so the control function is linear second this study shows that the application of irrigation in the damage control model has a different feature of economic threshold than pest management the damage control input approach in pest management generally is applied as a fixed treatment economic threshold but the irrigation in crop production generally results in an optimal treatment economic threshold third compared with a water requirements approach sometimes called an engineering method by economists our economic approach has the potential to increase net benefits to farmers and to encourage more efficient water use fourth we find that the optimal demand for irrigation water in the von liebig model is discrete i e corner solution while the quadratic functional form generally produces interior solutions depending on the price ratio in addition our control variable is the quantity of water over a full growing season for some crops there are critical production periods during the growing season where adequate water availability is more important for yield empirical and practical application of our model in these circumstances would require partitioning the growing season into different stages and the quantity of water would also need to be modeled for each stage finally we employ a non stochastic present value calculation in our analysis of fixed costs however the stream of benefits from irrigation is stochastic and farmers may exhibit risk aversion therefore in a future study a more complete analysis could use a stochastic present value approach with farmer risk preferences or a risk rated present value finally our theoretical model could be applied to other research topics including the adaption of water use in crop production to climate

10874,projected changes in global climate might make irrigation a more attractive option for farmers in historically rain fed agricultural regions if irrigation water becomes an economic input in field crop production in this type of region this would give rise to a derived demand for irrigation water by farmers many existing models of irrigation water use are based on estimated crop requirements but are not necessarily consistent with an economic approach to modeling the derived demand for an input the purpose of this paper is to develop an economic model of the demand for irrigation water treating irrigation as a damage control input the production economics of damage control inputs has been applied in pest management in crop production and was suggested as an approach to modeling the demand for irrigation water by fox and weersink 1995 but to date this extension has not been undertaken our model uses a two input approach with both a von liebig and a quadratic functional form of the relationship between inputs and yield we treat the damage agent water deficit and the control agent irrigation water as perfect substitutes as a result the control function is linear compared with a water requirements approach sometimes called an engineering method by economists our economic approach has the potential to increase net benefits to farmers and to encourage more efficient water use keywords derived demand for irrigation water field crop irrigation profit maximization alternative functional forms climate change damage control input 1 introduction projected global climate changes suggest that in future irrigation might be a more attractive option for farmers in historically rain fed production regions jacques et al 2018 li and troy 2018 singh et al 2017 turral et al 2008 if irrigation water becomes more important as an economic input in field crop production in these regions this would give rise to a derived demand for irrigation water by farmers the previous literature has focused primarily on the derived demand for irrigation water in arid regions such as wu and chen 2013 shen et al 2013 mehta et al 2013 amir and fisher 1999 and banerjee and obembe 2013 in these studies irrigation water is treated as a conventional crop production input and regular use of irrigation is assumed however in historically rain fed agriculture regions irrigation of common field crops has been limited in these circumstances it is more appropriate to treat irrigation water as a damage control input fox and weersink 1995 suggested that irrigation could be modeled as a damage control input in rain fed regions but they did not explore the implications of their suggestion damage control input models have been widely applied in modeling the economics of pest control robison and barry 1987 babcock et al 1992 fox and weersink 1995 and weed management pannell 1995 the production economics of damage control inputs includes a damage function a control function an incidence or level of the damage agent and a damage control input damage control inputs only affect output when a damage agent is present in this context the damage agent would be a water deficit for a growing crop resulting from a shortfall in precipitation fox and weersink 1995 showed that the optimality conditions for damage control inputs are subject to certain technical requirements that do not occur with conventional production inputs the relative curvatures of the damage and control functions can bring about corner solutions which take the form of all or nothing input applications with limited response to changes in relative prices many studies of the demand for irrigation water for example wu and chen 2013 shen et al 2013 and mehta et al 2013 use a water requirements approach or what economists sometimes call an engineering method to model irrigation these methods focus on hydrological balance and don t necessarily consider economic factors explicitly some studies have used an economic approach to investigate the irrigation water demand like amir and fisher 1999 and banerjee and obembe 2013 amir and fisher 1999 used a linear optimization model to analyze the agricultural demand for water in israel for field crops orchards vegetables and flowers they used their model to characterize irrigation water demand for varying water prices banerjee and obembe 2013 assumed constant irrigation water quantity per acre then they used an econometric model to estimate irrigation acreage with respect to crop prices and crop yields in georgia mississippi and alabama for corn soybeans cotton rice and peanuts although amir and fisher 1999 and banerjee and obembe 2013 include prices they didn t derive the irrigation water quantity per acre by considering potential crop yield precipitation crop price and farmers net profit the purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of the derived demand for irrigation water for field crops for historically rain fed agriculture 1 1 access to water sources for use in agricultural irrigation is subject to various institutional rules across locations it is beyond the scope of this paper to address the many governance arrangements that regulate access to both surface and groundwater for irrigation purposes the model treats irrigation water as a damage control input and takes into account the water from precipitation potential crop yield input prices crop price and farmers profit the elements of this model include damage function control function yield response function for both von liebig and quadratic functional forms variable costs and fixed costs of irrigation and the rate of time preference we treat the decision as a capital budget problem to realize its purpose this paper is organized into six sections section 2 develops a damage control model which treats irrigation water as a damage control input based on the model we discuss the effects of irrigation precipitation and potential yields on actual crop yields section 3 applies the damage control model developed in section 2 into the yield response function for both von liebig and quadratic functional forms section 4 uses the model from section 3 to derive the optimal demand of irrigation water based on profit maximization section 5 adds the fixed costs of irrigation section 6 discusses the implications of our results 2 the production economics of damage inputs 2 1 derivation of the control and damage functions a damage control production model consists of two elements the first element describes the effect of a damage control input on a damage agent the second element describes the effect of the incidence or level of the damage agent on output in the present context the damage control agent is the water deficit that arises when precipitation is insufficient to support the crop yield consistent with the optimal application of conventional inputs the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 is defined as the difference between the amount of water required for potential crop yield w and water obtained naturally from precipitation for one acre of cropland w p during the relevant growing season eq 1 shows the expression for calculating the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 1 z 0 w w p where w is the amount of water required to achieve potential crop yield for one acre of cropland when conventional crop inputs are applied optimally w p is the stochastic amount of water naturally obtained from precipitation for one acre of cropland when z 0 0 there is a water deficit z 0 could be negative z 0 0 which would constitute excess however we are focused on water shortage conditions excess precipitation might give rise to a need for tile drainage in the region we are studying but the economics of this decision for farmers is outside the scope of the present study the application of irrigation water in the face of a water deficit results in the controlled water deficit of z defined as the difference between the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 and the control function for irrigation c w i eq 2 models the damage agent as the controlled water deficit z as 2 z z 0 c w i where z is the remaining controlled water deficit after irrigation has been applied z 0 is the uncontrolled natural water deficit w i is the amount of the damage control input applied in this context irrigation water to one acre of cropland c w i is the control function of irrigation representing the treatment effect of irrigation on the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 when z z 0 c w i is zero and the controlled water deficit is equal to uncontrolled water deficit it means that water deficit is not treated by irrigation when z z 0 the controlled water deficit is less than uncontrolled water deficit it means that water deficit is partially treated by irrigation when z 0 controlled water deficit is zero it means that water deficit is completely treated by irrigation the first element of a damage control model is the control function c w i which describes how the application of the control input affects the incidence of the damage agent various functional forms are possible for the control function fox and weersink 1995 in the present context however the control function is linear since irrigation water and water from precipitation are treated as perfect substitutes 3 c w i w i when c w i 0 no irrigation is applied and the water deficit is not controlled z z 0 when c w i 0 irrigation is applied to treat water deficit when c w i w i u z 0 irrigation completely treats the uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 the amount of irrigation water in this case w i u is the amount of irrigation water per acre that exactly offsets the water deficit the water deficit decreases at a constant rate with more irrigation water c w i w i 0 the second element of a damage control model is the damage function d representing the effect of the damage agent on output the remaining amount of the damage agent after the damage control input is applied in this case the remaining water deficit after irrigation is applied z reduces yield yield in the absence of the water deficit is y 0 called potential yield potential crop yield y 0 is influenced by other conventional crop production inputs such as technology and fertilizer the yield is potential yield multiplied by a proportionate reduction in yield the proportion is determined by the damage function d z which has the remaining damage agent as its argument in the present context this can be written as 4 y y 0 1 d z where y is yield at a given level of water deficit z y 0 is the potential yield that would be obtained in the absence of a water deficit and d z is the damage function which represents the proportion of the potential yield that is lost as a result of the remaining water deficit while a water deficit may decrease the crop quality we limit our attention to only reductions in yield quantity the damage function d z can be compared to a cumulative probability distribution in the interval of 0 1 fox and weersink 1995 with no water deficit z 0 there is no damage d z 0 and yield will be equal to potential yield y y 0 as the water deficit z becomes positive and increases to the total water needed for potential crop yields w the damage d z becomes positive and increases to 1 then actual yield y decreases to 0 so the first derivative of the damage function with respect to the damage agent is positive d z 0 however the damage function d z may have various curvature properties given the discussion of crop water production function in section 3 the sign of d z z is indeterminate and depends on the crop water production function fig 1 shows a 4 axis graph of the damage control model for irrigation water with three different signs of d z z in fig 1 we see that if the effect of water on crop yields is linear then the damage function is linear d z z 0 if the effect of water on crop yields is concave then the damage function is convex d z z 0 if the effect of water on crop yields is convex then the damage function is concave d z z 0 2 2 the structure of the damage control model to combine the two elements of the damage control model the remaining water deficit z in eq 2 is substituted into the second element eq 4 then the expressions of uncontrolled natural water deficit z 0 in eq 1 and the control function c w i in eq 3 are substituted into an expanded damage control model this results in eq 5 5 y y 0 1 d z y 0 1 d z 0 c w i y 0 1 d w w p w i in eq 5 yield y is a function of potential yield y 0 crop water requirements to obtain the potential yield w precipitation w p irrigation water quantity w i and parameters of the damage function potential crop yield y 0 is influenced by conventional crop production inputs such as technology and fertilizer in addition to water as potential yield y 0 increases due to better technology and more intensive use of non water inputs yield y increases eq 6 shows the first derivative for yield eq 5 with respect to potential yield y y 0 6 y y 0 d y d y 0 1 1 d z 1 d z 0 w h e r e 1 d z 0 eq 6 shows a positive relationship between yield y and potential yield y 0 that is yield y increases as potential yield y 0 increases water required to achieve potential crop yield w is variable across crop types but fixed for a specific type of crop the crop water requirement w here is from the estimation of a bio economic crop yield model of xu 2017 precipitation w p is stochastic with more precipitation yield y increases until the water deficit reduces to zero eq 7 shows the first derivative for yield eq 5 with respect to precipitation y w p 7 y w p d y d w p 0 y 0 0 d d z d z d z d w p y 0 d z 1 y 0 d z 0 w h e r e y 0 0 a n d d z 0 where d z is the derivative of damage function with respect to water deficit z eq 7 shows the positive relationship between yield y and precipitation w p irrigation w i as the damage control input has a positive relationship with yield y because irrigation reduces the water deficit the first derivative of yield eq 5 with respect to irrigation y w i is shown in the following eq 8 8 y w i d y d w i 0 y 0 0 d d z d z d z d w i y 0 d z 1 y 0 d z 0 w h e r e y 0 0 a n d d z 0 eq 8 shows a positive relationship between yield y and irrigation w i different than the more general results of fox and weersink 1995 this result is specific for irrigation water due to precipitation water and irrigation water being assumed to be perfect substitutes in the control function eq 3 eq 9 shows the second derivative for yield with respect to irrigation y w i w i 9 y w i w i d y w i d w i y 0 d d z d z 1 y 0 d z z where y 0 0 and sign of d zz is unknown in eq 9 we see that the sign of y w i w i depends on the sign of d z z as mentioned above the curvature property of the damage function d z z is indeterminate and depends on the crop water production function so the sign of y w i w i is indeterminate as well 3 yield response to irrigation 3 1 previous literature on crop production functions for irrigation the von liebig and the polynomial models are widely used functions to model crop yields in response to water and nutrients holloway and paris 2002 stated that the von liebig model is based on von liebig s law of the minimum von liebig s law of minimum states that the growth of a crop is determined by the availability of the most limiting input the von liebig model assumes a linear crop response to the most limiting input until a plateau is reached and then another input becomes the limiting factor according to heady and dillon 1961 the von liebig model has been used widely by agronomists and agricultural economists for over a century more recent applications include wang and baerenklau 2014 and llewelyn and featherstone 1997 agricultural economists have also used polynomial functions to model crop yield response examples include kloster and whittlesey 1971 hexem and heady 1978 kiani and abbasi 2009 quiroga et al 2011 jalota et al 2007 wang and baerenklau 2014 rickard and fox 1999 lobell et al 2007 tack et al 2012 and roberts et al 2012 huang 1990 and amon armah et al 2015 stated that the polynomial crop production model is widely used due to its simplicity and computational tractability as well as its ability to fit the relevant data well in addition a polynomial can be seen as a second order taylor approximation of a more general function 3 2 irrigation demand with a linear response plateau von liebig model in the linear response plateau von liebig model the yield response to input is linear and yield achieves a plateau when the input exceeds a certain amount we assume two crop production inputs in the discussion that follows one is a damage control input irrigation water w i the other input is a composite input x including labor seed machinery fertilizer and so on eq 10 shows the general crop water von liebig production function 10 y w x min a 0 a 1 w b 0 b 1 x y 0 w w p w i where y w x represents the yield function which depends on the quantities of water and of a composite input w is the total quantity of water for a type of crop per acre including precipitation w p and irrigation water w i x is the quantity of the composite input per acre a 0 and a 1 are the intercept and slope parameters respectively in the crop production function for water and b 0 and b 1 are the intercept and slope parameters respectively in the crop production function for the composite input the total quantity of water w includes precipitation w p and irrigation water w i eq 10 can be rewritten as 11 y w i x m i n a 0 a 1 w p w i b 0 b 1 x y 0 m i n y l a 1 w i b 0 b 1 x y 0 w h e r e y l a 0 a 1 w p where y w i x represents yield as a function of both irrigation water and a composite input y l is the crop yield without irrigation to obtain the potential crop yield the quantities of irrigation water and the composite input should comply with the following rule in eq 12 12 y l a 1 w i u b 0 b 1 x u y 0 a n d w w p w i u where w i u is the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates water deficit and achieves the potential crop yield x u is the quantity of the composite input to achieve the potential crop yield in eq 12 these quantities of irrigation water and the composite input could achieve the potential crop yield any quantities more than those amounts w i u a n d x u cannot increase yield but would increase the quantity and cost of inputs thus the net benefit for a farmer will decrease therefore the quantities of water and the composite input in eq 12 are the maximal quantities that a rational farmer would use if the quantities of irrigation water and the composite input cannot achieve the potential crop yield then the crop yield is determined by the most limiting input only increasing the quantity of the most limiting input would increase the crop yields 3 2 1 linear response plateau for irrigation water in this section we develop a version of the linear response plateau von liebig model in which only irrigation water can vary to present the characteristics of linear response plateau for irrigation water eq 11 is simplified by this assumption to give us 13 y w i m i n y l a 1 w i y 0 when precipitation is less than the water requirements for the potential crop yield w w a water deficit reduces crop yield given eq 4 we derive the damage function in eq 14 14 y y 0 1 d z y y 0 1 d z d z 1 y y 0 yield y in eq 13 and potential yield y 0 in eq 12 are substituted into eq 14 to obtain the following damage function with respect to the water deficit 15 d z 1 y y 0 1 y l a 1 w i y l a 1 w i u y l a 1 w i u y l a 1 w i y l a 1 w i u a 1 w i u w i y l a 1 w i u a 1 z y l a 1 w i u θ z w h e r e θ a 1 y l a 1 w i u a 1 y 0 the first and second derivatives of the damage function with respect to the water deficit are 16 d z θ a 1 y 0 0 a n d d z z 0 so the damage function is linear given the formula of the first and second derivative for yield in terms of irrigation water in eq 8 and eq 9 eq 17 shows the signs of the first and second derivative for yield y in terms of irrigation water w i 17 y w i y 0 d z y 0 a 1 y 0 a 1 0 a n d y w i w i y 0 d z z 0 where the first derivative y w i is positive and the second derivative y w i w i is zero so the effect of irrigation water w i on yield y is positive and linear when the crop needs more water w w based on the curvature property of the yield function the following describes the characteristics under three conditions of yield function in terms of irrigation water 1 w i 0 no irrigation 2 0 w i w i u some irrigation but not the extent of potential yield and 3 w i w i u sufficient water from irrigation to realize potential yield as fig 1 shows when irrigation is not applied w i 0 the water deficit is not controlled z z 0 in this case yield equals the yield without irrigation y l as shown in eq 13 when a crop receives some irrigation water but not to the extent that the potential yield is achieved 0 w i w i u the water deficit is partially controlled z z 0 in this case the yield is higher than the yield without irrigation y y l and depends on irrigation water as shown in eq 18 according to eq 13 18 y y l a 1 w i when a crop receives sufficient water from irrigation w i w i u to eliminate the water deficit z 0 the yield equals the potential yield y y 0 in this case irrigation water quantity reaches the maximum level w i u which is the difference between sufficient water quantity that croplands need w and precipitation w p given eq 12 19 w i u w w p z 0 0 where w i u is the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates water deficit 3 2 2 linear response plateau for irrigation water and composite input this section discusses the joint effect of irrigation water and the composite input on crop yield graphically based on eq 11 if the intercept coefficient for irrigation water is larger than that for the composite input b 0 y l then the composite input is limiting input and only increasing the amount of the composite input would increase crop yields in the beginning in contrast if the intercept coefficient for irrigation water is less than that for composite input b 0 y l then the irrigation water is limiting input and only increasing the amount of irrigation water would increase crop yields in the beginning the discussion of the joint effect is separated into two cases a the case of b 0 y l composite input is the limiting factor fig 2 and b the case of b 0 y l irrigation water is the limiting factor fig 3 figs 2 and 3 illustrate the joint effect of irrigation water and composite input on crop yield the horizontal axes represent quantities of irrigation water w i composite input x and the vertical axis represents yield y respectively fig 2 shows how irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield when b 0 y l in this case only increasing the composite input could increase crop yield initially irrigation water starts to be used when the composite input reaches x i r r x x i r r here x i r r is the quantity of the composite input that starts to jointly affect crop yield with irrigation water then irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield until yield reaches the potential yield y y 0 w i w i u a n d x x u fig 3 shows how irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield when b 0 y l in this case irrigation water is the limiting input and the composite input starts to be used when the irrigation water reaches w i c o m w i w i c o m here w i c o m is the quantity of irrigation water that starts to jointly affect crop yield with the composite input then irrigation water and the composite input jointly affect crop yield until yield reaches the potential yield y y 0 w i w i u a n d x x u 3 3 irrigation demand with the quadratic functional form eq 20 shows the general quadratic functional form for a two input yield function 20 y w x β 0 β 1 w β 2 w 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 w w p w i a s s u m e β 0 0 β 1 a n d β 3 0 β 2 a n d β 4 0 where y w x represents the yield as a function of both total available water w and the quantity of the composite input x and β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are parameters as the total available water includes water from precipitation and irrigation eq 20 could be rewritten as 21 y w i x β 0 β 1 w p w i β 2 w p w i 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 β 0 β 1 w p β 1 w i β 2 w p 2 β 2 w i 2 2 β 2 w p w

input γ 0 and γ 1 are the parameters in the quadratic functional form for irrigation water and composite input the expressions of γ 0 and γ 1 are presented in eq 21 thus the potential yield could be written as 22 y 0 γ 0 γ 1 w i u β 2 w i u 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 where w i u represents the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit for the quadratic functional form the maximum quantity of irrigation water w i u can be derived as 23 f o c d y d w i γ 1 2 β 2 w i u 0 w i u γ 1 2 β 2 the values of w i u for each crop could be determined by estimating the crop yield model in eq 20 with actual data as shown in xu 2017 given the expression for the damage function in eq 14 the damage function for water deficit in the quadratic functional form is derived by substituting eq 21 and eq 22 into the damage function in eq 14 to obtain eq 24 24 d z 1 y y 0 1 γ 0 γ 1 w i β 2 w i 2 β 3 x β 4 x 2 y 0 γ 1 w i u w i β 2 w i u 2 w i 2 y 0 γ 1 z β 2 w i u 2 w i u z 2 y 0 γ 1 z β 2 z 2 2 β 2 w i u z y 0 β 2 y 0 z 2 γ 1 2 β 2 w i u y 0 z given the first derivative of yield with respect to the irrigation water in eq 23 the damage function can be simplified as 25 d z β 2 y 0 z 2 0 y 0 z β 2 y 0 z 2 eq 26 shows the first and second derivatives of the damage function d z in eq 25 with respect to water deficit z 26 d z 2 β 2 y 0 z 0 a n d d z z 2 β 2 y 0 0 w h e r e β 2 0 y 0 0 a n d z 0 where the first and second derivatives d z and d z z are both positive as the parameter β 2 is assumed negative in eq 20 the parameter β 2 is negative because there are diminishing returns from applying more irrigation water in the yield function eq 20 with more irrigation water marginal yield is positive but decreasing and all else constant so the damage function for a quadratic functional form is convex eq 27 shows the signs of the first and second derivatives for yield y in terms of irrigation water w i 27 y w i y 0 d z y 0 2 β 2 y 0 z 2 β 2 z 0 a n d y w i w i y 0 d z z y 0 2 β 2 y 0 2 β 2 0 where the first derivative y w i is positive and the second derivative y w i w i is negative as the parameter β 2 is assumed negative in eq 20 so the effect of irrigation water w i on yield y is concave in water deficit condition w w yield increases at a decreasing rate as more irrigation water is applied based on the curvature property of the yield function there are three situations with respect to the yield function in terms of irrigation water 1 w i 0 no irrigation 2 0 w i w i u some irrigation but not the extent of potential yield and 3 w i w i u sufficient water from irrigation to realize potential yield when irrigation is not applied w i 0 the water deficit is not controlled z z 0 in this case the yield equals the yield without irrigation y

no water deficit damage z 0 so yield equals the potential yield y y 0 in this case irrigation water quantity reaches the maximum level w i u as shown in eq 23 3 4 summary the agricultural irrigation literature makes frequent references to efficiency of water use economists invoke two definitions of efficiency that are relevant in this context technical efficiency and economic or allocative efficiency technical efficiency refers to a situation where the maximum output is obtained from a given quantity of inputs the technically efficient sets of input bundles are the production frontier that is the surface of the 3d production curve in figs 2 and 3 for von liebig model and the concave production curve in fig 1 for quadratic functional form economic efficiency refers to the situation where the marginal benefit of using a unit of an input is equal to the marginal cost of using that input a condition consistent with maximizing profit economic efficiency considers the price of output and the costs of inputs an economically efficient input bundle must be in the set of technically efficient production possibilities we now proceed to derive the profit maximizing conditions for input use for these two functional forms 4 profit maximization profit refers to the difference between total revenue and the cost of composite input plus the cost of irrigation water for the two input cases presented earlier eq 30 shows the maximization problem 30 m a x π p y t v c where π is profit per acre per year p is the price of the crop per unit of output t v c is the total variable cost of irrigation and the composite input eq 31 shows the total variable cost with respect to irrigation and the composite input per year 31 t v c x c x w i c p c a where c x is the price of the composite input c p is the cost of pumping irrigation water per unit c a is the additional cost if any of using irrigation water per unit this second irrigation water cost could arise as a marginal user cost an externality cost 2 2 the meaning of externality cost various depending on the water source for example if the irrigation water comes from groundwater then the externality cost refers to the reduction of the water table of neighbor farms if the irrigation water comes from surface water then it refers to the reduction in the availablility of water for downstream users or as a user fee for water the first term on the right side represents the cost of composite input and the second term represents the operation cost of irrigation 4 1 profit maximization in linear response plateau von liebig model 4 1 1 profit maximization in linear response plateau von liebig model for irrigation water and composite input the profit equation for the linear response plateau von liebig model for irrigation water and the composite input is 32 m a x π p min y l a 1 w i b 0 b 1 x y 0 x c x w i c p c a the first order condition with respect to irrigation water is 33 f o c π w i π w i p y w i c p c a 0 where π w i is the first derivative of profit with respect to irrigation water given the first order condition there are three mutually exclusive solutions two corner solutions and one interior solution for an interior solution the first order condition in eq 33 should be satisfied however since the production function in terms of irrigation is linear there are two corner solutions one corner solution would completely eliminate the water deficit we call this the upper corner solution another corner solution does not control water deficit at all we call this the lower corner solution table 1 shows the interior and corner solutions in the linear response plateau von liebig model it shows the quantity of irrigation water w i m by comparing the ratio of the marginal cost of irrigation to the crop price c p c a p with the slope of production function a 1 when the first order condition eq 33 is satisfied any value between zero and w i u could be the irrigation water quantity for profit maximization however if the price ratio c p c a p is larger than the rate of yield increase by adding irrigation water a 1 then it means that the marginal profit of adding one more unit of irrigation water is less than the marginal cost so rational farmers won t use irrigation w i m 0 if the price ratio c p c a p is less than the rate of yield increase by adding irrigation water a 1 then it means that the marginal profit of adding one more unit of irrigation water is more than the marginal cost so irrigation water will be used as much as possible thus reaching the maximum quantity w i m w i u a similar analysis is used with respect to the composite input table 2 shows the interior and corner solutions for the composite input x m in the linear response plateau von liebig model by comparing the ratio of the marginal cost of composite input to the crop price c x p and the rate of yield increase by adding composite input b 1 the profit maximizing combination of input bundles requires that both first order necessary and second order sufficiency conditions be satisfied for the von liebig model the first order condition for profit maximization is met but it is not the sufficient one as the von liebig model contains a minimum operator to achieve the profit maximization the first two elements inside the minimum operator should be equal as eq 34 34 y l a 1 w i b 0 b 1 x where w i is the optimal quantity of irrigation water and x is the optimal quantity of the composite input if an input bundle does not comply with the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 then one of the inputs is the limiting factor and the other input is overused the overuse of the second input won t change the crop yield and revenue but will increase the cost of inputs thus the profit of a farmer will decrease therefore all of the optimal input bundles must comply with the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 the bold dashed line in figs 2 and 3 shows all of the input bundles that comply with the fixed proportion rule we call them potential optimal input bundles the bold dashed line in fig 2 shows the potential optimal input bundles for irrigation water and composite input when b 0 y l initially the composite input is the limiting input so additional irrigation water will not increase crop yield in this segment the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points 0 0 0 to 0 x i r r y l in the second segment the ratio of irrigation water to the composite input must follow the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 to minimize the cost of input so the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points 0 x i r r y l to w i u x u y 0 in fig 2 the analysis is similar when b 0 y l the bold dashed line in fig 3 shows the potential optimal input bundles of irrigation water and the composite input when b 0 y l initially irrigation water is the limiting input so the composite input won t be used in this segment the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points 0 0 0 to w i c o m 0 b 0 in the second segment the ratio of irrigation water to the composite input must follow the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 to minimize the cost of input so the potential optimal input bundles must lie on the bold dashed line from points w i c o m 0 b 0 to w i u x u y 0 by considering the results in tables 1 and 2 as well as the potential optimal input bundles above table 3 shows the optimal input bundles and their yields for the linear response plateau von liebig model in table 3 the second and third columns show the relationship conditions from tables 1 and 2 the fourth and fifth columns present the corresponding profit maximization input quantity to each relationship condition from tables 1 and 2 the sixth column presents the optimal quantity of input bundles corresponding to the combined relationship conditions in addition the optimal input bundle complies with the rule in eq 34 the last column presents the yield with optimal input bundles y note that all these optimal bundles lie on the bold dashed lines in figs 2 and 3 it means that the profit maximization solutions for irrigation water w i must be less than or equal to the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit w i u in table 3 case 1 with the interior solutions for two inputs is the only case with multiple optimal input bundles as the price ratio equal to the rate of yield increases by adding one more unit of input for both irrigation water and composite input all of the input bundles satisfy the rule in eq 34 are the solutions in case 1 this is an unusual case and unlikely to ever happen even if this case happens it will not last long as price varies in cases 6 and 8 one input has a lower corner solution and the other input has an upper corner solution however the upper corner solution of the second input cannot be achieved as the lower corner solution of the first input limits the use of second input for example in case 6 irrigation water has a lower corner solution and the composite input has an upper corner solution but the composite input cannot achieve the upper corner solution because no use of irrigation water limits the use of composite input in this case the optimal quantity of the composite input should comply with the fixed proportion rule in eq 34 the amount should be as much as possible lies on the bold dashed line in figs 2 and 3 when irrigation water is zero that is x i r r in fig 2 or zero in fig 3 depends on the value of parameters otherwise the profit from crop production reduces because the cost of using more irrigation water is higher than the benefit in cases 2 and 4 one input has a lower corner solution and the other input has an interior solution for the same reason in cases 6 and 8 the optimal input bundles in cases 2 and 4 have low quantity as well thus the yields in these four cases are low compared to other cases such as cases 3 7 and 9 in table 3 cases 3 7 and 9 use the maximum amounts of irrigation water and the composite input thereby obtaining higher yield than other cases case 5 is the only case that does not use any input because the price ratio is larger than the rate of yield increases by adding input for both irrigation water and composite input thus using either irrigation water or the composite input will cost more than the benefit of increasing yields in table 3 some optimal bundles and yields are based on the value of b 0 and y l recall that y l is a 0 a 1 w p in eq 11 so some optimal input bundles and related yield depend on the value of parameters in the production function it is reasonable to think that yield will be zero when no water is available for a crop similarly it is reasonable to think that yield will be zero when no composite input is applied to crop production recall that the composite input includes seeds labor fertilizer machinery and all other inputs except for irrigation water so if there is no seed labor and machinery used for crop production then farmers gain nothing so i further assume that both a 0 and b 0 are zero a 0 0 a n d b 0 0 as a result eq 35 shows that y l must be no less than b 0 35 y l 0 a 1 w p 0 b 0 according to this additional assumption on parameters of the production functions the optimal input bundles in table 3 can be simplified the simplified results are shown in table 4 which shows the optimal input bundles when y l b 0 compared with the results in table 3 the results for cases 2 4 6 and 8 change in cases 2 and 8 the profit maximization solution does not use any inputs due to the high price ratio for composite input c x p as a result the yield is zero in cases 4 and 6 the profit maximization solution is no irrigation water but limited quantity of composite input to reach the yield y l 4 2 profit maximization in the quadratic functional form eq 36 is the profit equation for irrigation water and the composite input for the quadratic functional form 36 m a x π p y l γ 1 w i β 2 w i 2 x c x w i c p c a then the first order condition of profit with respect to irrigation water is 37 f o c π w i π w i p y w i c p c a 0 according to eq 37 interior solutions exist when the price ratio c p c a p is less than the slope of the quadratic production function with respect to irrigation water with no irrigation y w i 0 the interior solutions must satisfy the condition that the price ratio c p c a p is equal to the slope of the quadratic production function with respect to irrigation water y w i 38 y w i c p c a p w h e n c p c a p 0 y w i 0 where y w i is the slope of quadratic production function at the profit maximizing quantity of irrigation water y w i 0 is the slope of the quadratic production function when irrigation water is zero given the expression of y w i and z in eq 27 and eq 5 eq 38 could be expanded to obtain the optimal quantity of irrigation water 39 2 β 2 w w p w i c p c a p w w p w i c p c a 2 β 2 p w i w w p c p c a 2 β 2 p w i u c p c a 2 β 2 p if the price ratio c p c a p is higher than the slope of the quadratic production function when irrigation water is zero y w i 0 then the profit maximization solution is to use no irrigation water because the marginal cost of irrigation is higher than the marginal revenue eq 40 shows the corner solution 40 w i 0 w h e n c p c a p y w i 0 table 5 summarizes the optimal quantity of irrigation water for quadratic model by comparing the price ratio c p c a p and the slope of the quadratic production function when irrigation water is zero y w i 0 it shows both the interior and corner solutions from eq 39 and eq 40 due to the decreasing return from applying more irrigation water i e β 2 0 and positive pumping cost i e c p 0 in both solutions the profit maximization solution w i derived by economic method is less than the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit w i u 4 3 summary a water requirements approach sometimes called an engineering method by economists requires the quantity of irrigation water that completely eliminates the water deficit and achieves the potential crop yield y 0 that is w i u however in tables 3 and 5 the results from our economic approach indicate that the optimal quantity of irrigation water is not always the maximum amount w i u for the von liebig model the results are discrete i e corner solution when the price ratio for either input is larger than the rate of yield increase by adding one unit of this input the optimal quantity of irrigation water could be a value less than w i u for the quadratic functional form the results are generally interior solutions depending on the price ratio when the price ratio for irrigation water is larger than zero the optimal quantity of irrigation water could be a value less than w i u fig 4 takes the quadratic functional form as an example the optimal quantity of irrigation water by economic approach not only reduce the demand for irrigation water w i w i u but also maximizes the profit of farmers π π u therefore compared with the engineering method our economic approach has the potential to increase net benefits to farmers and to encourage more efficient water use as mentioned in section 1 the damage control model has been used previously in the pest management literature that literature has examined two concepts called economic thresholds the fixed treatment economic threshold is used to calculate the minimum pest incidence that justifies from an economic point of view the application of a pest control input at a pre determined rate sometimes called the label rate the second economic threshold concept in the pest management literature is the optimal treatment economic threshold this applies when the level of pest control effort can be varied and the control input can be applied at a level that maximizes profit in the context of irrigation there is not general requirement to fix the quantity of the control input that is irrigation water so the fixed treatment economic threshold is generally not relevant our optimal irrigation water quantities constitute optimal treatment economic thresholds section 4 derived the profit maximization quantity of irrigation water for von liebig and quadratic production functions this analysis did not distinguish fixed cost from variable costs implicitly our marginal conditions have been based on variable costs only in historically rain fed agriculture however part of the farmer s decision has to do with incurring fixed costs for machinery and irrigation related infrastructure in section 5 we investigate the net benefit from irrigation to farmers when fixed costs are taken into account 5 consideration of fixed costs of irrigation irrigation involves fixed costs which is the capital cost of equipment and installation if the additional revenue from using irrigation is higher than the variable costs of irrigation it still might be uneconomic for farmers to irrigate if the additional net revenue is not sufficient to cover these fixed costs in present value terms the annual net benefit from irrigation in a year in which a water deficit occurs can be expressed as eq 41 41 δ π t π t i π t n i where the subscript t refers to the year the superscript i refers to irrigation the superscript n i refers to no irrigation δ π t is the net benefit from irrigation in year t π t i is the profit with irrigation in year t π t n i is the profit without irrigation in year t the profit from irrigation in year t π t i can be expressed as 42 π t i p y x c x w i c p c a where the right hand side of eq 42 means the total revenue of using irrigation with optimal input bundles discussed in section 4 minus the cost of composite input in the condition of using irrigation and the operation cost of irrigation with optimal input bundles the profit without irrigation in year t π t n i can be expressed as 43 π t n i p y n i x n i c x where y n i is the yield using optimal quantity of the composite input in the condition of no irrigation x n i is the optimal quantity of the composite input without using irrigation the fixed cost of irrigation is the capital cost of equipment and installation symbolized as f c t is the expected useful lifetime of the irrigation equipment the cumulative benefit from irrigation during the expected life of the irrigation system is defined as the sum of the present values of the benefit from irrigation for each year during the expected life period the present value is the current discounted value of the benefit from irrigation in future assuming a specific rate of time preference in a year with a water deficit the benefit from irrigation is calculated as eq 41 δ π t π t i π t n i in the year without a water deficit the benefit from irrigation is zero because irrigation won t be used δ π t 0 eq 44 shows the present value of the net benefit from irrigation during the expected life of the irrigation system 44 p v δ π t 1 t δ π t 1 i t where p v δ π is the present value of the net benefit from irrigation during the expected life of the irrigation system and i is the rate of time preference used to discount future benefits if the present value of the net benefit p v δ π is larger than the fixed cost f c then irrigation would be an attractive investment to the farmer otherwise the farmer would not install the irrigation system it would be good to acknowledge that this simple present value calculation is not the whole story the stream of benefits is stochastic and farmers may exhibit risk aversion so a more complete analysis would use a stochastic present value approach with farmer risk preferences or a risk rated present value in future study 6 conclusion this paper develops a theoretical model of the derived demand for irrigation water for field crops for historically rain fed agriculture the model treats irrigation water as a damage control input and takes into account the water from precipitation potential crop yield input prices crop price and farmers profit further development of the framework used a von liebig model and a quadratic functional form to study the optimality conditions for the application of irrigation water finally the present value of net benefit from irrigation and the fixed cost of an irrigation system are compared to determine the economic attractiveness of irrigation this paper contributes by filling two gaps in the literature first it explores the application of irrigation water in the damage control model second economic factors are included in the determination of the demand for irrigation water by taking into account the water from precipitation potential crop yield input prices and crop price which has not been previously done in literature we find that this study is a special case of the damage control model both the damage agent and control agent are assumed to be perfect substitutes so the control function is linear second this study shows that the application of irrigation in the damage control model has a different feature of economic threshold than pest management the damage control input approach in pest management generally is applied as a fixed treatment economic threshold but the irrigation in crop production generally results in an optimal treatment economic threshold third compared with a water requirements approach sometimes called an engineering method by economists our economic approach has the potential to increase net benefits to farmers and to encourage more efficient water use fourth we find that the optimal demand for irrigation water in the von liebig model is discrete i e corner solution while the quadratic functional form generally produces interior solutions depending on the price ratio in addition our control variable is the quantity of water over a full growing season for some crops there are critical production periods during the growing season where adequate water availability is more important for yield empirical and practical application of our model in these circumstances would require partitioning the growing season into different stages and the quantity of water would also need to be modeled for each stage finally we employ a non stochastic present value calculation in our analysis of fixed costs however the stream of benefits from irrigation is stochastic and farmers may exhibit risk aversion therefore in a future study a more complete analysis could use a stochastic present value approach with farmer risk preferences or a risk rated present value finally our theoretical model could be applied to other research topics including the adaption of water use in crop production to climate
