24115,the effects of horizontal discretization on linear baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are investigated by analyzing the behavior of the hydrostatic eady problem in ocean models on the b and c grids on the c grid a spurious baroclinic instability appears at small wavelengths this instability does not disappear as the grid scale decreases instead it simply moves to smaller horizontal scales the peak growth rate of the spurious instability is independent of the grid scale as the latter decreases it is equal to c f ri where ri is the balanced richardson number f is the coriolis parameter and c is a nondimensional constant that depends on the richardson number as the richardson number increases c increases towards an upper bound of approximately 1 2 for large richardson numbers the spurious instability is faster than the eady instability to suppress the spurious instability it is recommended to use fourth order centered tracer advection along with biharmonic viscosity and diffusion with coefficients δ x 4 f 32 ri or larger where δx is the grid scale on the b grid the growth rates of baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are too small and converge upwards towards the correct values as the grid scale decreases no spurious instabilities are observed in b grid models at eddy permitting resolution the reduced growth rate of baroclinic instability may contribute to partially resolved eddies being too weak on the c grid the growth rate of symmetric instability is better larger than on the b grid and converges upwards towards the correct value as the grid scale decreases keywords baroclinic instability symmetric instability discretization 1 introduction the study of the effects of discretization on free wave propagation in models of geophysical fluids has a long history dating at least to the work of charney et al 1950 in particular the propagation of rossby and inertia gravity waves in the various staggered arakawa grids arakawa and lamb 1977 has received a great deal of attention over the years many results are reviewed in haidvogel and beckmann 1999 including the seminal work of wajsowicz 1986 and dukowicz 1995 on the b grid the horizontal components of velocity are staggered with respect to the tracers but not with respect to each other on the c grid they are staggered with respect to each other and with respect to the tracers intuition suggests and the aforementioned studies confirm that the b grid is more suited to describing large scale geostrophic dynamics like rossby waves than the c grid and the b grid has been popular in models used to simulate the global ocean the b grid is used by the parallel ocean program pop which is the ocean model component of both the community climate system models ccsm gent et al 2011 and the current version of the community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 and by the modular ocean model mom5 which is the ocean component of the cm2 5 model delworth et al 2012 the next version of mom will use the c grid models used to simulate smaller scale dynamics e g in regional simulations and process studies often use the c grid examples include the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 the ocean component of the nucleus for european modeling of the ocean nemo opa madec 2008 also uses the c grid which may become more popular for global models as resolution increases the distinction between these model grid types and their relative advantages and disadvantages is important because the steady increase in computational capacity at many climate modeling centers has ushered in a transitional period for global ocean models previous ipcc class models have been limited to horizontal resolutions 1 which is insufficient to resolve oceanic mesoscale eddies increasing resolution from the 1 benchmark means that mesoscale eddies will be resolved naturally across some of the global ocean promising increased realism of the global circulation e g maltrud and mcclean 2005 kirtman et al 2012 hallberg 2013 graham 2014 treguier et al 2014 and improved coupling to other components of the climate system e g delworth et al 2012 frenger et al 2013 progression into this eddy permitting regime introduces a suite of new challenges among which is the issue of how the structure of the model grid affects the growth and behavior of the mesoscale eddies themselves these eddies are geostrophically balanced which suggests that they might be more accurately represented on a b grid but they are not linear rossby waves so the above referenced free wave analyses do not directly apply direct analysis of the effects of numerical discretization on nonlinear mesoscale eddy dynamics is not straightforward and a different approach linear yet hopefully relevant to mesoscale eddy dynamics is taken here mesoscale eddies are believed to sustain their energy primarily by extracting available potential energy from the large scale flow e g ferrari and wunsch 2009 and a canonical linear model for this process is baroclinic instability in this paper we study the effects of discretization on the properties of linear baroclinic instability in the eady problem we use hydrostatic dynamics as typically used by global ocean models and consider commonly used discretizations on the b and c grids since the symmetric instability arises in the eady problem in addition to the baroclinic instability the behavior of symmetric instability under discretization is also investigated the paper is organized as follows the hydrostatic ocean primitive equations the spatial grids and the discretizations of interest are described in section 2 linear perturbation equations for the eady problem under the different discretizations are derived in section 3 growth rates of symmetric and baroclinic instabilities for the discretized models are presented in section 4 section 4 4 investigates the causes of and remedies for the spurious baroclinic instability on the c grid and section 4 5 verifies the linear analysis by comparison to direct simulations of the nonlinear equations some conclusions are discussed in section 5 2 preliminaries notation 2 1 governing partial differential equations the inviscid hydrostatic primitive equations on an f plane are 1 t u u u f 0 v x p 2 t v u v f 0 u y p 3 t b u b 0 4 u 0 5 z p b the velocity is u u v w f 0 is the coriolis parameter and b is the buoyancy the pressure p has been rescaled by a constant reference density ρ 0 and the boussinesq approximation has been used the depth independent barotropic component of pressure is not constrained by eq 5 we will here use a rigid lid approximation to constrain the barotropic pressure to wit the depth average of eq 4 is x u y v 0 where u and v are the depth averaged components of u and v and the vertical velocity w has been set to zero at both boundaries the depth averages of eqs 1 and 2 are t u h 1 0 h u u d z f 0 v x ϕ t v h 1 0 h u v d z f 0 u y ϕ where h is the depth and ϕ is the barotropic pressure taking the divergence of these equations leads to an elliptic equation for the barotropic pressure 6 h 2 ϕ f 0 x v y u h 1 h 0 h u u d z where h x y the above derivation applies at the level of the partial differential equations it bears noting that typical discrete ocean models allow for the existence of a divergent barotropic mode e g in the initial condition in the context of a discrete ocean model the above condition on the barotropic pressure does not prevent a divergent barotropic mode from existing it simply prevents it from evolving 2 2 notation for discretized equations we wish to investigate the dynamics on a regular cartesian grid with grid sizes δx δy and δ z h n z where nz is the number of vertical levels the velocity pressure and buoyancy will be tracked at points on the grid vectors of their values on the grid will be denoted u v w p and b the vectors will be triply indexed e g u i j k with indices i j and k denoting locations in the x y and z directions respectively indices are often truncated to save space e g u i 1 is a shorthand for u i 1 j k to isolate the effects of horizontal discretization the vertical discretization will be kept uniform with large nz the vertical discretization uses the lorenz grid common to the ocean models referenced in the introduction lorenz 1960 all variables except the vertical velocity are associated with the vertical grid points k 1 2 δ z k 1 n z the vertical velocity is associated with the vertical grid points kδz k 0 n z variables on the b grid occur in one of two sets of horizontal locations b i j p i j ϕ i j and w i j are located at x y δ x i δ y j while u i j and v i j are located at x y δ x i 1 2 δ y j 1 2 variables on the c grid occur in one of three sets of horizontal locations the buoyancy vertical velocity and tracer are all located at x y δ x i δ y j same as the b grid while u i j is located at x y δ x i 1 2 δ y j and v i j is located at x y δ x i δ y j 1 2 on both grids the vertical velocity is staggered with respect to the other variables the convention adopted here is to place w k at z k δ z and all the other variables at z k 1 2 δ z the methods used to discretize the governing equations can be completely described in terms of a few fundamental average and difference operators these operators are defined below according to their action 7 a x u i u i 1 u i 2 δ x u i u i 1 u i δ x 8 a y u j u j 1 u j 2 δ y u j u j 1 u j δ y 9 a z u k u k 1 u k 2 δ z u k u k 1 u k δ k it can be easily verified that all of these operators commute with one another and the convention adopted here will be to list averages before differences and plus before minus let the reader be advised that these operators are not centered the usual centered differences can be recovered by the combination of a forward difference δ and a backward average a or a backward difference and a forward average 2 3 discrete formulation on the b grid the discrete momentum equations on the b grid have the form 10 d u d t a u b f 0 v a y δ x p ϕ 11 d v d t a v b f 0 u a x δ y p ϕ where a u b and a v b are discretizations of advection of zonal and meridional momentum respectively and p and ϕ are the baroclinic and barotropic pressures respectively the dependent variables u and v in eqs 10 and 11 are vectors of the values of u and v on the computational grid as a result they are systems of ordinary rather than partial differential equations the second order energy conserving discretization of momentum advection due to bryan 1969 is somewhat complicated to save space define the following averaged velocity components 12 u a x a y a y u 13 v a x a x a y v 14 w a x a y w with this notation the zonal momentum advection takes the form 15 a u b δ x u a x u δ y v a y u δ z w a z u the meridional momentum advection has the same form but with v replacing u the standard second order discretization of the tracer advection on the b grid takes the form 16 δ x a y u a x b δ y a x v a y b δ z w a z b the discrete continuity equation is obtained by applying the tracer advection to a constant buoyancy profile b 1 17 a y δ x u a x δ y u δ z w 0 the discrete hydrostatic balance is simply 18 δ z p a z b this form of discrete hydrostatic balance has been shown to preserve the total kinetic plus potential energy by bryan 1969 the equation for discrete barotropic pressure is obtained by a derivation analogous to the derivation for the continuous equations it is unwieldy and not presented here a derivation for the much simpler case of a normal mode perturbation is in appendix a 2 4 discrete formulation on the c grid flux form the discrete momentum equations on the c grid have the form 19 d u d t a u c f 0 a x a y v δ x p ϕ 20 d v d t a v c f 0 a x a y u δ y p ϕ where a u c and a v c are discretizations of zonal and meridional momentum advection respectively note that compared to the b grid the coriolis terms are now averaged but the pressure gradient is not the b grid nevertheless requires fewer averaging operators than the c grid which suggests that the b grid will more accurately represent geostrophic flows at large scales that balance the coriolis acceleration and the pressure gradient the second order energy conserving flux form discretization of momentum advection on the c grid takes the form 21 a u c δ x a x u 2 2 δ y a x v a y u δ z a x w a z u and the meridional momentum advection takes the form 22 a v c δ x a y u a x v δ y a y v 2 2 δ z a y w a z v the standard second order discretization of the tracer advection on the c grid takes the form 23 δ x u a x b δ y v a y b δ z w a z b the discrete continuity equation is again obtained by applying the tracer advection to a constant buoyancy profile b 1 24 δ x u δ y v δ z w 0 the discrete hydrostatic balance is the same as eq 18 and a barotropic pressure equation for a normal mode perturbation is derived in appendix a 2 5 discrete formulation on the c grid vector invariant the horizontal advection of momentum in the primitive equations can be written in vector invariant form as 25 u x u v y u 1 2 x u 2 v 2 ζ v 26 u x v v y v 1 2 y u 2 v 2 ζ u where ζ x v y u is the vertical component of relative vorticity we consider two discretizations using this form an enstrophy conserving form ens from sadourny 1975 and an energy and enstrophy conserving form called een see e g arakawa and lamb 1981 madec 2008 and le sommer et al 2009 the ens discretization of eqs 25 and 26 takes the form 27 1 2 x u 2 v 2 ζ v 1 2 δ x a x u 2 a y v 2 a y δ x v δ y u a x a y v 28 1 2 y u 2 v 2 ζ u 1 2 δ y a x u 2 a y v 2 a x δ x v δ y u a x a y u the een form is significantly more complicated the gradient of horizontal kinetic energy remains the same but the product of relative vorticity and velocity takes the form 29 ζ v 1 12 ω i j ω i j 1 ω i 1 j v i j ω i j ω i j 1 ω i 1 j 1 v i j 1 ω i j ω i j 1 ω i 1 j v i 1 j ω i j ω i j 1 ω i 1 j 1 v i 1 j 1 30 ζ u 1 12 ω i j ω i 1 j ω i j 1 u i j ω i j ω i 1 j ω i 1 j 1 u i 1 j ω i j ω i 1 j ω i j 1 u i j 1 ω i j ω i 1 j ω i 1 j 1 u i 1 j 1 where ω i j δ x v δ x u 3 linear perturbation equations the steady configuration 31 u z m 2 z h 2 f 0 v w 0 b n 2 z m 2 y is an exact solution of the governing eqs 1 6 the brunt väisälä frequency is n and the slope of the isopycnals is m 2 n 2 the vertical shear is m 2 f 0 the linear stability of this equilibrium to infinitesimal perturbations has been considered by a legion of authors beginning with eady 1949 and with notable contributions in the hydrostatic non geostrophic case by stone 1966 1970 the goal here is to study linear stability of the discretized equations it is easy to verify that the following discrete configuration is also an equilibrium of the discretized equations since a second order discretization applied to a linear function is exact 32 u i j k m 2 δ z f 0 k n z 1 2 33 b i j k n 2 δ z k m 2 j δ y 34 v i j k 0 it is straightforward to derive linear perturbation equations about this equilibrium on the b grid these have the following form 35 d u d t u a x δ x u m 2 a x a y a z f 0 w f 0 v a y δ x p ϕ 36 d v d t u a x δ x v f 0 u a x δ y p ϕ 37 d b d t u a x δ x b n 2 a z w m 2 a x a y v 0 the system is completed by the discrete incompressibility condition on the b grid eq 17 and the discrete hydrostatic balance eq 18 note that the above equations are to be interpreted as holding at index i j k the discrete system governing linear perturbations on the c grid with the flux form and vector invariant ens forms of the momentum equations has the form 38 d u d t u a x δ x u m 2 a x a z f 0 w f 0 a x a y v δ x p ϕ 39 d v d t u a x δ x v f 0 a x a y u δ y p ϕ 40 d b d t u a x δ x b n 2 a z w m 2 a y v 0 the system is completed by the discrete incompressibility condition on the c grid eq 24 and by the discrete hydrostatic balance eq 18 the linear perturbation equations for with the een vector invariant discretization madec 2008 le sommer et al 2009 only differ in the meridional momentum equation which takes the following form 41 d v d t u 1 3 1 2 a y a y a x δ x v f 0 a x a y u u δ y 2 6 δ y 2 δ y u δ y p ϕ the final term on the left hand side is purely dispersive and converges towards zero as the grid is refined for perturbations on the baroclinic axis i e with no variation in the meridional direction the linear perturbation equation is the same as in the ens and flux form cases since a y 1 and δ y 0 for perturbations on the symmetric axis i e with no variation in the zonal direction the term a x δ x v 0 but the final term dispersive term on the left hand side remains for this reason the een vector invariant form is only considered separately from the other c grid discretizations in the examination of symmetric instability on both grids as in the continuous problem the background state does not vary in the horizontal thus as in the continuous problem the linear perturbation equations can be resolved into normal modes that are simply fourier modes solutions are therefore sought in the form 42 u u e i k x δ x i k y δ y j complex conjugate with similar representations of the other variables note the notational distinction between 1 i and the index i the coefficient vector u is now a singly indexed vector with index k varying across the depth by considering the domain to be of infinite horizontal extent all wavenumbers up to the nyquist are admissible on the grid 43 k x k y π δ x π δ x π δ y π δ y the horizontal averaging and difference operators admit these discrete fourier modes as eigenvectors with the following eigenvalues 44 a x e i k x δ x 1 2 δ x e i k x δ x 1 δ x 45 a y e i k y δ y 1 2 δ y e i k y δ y 1 δ y the equations governing the linear evolution of a normal mode constitute a system of differential algebraic equations differential equations for u v and b and algebraic equations for w p and ϕ it is convenient to eliminate the three diagnostic variables to obtain a system of linear differential equations for the three prognostic variables the details of this elimination can be found in appendix a the result in both cases is a system of linear differential equations i e 46 d d t u v b l u v b where the matrix l takes different forms on the b and c grids the matrix l is 3nz 3nz and depends on the wavenumbers kx ky the grid scales δx δy and δz and the external parameters h f 0 n 2 and m 2 the linear stability analysis consists of computing the eigenvalue with the largest real part if the real part is positive then the system is linearly unstable 4 discrete growth rates the deformation radius is nh f 0 rather than non dimensionalize the system we fix h 4000 m n 10 3 s 1 and f 0 10 4 s 1 for a deformation radius of 40 km after nondimensionalization e g stone 1966 the linear stability problem depends only on the richardson number so results for other parameter values can be obtained by rescaling the grid spacing will always be isotropic δ x δ y unless noted otherwise n z 128 results of the linear stability analysis of the eady problem are usually organized using the richardson number which for the eady problem is ri n 2 f 0 2 m 4 summarizing the results of stone 1966 1970 for ri 1 the peak instability occurs on the baroclinic axis k y 0 at a wavenumber kx somewhat larger than the deformation wavenumber f 0 nh ri 1 is the quasigeostrophic regime investigated by eady 1949 and the instability is baroclinic in this regime the peak growth rate scales approximately as 0 31m 2 n for ri 1 a new instability occurs with maximum growth rate on the symmetric axis k x 0 for ri 0 95 this new symmetric instability grows faster than the baroclinic instability the symmetric instability in turn gives way to a kelvin helmholtz instability at ri 0 25 but this parameter regime is not of interest here being far from the current resolving capabilities of hydrostatic ocean models the correct eigenvalues without errors due to horizontal discretization can be obtained by taking the limit δx δy 0 the limit is obtained by setting a x a y 1 and δ x i k x δ y i k y 4 1 symmetric instability fig 1 shows growth rates of symmetric instability at ri 1 2 for the b and c grids at grid sizes of 25 12 5 6 25 and 3 125 km the nyquist wavenumber for each grid size has been marked with an the b grid does not have any unstable modes for grid sizes of 25 and 12 5 km at 6 25 km there is a range of unstable modes but their growth rates are significantly too small while at 3 125 km the largest scale unstable modes are reasonably well represented on the c grid there are unstable modes at every grid scale as the grid scale decreases the discrete instability becomes more accurate the range of unstable modes widens and the growth rates increase these tendencies for the range and growth rates to increase as the grid scale decreases was also predicted by bachman and taylor 2014 for the case of viscous symmetric instability though their analysis did not distinguish between model grid types the een vector invariant discretization on the c grid displays too large growth rates at small scales spurious instability using this discretization has been observed and discussed in a similar configuration barotropic rather than sheared background velocity by hollingsworth et al 1983 and bell et al 2017 overall these behaviors confirm intuition the c grid is more suited to the unbalanced symmetric instability than the b grid the b grid with a grid size of 3 125 km achieves results similar to the c grid with a grid size of 6 25 km in this case the b grid requires double the resolution to get results similar to the c grid the qualitative behavior for a smaller deformation radius and proportionally smaller grid sizes is identical to that shown here 4 2 b grid baroclinic instability fig 2shows growth rates of baroclinic instability at ri 100 for the b grid at grid sizes of 25 12 5 and 6 25 km at eddy permitting resolution of 25 km the growth rate is on the order of 10 too small but the growth rates and the range of unstable modes are both quite accurate at eddy resolving grid scales of 12 5 and 6 25 km this same qualitative behavior occurs at all richardson numbers from 1 2 to 10 000 the behavior off the baroclinic axis i e ky 0 not shown is qualitatively similar to the behavior shown here for k y 0 since baroclinic instability is a source of eddy energy we conjecture that the reduced growth rate of baroclinic instability at eddy permitting resolution could lead to unrealistically weak eddies at these resolutions 4 3 c grid baroclinic instability fig 3 a shows growth rates of baroclinic instability at ri 100 for the c grid at grid sizes of 25 12 5 and 6 25 km and for perturbations on the baroclinic axis k y 0 the nyquist wavenumber for each grid size has been marked with an the behavior of the real instability is overshadowed by the appearance of a spurious instability at higher wavenumbers the peak of the spurious instability always occurs near the nyquist wavenumber and the peak growth rate is unaffected by variation in δx at any fixed wavenumber kx the spurious instability decays to 0 as δx 0 but for any δx there is a wavenumber kx that is spuriously unstable the impact of vertical resolution was tested by re computing the growth rates at δ x 25 km using n z 512 the growth rates are visually indistinguishable from those computed using n z 128 the eigenvector associated with the peak of the spurious instability at δ x 12 5 km shown as a black square in fig 3 a was computed and is shown in fig 3 b d panels b c and d show the vertical profiles of the real blue and imaginary red parts of u v and b respectively the profiles decay rapidly to zero for z 2000 m the amplitude of the profiles is immaterial since they essentially correspond to an unstable direction in phase space they have been normalized so that the maximum of v is 1 the spuriously unstable modes come in pairs with the same growth rate one for each boundary not shown the unstable modes are dominated by meridional cross front velocity with a weaker zonal along front velocity the buoyancy is approximately a factor of n smaller than the velocity which is the same as for the primary eady instability fig 4 shows the scaled growth rate along the baroclinic axis for the c grid with δ x 6 25 km for a range of richardson numbers from 1 2 to 104 the raw growth rate varies by over two orders of magnitude across this range of richardson numbers and fig 4 shows the growth rate multiplied by n m 2 in the limit of large ri the eady baroclinic instability approaches a peak growth rate of approximately 0 31m 2 n this behavior is clearly seen for k x 10 4 the amplitude of the spurious instability at large kx scales similarly to the non spurious eady instability in the limit of large richardson numbers the peak of the spurious instability scales approximately as m 2 2n at smaller richardson numbers the growth rate is somewhat less than this but across four orders of magnitude in richardson number the maximum spurious growth rate is in the range 0 2m 2 n 0 5m 2 n the growth rate of the spurious instability decays as ky moves off of the baroclinic axis just like the primary baroclinic instability not shown 4 4 causes remedies in this section tests are performed to attempt to isolate the cause of the spurious baroclinic instability on the c grid and to suggest remedies the most likely cause is the averaging that appears in the coriolis terms on the c grid this averaging is actually acting as a linear interpolation from the location of u to the location of v and vice versa it is possible to replace this second order averaging approach with a perfect interpolation for normal modes clearly this is not possible in general but it serves to test whether coriolis averaging is an essential cause of the spurious instability the term a x a y u in eq 39 interpolates u west and north to the location of v similarly the term a x a y v in eq 38 interpolates v east and south to the location of u a normal mode has the following exact horizontal structure e i k x δ x i k y δ y j to evaluate half a grid point west one simply multiplies by e i k x δ x 2 and similarly to move half a grid point north south or east to test the impact of coriolis averaging on the spurious instability we re compute eigenvalues with this perfect coriolis interpolation fig 5 a shows the results of this calculation at ri 100 and δ x 6 25 km while it does reduce the spurious instability at intermediate wavelengths the growth rate near the nyquist wavenumber is slightly worse this suggests that interpolation schemes for the coriolis force that are more accurate than the standard approach will not cure the spurious instability although higher order tracer advection schemes are more widely available in ocean models than higher order momentum advection schemes we test whether a fourth order centered advection scheme applied to both tracers and momentum might cure the spurious instability this is implemented as follows the second order centered difference a x δ x that appears in the terms u a x δ x u in eq 38 u a x δ x v in 39 and u a x δ x b in 40 is replaced with fourth order centered difference approximation of the form 47 δ x 4 u u i 2 8 u i 1 8 u i 1 u i 2 12 δ x fig 5 a yellow line shows the results of this calculation at ri 100 and δ x 6 25 km while fourth order advection does reduce the spurious instability at intermediate wavelengths the growth rate near the nyquist wavenumber is essentially unchanged although fourth order momentum and tracer advection fail to significantly improve the spurious instability we checked the impact of using fourth order tracer advection but only second order momentum advection the results of this calculation are shown in fig 5 a purple line surprisingly the use of fourth order advection on only the tracer field completely removes the spurious instability at intermediate wavelengths the peak of the spurious instability near the nyquist wavenumber is essentially unchanged several other tests not reported here have failed to identify any single term in the equations that is primarily responsible for the existence of the spurious instability it seems to result from a vicious collusion of the numerical errors present in several different terms in the equations the behavior reported above holds qualitatively over a wide range of richardson numbers having failed to completely remove the spurious instability by improving the numerical approximations though this may yet prove possible attention is turned to methods for mitigating its effects the obvious candidates to damp a spurious small scale instability are viscosity and diffusion first consider vertical viscosity and diffusion the coefficient of vertical tracer diffusion is constrained to be small in ocean models to avoid spurious diapycnal mixing so we will consider only vertical viscosity the vertical scale of the spuriously growing perturbations is not particularly small as exemplified in fig 3 b d and one should not expect vertical viscosity to be an effective means to damp the instability it has been verified that the relatively large vertical viscosity of ν z 10 3 m2 s has minimal impact on the instability at ri 100 and δ x 6 25 km since the peak growth rate of the spurious instability scales approximately as m 2 2n one can simply choose viscous and diffusive coefficients large enough that the rate of viscous damping matches or exceeds the rate of spurious growth the problem becomes easier to analyze if the coefficient of horizontal viscosity is set equal to that of horizontal diffusion in which case the normal mode equations take the form 48 d d t u v b l ν h d i u v b where d is the fourier symbol of the horizontal diffusion operator for example applying the standard second order laplacian diffusion operator leads to 49 d 4 δ x 2 sin 2 k x δ x 2 4 δ y 2 sin 2 k y δ y 2 to remove the spurious instability one can choose the viscous coefficient νh so that the peak growth rate of the spurious instability m 2 2n matches the damping rate of second order discrete harmonic laplacian or biharmonic diffusion at the nyquist wavenumber let a harmonic viscosity by ν 2 and a biharmonic viscosity be ν 4 then the conditions are 50 ν 2 m 2 δ x 2 8 n ν 4 m 2 δ x 4 32 n fig 5 b compares the effect of harmonic and biharmonic damping and of fourth order tracer advection on the growth rates the parameters are n 10 3 s 1 m 10 4 s 1 and δ x 6 25 km and the viscosities have been chosen according to the criteria above leading to ν 2 49 m2 s and ν 4 4 8 10 8 m4 s harmonic viscosity and diffusion are able to completely damp the spurious instability at all scales at the reasonably high resolution of δ x 6 25 km the true baroclinic growth rate is only slightly diminished but at coarser scales the amount of dissipation necessary to stop the instability might be sufficient to detrimentally affect the primary instability biharmonic viscosity is usually preferred over harmonic viscosity in eddying simulations because it helps confine unphysical dissipation to the smallest horizontal scales fig 5 b shows that when using the standard second order discretization of advection biharmonic viscosity damps the spurious instability at the smallest scales but not at intermediate scales this residual weakly growing spurious instability at intermediate scales is unsavory and can be eliminated by using fourth order tracer advection the salutary combined effects of biharmonic viscosity and fourth order tracer advection are shown in fig 5 b it is clear from fig 5 b that the viscosities prescribed in eq 50 are slightly larger than necessary to damp the spurious instability the results in fig 4 indicate that this will be more pronounced at smaller richardson numbers naturally other considerations also conspire to set the value of viscous and diffusive coefficients in eddying ocean model simulations and the prescriptions of eq 50 should be regarded as guidelines 4 5 comparison to nonlinear simulations to verify that the linear stability analysis corresponds with the behavior of ocean models we computed unstable perturbations from the linear instability analysis and introduced them as initial conditions in nonlinear simulations the simulations were run using the mitgcm code marshall et al 1997 in a horizontally periodic domain of size 1200 400 4 km with grid spacing 4 km in the horizontal and 100 uniformly spaced vertical levels the parameters of the background flow were set to n 2 10 6 s 2 m 2 10 9 s 2 and f 0 10 4 s 1 an initial perturbation was introduced with zonal wavelength of 4 δ x 16 km i e with wavenumber equal to half the nyquist wavenumber and with vertical profile that yields the fastest linear growth for perturbations of that scale the perturbation was normalized so that the maximum velocity was 0 1 cm s this perturbation has a wavelength that should be stable in the exact eady problem by contrast the linear stability analysis of the second order c grid discretization predicts a growth rate of 2 18 10 7 s 1 the kinetic energy of the perturbations should thus grow at a rate of approximately 2 2 18 10 7 4 36 10 7 s 1 the nonlinear simulation was run for 100 days and the total kinetic energy was tracked over this time period the total kinetic energy grew by a factor of more than 1000 the instantaneous growth rate of kinetic energy was estimated at each day using the formula ke growth rate 1 τ ln ke t τ ke t where τ is one day and ke is the total kinetic energy fig 6 a shows a time series of the estimated growth rate of kinetic energy the computed growth rate is close to the value predicted by the linear theory 4 36 10 7 s 1 after 250 days the growth is sufficient for nonlinear effects to appear which ends the exponential growth this simulation verifies the existence of a spurious linear instability in the c grid eady problem the linear theory says that when fourth order tracer advection is used there are no eigenvalues with positive real part for perturbations with this wavelength one could follow the procedure above by computing any eigenvector of the linear problem and introducing it as an initial perturbation to the nonlinear simulation but this might be unsatisfying because the linear theory suggests that any perturbation with this wavelength is stable in fact this suggestion that having no unstable eigenvalues implies that no solutions will grow is false unless the linear system is normal a complex matrix a is normal when it commutes with its complex conjugate transpose i e aa a a a normal matrix has a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors and the growth or decay of solutions to the linear system of differential equations y a y is determined completely by the eigenvalues of a the matrix l in eq 46 is not normal for the second order fourth order or exact systems and therefore does not have a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors one of the ramifications of this fact is that solutions of the linear system can grow even when all the eigenvalues have non positive real part non normal behavior is common in fluid dynamics and its presence in the quasigeostrophic eady problem was noted by farrell and ioannou 1996 the goal of this section is to verify the linear theory in a nonlinear simulation not to perform a full generalized stability analysis in the vein of farrell and ioannou 1996 with that in mind we introduced the same initial perturbation from the second order simulation described above into a simulation using fourth order tracer advection the perturbation grows but this is not a contradiction of the linear theory the linear theory predicts that the instantaneous growth rate associated with this particular perturbation the instantaneous growth rate is y l l y y 2 where y is the initial perturbation is 4 36 10 7 s 1 the growth rate measured from the nonlinear simulation is shown in fig 6 b the first 100 days show wildly varying estimates of the linear growth rate which then settles down to a value close to the theoretically predicted value this validates the linear theory while simultaneously illustrating the dangers of over interpreting eigenvalues in non normal systems 5 conclusions this paper investigates the effect of horizontal discretization on baroclinic and symmetric instabilities in the hydrostatic eady problem the effects of vertical discretization are minimized by using uniform high resolution in the vertical the effects of vertical discretization on baroclinic instability have been studied by arakawa and moorthi 1988 bell and white 1988 and bell and white 2017 in the horizontal the standard flux form energy conserving second order b and c grid discretizations are considered along with the two forms of vector invariant discretizations on the c grid the flux form and vector invariant enstrophy conserving ens schemes madec 2008 on the c grid give a better representation of symmetric instability than the b grid the latter has growth rates that are generally too small the vector invariant enstrophy and energy conserving een scheme on the c grid arakawa and lamb 1981 madec 2008 has too large growth rates for symmetric instability at small scales this behavior is presumably related to the hollingsworth instability hollingsworth et al 1983 and the symmetric instability of the computational kind discussed by bell et al 2017 and ducousso et al 2017 the representation of baroclinic instability on the b grid is qualitatively correct at eddy permitting and eddy resolving resolutions no spurious instabilities are observed and the primary deficiency is that the growth rates can be on the order of 10 too small at eddy permitting resolution since mesoscale eddies are energized by baroclinic instability this suggests that eddies in a b grid model at eddy permitting resolution might extract too little potential energy from the large scale flow resulting in eddies that are too weak this explanation for the weakness of eddies at eddy permitting resolution is in stark contrast to the energetic picture assumed in many recent eddy permitting parameterization studies that either assume that the missing energy comes from energetic backscatter from subgrid scales grooms and majda 2013 kitsios et al 2013 grooms and majda 2014 grooms et al 2015b or that the eddies are overly damped by viscosity jansen and held 2014 the relative importance of anemic baroclinic production missing backscatter and spurious dissipation in the energy budget of eddies at eddy permitting resolution remains unknown a spurious baroclinic instability was discovered on the c grid where the flux form discretization and the two vector invariant forms all give the same results this spurious instability is peaked at scales just below the smallest resolvable nyquist scale but has relatively large vertical scales the unstable perturbations manifest primarily in the velocity field primarily cross front with a weak signature in the density field the growth rates scale similarly to the baroclinic growth rate with a peak growth rate of approximately f 0 2 ri where ri is the richardson number this growth rate is approximately independent of the grid scale δx and the spurious instability does not disappear as the grid is refined instead it simply moves to smaller scales it was found that fourth order centered tracer advection significantly improves the spurious instability confining it to the very smallest scales but not significantly reducing its growth rate curiously using fourth order momentum advection had little positive impact overall it is suggested that eddy permitting and eddy resolving models on the c grid should use fourth order tracer advection with biharmonic viscosity and diffusion with coefficients ν 4 κ 4 f 0 δ x 4 32 r i for mesoscale richardson numbers on the order of 100 and eddy resolving grid scales less than 10 km this amount of dissipation is not excessive the lack of spurious baroclinic instability on the b grid suggests that b grid models might be more appropriate for eddy permitting and eddy resolving simulations though perhaps not for simulations resolving submesoscales and smaller even on the b grid higher order numerics might improve eddy permitting ocean models though fourth order tracer advection was not found to improve the growth rates these models are defined by the fact that the eddy scales are not much larger than the grid scale low and high order methods all give similarly accurate results for scales that are well resolved by the grid higher order methods are distinguished by giving better approximations at intermediate scales that are partially resolved by the grid e g wavelengths four to six times the grid spacing and seem naturally suited to eddy permitting modeling neither low nor high order methods give accurate approximations for very small scales with wavelengths near twice the grid spacing grooms et al 2015a recently found that an idealized eddy permitting model with fourth order numerics gave better short time forecasting and data assimilation performance than a model with second order numerics and that the improvement was comparable in magnitude to the improvement obtained by using improved subgrid scale parameterizations the eady baroclinic instability is a type of baroclinic instability not often seen in the ocean tulloch et al 2011 find that baroclinic instability in oceans typically results from a change of sign of the mean potential vorticity gradient in the interior phillips type or of the combination of a surface shear and an interior mean potential vorticity gradient ocean charney type the eady problem is analyzed here because the coefficients in the linear perturbation equations are independent of the x and y coordinates more realistic non uniform vertical mean shear would through geostrophic balance result in linear perturbation equations with coefficients that depend on the y coordinate this does not happen in the quasigeostrophic approximation which prevents the use of a full normal mode expansion because of this mismatch between the character of the eady problem and of baroclinic instability in the oceans the behavior reported here should be extrapolated to more complex ocean models with caution finally the analysis here has focused on the two quadrilateral grid schemes most common in global ocean models the arakawa b and c grids it is of interest to pursue a similar analysis on the hexagonal grid used in the mpas ocean model ringler et al 2013 the methods used by thuburn 2008 to study free wave propagation on hexagonal grids may be adapted to the baroclinic instability problem but the analysis is sufficiently complex that it merits a separate study acknowledgments i grooms is grateful to f bryan and k lindsay for providing references on the

nsf grant dms 1407340 appendix a normal mode equations the way to eliminate hydrostatic pressure is the same on both the b and c grids on both grids the discrete hydrostatic balance for a normal mode

the baroclinic pressure has no barotropic component this allows us to eliminate the baroclinic pressure by an equation of the form a 2 p p b where p is a square matrix the entries are available in closed form but the expressions are unwieldy the vertical velocity is obtained by integrating the discrete incompressibility condition which has different forms on the b and c grids on the b grid we have a 3 1 δ z 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 w a y δ x u a x δ y v and on the c grid a 4 1 δ z 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 w δ x u δ y v the inverse of this coefficient matrix is available in closed form it is δz times a lower triangular matrix whose diagonal and sub diagonal elements are all ones the vertical velocity only appears in the linear perturbation equations in the form a z w so we will write a 5 a z w w a y δ x u a x δ y v on the b grid and a 6 a z w w δ x u δ y v on the c grid where the matrix w is in both cases a 7 δ z 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 it remains to eliminate the barotropic

diagonal matrix with entries u following the derivation for the continuous case the equations are first averaged across depth by multiplying from the left by 1 t nz where t indicates the transpose this eliminates the baroclinic pressure next ϕ is obtained by enforcing the condition 1 t d d t a y δ x u a x δ y v 0 this leads to a 10 ϕ 1 t n z a x a x δ x δ x a y a y δ y δ y a x a y δ x 2 u m 2 a

24115,the effects of horizontal discretization on linear baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are investigated by analyzing the behavior of the hydrostatic eady problem in ocean models on the b and c grids on the c grid a spurious baroclinic instability appears at small wavelengths this instability does not disappear as the grid scale decreases instead it simply moves to smaller horizontal scales the peak growth rate of the spurious instability is independent of the grid scale as the latter decreases it is equal to c f ri where ri is the balanced richardson number f is the coriolis parameter and c is a nondimensional constant that depends on the richardson number as the richardson number increases c increases towards an upper bound of approximately 1 2 for large richardson numbers the spurious instability is faster than the eady instability to suppress the spurious instability it is recommended to use fourth order centered tracer advection along with biharmonic viscosity and diffusion with coefficients δ x 4 f 32 ri or larger where δx is the grid scale on the b grid the growth rates of baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are too small and converge upwards towards the correct values as the grid scale decreases no spurious instabilities are observed in b grid models at eddy permitting resolution the reduced growth rate of baroclinic instability may contribute to partially resolved eddies being too weak on the c grid the growth rate of symmetric instability is better larger than on the b grid and converges upwards towards the correct value as the grid scale decreases keywords baroclinic instability symmetric instability discretization 1 introduction the study of the effects of discretization on free wave propagation in models of geophysical fluids has a long history dating at least to the work of charney et al 1950 in particular the propagation of rossby and inertia gravity waves in the various staggered arakawa grids arakawa and lamb 1977 has received a great deal of attention over the years many results are reviewed in haidvogel and beckmann 1999 including the seminal work of wajsowicz 1986 and dukowicz 1995 on the b grid the horizontal components of velocity are staggered with respect to the tracers but not with respect to each other on the c grid they are staggered with respect to each other and with respect to the tracers intuition suggests and the aforementioned studies confirm that the b grid is more suited to describing large scale geostrophic dynamics like rossby waves than the c grid and the b grid has been popular in models used to simulate the global ocean the b grid is used by the parallel ocean program pop which is the ocean model component of both the community climate system models ccsm gent et al 2011 and the current version of the community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 and by the modular ocean model mom5 which is the ocean component of the cm2 5 model delworth et al 2012 the next version of mom will use the c grid models used to simulate smaller scale dynamics e g in regional simulations and process studies often use the c grid examples include the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 the ocean component of the nucleus for european modeling of the ocean nemo opa madec 2008 also uses the c grid which may become more popular for global models as resolution increases the distinction between these model grid types and their relative advantages and disadvantages is important because the steady increase in computational capacity at many climate modeling centers has ushered in a transitional period for global ocean models previous ipcc class models have been limited to horizontal resolutions 1 which is insufficient to resolve oceanic mesoscale eddies increasing resolution from the 1 benchmark means that mesoscale eddies will be resolved naturally across some of the global ocean promising increased realism of the global circulation e g maltrud and mcclean 2005 kirtman et al 2012 hallberg 2013 graham 2014 treguier et al 2014 and improved coupling to other components of the climate system e g delworth et al 2012 frenger et al 2013 progression into this eddy permitting regime introduces a suite of new challenges among which is the issue of how the structure of the model grid affects the growth and behavior of the mesoscale eddies themselves these eddies are geostrophically balanced which suggests that they might be more accurately represented on a b grid but they are not linear rossby waves so the above referenced free wave analyses do not directly apply direct analysis of the effects of numerical discretization on nonlinear mesoscale eddy dynamics is not straightforward and a different approach linear yet hopefully relevant to mesoscale eddy dynamics is taken here mesoscale eddies are believed to sustain their energy primarily by extracting available potential energy from the large scale flow e g ferrari and wunsch 2009 and a canonical linear model for this process is baroclinic instability in this paper we study the effects of discretization on the properties of linear baroclinic instability in the eady problem we use hydrostatic dynamics as typically used by global ocean models and consider commonly used discretizations on the b and c grids since the symmetric instability arises in the eady problem in addition to the baroclinic instability the behavior of symmetric instability under discretization is also investigated the paper is organized as follows the hydrostatic ocean primitive equations the spatial grids and the discretizations of interest are described in section 2 linear perturbation equations for the eady problem under the different discretizations are derived in section 3 growth rates of symmetric and baroclinic instabilities for the discretized models are presented in section 4 section 4 4 investigates the causes of and remedies for the spurious baroclinic instability on the c grid and section 4 5 verifies the linear analysis by comparison to direct simulations of the nonlinear equations some conclusions are discussed in section 5 2 preliminaries notation 2 1 governing partial differential equations the inviscid hydrostatic primitive equations on an f plane are 1 t u u u f 0 v x p 2 t v u v f 0 u y p 3 t b u b 0 4 u 0 5 z p b the velocity is u u v w f 0 is the coriolis parameter and b is the buoyancy the pressure p has been rescaled by a constant reference density ρ 0 and the boussinesq approximation has been used the depth independent barotropic component of pressure is not constrained by eq 5 we will here use a rigid lid approximation to constrain the barotropic pressure to wit the depth average of eq 4 is x u y v 0 where u and v are the depth averaged components of u and v and the vertical velocity w has been set to zero at both boundaries the depth averages of eqs 1 and 2 are t u h 1 0 h u u d z f 0 v x ϕ t v h 1 0 h u v d z f 0 u y ϕ where h is the depth and ϕ is the barotropic pressure taking the divergence of these equations leads to an elliptic equation for the barotropic pressure 6 h 2 ϕ f 0 x v y u h 1 h 0 h u u d z where h x y the above derivation applies at the level of the partial differential equations it bears noting that typical discrete ocean models allow for the existence of a divergent barotropic mode e g in the initial condition in the context of a discrete ocean model the above condition on the barotropic pressure does not prevent a divergent barotropic mode from existing it simply prevents it from evolving 2 2 notation for discretized equations we wish to investigate the dynamics on a regular cartesian grid with grid sizes δx δy and δ z h n z where nz is the number of vertical levels the velocity pressure and buoyancy will be tracked at points on the grid vectors of their values on the grid will be denoted u v w p and b the vectors will be triply indexed e g u i j k with indices i j and k denoting locations in the x y and z directions respectively indices are often truncated to save space e g u i 1 is a shorthand for u i 1 j k to isolate the effects of horizontal discretization the vertical discretization will be kept uniform with large nz the vertical discretization uses the lorenz grid common to the ocean models referenced in the introduction lorenz 1960 all variables except the vertical velocity are associated with the vertical grid points k 1 2 δ z k 1 n z the vertical velocity is associated with the vertical grid points kδz k 0 n z variables on the b grid occur in one of two sets of horizontal locations b i j p i j ϕ i j and w i j are located at x y δ x i δ y j while u i j and v i j are located at x y δ x i 1 2 δ y j 1 2 variables on the c grid occur in one of three sets of horizontal locations the buoyancy vertical velocity and tracer are all located at x y δ x i δ y j same as the b grid while u i j is located at x y δ x i 1 2 δ y j and v i j is located at x y δ x i δ y j 1 2 on both grids the vertical velocity is staggered with respect to the other variables the convention adopted here is to place w k at z k δ z and all the other variables at z k 1 2 δ z the methods used to discretize the governing equations can be completely described in terms of a few fundamental average and difference operators these operators are defined below according to their action 7 a x u i u i 1 u i 2 δ x u i u i 1 u i δ x 8 a y u j u j 1 u j 2 δ y u j u j 1 u j δ y 9 a z u k u k 1 u k 2 δ z u k u k 1 u k δ k it can be easily verified that all of these operators commute with one another and the convention adopted here will be to list averages before differences and plus before minus let the reader be advised that these operators are not centered the usual centered differences can be recovered by the combination of a forward difference δ and a backward average a or a backward difference and a forward average 2 3 discrete formulation on the b grid the discrete momentum equations on the b grid have the form 10 d u d t a u b f 0 v a y δ x p ϕ 11 d v d t a v b f 0 u a x δ y p ϕ where a u b and a v b are discretizations of advection of zonal and meridional momentum respectively and p and ϕ are the baroclinic and barotropic pressures respectively the dependent variables u and v in eqs 10 and 11 are vectors of the values of u and v on the computational grid as a result they are systems of ordinary rather than partial differential equations the second order energy conserving discretization of momentum advection due to bryan 1969 is somewhat complicated to save space define the following averaged velocity components 12 u a x a y a y u 13 v a x a x a y v 14 w a x a y w with this notation the zonal momentum advection takes the form 15 a u b δ x u a x u δ y v a y u δ z w a z u the meridional momentum advection has the same form but with v replacing u the standard second order discretization of the tracer advection on the b grid takes the form 16 δ x a y u a x b δ y a x v a y b δ z w a z b the discrete continuity equation is obtained by applying the tracer advection to a constant buoyancy profile b 1 17 a y δ x u a x δ y u δ z w 0 the discrete hydrostatic balance is simply 18 δ z p a z b this form of discrete hydrostatic balance has been shown to preserve the total kinetic plus potential energy by bryan 1969 the equation for discrete barotropic pressure is obtained by a derivation analogous to the derivation for the continuous equations it is unwieldy and not presented here a derivation for the much simpler case of a normal mode perturbation is in appendix a 2 4 discrete formulation on the c grid flux form the discrete momentum equations on the c grid have the form 19 d u d t a u c f 0 a x a y v δ x p ϕ 20 d v d t a v c f 0 a x a y u δ y p ϕ where a u c and a v c are discretizations of zonal and meridional momentum advection respectively note that compared to the b grid the coriolis terms are now averaged but the pressure gradient is not the b grid nevertheless requires fewer averaging operators than the c grid which suggests that the b grid will more accurately represent geostrophic flows at large scales that balance the coriolis acceleration and the pressure gradient the second order energy conserving flux form discretization of momentum advection on the c grid takes the form 21 a u c δ x a x u 2 2 δ y a x v a y u δ z a x w a z u and the meridional momentum advection takes the form 22 a v c δ x a y u a x v δ y a y v 2 2 δ z a y w a z v the standard second order discretization of the tracer advection on the c grid takes the form 23 δ x u a x b δ y v a y b δ z w a z b the discrete continuity equation is again obtained by applying the tracer advection to a constant buoyancy profile b 1 24 δ x u δ y v δ z w 0 the discrete hydrostatic balance is the same as eq 18 and a barotropic pressure equation for a normal mode perturbation is derived in appendix a 2 5 discrete formulation on the c grid vector invariant the horizontal advection of momentum in the primitive equations can be written in vector invariant form as 25 u x u v y u 1 2 x u 2 v 2 ζ v 26 u x v v y v 1 2 y u 2 v 2 ζ u where ζ x v y u is the vertical component of relative vorticity we consider two discretizations using this form an enstrophy conserving form ens from sadourny 1975 and an energy and enstrophy conserving form called een see e g arakawa and lamb 1981 madec 2008 and le sommer et al 2009 the ens discretization of eqs 25 and 26 takes the form 27 1 2 x u 2 v 2 ζ v 1 2 δ x a x u 2 a y v 2 a y δ x v δ y u a x a y v 28 1 2 y u 2 v 2 ζ u 1 2 δ y a x u 2 a y v 2 a x δ x v δ y u a x a y u the een form is significantly more complicated the gradient of horizontal kinetic energy remains the same but the product of relative vorticity and velocity takes the form 29 ζ v 1 12 ω i j ω i j 1 ω i 1 j v i j ω i j ω i j 1 ω i 1 j 1

frequency is n and the slope of the isopycnals is m 2 n 2 the vertical shear is m 2 f 0 the linear stability of this equilibrium to infinitesimal perturbations has been considered by a legion of authors beginning with eady 1949 and with notable contributions in the hydrostatic non geostrophic case by stone 1966 1970 the goal here is to study linear stability of the discretized equations it is easy to verify that the following discrete configuration is also an equilibrium of the discretized equations since a second order discretization applied to a linear function is exact 32 u i j k m 2 δ z f 0 k n z 1 2 33 b i j k n 2 δ z k m 2 j δ y 34 v i j k 0 it is straightforward to derive linear perturbation equations about this equilibrium on the b grid these have the following form 35 d u d t

condition on the b grid eq 17 and the discrete hydrostatic balance eq 18 note that the above equations are to be interpreted as holding at index i j k the discrete system governing linear perturbations on the c grid with the flux form and vector invariant ens forms of the momentum equations has the form 38 d u d t u a x δ x u m 2 a x a z f 0 w f 0 a x a y v δ x p ϕ 39 d v d t u a x δ x v f 0 a x a y u δ y p ϕ 40 d b d t u a x δ x b n 2 a z w m 2 a y v 0 the system is completed by the discrete incompressibility condition on the c grid eq 24 and by the discrete hydrostatic balance eq 18 the linear perturbation equations for with the een vector invariant discretization madec 2008 le sommer et al 2009 only differ in the meridional momentum equation which takes the following form 41 d v d t u 1 3 1 2 a y a y a x δ x v f 0 a x a y u u δ y 2 6 δ y 2 δ y u δ y p ϕ the final term on the left hand side is purely dispersive and converges towards zero as the grid is refined for perturbations on the baroclinic axis i e with no variation in the meridional direction the linear perturbation equation is the same as in the ens and flux form cases since a y 1 and δ y 0 for perturbations on the symmetric axis i e with no variation in the zonal direction the term a x δ x v 0 but the final term dispersive term on the left hand side remains for this reason the een vector invariant form is only considered separately from the other c grid discretizations in the examination of symmetric instability on both grids as in the continuous problem the background state does not vary in the horizontal thus as in the continuous problem the linear perturbation equations can be resolved into normal modes that are simply fourier modes solutions are therefore sought in the form 42 u u e i k x δ x i k y δ y j complex conjugate with similar representations of the other variables note the notational distinction between 1 i and the index i the coefficient vector u is now a singly indexed vector with index k varying across the depth by considering the domain to be of infinite horizontal extent all wavenumbers up to the nyquist are admissible on the grid 43 k x k y π δ x π δ x π

y δ y 1 2 δ y e i k y δ y 1 δ y the equations governing the linear evolution of a normal mode constitute a system of differential algebraic equations differential equations for u v and b and algebraic equations for w p and ϕ it is convenient to eliminate the three diagnostic variables to obtain a system of linear differential equations for the three prognostic variables the details of this elimination can be found in appendix a the result in both cases is a system of linear differential equations i e 46 d d t u v b l u v b where the matrix l takes different forms on the b and c grids the matrix l is 3nz 3nz and depends on the wavenumbers kx ky the grid scales δx δy and δz and the external parameters h f 0 n 2 and m 2 the linear stability analysis consists of computing the eigenvalue with the largest real part if the real part is positive then the system is linearly unstable 4 discrete growth rates the deformation radius is nh f 0 rather than non dimensionalize the system we fix h 4000 m n 10 3 s 1 and f 0 10 4 s 1 for a deformation radius of 40 km after nondimensionalization e g stone 1966 the linear stability problem depends only on the richardson number so results for other parameter values can be obtained by rescaling the grid spacing will always be isotropic δ x δ y unless noted otherwise n z 128 results of the linear stability analysis of the eady problem are usually organized using the richardson number which for the eady problem is ri n 2 f 0 2 m 4 summarizing the results of stone 1966 1970 for ri 1 the peak instability occurs on the baroclinic axis k y 0 at a wavenumber kx somewhat larger than the deformation wavenumber f 0 nh ri 1 is the quasigeostrophic regime investigated by eady 1949 and the instability is baroclinic in this regime the peak growth rate scales approximately as 0 31m 2 n for ri 1 a new instability occurs with maximum growth rate on the symmetric axis k x 0 for ri 0 95 this new symmetric instability grows faster than the baroclinic instability the symmetric instability in turn gives way to a kelvin helmholtz instability at ri 0 25 but this parameter regime is not of interest here being far from the current resolving capabilities of hydrostatic ocean models the correct eigenvalues without errors due to horizontal discretization can be obtained by taking the limit δx δy 0 the limit is obtained by setting a x a y 1 and δ x i k x δ y i k y 4 1 symmetric instability fig 1 shows growth rates of symmetric instability at ri 1 2 for the b and c grids at grid sizes of 25 12 5 6 25 and 3 125 km the nyquist wavenumber for each grid size has been marked with an the b grid does not have any unstable modes for grid sizes of 25 and 12 5 km at 6 25 km there is a range of unstable modes but their growth rates are significantly too small while at 3 125 km the largest scale unstable modes are reasonably well represented on the c grid there are unstable modes at every grid scale as the grid scale decreases the discrete instability becomes more accurate the range of unstable modes widens and the growth rates increase these tendencies for the range and growth rates to increase as the grid scale decreases was also predicted by bachman and taylor 2014 for the case of viscous symmetric instability though their analysis did not distinguish between model grid types the een vector invariant discretization on the c grid displays too large growth rates at small scales spurious instability using this discretization has been observed and discussed in a similar configuration barotropic rather than sheared background velocity by hollingsworth et al 1983 and bell et al 2017 overall these behaviors confirm intuition the c grid is more suited to the unbalanced symmetric instability than the b grid the b grid with a grid size of 3 125 km achieves results similar to the c grid with a grid size of 6 25 km in this case the b grid requires double the resolution to get results similar to the c grid the qualitative behavior for a smaller deformation radius and proportionally smaller grid sizes is identical to that shown here 4 2 b grid baroclinic instability fig 2shows growth rates of baroclinic instability at ri 100 for the b grid at grid sizes of 25 12 5 and 6 25 km at eddy permitting resolution of 25 km the growth rate is on the order of 10 too small but the growth rates and the range of unstable modes are both quite accurate at eddy resolving grid scales of 12 5 and 6 25 km this same qualitative behavior occurs at all richardson numbers from 1 2 to 10 000 the behavior off the baroclinic axis i e ky 0 not shown is qualitatively similar to the behavior shown here for k y 0 since baroclinic instability is a source of eddy energy we conjecture that the reduced growth rate of baroclinic instability at eddy permitting resolution could lead to unrealistically weak eddies at these resolutions 4 3 c grid baroclinic instability fig 3 a shows growth rates of baroclinic instability at ri 100 for the c grid at grid sizes of 25 12 5 and 6 25 km and for perturbations on the baroclinic axis k y 0 the nyquist wavenumber for each grid size has been marked with an the behavior of the real instability is overshadowed by the appearance of a spurious instability at higher wavenumbers the peak of the spurious instability always occurs near the nyquist wavenumber and the peak growth rate is unaffected by variation in δx at any fixed wavenumber kx the spurious instability decays to 0 as δx 0 but for any δx there is a wavenumber kx that is spuriously unstable the impact of vertical resolution was tested by re computing the growth rates at δ x 25 km using n z 512 the growth rates are visually indistinguishable from those computed using n z 128 the eigenvector associated with the peak of the spurious instability at δ x 12 5 km shown as a black square in fig 3 a was computed and is shown in fig 3 b d panels b c and d show the vertical profiles of the real blue and imaginary red parts of u v and b respectively the profiles decay rapidly to zero for z 2000 m the amplitude of the profiles is immaterial since they essentially correspond to an unstable direction in phase space they have been normalized so that the maximum of v is 1 the spuriously unstable modes come in pairs with the same growth rate one for each boundary not shown the unstable modes are dominated by meridional cross front velocity with a weaker zonal along front velocity the buoyancy is approximately a factor of n smaller than the velocity which is the same as for the primary eady instability fig 4 shows the scaled growth rate along the baroclinic axis for the c grid with δ x 6 25 km for a range of richardson numbers from 1 2 to 104 the raw growth rate varies by over two orders of magnitude across this range of richardson numbers and fig 4 shows the growth rate multiplied by n m 2 in the limit of large ri the eady baroclinic instability approaches a peak growth rate of approximately 0 31m 2 n this behavior is clearly seen for k x 10 4 the amplitude of the spurious instability at large kx scales similarly to the non spurious eady instability in the limit of large richardson numbers the peak of the spurious instability scales approximately as m 2 2n at smaller richardson numbers the growth rate is somewhat less than this but across four orders of magnitude in richardson number the maximum spurious growth rate is in the range 0 2m 2 n 0 5m 2 n the growth rate of the spurious instability decays as ky moves off of the baroclinic axis just like the primary baroclinic instability not shown 4 4 causes remedies in this section tests are performed to attempt to isolate the cause of the spurious baroclinic instability on the c grid and to suggest remedies the most likely cause is the averaging that appears in the coriolis terms on the c grid this averaging is actually acting as a linear interpolation from the location of u to the location of v and vice versa it is possible to replace this second order averaging approach with a perfect interpolation for normal modes clearly this is not possible in general but it serves to test whether coriolis averaging is an essential cause of the spurious instability the term a x a y u in eq 39 interpolates u west and north to the location of v similarly the term a x a y v in eq 38 interpolates v east and south to the location of u a normal mode has the following exact horizontal structure e i k x δ x i k y δ y j to evaluate half a grid point west one simply multiplies by e i k x δ x 2 and similarly to move half a grid point north south or east to test the impact of coriolis averaging on the spurious instability we re compute eigenvalues with this perfect coriolis interpolation fig 5 a shows the results of this calculation at ri 100 and δ x 6 25 km while it does reduce the spurious instability at intermediate wavelengths the growth rate near the nyquist wavenumber is slightly worse this suggests that interpolation schemes for the coriolis force that are more accurate than the standard approach will not cure the spurious instability although higher order tracer advection schemes are more widely available in ocean models than higher order momentum advection schemes we test whether a fourth order centered advection scheme applied to both tracers and momentum might cure the spurious instability this is implemented as follows the second order centered difference a x δ x that appears in the terms u a x δ x u in eq 38 u a x δ x v in 39 and u a x δ x b in 40 is replaced with fourth order centered difference approximation of the form 47 δ x 4 u u i 2 8 u i 1 8 u i 1 u i 2 12 δ x fig 5 a yellow line shows the results of this calculation at ri 100 and δ x 6 25 km while fourth order advection does reduce the spurious instability at intermediate wavelengths the growth rate near the nyquist wavenumber is essentially unchanged although fourth order momentum and tracer advection fail to significantly improve the spurious instability we checked the impact of using fourth order tracer advection but only second order momentum advection the results of this calculation are shown in fig 5 a purple line surprisingly the use of fourth order advection on only the tracer field completely removes the spurious instability at intermediate wavelengths the peak of the spurious instability near the nyquist wavenumber is essentially unchanged several other tests not reported here have failed to identify any single term in the equations that is primarily responsible for the existence of the spurious instability it seems to result from a vicious collusion of the numerical errors present in several different terms in the equations the behavior reported above holds qualitatively over a wide range of richardson numbers having failed to completely remove the spurious instability by improving the numerical approximations though this may yet prove possible attention is turned to methods for mitigating its effects the obvious candidates to damp a spurious small scale instability are viscosity and diffusion first consider vertical viscosity and diffusion the coefficient of vertical tracer diffusion is constrained to be small in ocean models to avoid spurious diapycnal mixing so we will consider only vertical viscosity the vertical scale of the spuriously growing perturbations is not particularly small as exemplified in fig 3 b d and one should not expect vertical viscosity to be an effective means to damp the instability it has been verified that the relatively large vertical viscosity of ν z 10 3 m2 s has minimal impact on the instability at ri 100 and δ x 6 25 km since the peak growth rate of the spurious instability scales approximately as m 2 2n one can simply choose viscous and diffusive coefficients large enough that the rate of viscous damping matches or exceeds the rate of spurious growth the problem becomes easier to analyze if the coefficient of horizontal viscosity is set equal to that of horizontal diffusion in which case the normal mode equations take the form 48 d d t u v b l ν h d i u v b where d is the fourier symbol of the horizontal diffusion operator for example applying the standard second order laplacian diffusion operator leads to 49 d 4 δ x 2 sin 2 k x δ x 2 4 δ y 2 sin 2 k y δ y 2 to remove the spurious instability one can choose the viscous coefficient νh so that the peak growth rate of the spurious instability m 2 2n matches the damping rate of second order discrete harmonic laplacian or biharmonic diffusion at the nyquist wavenumber let a harmonic viscosity by ν 2 and a biharmonic viscosity be ν 4 then the conditions are 50 ν 2 m 2 δ x 2 8 n ν 4 m 2 δ x 4 32 n fig 5 b compares the effect of harmonic and biharmonic damping and of fourth order tracer advection on the growth rates the parameters are n 10 3 s 1 m 10 4 s 1 and δ x 6 25 km and the viscosities have been chosen according to the criteria above leading to ν 2 49 m2 s and ν 4 4 8 10 8 m4 s harmonic viscosity and diffusion are able to completely damp the spurious instability at all scales at the reasonably high resolution of δ x 6 25 km the true baroclinic growth rate is only slightly diminished but at coarser scales the amount of dissipation necessary to stop the instability might be sufficient to detrimentally affect the primary instability biharmonic viscosity is usually preferred over harmonic viscosity in eddying simulations because it helps confine unphysical dissipation to the smallest horizontal scales fig 5 b shows that when using the standard second order discretization of advection biharmonic viscosity damps the spurious instability at the smallest scales but not at intermediate scales this residual weakly growing spurious instability at intermediate scales is unsavory and can be eliminated by using fourth order tracer advection the salutary combined effects of biharmonic viscosity and fourth order tracer advection are shown in fig 5 b it is clear from fig 5 b that the viscosities prescribed in eq 50 are slightly larger than necessary to damp the spurious instability the results in fig 4 indicate that this will be more pronounced at smaller richardson numbers naturally other considerations also conspire to set the value of viscous and diffusive coefficients in eddying ocean model simulations and the prescriptions of eq 50 should be regarded as guidelines 4 5 comparison to nonlinear simulations to verify that the linear stability analysis corresponds with the behavior of ocean models we computed unstable perturbations from the linear instability analysis and introduced them as initial conditions in nonlinear simulations the simulations were run using the mitgcm code marshall et al 1997 in a horizontally periodic domain of size 1200 400 4 km with grid spacing 4 km in the horizontal and 100 uniformly spaced vertical levels the parameters of the background flow were set to n 2 10 6 s 2 m 2 10 9 s 2 and f 0 10 4 s 1 an initial perturbation was introduced with zonal wavelength of 4 δ x 16 km i e with wavenumber equal to half the nyquist wavenumber and with vertical profile that yields the fastest linear growth for perturbations of that scale the perturbation was normalized so that the maximum velocity was 0 1 cm s this perturbation has a wavelength that should be stable in the exact eady problem by contrast the linear stability analysis of the second order c grid discretization predicts a growth rate of 2 18 10 7 s 1 the kinetic energy of the perturbations should thus grow at a rate of approximately 2 2 18 10 7 4 36 10 7 s 1 the nonlinear simulation was run for 100 days and the total kinetic energy was tracked over this time period the total kinetic energy grew by a factor of more than 1000 the instantaneous growth rate of kinetic energy was estimated at each day using the formula ke growth rate 1 τ ln ke t τ ke t where τ is one day and ke is the total kinetic energy fig 6 a shows a time series of the estimated growth rate of kinetic energy the computed growth rate is close to the value predicted by the linear theory 4 36 10 7 s 1 after 250 days the growth is sufficient for nonlinear effects to appear which ends the exponential growth this simulation verifies the existence of a spurious linear instability in the c grid eady problem the linear theory says that when fourth order tracer advection is used there are no eigenvalues with positive real part for perturbations with this wavelength one could follow the procedure above by computing any eigenvector of the linear problem and introducing it as an initial perturbation to the nonlinear simulation but this might be unsatisfying because the linear theory suggests that any perturbation with this wavelength is stable in fact this suggestion that having no unstable eigenvalues implies that no solutions will grow is false unless the linear system is normal a complex matrix a is normal when it commutes with its complex conjugate transpose i e aa a a a normal matrix has a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors and the growth or decay of solutions to the linear system of differential equations y a y is determined completely by the eigenvalues of a the matrix l in eq 46 is not normal for the second order fourth order or exact systems and therefore does not have a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors one of the ramifications of this fact is that solutions of the linear system can grow even when all the eigenvalues have non positive real part non normal behavior is common in fluid dynamics and its presence in the quasigeostrophic eady problem was noted by farrell and ioannou 1996 the goal of this section is to verify the linear theory in a nonlinear simulation not to perform a full generalized stability analysis in the vein of farrell and ioannou 1996 with that in mind we introduced the same initial perturbation from the second order simulation described above into a simulation using fourth order tracer advection the perturbation grows but this is not a contradiction of the linear theory the linear theory predicts that the instantaneous growth rate associated with this particular perturbation the instantaneous growth rate is y l l y y 2 where y is the initial perturbation is 4 36 10 7 s 1 the growth rate measured from the nonlinear simulation is shown in fig 6 b the first 100 days show wildly varying estimates of the linear growth rate which then settles down to a value close to the theoretically predicted value this validates the linear theory while simultaneously illustrating the dangers of over interpreting eigenvalues in non normal systems 5 conclusions this paper investigates the effect of horizontal discretization on baroclinic and symmetric instabilities in the hydrostatic eady problem the effects of vertical discretization are minimized by using uniform high resolution in the vertical the effects of vertical discretization on baroclinic instability have been studied by arakawa and moorthi 1988 bell and white 1988 and bell and white 2017 in the horizontal the standard flux form energy conserving second order b and c grid discretizations are considered along with the two forms of vector invariant discretizations on the c grid the flux form and vector invariant enstrophy conserving ens schemes madec 2008 on the c grid give a better representation of symmetric instability than the b grid the latter has growth rates that are generally too small the vector invariant enstrophy and energy conserving een scheme on the c grid arakawa and lamb 1981 madec 2008 has too large growth rates for symmetric instability at small scales this behavior is presumably related to the hollingsworth instability hollingsworth et al 1983 and the symmetric instability of the computational kind discussed by bell et al 2017 and ducousso et al 2017 the representation of baroclinic instability on the b grid is qualitatively correct at eddy permitting and eddy resolving resolutions no spurious instabilities are observed and the primary deficiency is that the growth rates can be on the order of 10 too small at eddy permitting resolution since mesoscale eddies are energized by baroclinic instability this suggests that eddies in a b grid model at eddy permitting resolution might extract too little potential energy from the large scale flow resulting in eddies that are too weak this explanation for the weakness of eddies at eddy permitting resolution is in stark contrast to the energetic picture assumed in many recent eddy permitting parameterization studies that either assume that the missing energy comes from energetic backscatter from subgrid scales grooms and majda 2013 kitsios et al 2013 grooms and majda 2014 grooms et al 2015b or that the eddies are overly damped by viscosity jansen and held 2014 the relative importance of anemic baroclinic production missing backscatter and spurious dissipation in the energy budget of eddies at eddy permitting resolution remains unknown a spurious baroclinic instability was discovered on the c grid where the flux form discretization and the two vector invariant forms all give the same results this spurious instability is peaked at scales just below the smallest resolvable nyquist scale but has relatively large vertical scales the unstable perturbations manifest primarily in the velocity field primarily cross front with a weak signature in the density field the growth rates scale similarly to the baroclinic growth rate with a peak growth rate of approximately f 0 2 ri where ri is the richardson number this growth rate is approximately independent of the grid scale δx and the spurious instability does not disappear as the grid is refined instead it simply moves to smaller scales it was found that fourth order centered tracer advection significantly improves the spurious instability confining it to the very smallest scales but not significantly reducing its growth rate curiously using fourth order momentum advection had little positive impact overall it is suggested that eddy permitting and eddy resolving models on the c grid should use fourth order tracer advection with biharmonic viscosity and diffusion with coefficients ν 4 κ 4 f 0 δ x 4 32 r i for mesoscale richardson numbers on the order of 100 and eddy resolving grid scales less than 10 km this amount of dissipation is not excessive the lack of spurious baroclinic instability on the b grid suggests that b grid models might be more appropriate for eddy permitting and eddy resolving simulations though perhaps not for simulations resolving submesoscales and smaller even on the b grid higher order numerics might improve eddy permitting ocean models though fourth order tracer advection was not found to improve the growth rates these models are defined by the fact that the eddy scales are not much larger than the grid scale low and high order methods all give similarly accurate results for scales that are well resolved by the grid higher order methods are distinguished by giving better approximations at intermediate scales that are partially resolved by the grid e g wavelengths four to six times the grid spacing and seem naturally suited to eddy permitting modeling neither low nor high order methods give accurate approximations for very small scales with wavelengths near twice the grid spacing grooms et al 2015a recently found that an idealized eddy permitting model with fourth order numerics gave better short time forecasting and data assimilation performance than a model with second order numerics and that the improvement was comparable in magnitude to the improvement obtained by using improved subgrid scale parameterizations the eady baroclinic instability is a type of baroclinic instability not often seen in the ocean tulloch et al 2011 find that baroclinic instability in oceans typically results from a change of sign of the mean potential vorticity gradient in the interior phillips type or of the combination of a surface shear and an interior mean potential vorticity gradient ocean charney type the eady problem is analyzed here because the coefficients in the linear perturbation equations are independent of the x and y coordinates more realistic non uniform vertical mean shear would through geostrophic balance result in linear perturbation equations with coefficients that depend on the y coordinate this does not happen in the quasigeostrophic approximation which prevents the use of a full normal mode expansion because of this mismatch between the character of the eady problem and of baroclinic instability in the oceans the behavior reported here should be extrapolated to more complex ocean models with caution finally the analysis here has focused on the two quadrilateral grid schemes most common in global ocean models the arakawa b and c grids it is of interest to pursue a similar analysis on the hexagonal grid used in the mpas ocean model ringler et al 2013 the methods used by thuburn 2008 to study free wave propagation on hexagonal grids may be adapted to the baroclinic instability problem but the analysis is sufficiently complex that it merits a separate study acknowledgments i grooms is grateful to f bryan and k lindsay for providing references on the

nsf grant dms 1407340 appendix a normal mode equations the way to eliminate hydrostatic pressure is the same on both the b and c grids on both grids the discrete hydrostatic balance for a normal mode

the baroclinic pressure has no barotropic component this allows us to eliminate the baroclinic pressure by an equation of the form a 2 p p b where p is a square matrix the entries are available in closed form but the expressions are unwieldy the vertical velocity is obtained by integrating the discrete incompressibility condition which has different forms on the b and c grids on the b grid we have a 3 1 δ z 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 w a y δ x u a x δ y v and on the c grid a 4 1 δ z 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 w δ x u δ y v the inverse of this coefficient matrix is available in closed form it is δz times a lower triangular matrix whose diagonal and sub diagonal elements are all ones the vertical velocity only appears in the linear perturbation equations in the form a z w so we will write a 5 a z w w a y δ x u a x δ y v on the b grid and a 6 a z w w δ x u δ y v on the c grid where the matrix w is in both cases a 7 δ z 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 it remains to eliminate the barotropic

24116,the ability to parameterize southern ocean eddy effects in a forced coarse resolution ocean general circulation model is assessed the transient model response to a suite of different southern ocean wind stress forcing perturbations is presented and compared to identical experiments performed with the same model in 0 1 eddy resolving resolution with forcing of present day wind stress magnitude and a thickness diffusivity formulated in terms of the local stratification it is shown that the southern ocean residual meridional overturning circulation in the two models is different in structure and magnitude it is found that the difference in the upper overturning cell is primarily explained by an overly strong subsurface flow in the parameterized eddy induced circulation while the difference in the lower cell is mainly ascribed to the mean flow overturning with a zonally constant decrease of the zonal wind stress by 50 we show that the absolute decrease in the overturning circulation is insensitive to model resolution and that the meridional isopycnal slope is relaxed in both models the agreement between the models is not reproduced by a 50 wind stress increase where the high resolution overturning decreases by 20 but increases by 100 in the coarse resolution model it is demonstrated that this difference is explained by changes in surface buoyancy forcing due to a reduced antarctic sea ice cover which strongly modulate the overturning response and ocean stratification we conclude that the parameterized eddies are able to mimic the transient response to altered wind stress in the high resolution model but partly misrepresent the unperturbed southern ocean meridional overturning circulation and associated heat transports keywords southern ocean eddy compensation parameterized sensitivity 1 introduction the outcropping isopycnals of the southern ocean provide an important adiabatic pathway for the meridional overturning circulation and hence aid the ventilation of the deep ocean marshall and speer 2012 together with the zonally unblocked antarctic circumpolar current the southern ocean thus plays a central role in the modern view of the ocean general circulation gnanadesikan 1999 thompson et al 2016 the global carbon cycle sigman and boyle 2000 le quéré et al 2007 bronselaer et al 2016 ocean heat uptake marshall and zanna 2014 and the exchange of tracers between the major ocean basins thompson 2008 the southern hemisphere westerlies are a key driving force of the circulation e g toggweiler and samuels 1995 tansley and marshall 2001 and these have been subject to an intensification and poleward shift throughout the last several decades as a result of ozone depletion and anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide thompson and solomon 2002 marshall 2003 a fundamental question is what implication the wind stress changes have on the global circulation and climate and whether the relevant physics is faithfully represented in state of the art climate models to allow for meaningful predictions of the response in this respect the mesoscale eddy field in the southern ocean e g frenger et al 2015 has proven to have a leading order influence on the local dynamics ocean models of varying complexity and basin geometry but with an explicitly resolved eddy field have demonstrated that a limit exists in which the time mean transport of a circumpolar current becomes independent of the strength of the overlying zonal wind stress hogg and blundell 2006 nadeau and straub 2009 munday et al 2013 marshall et al 2017 beyond this limit additional momentum input to the surface ocean by the winds mainly fuel a stronger eddy field through baroclinic instability which facilitates a vertical momentum transfer to the ocean floor and dissipation by form drag munk and palmén 1951 johnson and bryden 1989 instead of accelerating the current recent observations from the southern ocean have shown that the isopycnal slope and hence the baroclinic transport of the antarctic circumpolar current has indeed been insensitive to the wind stress changes böning et al 2008 while the surface kinetic energy has increased hogg et al 2015 supporting the model results and the notion that the southern ocean is in the so called state of eddy saturation contemporary residual mean theory also emphasizes the role of mesoscale eddies in setting the strength of the upper cell of the meridional overturning in the southern ocean here they compensate the effect of a wind driven northward ekman flow anomaly through an oppositely directed flow akin to a stokes drift referred to as eddy compensation see e g marshall and radko 2003 the results from models with explicit eddies show that this is indeed the case hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 but also that the sensitivity of the overturning circulation remains non zero to a wind stress strength that is several times greater than the present day magnitude unlike the behavior of the zonal transport munday et al 2013 using an idealized primitive equation model at various eddying resolutions morrison and hogg 2013 likewise demonstrate the sensitivity difference between the zonal and meridional circulation to the zonal wind stress they argue that the sensitivity difference arises because eddy compensation is a depth dependent metric whereas eddy saturation is depth integrated and thus camouflages potentially higher local sensitivities in the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity field in a recent high resolution coupled model experiment run for two model decades bishop et al 2016 shows that the upper cell of the residual overturning increases in magnitude by 39 to a zonally constant 50 increase of the southern ocean zonal wind stress and that the mean drake passage transport changes by 6 only the degree of compensation and saturation that should be expected on a longer time scale is however still unclear as computational cost limits sufficiently long integrations of comprehensive high resolution ocean models moreover the non local response of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to a southern ocean wind stress change is continuously debated for example it has been suggested that models with idealized basin geometry do not capture the changes in diapycnal upwelling in the pacific ocean since this diabatic pathway is also able to provide the necessary closure for the meridional overturning circulation these models potentially overestimate the role of the southern ocean winds jochum and eden 2015 the results from eddy resolving ocean models despite their simplifications and shortcomings have questioned the ability of coarse resolution ocean models to represent the eddy effect on the large scale flow in a wind stress change scenario most climate models use the gent mcwilliams parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 to model baroclinic instability and along isopycnal eddy mixing in the interior ocean and rely on the assumption that the strength of baroclinic instability is proportional to the isopycnal slope comparison studies have shown that when the proportionality parameter in the eddy down gradient closure the thickness diffusivity is a constant the zonal transport cannot possibly eddy saturate and the meridional circulation is too sensitive to wind stress changes hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 munday et al 2013 when the eddy diffusivity is allowed to vary in space and time as function of the stratification ferreira et al 2005 danabasoglu and marshall 2007 the transport through drake passage shows a less sensitive relationship to the zonal wind stress gent and danabasoglu 2011 however the change in the residual overturning still varies considerably among models subject to the same wind stress increase farneti et al 2015 which complicates an assessment of the parameterized eddy effect both bitz and polvani 2012 and bryan et al 2014 compare climate change experiments between a fully coupled coarse resolution model using above parameterization and an identical eddy resolving model the model solutions in the study by bryan et al 2014 show that the poleward eddy heat transport between 60 s and 50 s increases following an increase in the zonal wind stress in their low resolution model setup whereas the high resolution model finds a response of opposite sign bitz and polvani 2012 report similar model responses where the resolved eddies contribute substantially less to the change in poleward heat transport compared to the parameterized eddies while these results suggest that the parameterized eddies respond oppositely or overly strong to a wind stress change ambiguity on the performance of the eddy parameterization still remains because the modelled wind stress changes are dependent on the background climate this is not necessarily the same at different model resolution exemplified by bryan et al 2014 where differences in antarctic sea ice thickness influence the modelled climate response in addition an increasing body of literature has shown that the strength of the antarctic circumpolar current and the position of its fronts is sensitive to the spatial structure and strength of the wind stress field sallée et al 2008 morrow et al 2010 mazloff 2012 dufour et al 2012 zika et al 2013 langlais et al 2015 the compilation of these results suggest a return to simpler general circulation model experimental setups with a complete control on the applied wind stress to elucidate the nature of the response in the present study we present simulations from the second version of the parallel ocean program pop model configured at a horizontal resolution of 1 and 0 1 the former employing a state of the art eddy parameterization forced with different prescribed southern ocean wind stress scenarios in an attempt to evaluate the performance of parameterized eddies the results presented here indicate that the parameterized eddy induced meridional circulation cancel the wind driven overturning differently than the eddy resolving model when forced with present day winds despite differences in the background ocean state we demonstrate that the two models respond similarly to wind stress perturbations but note that the model comparison is not straightforward as changes in buoyancy forcing and sea ice cover are able to drive a complex model response the latter point raises the question to what extent the current concept of eddy compensation is applicable to complex models 2 model description experimental setup and spin up assessment we use the community earth system model cesm with an active ocean and sea ice model on a global domain with realistic bottom topography with prescribed meteorological boundary conditions the ocean and sea ice models share the same grid and the solution of the governing equations is sought using two different horizontal grid resolutions a tri polar 0 1 grid with the meridional grid spacing proportional to the cosine of latitude and a dipole 1 grid that also has a meridional grid discretization that varies with latitude with a latitudinal grid spacing of 0 5 in the southern ocean the vertical axis that belongs to the first grid is resolved by 62 z coordinate levels with the distance of separation increasing monotonically with depth and has a partial bottom cell representation in accord with the etopo2v2 bathymetry product the coarse resolution grid holds 60 levels in the vertical and with no partial bottom cells the dynamical core of the ocean model is the same for both grid resolutions and is documented in smith et al 2010 except for the treatment of motion on the mesoscale which is outlined in the next paragraph for further information on the grid layouts and aspects of the control integration of the fully coupled models the reader is referred to gent et al 2011 and small et al 2014 with respect to the coarse and the fine resolution model

2008 compiled from atmospheric reanalysis and observations and the fields have a temporal resolution of six hours and repeat themselves after one model year exactly ideally the model solution that evolves on the 0 1 grid should be subject to motion on a characteristic length scale on the order of the first baroclinic rossby radius chelton et al 1998 and no mesoscale eddy parameterization is therefore enabled the isopycnal tracer diffusion is likewise disabled but a biharmonic operator is implemented to represent lateral mixing by subgrid scale processes that remain unresolved bryan and bachman 2015 ocean mesoscale eddies are not explicitly resolved on the 1 grid and are parameterized in the interior ocean using the gent and mcwilliams 1990 isopycnal mixing formulation with the spatiotemporal thickness diffusivity proposed by ferreira et al 2005 this choice of the eddy transfer coefficient ensures that it is surface intensified in alignment with previous studies and has shown to improve the model solution with respect to observations of the southern ocean density structure and leads to a greater cancellation between the wind driven and eddy induced southern ocean meridional cells danabasoglu and marshall 2007 farneti et al 2015 as default in pop the parameterized ocean interior eddy fluxes are modified towards the surface boundary layer in accord with ferrari et al 2008 where diabatic eddy fluxes are aligned with the surface ocean of additional relevance to this study convective instability is handled implicitly in both models that is the local vertical diffusivity is increased by several orders of magnitude when the water column is statically unstable during statically stable conditions the vertical mixing is parameterized as in large et al 1994 the model on the 1 grid was initialized from a state of rest and the property fields from the polar science center hydrographic climatology steele et al 2001 and a control simulation labelled ccont of 300 model years was integrated forward with the default wind stress denoted by τ 0 τ 0 ϕ τ 0 θ the control simulation with the 0 1 model labelled hcont was also initialized from rest but the initial conditions to the salt and temperature fields were instead provided by the world ocean circulation experiment hydrographic climatology gouretski and koltermann 2004 the first 16 years of hcont were conducted at the national center for atmospheric research and is described in detail in bryan and bachman 2015 the model run was hereafter adopted by the authors and integrated additionally ten years forward in time to reach a total hcont length of 26 years several wind stress change experiments were branched off from the last year of both ccont and hcont with the zonal wind stress in the southern ocean subject to 1 τ ϕ ϕ θ t τ 0 ϕ ϕ θ t f θ where τϕ is the perturbed zonal wind stress f is a time invariant perturbation that has a zonally constant structure expressed by 2 f θ f 0 for θ 35 s a π 180 θ b for 35 s θ 25 s 1 otherwise and it is understood that θ increases northward here f 0 is the perturbation factor and a and b were chosen such that the linear decrease of the perturbation with latitude matches f 0 at θ 35 s and unity at 25 s this is the same perturbation that was used in the coupled model studies by gent and danabasoglu 2011 jochum and eden 2015 and bishop et al 2016 table 1 summaries the suite of wind stress experiments presented in this paper as well as their abbreviations and provides the coefficients specific to the applied perturbations a 50 wind stress increase and decrease experiment blue and magenta line upper left panel of fig 1 were extended from the end of the high resolution control simulation labelled htau15 and htau05 respectively both of 16 years duration the output from htau15 and htau05 as well as the last year from hcont was stored as three day mean fields and subsequently reduced to monthly means to fit the purpose of this study identical perturbations to the wind stress field were conducted with the coarse resolution model the experiments labelled ctau05 and ctau15 both of 100 model year duration as will become evident later in the reading of the present study the wind stress increase perturbation pushes the state of the marginal seas of the southern ocean towards a state that favors deep convection which influences the overturning response in htau15 to emphasize this point a double wind stress increase experiment green line upper left panel of fig 1 with the 1 model labelled ctau20 is performed also of 100 year duration throughout this study and unless otherwise stated the analysis of ccont and hcont is conducted on the ten years that lead up to the application of the wind stress perturbation that is year 16 to 25 for hcont and year 290 to 299 for ccont the analysis of the high resolution wind stress experiments is focussed on the last ten years the time span between year 33 and 42 and the corresponding time span for the coarse resolution experiments is between year 307 and 316 the time mean of ctau20 is taken between model year 313 to 322 shifted by six years relative to ctau15 due to a difference in the timing of the onset of deep convection relative to htau15 the black curve in the upper left panel of fig 1 shows the annual mean zonally averaged zonal wind stress profile that arises from the unperturbed forcing field and the peak wind stress is smaller by approximately 25 than what is found in the coupled model configuration gent and danabasoglu 2011 bryan et al 2014 bishop et al 2016 comparing the time mean drake passage transport profile from hcont to the corresponding profile from ccont it is seen that there is an overall good agreement between the models in terms of the vertical velocity shear upper right panel fig 1 the depth integrated volume transport of hcont and ccont yields similar time mean drake passage transports of 133 sv and 136 sv respectively and compares well with the 134 27 sv full depth observational estimate reviewed by cunningham et al 2003 the more recent estimate of 141 13 sv by koenig et al 2014 based on satellite altimetry and mooring data agrees with the presented model solutions as well although the 173 11 sv estimate by donohue et al 2016 which additionally includes a barotropic contribution from resolved near bottom currents suggests that the modelled drake passage transport in both models is too low the winter mean boundary layer depth simulated in the two models defined in large et al 1994 is seen in the lower row of plots in fig 1 as well as the 15 austral winter mean july august september sea ice concentration isoline from the model white line and from the special sensor microwave imager observations black line comiso 2000 the boundary layer depth of ccont left in general agrees with hcont right on the large scale but hcont also possesses several local maxima of which some occur in proximity of topographic obstacles and has a deeper boundary layer in the path of the antarctic circumpolar current in the indian ocean sector hcont also displays a deeper boundary layer close to the coast of antarctica especially in the weddell sea which is the signature of dense water formation the observed extent of the winter sea ice cover in general compares well with the two model simulations though with a misrepresentation in the pacific sector in ccont and a too large extent in hcont to the east of drake passage and south of australia the computational costs of the 0 1 model made it difficult to integrate the high resolution simulations closer to their equilibrium solution given our resources the total sum of 42 high resolution model years required more than a year to complete on 4096 cores of the bluegene supercomputer located in jülich germany and exhausted our resources model drift therefore remains and it is here examined in hcont to identify the fraction of the model response presented in the results section which is due to model drift the upper left panel of fig 2 displays the evolution of the horizontally averaged potential temperature field of the southern ocean in hcont from model year 16 to 25 on decadal time scale as is the interest of the present study significant drift is present between 1000 m and 400 m depth the southern ocean warms at a rate about 0 2 c decade at 600 m depth and is of the same magnitude and location as the warming trend presented by small et al 2014 who examine the model in its coupled configuration the abyssal ocean also warms but equilibrates the slowest and does not drift much on the decadal time scale for comparison ccont which is integrated much further towards equilibrium warms by approx 0 003 c decade only at 600 m depth evaluated between model year 290 and 299 the ten year mean temperature profiles of both ccont blue and hcont black are shown in the upper right panel the profiles in the deep ocean match quite well but hcont is seen to be warmer by 1 c than ccont above 1km depth and the difference becomes bigger as time progress due to the model drift however the meridional density gradient across the southern ocean does not appear to be affected by the difference in temperature stratification and the model drift as is indirectly inferred from the time series of the drake passage transport in the lower panel of fig 2 the strength of the southern ocean meridional overturning circulation also does not appear to drift which is discussed in greater detail in section 4 and shown in fig 5 we thus consider a comparison between the high and coarse resolution model meaningful but the shortness and drift of the high resolution model integrations is a caveat of the present study that should be kept in mind 3 decomposition of the meridional overturning circulation to avoid the representation of artificial diapycnal flows in the southern ocean the analysis of the meridional overturning circulation is here performed in density coordinates in accord with previous related studies e g hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 munday et al 2013 bishop et al 2016 when remapped to vertical coordinates such overturning circulation is found to respect the adiabatic nature of the interior ocean with streamlines approximately aligned with the isolines of the density field döös and webb 1994 viebahn and eden 2012 the time mean of the isopycnal stream function is given by 3 ψ i θ σ 0 2 π η b ϕ θ η ϕ θ t v ϕ θ z t d z r cos θ d ϕ where ϕ θ and z are the usual spherical coordinates r is earth s radius and σ is potential density ηb is the depth of the ocean bottom and η ϕ θ t is the depth of the surface of constant σ that varies in both space and time denotes the averaging operator with respect to the time coordinate the overturning streamfunction is split into various components by decomposing the velocity and density fields into different terms that each are governed by distinct physics the decomposition here consists of separating the velocity and density field into a time mean and the deviation about it v ϕ θ z t v ϕ θ z v ϕ θ z t and likewise for σ the isopycnal streamfunction that arises from the time mean fields is here denoted ψi and is given by 4 ψ i θ σ 0 2 π η b ϕ θ η ϕ θ v ϕ θ z d z r cos θ d ϕ where η is the height of the time mean density surface σ the difference between the time mean of the isopycnal streamfunction and the streamfunction derived from the time mean fields is the deviation from the time mean 5 ψ i ψ i ψ i which captures the motion that varies on a temporal time scale shorter than the time span of the applied time averaging operator on a time scale less than a couple of months the transient mesoscale eddy field is known to be a dominating contribution to ψ i ballarotta et al 2013 and its nature is to oppose the time mean flow the residual that arises from the cancellation between these two cells is thus given by the isopycnal streamfunction ψ i which advects tracers and other physical properties the mesoscale eddy field is not resolved in the coarse resolution 1 model and is instead represented by the eddy induced transport velocities given by the implemented eddy parameterization the isopycnal overturning streamfunction is here calculated as 6 ψ i 0 2 π η b η v d z r cos θ d ϕ 0 2 π η b η v gm d z r cos θ d ϕ where v gm is the meridional component of the eddy induced velocity field the first term on the right hand side of eq 6 is the overturning streamfunction associated with the mean flow and the second term is the time mean eddy induced overturning streamfunction which in the analysis that follows are compared to the high resolution overturning streamfunctions ψi and ψ i respectively 3 1 choice of temporal resolution as seen from satellite altimetry frenger et al 2015 reports that the mean lifespan of a southern ocean eddy is about ten weeks this is supported by the study by ballarotta et al 2013 who uses a 1 4 global ocean model to show that an estimate of the overturning streamfunction obtained with the use of monthly mean output fields captures the majority of the eddy variability however the present study uses a model of 1 10 resolution which possesses more energy at the high frequencies and large wavenumbers to assess the difference in the representation of the residual meridional overturning circulation in the 1 10 model at different temporal resolution we compute ψ i of htau05 with both monthly mean and three day mean model output the left panel of fig 3 shows the ten year mean of ψ i between model year 33 and 42 calculated using monthly mean fields the right panel shows the same as the left panel but calculated using three day mean output the characteristics of the eddy induced overturning is discussed in the succeeding section and here we focus on its dependence on temporal resolution only the structure of ψ i is more or less independent from the temporal resolution of the output fields but its magnitude does vary the minimum in the heavier water masses changes from 10 sv to 14 sv when the temporal resolution is increased but the second minimum closer to the surface between 50 s and 40 s changes by less than 1 sv the latter minimum is associated with the overturning in the upper cell which has been the primary focus in the discussion of eddy compensation in the southern ocean since this eddy motion appears to vary mostly on a time scale that exceeds a month an appropriate estimate of the overturning metrics is possible to obtain by using monthly mean fields the minimum of the eddy overturning in the densest water is though underestimated by approximately 30 by this choice the results presented in the subsequent section are all computed using monthly mean fields since the main focus of this study is on the upper overturning cell 4 results 4 1 background state overturning fig 4 presents the ten year mean spatial structure of the meridional overturning circulation in the southern ocean from the two default simulations as well as its decomposition as function of potential density referenced to 2000 db the decomposition of the overturning follows the procedure outlined in section 3 and the potential density axis was discretized into 200 equally spaced levels between 1033 0 kg m3 and 1037 5 kg m3 for both model solutions the black solid line in all panels is the zonal mean of the surface potential density field averaged over the same ten year time span and gives an approximate indication of the ocean surface the residual circulation upper panels fig 4 from both models in general show a quasi adiabatic inflow of circumpolar deep water to the southern ocean in the density range 1036 5 kg m3 1037 0 kg m3 and a transformation and separation of water masses as the water upwells at higher southern latitudes the water that upwells north of the separation point gains buoyancy at the surface and returns northward in the surface ekman layer this flow pattern is referred to as the upper cell farneti et al 2015 transformation of lower circumpolar deep water the denser fraction of the water that enters the southern ocean to bottom water between 65 s and 75 s is also seen in both model solutions which replenish the bottom water masses that partly flows northward in the abyss and partly upwells due to mixing marshall and speer 2012 this circulation is referred to as the lower cell other cells such as the anti clockwise subtropical cell and anti clockwise recirculation between 50 s and 55 s are also seen at both model resolutions but are not discussed further see farneti et al 2015 for a thorough discussion on these cells the amount of dense water that flows into the southern ocean at 40 s and subsequently upwells is about 30 sv in hcont but only 12 sv in ccont from the minimum and maximum of the lower and upper cell respectively it is seen that the water that upwells to the surface divides approximately evenly between the two in hcont with an overturning of 15 sv in the upper cell and 17 sv in the lower cell in ccont a substantial recirculation is seen in the lower cell with a bottom water formation of 12 sv between 70 and 60 s but only 5 sv leaves the domain to the north through the abyss this is an expression of the weak formation of antarctic bottom water in ccont gent et al 2011 the remaining 7 sv that enters the southern ocean leaves through the upper cell similar residual overturning structures are also seen in the coupled model configuration of cesm as well as the difference between the high and the low resolution runs albeit with overall stronger amplitude due to overly strong modelled southern ocean winds gent and danabasoglu 2011 bishop et al 2016 in comparison to the multi model study by farneti et al 2015 the upper cell strength of 7 sv in ccont is considerably weaker than the 12 to 18 sv found in most state of the art coarse resolution climate models forced with the core v2 1958 2007 reanalysis product this difference is at least partly explained by the fact that the southern ocean winds are subject to a 30 intensification in this period the time series of the maximum and minimum of the upper and lower cell of the residual meridional overturning circulation from hcont upper right panel of fig 4 are shown by the black and green curve in fig 5 respectively both time series show pronounced interannual variability that arises from the resolved eddy field and an annual cycle is also visible the maxima of the upper cell fall during the austral winter months where the zonal winds and the northward surface ekman current are the strongest see yuan 2004 for an observational estimate of the seasonality in the southern ocean winds the minima of the bottom cell also occur during the winter months and is associated with the production of dense water due to an intense buoyancy loss to the atmosphere and brine rejection from sea ice formation also neither time series possess any clear trend although the first two years of the lower cell appear to have a stronger more negative summer overturning the same time series are also provided for ccont magenta and blue lines for the upper and lower cell respectively which are seen to share many features with hcont but with a more uniform annual cycle and a weaker circulation in general that was also reflected in the spatial structure of the residual overturning upper panels fig 4 looking into the decomposition of the meridional flow the overturning that arises from the time mean velocity fields middle panels fig 4 is overall stronger than the residual and the subsurface maximum of the upper cell is also more comparable between the two models this is not a surprise as the models are subject to identical surface boundary conditions and no cancellation from the transient eddies is present in this metric a closed cell of clockwise circulation is also seen in both model solutions at the surface at about 1035 kg m3 and 45 s again present in the coupled model solutions as well it is also interesting to note that the flow in the abyss between 60 s and 50 s is entirely eddy induced in ccont left panel but only partly at 0 1 resolution right panel the flow driven by the transient eddies is different between the two models lower panels fig 4 whereas both models show that the eddy cell in general counteracts the time mean flow and that the cells span the same latitude density space the minima of the eddy driven overturning is differently located the parameterized eddy field gives rise to a subsurface minimum in the densest waters between 50 s and 60 s and another subsurface minimum around 45 s and 1035 75 kg m3 left panel the explicit eddy field right panel also gives rise to the subsurface minimum in the densest water but has a vanishing subsurface flow around 1036 kg m3 between 40 s and 50 s this difference in spatial structure gives rise to different cancellations between the time mean and the eddy induced flow resulting in the weaker residual overturning of the upper cell in the coarse resolution model 4 2 wind stress perturbation experiments 4 2 1 circulation response the model response that follows from the wind stress perturbations is reflected in the residual meridional overturning circulation shown in fig 6 the panels display the difference between the perturbation experiments and the control in accord with the averaging intervals mentioned in section 2 the upper row of panels display the results from the high resolution model and the middle row of panels from the coarse resolution model the left middle and right column of panels is for the tau05 tau15 and tau20 experiment respectively in terms of structure and absolute magnitude ctau05 and htau05 show similar transient responses to the wind stress decrease both models show a weakening of similar magnitude of the upper overturning cell and a smaller weakening of the lower overturning cell confined to high southern latitudes the maximum of the upper overturning cell in htau05 decreases from 15 sv to 6 sv a 60 reduction whereas the upper cell of ctau05 collapses and finds a decrease of the upper cell maximum by 9 sv which corresponds to 130 relative decrease the weakening of the lower cell corresponds to a northward retreat in both models and the cell strength changes from 10 sv to 6 sv in ctau05 and from 17 sv to 10 sv in htau05 at 65 s the ten year mean drake passage transport decreases in ctau05 and htau05 by 12 and 4 sv with respect to their control values respectively see table 2 during the same time interval shifting focus to the wind stress increase experiment it is immediately seen that ctau15 and htau15 are subject to different transient model responses ctau15 finds a general increase of the upper cell and an increase and displacement of the maximum from 7 sv to 14 sv as well as an increase in the zonal transport by 11 sv a greater value of the average thickness diffusivity κ is also seen table 2 but the change amounts to less than 10 compared to ccont relatively small changes are seen in the lower cell between 70 s and 60 s but a closer inspection also reveals that the positive changes seen in the densest waters between 60 s and the northern southern ocean reflects a weakening of the northward movement of bottom water suprisingly htau15 shows a weakening of the upper cell and a relatively large increase in the drake passage transport by 47 sv opposite to the response seen in ctau15 and different from the structure of the weakening seen in htau05 the maximum of the upper cell decreases by about 3 sv but the lower cell increases in strength by several times the control value fundamentally different to ctau15 the inflow of water to the southern ocean increases in the 0 1 model but the vast majority of the water enters the lower cell and leaves the domain through the abyss the water that inflows in the 1 model increases as well albeit weakly but this water leaves the domain entirely through the upper cell the root cause of the different circulation responses to the stronger winds is at least partly due to the onset of deep convection in the weddell sea in htau15 this response is similar to the model simulation presented in cheon et al 2013 in some aspects and causes a sea ice retreat and an anomalous heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere a detailed account of the physical processes that lead to a destabilization of the water column is beyond the scope of the present study it is though relevant to remark that minor differences in the weddell sea background stratification between ccont and hcont prevents deep convection in ctau15 the weddell sea hydrography is in general sensitive to model setup see e g kjellsson et al 2015 a stronger increase in the zonal wind stress in the coarse resolution model by 100 ctau20 does trigger weddell sea deep convection and enhances the lower overturning cell in a similar manner as seen in htau15 fig 6 right middle panel but the upper overturning cell appears less affected also as seen from table 2 both κ and the drake passage transport enhance by 32 and 44 respectively which indicate substantial changes in the ocean stratification the difference in involved physics in principle render a comparison of the eddy compensation between ctau15 and htau15 inappropriate because the eddy induced overturning component ψ i of htau15 is influenced by the transients of the bottom water formation this difference in the behavior of the residual meridional overturning circulation in ctau15 htau15 and ctau20 displays that the southern ocean model response is far from trivial when two overturning cells are present as is the case in more comprehensive ocean models as previously emphasized in the literature e g munday et al 2013 eddy compensation is a steady state argument the lower left and middle panel of fig 6 display the difference in the ten year mean residual overturning from ctau05 and ctau15 after 100 years worth of model integration and thus closer to model equilibrium on centennial time scale both experiments unequivocally show that the initial response in the upper cell attenuates and that the transport anomaly in the lower cell grows ctau05 now features a more modest decrease in the upper cell maximum of 4 sv corresponding to a 43 reduction and ctau15 has regained its control value of approximately 7 sv consistently ctau20 lower right panel also shows a weakening of the initial upper cell response with time from the perspective of parameterized eddies this comparison indicates that the adjustment time of the southern ocean overturning takes place on centennial time scale possibly beyond and that the bottom route as an outflow from the southern ocean appears to grow in importance as the overturning system equilibrates this calls into question whether eddy compensation is meaningfully inferred from the residual meridional overturning as seen in complex model simulations with a representation of both the upper and lower overturning cells and variable surface buoyancy forcing that has not fully equilibrated again comparing to the coupled model studies that similarly use cesm gent and danabasoglu 2011 reports a 1 4 sv increase of the upper cell 100 years subsequent to an increase of the zonal wind stress by 50 and the recirculation in the lower cell is seen to increase as well their figure 3 but with a smaller outflow of the densest water the present study similarly finds a weak response of the upper cell on a centennial time scale though with a stronger outflow from the southern ocean in the abyss compared to ccont on decadal time scale a comparison between the high resolution model responses is possible with active deep convection htau15 is different to its coupled model counterpart in bishop et al 2016 and finds a 20 weakening of the upper cell where they find a strenghening by 39 however both model finds a strengthening of the lower cell which in their study is connected to a thinner austral winter sea ice cover in the weddell sea see their figure 13 much alike the physical response presented here 4 2 2 changes in the 1036 5 kg m3 density surface the change in the meridional slope of the southern ocean isopycnals is a salient measure pertinent to the discussion on the response of the circulation to a wind stress change due to the prevailing thermal wind balance in addition this metric should not be significantly influenced by the deep convection event in regions away from the weddell sea which allow us to indirectly infer the degree of compensation in htau15 the upper panels of fig 7 show the time mean depth of the 1036 5 kg m3 potential density surface henceforth denoted by σ 36 5 from ccont left and hcont right the remaining stereographic plots in the left column display the vertical displacement of the isopycnal between the wind stress perturbation experiments and the control integration for the coarse resolution model the depth changes in the high resolution model is shown in the right column and the lowermost plot shows the zonal mean difference in isopycnal depth for all experiments the difference is taken between the ten year means that are outlined in section 2 the choice to map the changes in σ 36 5 is motivated by fig 4 which show that the upwelling in the southern ocean associated with the upper residual overturning cell is approximately along this density surface in both models both ccont and hcont finds that σ 36 5 sits at a depth that exceeds 1 km in the periphery of the southern ocean and that it outcrops between 50 s and 60 s this is in agreement with the residual meridional overturning circulation which shows that water of density 1036 5 kg m3 is subject to upwelling and transformation in this latitude band ctau05 and htau05 both show a response that holds a zonal pattern a deepening of the isopycnal at high southern latitudes and a rise in the mid latitudes this corresponds to a weakening of the meridional slope of σ 36 5 and a southward displacement of the outcrop line regional differences do exist between the two model responses but the large scale structure is similar this is also seen from the lowermost panel which shows that the peak zonally averaged vertical depression of σ 36 5 magenta lines is about 50 m at high southern latitudes in both ctau05 and htau05 true to both models σ 36 5 rises at high southern latitudes equivalent to a steepening and is depressed farther to the north for the 50 wind stress increase the rise of σ 36 5 in ctau15 is rather modest and mirrors the response seen in ctau05 to a high degree which is also visible in the zonal mean solid blue line the high resolution model on the other hand has an increase of the isopycnal tilt of greater magnitude the greater rise along the path of the antarctic circumpolar current is expected to be the outcome of a complex interplay between the active deep convection in the antarctic polar seas the stronger winds and the transient eddy response however the deepening in the northern part of the domain takes place relatively far away from the deep convection zones and the response is therefore expected to follow the ekman and eddy dynamics alone despite the two local maxima in the deepening in the atlantic sector of htau15 ctau15 overall finds the strongest response in the northern part of the southern ocean as seen from the zonal mean blue lines σ 36 5 displaces with 50 m in ctau15 whereas htau15 finds a zonally averaged maximum deepening of about 25 m this suggests a stronger parameterized sensitivity in ctau15 to the zonal wind stress increase compared to hcont15 4 2 3 northward heat transport response to enable a direct comparison between bitz and polvani 2012 bryan et al 2014 and the present study we investigate the total northward heat transport and its decomposition into contributions from the mean flow and the eddy induced circulation the upper panel of fig 8 shows the total northward heat transport the middle panel the transport by the mean flow and the lower panel the eddy heat transport the heat transport estimate from the coarse resolution model solid lines includes both the heat advection by the bolus velocities and isopycnal diffusion of heat and the contribution from submesoscale eddies is not included the total northward heat transport in the high resolution model dashed lines is obtained by integrating v θ in the zonal and the vertical and the eddy component is obtained by subtracting the product v θ from v θ here θ denotes potential temperature horizontal diffusion of heat due to the biharmonic operator is orders of magnitude smaller than the advective terms and is therefore not included the total heat transport of ccont and hcont solid and dashed black lines upper panel both show that it is directed southward everywhere in the southern ocean and that the two models deviate the greatest between 60 s and 50 s with about 0 1 pw the estimates are in agreement with those modelled by bryan et al 2014 their fig 2 but with a less strong discrepancy north of 40 s the decomposition shows that the northward heat transport by the mean flow middle panel is overall weaker in hcont the eddy contribution lower panel is southward at all latitudes in both models but the parameterized eddies suggest a greater southward eddy heat transport than hcont as was also the case in bryan et al 2014 ctau05 and htau05 magenta lines agree that the northward heat transport decreases north of 55 s when the wind stress is reduced this is primarily due to the changes in the mean flow which follow from the reduced northward surface ekman drift as was also seen in the residual overturning response shown in fig 6 this change is partly balanced by a reduced southward heat transport by the eddies ctau05 suggests a stronger weakening in the total northward heat transport which is a result of a greater change in the mean flow heat transport compared to htau05 in concert with a weaker parameterized eddy response as was already seen from the response in the residual overturning circulation and the density structure ctau15 and htau15 blue lines respond differently to the 50 wind stress increase ctau15 shows a response that is opposite to that seen in ctau05 in the total heat transport and its two components htau15 on the other hand shows that the total heat transport becomes increasingly southward everywhere with a peak southward transport beyond 1pw around 60 s recalling that the eddy transport also encompasses the transient response from the convection in the weddell sea the decomposition shows that both the mean flow and the eddy transport contributes to the increased southward heat transport as was evident from fig 6 the htau15 circulation intensifies as function of the stronger winds but the majority of the water densifies upon upwelling and enters the lower overturning cell fig 8 shows that this enhanced poleward flow also increases the amount of heat that is transported southward a similar response is also seen in ctau20 green lines where the southward heat transport is increased south of 50 s mainly due to the changes in the mean flow the heat transport in the northern part of the southern ocean does not appear to be affected the same way as htau15 by the convection in the polar seas this is in line with the residual overturning response seen in the middle right panel of fig 6 where both the upper and lower cell strength of ctau20 increases as function of the stronger wind stress 4 2 4 buoyancy forcing response an increase in the residual meridional overturning circulation must be accompanied with an increase in the transformation of water masses in the ocean mixed layer we therefore examine the surface buoyancy forcing changes to the wind stress perturbations to understand the thermodynamical response associated with the changes in ψ i we adopt the same approach as in bishop et al 2016 and compute the ocean surface buoyancy forcing as function of the surface heat fluxes atmospheric fresh water contributions from precipitation and evaporation prescribed river run off and contributions from interactions with the active sea ice model the upper panels of fig 9 show the ccont left and hcont right ten year mean surface buoyancy forcing fields a positive buoyancy forcing indicates that the ocean surface became fresher and or warmer it is seen that the forcing field of ccont and hcont holds a similar structure in the long term mean the ocean surface losses buoyancy along the coast of antarctica due to brine rejection gains buoyancy below the sea ice due to ice melt abernathey et al 2016 and warm western boundary currents release heat to the relatively colder atmosphere above the largest difference between ccont and hcont is seen in the indian sector where a strong meridional gradient associated with the antarctic circumpolar current is present in hcont but not in ccont the zonally averaged difference in surface buoyancy forcing between the wind stress change experiments and the control simulations is seen in the lower panel of fig 9 changes in the buoyancy forcing reflect changes in ocean surface properties and sea ice cover since the meteorological forcing fields are prescribed the coarse resolution model reponse to the 50 wind stress increase and decrease is approximately linear as was also the case in the changes of ψ i and σ 36 5 and the modelled response is confined to north of 60 s this latitude coincides approximately with the austral winter sea ice edge fig 1 ctau15 blue solid line gains more buoyancy in the region where water upwells consistent with an equatorward displacement of the σ 36 5 outcrop latitude fig 7 and an increased residual overturning circulation in the upper cell fig 6 vice versa ctau05 solid magenta line finds a decrease in the buoyancy forcing in accord with a relaxation of the isopycnal slope and decrease in the upper cell strength the htau05 buoyancy forcing response dashed magenta line is in many ways similar to ctau05 although it suggests a buoyancy gain about 40 s relative to hcont the changes in the buoyancy forcing in the model simulations that involve enhanced deep convection htau15 and ctau20 behaves differently compared to ctau15 htau15 blue dashed line finds a zonally averaged buoyancy loss throughout the southern ocean most notably at 70 s where the response peaks at 1 5 10 8 m 2 s 3 this is the expression of a strong heat loss to the atmosphere due to a reduced sea ice cover in this model simulation this is also the region where bottom waters are formed in hcont fig 4 and explains the much stronger lower cell seen in fig 6 accordingly ctau20 green solid line also finds a strong heat loss at high southern latitudes and a stronger lower cell the upper cell does not strengthen in htau15 despite the stronger winds and the buoyancy forcing response suggests that the reason is a thermodynamical constraint on the water mass transformation this constraint is not present in ctau20 where the mid latitudes gains more buoyancy than in ccont why the upper residual overturning cell increases as function of the stronger winds 5 discussion the decomposition of the residual meridional overturning circulation seen in fig 4 shows that the lower cell in the control simulations is weaker in ccont compared to hcont this is largely explained by differences in the mean flow circulation middle panels fig 4 in addition to the fact that it is overall weaker it is also more or less absent between 60 s and 50 s and does not extend as far southward as seen in hcont this mismatch between the two simulations is most likely a function of the inability of the coarse resolution model to produce dense bottom waters which is a common shortcoming of most cmip5 models heuzé et al 2013 in support of this conclusion the buoyancy forcing fields from ccont and hcont fig 9 also shows that the antarctic coastal buoyancy loss is greater in hcont and therefore allows for a greater dense water formation the upper mean flow overturning cell has a closer resemblance between the two models and the dissimilarity in the residual of the upper cell is primarily a function of the eddy induced flow which in the lower panels of fig 4 is shown to have a different structure in latitude density space specifically the flow of water between 50 s and 40 s with densities about 1036 kg m3 is poorly represented in ccont as hcont suggests a more surface intensified eddy driven circulation more promising is the parameterized eddy flow in the most dense water between 60 s and 50 s which compares better to hcont as seen from fig 3 this part of the eddy circulation in hcont is however underestimated in ψ i by our choice of using monthly mean output in the computation of ψ i this is not the case with respect to the discrepancy in the upper cell which is not an artifact of a misrepresentation of ψ i but rather originates in the limitations of the gent mcwilliams parameterization differences in the surface buoyancy forcing are able to contribute to the difference in the residual overturning circulation as well this effect is though ascribed a minor contribution given that the ccont and hcont forcing fields are similar in both structure and magnitude as seen from fig 9 a similar result was found in the inter model comparison study by farneti et al 2015 they estimated the eddy induced overturning circulations that arise explicitly in the gfdl and kiel ocean models of 1 4 horizontal resolution and compared it to the circulation from the coarse resolution version of the same models admittedly not able to resolve the full eddy field especially not at high southern latitudes the eddy permitting models do indicate that the parameterization either do not represent or significantly underestimates the eddy induced flow in the lighter water masses close to the surface to the north of 50 s see their figure 18 which is the case in the present study as well that a discrepancy between the resolved and parameterized eddy induced overturning circulation exists is perhaps not unexpected for example it has previously been shown that a down gradient closure for eddy fluxes of isopycnal thickness is of limited skill roberts and marshall 2000 and that ambiguity remains to the optimal choice of the thickness diffusivity eden et al 2009 the parameterized sensitivity of the circulation to the southern ocean zonal wind stress compares well to that of an eddy resolving model for a wind stress reduction on decadal time scale ctau05 and htau05 find a reduction of the upper residual overturning cell of comparable magnitude and spatial structure fig 6 this contrasts with hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 that also investigate the overturning response on a 20 year time scale but use a constant thickness diffusivity in addition both model simulations suggest a reduction of the meridional slope of σ 36 5 which is seen as a depression at high southern latitudes and a lift in the mid latitudes of about 50 m in the zonal mean fig 7 the same comparison for a 50 wind stress increase is made less straightforward by the complex model response of the htau15 experiment as noted in the results section it might be reasonable to assume that the changes in σ 36 5 in the northern part of the southern ocean is unaffected by the deep convection in the polar marginal seas here ctau15 shows a stronger response than htau15 fig 7 which might imply that the sensitivity is higher in the coarse resolution model than in the eddy resolving model with respect to a wind stress increase this inference is though complicated by the fact that the buoyancy forcing change is different between ctau15 and htau15 as well fig 9 comparing the modelled heat transport responses to preceeding model studies fig 8 bryan et al 2014 finds that the parameterized eddy heat transport becomes increasingly southward between 60 s and 50 s due to stronger winds in a coupled model experiment moreover they find that an eddy resolving model obtains an eddy response of opposite sign in an identical forcing scenario in the wind stress reduction experiments analyzed in this study the parameterized and resolved eddy field both result in a consistent weakening of the southward heat transport and the largest response is found between 40 s and 50 s also where bitz and polvani 2012 show that the parameterized response is stronger than the response by the explicit eddies in an ozone forcing experiment we here demonstrate the opposite case with prescribed atmospheric forcing this latter point is also true for the 50 wind stress increase experiments where the explicit eddies respond strongest even in the northern part of the domain away from the antarctic convective zones this inconsistency with past studies is likely the result of differences in experimental setup and the presence of ocean atmosphere feedbacks in the coupled simulations the disparate transient overturning responses simulated in the ctau15 and htau15 experiments displayed in the middle column of panels in fig 6 also deserve more attention despite ambiguity in terms of adjustment time and amplitude the response seen in the ctau15 experiment in general aligns itself with previous coarse resolution eddy parameterizing general circulation model studies that show that the upper residual cell increases in strength as function of stronger zonal wind stress gent and danabasoglu 2011 farneti et al 2015 the message from high resolution model studies has been that a similar though attenuated response is found when the eddies are explicitly resolved hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 munday et al 2013 the weakening of the upper cell as seen from the htau15 experiment contrasts with these studies and appears to be controlled by the active deep convection in the weddell sea to some extent the sea ice retreat that follows allows for an efficient loss of buoyancy that drives an enhanced formation of bottom water and an amplification of the lower cell fig 9 much alike the results from the buoyancy forcing experiments presented in jansen and nadeau 2016 a recent study by hogg et al 2017 finds a similar decrease of the upper residual cell strength in a global 1 4 resolution general circulation model in an experiment where the southern ocean winds are subject to a poleward shift and intensification in accord with the present study their overturning response is concurrent with deep convection in the weddell sea evidently compensation of the wind driven southern ocean upwelling is not only possible to achieve through increased eddy activity but also through high latitude deep convection which complicates an assessment of the eddy effect in isolation from non equilibrated model runs whether this result has implications for past wind stress change experiments with relatively short adjustment time and changes in surface buoyancy fluxes is not clear the literature on southern ocean wind stress change experiments however shows that it is not uncommon to invoke perturbations of similar magnitude as those tested in the present study e g gent and danabasoglu 2011 dufour et al 2012 munday et al 2013 jochum and eden 2015 bishop et al 2016 lastly we note that observations have shown that the isopycnals have subsided throughout the southern ocean over the last several decades as a function of stronger westerlies but with minimal changes to the isopycnal slope böning et al 2008 their figure 4 a though not directly comparable to the model responses investigated here due to the simplicity of the applied wind stress perturbations and the integration length of the experiments it is possible to compare the nature of the modelled reponse seen in ctau15 and htau15 to the observations the observations show that the modelled adjustment of the 1036 5 kg m3 density surface is of correct sign and is within the correct order of magnitude in the northern part of the domain regardless of model resolution however neither of the models capture the deepening of σ 36 5 at the higher southern latitudes and instead find an increase of the isopycnal slope and the drake passage transport table 2 the high resolution wind stress reduction experiment htau05 which does not experience a reduced sea ice extent also provides evidence for a finite sensitivity of the isopycnal slope to the zonal wind stress appropriate to the discussion of the results presented here is also the short spin up of the high resolution model and the void of a control integration through the 50 wind stress change experiments which are obvious drawbacks to the analysis of hcont htau05 and htau15 fig 2 shows that the horizontally averaged southern ocean temperature field drifts and that hcont is warmer than ccont in the upper 1km the time series of the overturning strength of the upper and lower cell shown in fig 5 as well as the drake passage transport time series seen in the bottom panel of fig 2 do provide some comfort in that the metrics under investigation do not drift prior to the initiation of the perturbation experiments a weakening of the lower cell with time is visible green line fig 5 a result that most likely stems from an insufficient spin up of the deep ocean and enters the results section as an overestimation of the strength of the lower cell the drift in hcont also influences the results from the wind stress change experiments as the ten year means obtained from the control and the perturbation experiments are shifted in time due to the absence of a sufficiently long control integration however given the short integration times involved in this study and the negligible drift in the hcont overturning strength we do not expect remaining drift to change the results significantly 6 summary we compare forced ocean general circulation model simulations of 1 and 0 1 horizontal resolution to assess the ability of the eddy mixing parameterization as formulated in danabasoglu and marshall 2007 to mimic resolved eddy effects a comparison of the southern ocean isopycnal streamfunction from the two models shows that the coarse resolution model has a weaker transport in both overturning cells with present day wind stress magnitude from a decomposition of the residual overturning streamfunction into a mean flow and an eddy induced component it is evident that a different distribution of the eddy circulation across water masses is responsible for a substantial part of the dissimilarity seen in the upper cell of the residual overturning differences in the mean flow overturning circulation also exist but the implication of this discrepancy is most important for the lower overturning cell for example the deep flow in the coarse resolution model appears to be entirely eddy driven between 60 s and 50 s but this is not the case in the high resolution model in addition the decomposition of the meridional heat transport reveals that the parameterized poleward eddy heat flux is overly strong in the southern ocean a zonally constant decrease of the southern ocean zonal wind stress south of 25 s results in a decrease of similar magnitude in the upper residual overturning cell in both models concurrently the meridional isopycnal slope reduces and the northward meridional heat transport decreases regardless of model resolution an increase of the wind stress by 50 on the other hand is found to drive a complex model response in the 0 1 resolution model but not in the coarse resolution model on decadal time scale the transient response from the high resolution model shows a weakening of the upper residual overturning cell by approx 20 and a strengthening of the lower cell driven by enhanced bottom water formation in the weddell sea this follows from a retreat of the austral winter sea ice edge that allows for a strong loss of heat to the prescribed atmosphere in contrast the residual meridional overturning in the coarse resolution model finds a 100 increase of the upper cell on the same time scale and with no discernable change in the lower cell a 100 wind stress increase experiment with the coarse resolution model also features a reduction in antarctic sea ice and stronger residual overturning in the bottom cell demonstrating that the complex model response is not limited to the high resolution model the main conclusion from the presented suite of experiments is that the parameterized eddies are able to mimic the nature of the resolved eddy field during wind stress change but are less skillful in representing the residual meridional overturning circulation and the heat transport for present day wind stress in addition we also emphasize that the dynamics of eddy compensation are probably more involved than what is found in simple models e g marshall and radko 2003 as exemplified by the high resolution model experiment with stronger wind stress the interaction between the sea ice and the ocean results in buoyancy forcing changes that overwhelm the eddy response it appears that the challenge for future general circulation model studies is to design clever experimental setups that clearly isolate the effect from the eddies yet preserve the complexity

24116,the ability to parameterize southern ocean eddy effects in a forced coarse resolution ocean general circulation model is assessed the transient model response to a suite of different southern ocean wind stress forcing perturbations is presented and compared to identical experiments performed with the same model in 0 1 eddy resolving resolution with forcing of present day wind stress magnitude and a thickness diffusivity formulated in terms of the local stratification it is shown that the southern ocean residual meridional overturning circulation in the two models is different in structure and magnitude it is found that the difference in the upper overturning cell is primarily explained by an overly strong subsurface flow in the parameterized eddy induced circulation while the difference in the lower cell is mainly ascribed to the mean flow overturning with a zonally constant decrease of the zonal wind stress by 50 we show that the absolute decrease in the overturning circulation is insensitive to model resolution and that the meridional isopycnal slope is relaxed in both models the agreement between the models is not reproduced by a 50 wind stress increase where the high resolution overturning decreases by 20 but increases by 100 in the coarse resolution model it is demonstrated that this difference is explained by changes in surface buoyancy forcing due to a reduced antarctic sea ice cover which strongly modulate the overturning response and ocean stratification we conclude that the parameterized eddies are able to mimic the transient response to altered wind stress in the high resolution model but partly misrepresent the unperturbed southern ocean meridional overturning circulation and associated heat transports keywords southern ocean eddy compensation parameterized sensitivity 1 introduction the outcropping isopycnals of the southern ocean provide an important adiabatic pathway for the meridional overturning circulation and hence aid the ventilation of the deep ocean marshall and speer 2012 together with the zonally unblocked antarctic circumpolar current the southern ocean thus plays a central role in the modern view of the ocean general circulation gnanadesikan 1999 thompson et al 2016 the global carbon cycle sigman and boyle 2000 le quéré et al 2007 bronselaer et al 2016 ocean heat uptake marshall and zanna 2014 and the exchange of tracers between the major ocean basins thompson 2008 the southern hemisphere westerlies are a key driving force of the circulation e g toggweiler and samuels 1995 tansley and marshall 2001 and these have been subject to an intensification and poleward shift throughout the last several decades as a result of ozone depletion and anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide thompson and solomon 2002 marshall 2003 a fundamental question is what implication the wind stress changes have on the global circulation and climate and whether the relevant physics is faithfully represented in state of the art climate models to allow for meaningful predictions of the response in this respect the mesoscale eddy field in the southern ocean e g frenger et al 2015 has proven to have a leading order influence on the local dynamics ocean models of varying complexity and basin geometry but with an explicitly resolved eddy field have demonstrated that a limit exists in which the time mean transport of a circumpolar current becomes independent of the strength of the overlying zonal wind stress hogg and blundell 2006 nadeau and straub 2009 munday et al 2013 marshall et al 2017 beyond this limit additional momentum input to the surface ocean by the winds mainly fuel a stronger eddy field through baroclinic instability which facilitates a vertical momentum transfer to the ocean floor and dissipation by form drag munk and palmén 1951 johnson and bryden 1989 instead of accelerating the current recent observations from the southern ocean have shown that the isopycnal slope and hence the baroclinic transport of the antarctic circumpolar current has indeed been insensitive to the wind stress changes böning et al 2008 while the surface kinetic energy has increased hogg et al 2015 supporting the model results and the notion that the southern ocean is in the so called state of eddy saturation contemporary residual mean theory also emphasizes the role of mesoscale eddies in setting the strength of the upper cell of the meridional overturning in the southern ocean here they compensate the effect of a wind driven northward ekman flow anomaly through an oppositely directed flow akin to a stokes drift referred to as eddy compensation see e g marshall and radko 2003 the results from models with explicit eddies show that this is indeed the case hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 but also that the sensitivity of the overturning circulation remains non zero to a wind stress strength that is several times greater than the present day magnitude unlike the behavior of the zonal transport munday et al 2013 using an idealized primitive equation model at various eddying resolutions morrison and hogg 2013 likewise demonstrate the sensitivity difference between the zonal and meridional circulation to the zonal wind stress they argue that the sensitivity difference arises because eddy compensation is a depth dependent metric whereas eddy saturation is depth integrated and thus camouflages potentially higher local sensitivities in the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity field in a recent high resolution coupled model experiment run for two model decades bishop et al 2016 shows that the upper cell of the residual overturning increases in magnitude by 39 to a zonally constant 50 increase of the southern ocean zonal wind stress and that the mean drake passage transport changes by 6 only the degree of compensation and saturation that should be expected on a longer time scale is however still unclear as computational cost limits sufficiently long integrations of comprehensive high resolution ocean models moreover the non local response of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to a southern ocean wind stress change is continuously debated for example it has been suggested that models with idealized basin geometry do not capture the changes in diapycnal upwelling in the pacific ocean since this diabatic pathway is also able to provide the necessary closure for the meridional overturning circulation these models potentially overestimate the role of the southern ocean winds jochum and eden 2015 the results from eddy resolving ocean models despite their simplifications and shortcomings have questioned the ability of coarse resolution ocean models to represent the eddy effect on the large scale flow in a wind stress change scenario most climate models use the gent mcwilliams parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 to model baroclinic instability and along isopycnal eddy mixing in the interior ocean and rely on the assumption that the strength of baroclinic instability is proportional to the isopycnal slope comparison studies have shown that when the proportionality parameter in the eddy down gradient closure the thickness diffusivity is a constant the zonal transport cannot possibly eddy saturate and the meridional circulation is too sensitive to wind stress changes hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 munday et al 2013 when the eddy diffusivity is allowed to vary in space and time as function of the stratification ferreira et al 2005 danabasoglu and marshall 2007 the transport through drake passage shows a less sensitive relationship to the zonal wind stress gent and danabasoglu 2011 however the change in the residual overturning still varies considerably among models subject to the same wind stress increase farneti et al 2015 which complicates an assessment of the parameterized eddy effect both bitz and polvani 2012 and bryan et al 2014 compare climate change experiments between a fully coupled coarse resolution model using above parameterization and an identical eddy resolving model the model solutions in the study by bryan et al 2014 show that the poleward eddy heat transport between 60 s and 50 s increases following an increase in the zonal wind stress in their low resolution model setup whereas the high resolution model finds a response of opposite sign bitz and polvani 2012 report similar model responses where the resolved eddies contribute substantially less to the change in poleward heat transport compared to the parameterized eddies while these results suggest that the parameterized eddies respond oppositely or overly strong to a wind stress change ambiguity on the performance of the eddy parameterization still remains because the modelled wind stress changes are dependent on the background climate this is not necessarily the same at different model resolution exemplified by bryan et al 2014 where differences in antarctic sea ice thickness influence the modelled climate response in addition an increasing body of literature has shown that the strength of the antarctic circumpolar current and the position of its fronts is sensitive to the spatial structure and strength of the wind stress field sallée et al 2008 morrow et al 2010 mazloff 2012 dufour et al 2012 zika et al 2013 langlais et al 2015 the compilation of these results suggest a return to simpler general circulation model experimental setups with a complete control on the applied wind stress to elucidate the nature of the response in the present study we present simulations from the second version of the parallel ocean program pop model configured at a horizontal resolution of 1 and 0 1 the former employing a state of the art eddy parameterization forced with different prescribed southern ocean wind stress scenarios in an attempt to evaluate the performance of parameterized eddies the results presented here indicate that the parameterized eddy induced meridional circulation cancel the wind driven overturning differently than the eddy resolving model when forced with present day winds despite differences in the background ocean state we demonstrate that the two models respond similarly to wind stress perturbations but note that the model comparison is not straightforward as changes in buoyancy forcing and sea ice cover are able to drive a complex model response the latter point raises the question to what extent the current concept of eddy compensation is applicable to complex models 2 model description experimental setup and spin up assessment we use the community earth system model cesm with an active ocean and sea ice model on a global domain with realistic bottom topography with prescribed meteorological boundary conditions the ocean and sea ice models share the same grid and the solution of the governing equations is sought using two different horizontal grid resolutions a tri polar 0 1 grid with the meridional grid spacing proportional to the cosine of latitude and a dipole 1 grid that also has a meridional grid discretization that varies with latitude with a latitudinal grid spacing of 0 5 in the southern ocean the vertical axis that belongs to the first grid is resolved by 62 z coordinate levels with the distance of separation increasing monotonically with depth and has a partial bottom cell representation in accord with the etopo2v2 bathymetry product the coarse resolution grid holds 60 levels in the vertical and with no partial bottom cells the dynamical core of the ocean model is the same for both grid resolutions and is documented in smith et al 2010 except for the treatment of motion on the mesoscale which is outlined in the next paragraph for further information on the grid layouts and aspects of the control integration of the fully coupled models the reader is referred to gent et al 2011 and small et al 2014 with respect to the coarse and the fine resolution model respectively the prescribed atmosphere used in this study is given by the normal year forcing fields from the second version of the coordinated ocean research experiment core v2 nyf large and yeager 2008 compiled from atmospheric reanalysis and observations and the fields have a temporal resolution of six hours and repeat themselves after one model year exactly ideally the model solution that evolves on the 0 1 grid should be subject to motion on a characteristic length scale on the order of the first baroclinic rossby radius chelton et al 1998 and no mesoscale eddy parameterization is therefore enabled the isopycnal tracer diffusion is likewise disabled but a biharmonic operator is implemented to represent lateral mixing by subgrid scale processes that remain unresolved bryan and bachman 2015 ocean mesoscale eddies are not explicitly resolved on the 1 grid and are parameterized in the interior ocean using the gent and mcwilliams 1990 isopycnal mixing formulation with the spatiotemporal thickness diffusivity proposed by ferreira et al 2005 this choice of the eddy transfer coefficient ensures that it is surface intensified in alignment with previous studies and has shown to improve the model solution with respect to observations of the southern ocean density structure and leads to a greater cancellation between the wind driven and eddy induced southern ocean meridional cells danabasoglu and marshall 2007 farneti et al 2015 as default in pop the parameterized ocean interior eddy fluxes are modified towards the surface boundary layer in accord with ferrari et al 2008 where diabatic eddy fluxes are aligned with the surface ocean of additional relevance to this study convective instability is handled implicitly in both models that is the local vertical diffusivity is increased by several orders of magnitude when the water column is statically unstable during statically stable conditions the vertical mixing is parameterized as in large et al 1994 the model on the 1 grid was initialized from a state of rest and the property fields from the polar science center hydrographic climatology steele et al 2001 and a control simulation labelled ccont of 300 model years was integrated forward with the default wind stress denoted by τ 0 τ 0 ϕ τ 0 θ the control simulation with the 0 1 model labelled hcont was also initialized from rest but the initial conditions to the salt and temperature fields were instead provided by the world ocean circulation experiment hydrographic climatology gouretski and koltermann 2004 the first 16 years of hcont were conducted at the national center for atmospheric research and is described in detail in bryan and bachman 2015 the model run was hereafter adopted by the authors and integrated additionally ten years forward in time to reach a total hcont length of 26 years several wind stress change experiments were branched off from the last year of both ccont and hcont with the zonal wind stress in the southern ocean subject to 1 τ ϕ ϕ θ t τ 0 ϕ ϕ θ t f θ where τϕ is the perturbed zonal wind stress f is a time invariant perturbation that has a zonally constant structure expressed by 2 f θ f 0 for θ 35 s a π 180 θ b for 35 s θ 25 s 1 otherwise and it is understood that θ increases northward here f 0 is the perturbation factor and a and b were chosen such that the linear decrease of the perturbation with latitude matches f 0 at θ 35 s and unity at 25 s this is the same perturbation that was used in the coupled model studies by gent and danabasoglu 2011 jochum and eden 2015 and bishop et al 2016 table 1 summaries the suite of wind stress experiments presented in this paper as well as their abbreviations and provides the coefficients specific to the applied perturbations a 50 wind stress increase and decrease experiment blue and magenta line upper left panel of fig 1 were extended from the end of the high resolution control simulation labelled htau15 and htau05 respectively both of 16 years duration the output from htau15 and htau05 as well as the last year from hcont was stored as three day mean fields and subsequently reduced to monthly means to fit the purpose of this study identical perturbations to the wind stress field were conducted with the coarse resolution model the experiments labelled ctau05 and ctau15 both of 100 model year duration as will become evident later in the reading of the present study the wind stress increase perturbation pushes the state of the marginal seas of the southern ocean towards a state that favors deep convection which influences the overturning response in htau15 to emphasize this point a double wind stress increase experiment green line upper left panel of fig 1 with the 1 model labelled ctau20 is performed also of 100 year duration throughout this study and unless otherwise stated the analysis of ccont and hcont is conducted on the ten years that lead up to the application of the wind stress perturbation that is year 16 to 25 for hcont and year 290 to 299 for ccont the analysis of the high resolution wind stress experiments is focussed on the last ten years the time span between year 33 and 42 and the corresponding time span for the coarse resolution experiments is between year 307 and 316 the time mean of ctau20 is taken between model year 313 to 322 shifted by six years relative to ctau15 due to a difference in the timing of the onset of deep convection relative to htau15 the black curve in the upper left panel of fig 1 shows the annual mean zonally averaged zonal wind stress profile that arises from the unperturbed forcing field and the peak wind stress is smaller by approximately 25 than what is found in the coupled model configuration gent and danabasoglu 2011 bryan et al 2014 bishop et al 2016 comparing the time mean drake passage transport profile from hcont to the corresponding profile from ccont it is seen that there is an overall good agreement between the models in terms of the vertical velocity shear upper right panel fig 1 the depth integrated volume transport of hcont and ccont yields similar time mean drake passage transports of 133 sv and 136 sv respectively and compares well with the 134 27 sv full depth observational estimate reviewed by cunningham et al 2003 the more recent estimate of 141 13 sv by koenig et al 2014 based on satellite altimetry and mooring data agrees with the presented model solutions as well although the 173 11 sv estimate by donohue et al 2016 which additionally includes a barotropic contribution from resolved near bottom currents suggests that the modelled drake passage transport in both models is too low the winter mean boundary layer depth simulated in the two models defined in large et al 1994 is seen in the lower row of plots in fig 1 as well as the 15 austral winter mean july august september sea ice concentration isoline from the model white line and from the special sensor microwave imager observations black line comiso 2000 the boundary layer depth of ccont left in general agrees with hcont right on the large scale but hcont also possesses several local maxima of which some occur in proximity of topographic obstacles and has a deeper boundary layer in the path of the antarctic circumpolar current in the indian ocean sector hcont also displays a deeper boundary layer close to the coast of antarctica especially in the weddell sea which is the signature of dense water formation the observed extent of the winter sea ice cover in general compares well with the two model simulations though with a misrepresentation in the pacific sector in ccont and a too large extent in hcont to the east of drake passage and south of australia the computational costs of the 0 1 model made it difficult to integrate the high resolution simulations closer to their equilibrium solution given our resources the total sum of 42 high resolution model years required more than a year to complete on 4096 cores of the bluegene supercomputer located in jülich germany and exhausted our resources model drift therefore remains and it is here examined in hcont to identify the fraction of the model response presented in the results section which is due to model drift the upper left panel of fig 2 displays the evolution of the horizontally averaged potential temperature field of the southern ocean in hcont from model year 16 to 25 on decadal time scale as is the interest of the present study significant drift is present between 1000 m and 400 m depth the southern ocean warms at a rate about 0 2 c decade at 600 m depth and is of the same magnitude and location as the warming trend presented by small et al 2014 who examine the model in its coupled configuration the abyssal ocean also warms but equilibrates the slowest and does not drift much on the decadal time scale for comparison ccont which is integrated much further towards equilibrium warms by approx 0 003 c decade only at 600 m depth evaluated between model year 290 and 299 the ten year mean temperature profiles of both ccont blue and hcont black are shown in the upper right panel the profiles in the deep ocean match quite well but hcont is seen to be warmer by 1 c than ccont above 1km depth and the difference becomes bigger as time progress due to the model drift however the meridional density gradient across the southern ocean does not appear to be affected by the difference in temperature stratification and the model drift as is indirectly inferred from the time series of the drake passage transport in the lower panel of fig 2 the strength of the southern ocean meridional overturning circulation also does not appear to drift which is discussed in greater detail in section 4 and shown in fig 5 we thus consider a comparison between the high and coarse resolution model meaningful but the shortness and drift of the high resolution model integrations is a caveat of the present study that should be kept in mind 3 decomposition of the meridional overturning circulation to avoid the representation of artificial diapycnal flows in the southern ocean the analysis of the meridional overturning circulation is here performed in density coordinates in accord with previous related studies e g hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 munday et al 2013 bishop et al 2016 when remapped to vertical coordinates such overturning circulation is found to respect the adiabatic nature of the interior ocean with streamlines approximately aligned with the isolines of the density field döös and webb 1994 viebahn and eden 2012 the time mean of the isopycnal stream function is given by 3 ψ i θ σ 0 2 π η b ϕ θ η ϕ θ t v ϕ θ z t d z r cos θ d ϕ where ϕ θ and z are the usual spherical coordinates r is earth s radius and σ is potential density ηb is the depth of the ocean bottom and η ϕ θ t is the depth of the surface of constant σ that varies in both space and time denotes the averaging operator with respect to the time coordinate the overturning streamfunction is split into various components by decomposing the velocity and density fields into different terms that each are governed by distinct physics the decomposition here consists of separating the velocity and density field into a time mean and the deviation about it v ϕ θ z t v ϕ θ z v ϕ θ z t and likewise for σ the isopycnal streamfunction that arises from the time mean fields is here denoted ψi and is given by 4 ψ i θ σ 0 2 π η b ϕ θ η ϕ θ v ϕ θ z d z r cos θ d ϕ where η is the height of the time mean density surface σ the difference between the time mean of the isopycnal streamfunction and the streamfunction derived from the time mean fields is the deviation from the time mean 5 ψ i ψ i ψ i which captures the motion that varies on a temporal time scale shorter than the time span of the applied time averaging operator on a time scale less than a couple of months the transient mesoscale eddy field is known to be a dominating contribution to ψ i ballarotta et al 2013 and its nature is to oppose the time mean flow the residual that arises from the cancellation between these two cells is thus given by the isopycnal streamfunction ψ i which advects tracers and other physical properties the mesoscale eddy field is not resolved in the coarse resolution 1 model and is instead represented by the eddy induced transport velocities given by the implemented eddy parameterization the isopycnal overturning streamfunction is here calculated as 6 ψ i 0 2 π η b η v d z r cos θ d ϕ 0 2 π η b η v gm d z r cos θ d ϕ where v gm is the meridional component of the eddy induced velocity field the first term on the right hand side of eq 6 is the overturning streamfunction associated with the mean flow and the second term is the time mean eddy induced overturning streamfunction which in the analysis that follows are compared to the high resolution overturning streamfunctions ψi and ψ i respectively 3 1 choice of temporal resolution as seen from satellite altimetry frenger et al 2015 reports that the mean lifespan of a southern ocean eddy is about ten weeks this is supported by the study by ballarotta et al 2013 who uses a 1 4 global ocean model to show that an estimate of the overturning streamfunction obtained with the use of monthly mean output fields captures the majority of the eddy variability however the present study uses a model of 1 10 resolution which possesses more energy at the high frequencies and large wavenumbers to assess the difference in the representation of the residual meridional overturning circulation in the 1 10 model at different temporal resolution we compute ψ i of htau05 with both monthly mean and three day mean model output the left panel of fig 3 shows the ten year mean of ψ i between model year 33 and 42 calculated using monthly mean fields the right panel shows the same as the left panel but calculated using three day mean output the characteristics of the eddy induced overturning is discussed in the succeeding section and here we focus on its dependence on temporal resolution only the structure of ψ i is more or less independent from the temporal resolution of the output fields but its magnitude does vary the minimum in the heavier water masses changes from 10 sv to 14 sv when the temporal resolution is increased but the second minimum closer to the surface between 50 s and 40 s changes by less than 1 sv the latter minimum is associated with the overturning in the upper cell which has been the primary focus in the discussion of eddy compensation in the southern ocean since this eddy motion appears to vary mostly on a time scale that exceeds a month an appropriate estimate of the overturning metrics is possible to obtain by using monthly mean fields the minimum of the eddy overturning in the densest water is though underestimated by approximately 30 by this choice the results presented in the subsequent section are all computed using monthly mean fields since the main focus of this study is on the upper overturning cell 4 results 4 1 background state overturning fig 4 presents the ten year mean spatial structure of the meridional overturning circulation in the southern ocean from the two default simulations as well as its decomposition as function of potential density referenced to 2000 db the decomposition of the overturning follows the procedure outlined in section 3 and the potential density axis was discretized into 200 equally spaced levels between 1033 0 kg m3 and 1037 5 kg m3 for both model solutions the black solid line in all panels is the zonal mean of the surface potential density field averaged over the same ten year time span and gives an approximate indication of the ocean surface the residual circulation upper panels fig 4 from both models in general show a quasi adiabatic inflow of circumpolar deep water to the southern ocean in the density range 1036 5 kg m3 1037 0 kg m3 and a transformation and separation of water masses as the water upwells at higher southern latitudes the water that upwells north of the separation point gains buoyancy at the surface and returns northward in the surface ekman layer this flow pattern is referred to as the upper cell farneti et al 2015 transformation of lower circumpolar deep water the denser fraction of the water that enters the southern ocean to bottom water between 65 s and 75 s is also seen in both model solutions which replenish the bottom water masses that partly flows northward in the abyss and partly upwells due to mixing marshall and speer 2012 this circulation is referred to as the lower cell other cells such as the anti clockwise subtropical cell and anti clockwise recirculation between 50 s and 55 s are also seen at both model resolutions but are not discussed further see farneti et al 2015 for a thorough discussion on these cells the amount of dense water that flows into the southern ocean at 40 s and subsequently upwells is about 30 sv in hcont but only 12 sv in ccont from the minimum and maximum of the lower and upper cell respectively it is seen that the water that upwells to the surface divides approximately evenly between the two in hcont with an overturning of 15 sv in the upper cell and 17 sv in the lower cell in ccont a substantial recirculation is seen in the lower cell with a bottom water formation of 12 sv between 70 and 60 s but only 5 sv leaves the domain to the north through the abyss this is an expression of the weak formation of antarctic bottom water in ccont gent et al 2011 the remaining 7 sv that enters the southern ocean leaves through the upper cell similar residual overturning structures are also seen in the coupled model configuration of cesm as well as the difference between the high and the low resolution runs albeit with overall stronger amplitude due to overly strong modelled southern ocean winds gent and danabasoglu 2011 bishop et al 2016 in comparison to the multi model study by farneti et al 2015 the upper cell strength of 7 sv in ccont is considerably weaker than the 12 to 18 sv found in most state of the art coarse resolution climate models forced with the core v2 1958 2007 reanalysis product this difference is at least partly explained by the fact that the southern ocean winds are subject to a 30 intensification in this period the time series of the maximum and minimum of the upper and lower cell of the residual meridional overturning circulation from hcont upper right panel of fig 4 are shown by the black and green curve in fig 5 respectively both time series show pronounced interannual variability that arises from the resolved eddy field and an annual cycle is also visible the maxima of the upper cell fall during the austral winter months where the zonal winds and the northward surface ekman current are the strongest see yuan 2004 for an observational estimate of the seasonality in the southern ocean winds the minima of the bottom cell also occur during the winter months and is associated with the production of dense water due to an intense buoyancy loss to the atmosphere and brine rejection from sea ice formation also neither time series possess any clear trend although the first two years of the lower cell appear to have a stronger more negative summer overturning the same time series are also provided for ccont magenta and blue lines for the upper and lower cell respectively which are seen to share many features with hcont but with a more uniform annual cycle and a weaker circulation in general that was also reflected in the spatial structure of the residual overturning upper panels fig 4 looking into the decomposition of the meridional flow the overturning that arises from the time mean velocity fields middle panels fig 4 is overall stronger than the residual and the subsurface maximum of the upper cell is also more comparable between the two models this is not a surprise as the models are subject to identical surface boundary conditions and no cancellation from the transient eddies is present in this metric a closed cell of clockwise circulation is also seen in both model solutions at the surface at about 1035 kg m3 and 45 s again present in the coupled model solutions as well it is also interesting to note that the flow in the abyss between 60 s and 50 s is entirely eddy induced in ccont left panel but only partly at 0 1 resolution right panel the flow driven by the transient eddies is different between the two models lower panels fig 4 whereas both models show that the eddy cell in general counteracts the time mean flow and that the cells span the same latitude density space the minima of the eddy driven overturning is differently located the parameterized eddy field gives rise to a subsurface minimum in the densest waters between 50 s and 60 s and another subsurface minimum around 45 s and 1035 75 kg m3 left panel the explicit eddy field right panel also gives rise to the subsurface minimum in the densest water but has a vanishing subsurface flow around 1036 kg m3 between 40 s and 50 s this difference in spatial structure gives rise to different cancellations between the time mean and the eddy induced flow resulting in the weaker residual overturning of the upper cell in the coarse resolution model 4 2 wind stress perturbation experiments 4 2 1 circulation response the model response that follows from the wind stress perturbations is reflected in the residual meridional overturning circulation shown in fig 6 the panels display the difference between the perturbation experiments and the control in accord with the averaging intervals mentioned in section 2 the upper row of panels display the results from the high resolution model and the middle row of panels from the coarse resolution model the left middle and right column of panels is for the tau05 tau15 and tau20 experiment respectively in terms of structure and absolute magnitude ctau05 and htau05 show similar transient responses to the wind stress decrease both models show a weakening of similar magnitude of the upper overturning cell and a smaller weakening of the lower overturning cell confined to high southern latitudes the maximum of the upper overturning cell in htau05 decreases from 15 sv to 6 sv a 60 reduction whereas the upper cell of ctau05 collapses and finds a decrease of the upper cell maximum by 9 sv which corresponds to 130 relative decrease the weakening of the lower cell corresponds to a northward retreat in both models and the cell strength changes from 10 sv to 6 sv in ctau05 and from 17 sv to 10 sv in htau05 at 65 s the ten year mean drake passage transport decreases in ctau05 and htau05 by 12 and 4 sv with respect to their control values respectively see table 2 during the same time interval shifting focus to the wind stress increase experiment it is immediately seen that ctau15 and htau15 are subject to different transient model responses ctau15 finds a general increase of the upper cell and an increase and displacement of the maximum from 7 sv to 14 sv as well as an increase in the zonal transport by 11 sv a greater value of the average thickness diffusivity κ is also seen table 2 but the change amounts to less than 10 compared to ccont relatively small changes are seen in the lower cell between 70 s and 60 s but a closer inspection also reveals that the positive changes seen in the densest waters between 60 s and the northern southern ocean reflects a weakening of the northward movement of bottom water suprisingly htau15 shows a weakening of the upper cell and a relatively large increase in the drake passage transport by 47 sv opposite to the response seen in ctau15 and different from the structure of the weakening seen in htau05 the maximum of the upper cell decreases by about 3 sv but the lower cell increases in strength by several times the control value fundamentally different to ctau15 the inflow of water to the southern ocean increases in the 0 1 model but the vast majority of the water enters the lower cell and leaves the domain through the abyss the water that inflows in the 1 model increases as well albeit weakly but this water leaves the domain entirely through the upper cell the root cause of the different circulation responses to the stronger winds is at least partly due to the onset of deep convection in the weddell sea in htau15 this response is similar to the model simulation presented in cheon et al 2013 in some aspects and causes a sea ice retreat and an anomalous heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere a detailed account of the physical processes that lead to a destabilization of the water column is beyond the scope of the present study it is though relevant to remark that minor differences in the weddell sea background stratification between ccont and hcont prevents deep convection in ctau15 the weddell sea hydrography is in general sensitive to model setup see e g kjellsson et al 2015 a stronger increase in the zonal wind stress in the coarse resolution model by 100 ctau20 does trigger weddell sea deep convection and enhances the lower overturning cell in a similar manner as seen in htau15 fig 6 right middle panel but the upper overturning cell appears less affected also as seen from table 2 both κ and the drake passage transport enhance by 32 and 44 respectively which indicate substantial changes in the ocean stratification the difference in involved physics in principle render a comparison of the eddy compensation between ctau15 and htau15 inappropriate because the eddy induced overturning component ψ i of htau15 is influenced by the transients of the bottom water formation this difference in the behavior of the residual meridional overturning circulation in ctau15 htau15 and ctau20 displays that the southern ocean model response is far from trivial when two overturning cells are present as is the case in more comprehensive ocean models as previously emphasized in the literature e g munday et al 2013 eddy compensation is a steady state argument the lower left and middle panel of fig 6 display the difference in the ten year mean residual overturning from ctau05 and ctau15 after 100 years worth of model integration and thus closer to model equilibrium on centennial time scale both experiments unequivocally show that the initial response in the upper cell attenuates and that the transport anomaly in the lower cell grows ctau05 now features a more modest decrease in the upper cell maximum of 4 sv corresponding to a 43 reduction and ctau15 has regained its control value of approximately 7 sv consistently ctau20 lower right panel also shows a weakening of the initial upper cell response with time from the perspective of parameterized eddies this comparison indicates that the adjustment time of the southern ocean overturning takes place on centennial time scale possibly beyond and that the bottom route as an outflow from the southern ocean appears to grow in importance as the overturning system equilibrates this calls into question whether eddy compensation is meaningfully inferred from the residual meridional overturning as seen in complex model simulations with a representation of both the upper and lower overturning cells and variable surface buoyancy forcing that has not fully equilibrated again comparing to the coupled model studies that similarly use cesm gent and danabasoglu 2011 reports a 1 4 sv increase of the upper cell 100 years subsequent to an increase of the zonal wind stress by 50 and the recirculation in the lower cell is seen to increase as well their figure 3 but with a smaller outflow of the densest water the present study similarly finds a weak response of the upper cell on a centennial time scale though with a stronger outflow from the southern ocean in the abyss compared to ccont on decadal time scale a comparison between the high resolution model responses is possible with active deep convection htau15 is different to its coupled model counterpart in bishop et al 2016 and finds a 20 weakening of the upper cell where they find a strenghening by 39 however both model finds a strengthening of the lower cell which in their study is connected to a thinner austral winter sea ice cover in the weddell sea see their figure 13 much alike the physical response presented here 4 2 2 changes in the 1036 5 kg m3 density surface the change in the meridional slope of the southern ocean isopycnals is a salient measure pertinent to the discussion on the response of the circulation to a wind stress change due to the prevailing thermal wind balance in addition this metric should not be significantly influenced by the deep convection event in regions away from the weddell sea which allow us to indirectly infer the degree of compensation in htau15 the upper panels of fig 7 show the time mean depth of the 1036 5 kg m3 potential density surface henceforth denoted by σ 36 5 from ccont left and hcont right the remaining stereographic plots in the left column display the vertical displacement of the isopycnal between the wind stress perturbation experiments and the control integration for the coarse resolution model the depth changes in the high resolution model is shown in the right column and the lowermost plot shows the zonal mean difference in isopycnal depth for all experiments the difference is taken between the ten year means that are outlined in section 2 the choice to map the changes in σ 36 5 is motivated by fig 4 which show that the upwelling in the southern ocean associated with the upper residual overturning cell is approximately along this density surface in both models both ccont and hcont finds that σ 36 5 sits at a depth that exceeds 1 km in the periphery of the southern ocean and that it outcrops between 50 s and 60 s this is in agreement with the residual meridional overturning circulation which shows that water of density 1036 5 kg m3 is subject to upwelling and transformation in this latitude band ctau05 and htau05 both show a response that holds a zonal pattern a deepening of the isopycnal at high southern latitudes and a rise in the mid latitudes this corresponds to a weakening of the meridional slope of σ 36 5 and a southward displacement of the outcrop line regional differences do exist between the two model responses but the large scale structure is similar this is also seen from the lowermost panel which shows that the peak zonally averaged vertical depression of σ 36 5 magenta lines is about 50 m at high southern latitudes in both ctau05 and htau05 true to both models σ 36 5 rises at high southern latitudes equivalent to a steepening and is depressed farther to the north for the 50 wind stress increase the rise of σ 36 5 in ctau15 is rather modest and mirrors the response seen in ctau05 to a high degree which is also visible in the zonal mean solid blue line the high resolution model on the other hand has an increase of the isopycnal tilt of greater magnitude the greater rise along the path of the antarctic circumpolar current is expected to be the outcome of a complex interplay between the active deep convection in the antarctic polar seas the stronger winds and the transient eddy response however the deepening in the northern part of the domain takes place relatively far away from the deep convection zones and the response is therefore expected to follow the ekman and eddy dynamics alone despite the two local maxima in the deepening in the atlantic sector of htau15 ctau15 overall finds the strongest response in the northern part of the southern ocean as seen from the zonal mean blue lines σ 36 5 displaces with 50 m in ctau15 whereas htau15 finds a zonally averaged maximum deepening of about 25 m this suggests a stronger parameterized sensitivity in ctau15 to the zonal wind stress increase compared to hcont15 4 2 3 northward heat transport response to enable a direct comparison between bitz and polvani 2012 bryan et al 2014 and the present study we investigate the total northward heat transport and its decomposition into contributions from the mean flow and the eddy induced circulation the upper panel of fig 8 shows the total northward heat transport the middle panel the transport by the mean flow and the lower panel the eddy heat transport the heat transport estimate from the coarse resolution model solid lines includes both the heat advection by the bolus velocities and isopycnal diffusion of heat and the contribution from submesoscale eddies is not included the total northward heat transport in the high resolution model dashed lines is obtained by integrating v θ in the zonal and the vertical and the eddy component is obtained by subtracting the product v θ from v θ here θ denotes potential temperature horizontal diffusion of heat due to the biharmonic operator is orders of magnitude smaller than the advective terms and is therefore not included the total heat transport of ccont and hcont solid and dashed black lines upper panel both show that it is directed southward everywhere in the southern ocean and that the two models deviate the greatest between 60 s and 50 s with about 0 1 pw the estimates are in agreement with those modelled by bryan et al 2014 their fig 2 but with a less strong discrepancy north of 40 s the decomposition shows that the northward heat transport by the mean flow middle panel is overall weaker in hcont the eddy contribution lower panel is southward at all latitudes in both models but the parameterized eddies suggest a greater southward eddy heat transport than hcont as was also the case in bryan et al 2014 ctau05 and htau05 magenta lines agree that the northward heat transport decreases north of 55 s when the wind stress is reduced this is primarily due to the changes in the mean flow which follow from the reduced northward surface ekman drift as was also seen in the residual overturning response shown in fig 6 this change is partly balanced by a reduced southward heat transport by the eddies ctau05 suggests a stronger weakening in the total northward heat transport which is a result of a greater change in the mean flow heat transport compared to htau05 in concert with a weaker parameterized eddy response as was already seen from the response in the residual overturning circulation and the density structure ctau15 and htau15 blue lines respond differently to the 50 wind stress increase ctau15 shows a response that is opposite to that seen in ctau05 in the total heat transport and its two components htau15 on the other hand shows that the total heat transport becomes increasingly southward everywhere with a peak southward transport beyond 1pw around 60 s recalling that the eddy transport also encompasses the transient response from the convection in the weddell sea the decomposition shows that both the mean flow and the eddy transport contributes to the increased southward heat transport as was evident from fig 6 the htau15 circulation intensifies as function of the stronger winds but the majority of the water densifies upon upwelling and enters the lower overturning cell fig 8 shows that this enhanced poleward flow also increases the amount of heat that is transported southward a similar response is also seen in ctau20 green lines where the southward heat transport is increased south of 50 s mainly due to the changes in the mean flow the heat transport in the northern part of the southern ocean does not appear to be affected the same way as htau15 by the convection in the polar seas this is in line with the residual overturning response seen in the middle right panel of fig 6 where both the upper and lower cell strength of ctau20 increases as function of the stronger wind stress 4 2 4 buoyancy forcing response an increase in the residual meridional overturning circulation must be accompanied with an increase in the transformation of water masses in the ocean mixed layer we therefore examine the surface buoyancy forcing changes to the wind stress perturbations to understand the thermodynamical response associated with the changes in ψ i we adopt the same approach as in bishop et al 2016 and compute the ocean surface buoyancy forcing as function of the surface heat fluxes atmospheric fresh water contributions from precipitation and evaporation prescribed river run off and contributions from interactions with the active sea ice model the upper panels of fig 9 show the ccont left and hcont right ten year mean surface buoyancy forcing fields a positive buoyancy forcing indicates that the ocean surface became fresher and or warmer it is seen that the forcing field of ccont and hcont holds a similar structure in the long term mean the ocean surface losses buoyancy along the coast of antarctica due to brine rejection gains buoyancy below the sea ice due to ice melt abernathey et al 2016 and warm western boundary currents release heat to the relatively colder atmosphere above the largest difference between ccont and hcont is seen in the indian sector where a strong meridional gradient associated with the antarctic circumpolar current is present in hcont but not in ccont the zonally averaged difference in surface buoyancy forcing between the wind stress change experiments and the control simulations is seen in the lower panel of fig 9 changes in the buoyancy forcing reflect changes in ocean surface properties and sea ice cover since the meteorological forcing fields are prescribed the coarse resolution model reponse to the 50 wind stress increase and decrease is approximately linear as was also the case in the changes of ψ i and σ 36 5 and the modelled response is confined to north of 60 s this latitude coincides approximately with the austral winter sea ice edge fig 1 ctau15 blue solid line gains more buoyancy in the region where water upwells consistent with an equatorward displacement of the σ 36 5 outcrop latitude fig 7 and an increased residual overturning circulation in the upper cell fig 6 vice versa ctau05 solid magenta line finds a decrease in the buoyancy forcing in accord with a relaxation of the isopycnal slope and decrease in the upper cell strength the htau05 buoyancy forcing response dashed magenta line is in many ways similar to ctau05 although it suggests a buoyancy gain about 40 s relative to hcont the changes in the buoyancy forcing in the model simulations that involve enhanced deep convection htau15 and ctau20 behaves differently compared to ctau15 htau15 blue dashed line finds a zonally averaged buoyancy loss throughout the southern ocean most notably at 70 s where the response peaks at 1 5 10 8 m 2 s 3 this is the expression of a strong heat loss to the atmosphere due to a reduced sea ice cover in this model simulation this is also the region where bottom waters are formed in hcont fig 4 and explains the much stronger lower cell seen in fig 6 accordingly ctau20 green solid line also finds a strong heat loss at high southern latitudes and a stronger lower cell the upper cell does not strengthen in htau15 despite the stronger winds and the buoyancy forcing response suggests that the reason is a thermodynamical constraint on the water mass transformation this constraint is not present in ctau20 where the mid latitudes gains more buoyancy than in ccont why the upper residual overturning cell increases as function of the stronger winds 5 discussion the decomposition of the residual meridional overturning circulation seen in fig 4 shows that the lower cell in the control simulations is weaker in ccont compared to hcont this is largely explained by differences in the mean flow circulation middle panels fig 4 in addition to the fact that it is overall weaker it is also more or less absent between 60 s and 50 s and does not extend as far southward as seen in hcont this mismatch between the two simulations is most likely a function of the inability of the coarse resolution model to produce dense bottom waters which is a common shortcoming of most cmip5 models heuzé et al 2013 in support of this conclusion the buoyancy forcing fields from ccont and hcont fig 9 also shows that the antarctic coastal buoyancy loss is greater in hcont and therefore allows for a greater dense water formation the upper mean flow overturning cell has a closer resemblance between the two models and the dissimilarity in the residual of the upper cell is primarily a function of the eddy induced flow which in the lower panels of fig 4 is shown to have a different structure in latitude density space specifically the flow of water between 50 s and 40 s with densities about 1036 kg m3 is poorly represented in ccont as hcont suggests a more surface intensified eddy driven circulation more promising is the parameterized eddy flow in the most dense water between 60 s and 50 s which compares better to hcont as seen from fig 3 this part of the eddy circulation in hcont is however underestimated in ψ i by our choice of using monthly mean output in the computation of ψ i this is not the case with respect to the discrepancy in the upper cell which is not an artifact of a misrepresentation of ψ i but rather originates in the limitations of the gent mcwilliams parameterization differences in the surface buoyancy forcing are able to contribute to the difference in the residual overturning circulation as well this effect is though ascribed a minor contribution given that the ccont and hcont forcing fields are similar in both structure and magnitude as seen from fig 9 a similar result was found in the inter model comparison study by farneti et al 2015 they estimated the eddy induced overturning circulations that arise explicitly in the gfdl and kiel ocean models of 1 4 horizontal resolution and compared it to the circulation from the coarse resolution version of the same models admittedly not able to resolve the full eddy field especially not at high southern latitudes the eddy permitting models do indicate that the parameterization either do not represent or significantly underestimates the eddy induced flow in the lighter water masses close to the surface to the north of 50 s see their figure 18 which is the case in the present study as well that a discrepancy between the resolved and parameterized eddy induced overturning circulation exists is perhaps not unexpected for example it has previously been shown that a down gradient closure for eddy fluxes of isopycnal thickness is of limited skill roberts and marshall 2000 and that ambiguity remains to the optimal choice of the thickness diffusivity eden et al 2009 the parameterized sensitivity of the circulation to the southern ocean zonal wind stress compares well to that of an eddy resolving model for a wind stress reduction on decadal time scale ctau05 and htau05 find a reduction of the upper residual overturning cell of comparable magnitude and spatial structure fig 6 this contrasts with hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 that also investigate the overturning response on a 20 year time scale but use a constant thickness diffusivity in addition both model simulations suggest a reduction of the meridional slope of σ 36 5 which is seen as a depression at high southern latitudes and a lift in the mid latitudes of about 50 m in the zonal mean fig 7 the same comparison for a 50 wind stress increase is made less straightforward by the complex model response of the htau15 experiment as noted in the results section it might be reasonable to assume that the changes in σ 36 5 in the northern part of the southern ocean is unaffected by the deep convection in the polar marginal seas here ctau15 shows a stronger response than htau15 fig 7 which might imply that the sensitivity is higher in the coarse resolution model than in the eddy resolving model with respect to a wind stress increase this inference is though complicated by the fact that the buoyancy forcing change is different between ctau15 and htau15 as well fig 9 comparing the modelled heat transport responses to preceeding model studies fig 8 bryan et al 2014 finds that the parameterized eddy heat transport becomes increasingly southward between 60 s and 50 s due to stronger winds in a coupled model experiment moreover they find that an eddy resolving model obtains an eddy response of opposite sign in an identical forcing scenario in the wind stress reduction experiments analyzed in this study the parameterized and resolved eddy field both result in a consistent weakening of the southward heat transport and the largest response is found between 40 s and 50 s also where bitz and polvani 2012 show that the parameterized response is stronger than the response by the explicit eddies in an ozone forcing experiment we here demonstrate the opposite case with prescribed atmospheric forcing this latter point is also true for the 50 wind stress increase experiments where the explicit eddies respond strongest even in the northern part of the domain away from the antarctic convective zones this inconsistency with past studies is likely the result of differences in experimental setup and the presence of ocean atmosphere feedbacks in the coupled simulations the disparate transient overturning responses simulated in the ctau15 and htau15 experiments displayed in the middle column of panels in fig 6 also deserve more attention despite ambiguity in terms of adjustment time and amplitude the response seen in the ctau15 experiment in general aligns itself with previous coarse resolution eddy parameterizing general circulation model studies that show that the upper residual cell increases in strength as function of stronger zonal wind stress gent and danabasoglu 2011 farneti et al 2015 the message from high resolution model studies has been that a similar though attenuated response is found when the eddies are explicitly resolved hallberg and gnanadesikan 2006 munday et al 2013 the weakening of the upper cell as seen from the htau15 experiment contrasts with these studies and appears to be controlled by the active deep convection in the weddell sea to some extent the sea ice retreat that follows allows for an efficient loss of buoyancy that drives an enhanced formation of bottom water and an amplification of the lower cell fig 9 much alike the results from the buoyancy forcing experiments presented in jansen and nadeau 2016 a recent study by hogg et al 2017 finds a similar decrease of the upper residual cell strength in a global 1 4 resolution general circulation model in an experiment where the southern ocean winds are subject to a poleward shift and intensification in accord with the present study their overturning response is concurrent with deep convection in the weddell sea evidently compensation of the wind driven southern ocean upwelling is not only possible to achieve through increased eddy activity but also through high latitude deep convection which complicates an assessment of the eddy effect in isolation from non equilibrated model runs whether this result has implications for past wind stress change experiments with relatively short adjustment time and changes in surface buoyancy fluxes is not clear the literature on southern ocean wind stress change experiments however shows that it is not uncommon to invoke perturbations of similar magnitude as those tested in the present study e g gent and danabasoglu 2011 dufour et al 2012 munday et al 2013 jochum and eden 2015 bishop et al 2016 lastly we note that observations have shown that the isopycnals have subsided throughout the southern ocean over the last several decades as a function of stronger westerlies but with minimal changes to the isopycnal slope böning et al 2008 their figure 4 a though not directly comparable to the model responses investigated here due to the simplicity of the applied wind stress perturbations and the integration length of the experiments it is possible to compare the nature of the modelled reponse seen in ctau15 and htau15 to the observations the observations show that the modelled adjustment of the 1036 5 kg m3 density surface is of correct sign and is within the correct order of magnitude in the northern part of the domain regardless of model resolution however neither of the models capture the deepening of σ 36 5 at the higher southern latitudes and instead find an increase of the isopycnal slope and the drake passage transport table 2 the high resolution wind stress reduction experiment htau05 which does not experience a reduced sea ice extent also provides evidence for a finite sensitivity of the isopycnal slope to the zonal wind stress appropriate to the discussion of the results presented here is also the short spin up of the high resolution model and the void of a control integration through the 50 wind stress change experiments which are obvious drawbacks to the analysis of hcont htau05 and htau15 fig 2 shows that the horizontally averaged southern ocean temperature field drifts and that hcont is warmer than ccont in the upper 1km the time series of the overturning strength of the upper and lower cell shown in fig 5 as well as the drake passage transport time series seen in the bottom panel of fig 2 do provide some comfort in that the metrics under investigation do not drift prior to the initiation of the perturbation experiments a weakening of the lower cell with time is visible green line fig 5 a result that most likely stems from an insufficient spin up of the deep ocean and enters the results section as an overestimation of the strength of the lower cell the drift in hcont also influences the results from the wind stress change experiments as the ten year means obtained from the control and the perturbation experiments are shifted in time due to the absence of a sufficiently long control integration however given the short integration times involved in this study and the negligible drift in the hcont overturning strength we do not expect remaining drift to change the results significantly 6 summary we compare forced ocean general circulation model simulations of 1 and 0 1 horizontal resolution to assess the ability of the eddy mixing parameterization as formulated in danabasoglu and marshall 2007 to mimic resolved eddy effects a comparison of the southern ocean isopycnal streamfunction from the two models shows that the coarse resolution model has a weaker transport in both overturning cells with present day wind stress magnitude from a decomposition of the residual overturning streamfunction into a mean flow and an eddy induced component it is evident that a different distribution of the eddy circulation across water masses is responsible for a substantial part of the dissimilarity seen in the upper cell of the residual overturning differences in the mean flow overturning circulation also exist but the implication of this discrepancy is most important for the lower overturning cell for example the deep flow in the coarse resolution model appears to be entirely eddy driven between 60 s and 50 s but this is not the case in the high resolution model in addition the decomposition of the meridional heat transport reveals that the parameterized poleward eddy heat flux is overly strong in the southern ocean a zonally constant decrease of the southern ocean zonal wind stress south of 25 s results in a decrease of similar magnitude in the upper residual overturning cell in both models concurrently the meridional isopycnal slope reduces and the northward meridional heat transport decreases regardless of model resolution an increase of the wind stress by 50 on the other hand is found to drive a complex model response in the 0 1 resolution model but not in the coarse resolution model on decadal time scale the transient response from the high resolution model shows a weakening of the upper residual overturning cell by approx 20 and a strengthening of the lower cell driven by enhanced bottom water formation in the weddell sea this follows from a retreat of the austral winter sea ice edge that allows for a strong loss of heat to the prescribed atmosphere in contrast the residual meridional overturning in the coarse resolution model finds a 100 increase of the upper cell on the same time scale and with no discernable change in the lower cell a 100 wind stress increase experiment with the coarse resolution model also features a reduction in antarctic sea ice and stronger residual overturning in the bottom cell demonstrating that the complex model response is not limited to the high resolution model the main conclusion from the presented suite of experiments is that the parameterized eddies are able to mimic the nature of the resolved eddy field during wind stress change but are less skillful in representing the residual meridional overturning circulation and the heat transport for present day wind stress in addition we also emphasize that the dynamics of eddy compensation are probably more involved than what is found in simple models e g marshall and radko 2003 as exemplified by the high resolution model experiment with stronger wind stress the interaction between the sea ice and the ocean results in buoyancy forcing changes that overwhelm the eddy response it appears that the challenge for future general circulation model studies is to design clever experimental setups that clearly isolate the effect from the eddies yet preserve the complexity

24117,a three dimensional nonhydrostatic coastal model suntans is used to study hyperpycnal plumes on sloping continental shelves with idealized domain setup the study aims to examine the nonhydrostatic effect of the plunging hyperpycnal plume and the associated flow structures on different shelf slopes the unstructured triangular grid in suntans allows for local refinement of the grid size for regions in which the flow varies abruptly while retaining low cost computation using the coarse grid resolution for regions in which the flow is more uniform these nonhydrostatic simulations reveal detailed three dimensional flow structures in both transient and steady states via comparison with the hydrostatic simulation we show that the nonhydrostatic effect is particularly important before plunging when the plume is subject to significant changes in both the along shore and vertical directions after plunging where the plume becomes an undercurrent that is more spatially uniform little difference is found between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations in the present gentle and mild slope cases a grid dependence study shows that the nonhydrostatic effect can be seen only when the grid resolution is sufficiently fine that the calculation is not overly diffusive a depth integrated momentum budget analysis is then conducted to show that the flow convergence due to plunging is an important factor in the three dimensional flow structures moreover it shows that the nonhydrostatic effect becomes more important as the slope increases and in the steep slope case neglect of transport of the vertical momentum during plunging in the hydrostatic case further leads to an erroneous prediction for the undercurrent keywords hyperpycnal plume suntans nonhydrostatic effect plunging 1 introduction hyperpycnal plume is a type of turbidity current which is a sediment laden current that moves down a slope in water it is driven by gravity and frequently occurs in natural environments such as lakes reservoirs and estuaries van rijn 1984 chikita and okumura 1990 when the suspended concentration of sediment in a river is so great that the bulk density of the river water is greater than the density of the ambient water the hyperpycnal plume forms a flowing undercurrent driven by the difference in density between the current and the ambient fluid meiburg and kneller 2010 this typically occurs during or after storms or typhoon events when considerable suspended sediments are transported by the flood along the river and finally discharge into reservoirs or the sea mulder and syvitski 1995 hyperpycnal plumes play an important role in sediment transport in the ocean which can in turn significantly alter the underwater environment in the ocean milliman and syvitski 1992 warrick and milliman 2003 dadson et al 2005 liu et al 2013 in general hyperpycnal plumes can be divided into three parts plunging the main body and the head region kassem and imran 2001 as shown in fig 1 due to the degree of dilution the flow instability and mixing at the leading head determine the propagation distance of the underwater turbidity current within the main body the vertical profiles of the velocity and the sediment concentration are responsible for scouring and deposition on the sea floor in the plunging region where the plume begins to sink beneath the ambient fluid to become an undercurrent the strong entrainment is critical to the subsequent plume dynamics in the main body entrainment due to the interfacial shear instability between the ambient ocean fluid and the undercurrent also plays an important role in plume dynamics numerous early studies used theoretical derivations and laboratory experiments to obtain a better understanding of hyperpycnal plumes e g benjamin 1968 ellison and turner 1959 britter and linden 1980 huppert and simpson 1980 parker et al 1987 garcia 1993 altinakar et al 1996 kneller et al 1999 these studies focused on turbidity currents and provided insights into both the leading head and main body of the plume however studies of the plunging region remain relatively rare and have been limited to theoretical argument hauenstein and dracos 1984 akiyama and stefan 1984 recently owing to great advances in computational techniques and resources two or three dimensional hydrodynamic modeling has become an important approach for the study of sediment laden plumes two dimensional vertical 2dv modeling along with turbulence closure models are widely conducted to simulate the laboratory scale turbidity currents for investigating the flow structure and small scale dynamics for example choi and garcia 2002 used 2dv reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations along with a k ϵ turbulence model to investigate the mean flow structure and modeled turbulent kinetic energy of a dense undercurrent on a constant slope in their study comparison with the depth integrated model which was commonly used in earlier theoretical and computational works e g ellison and turner 1959 parker et al 1986 akiyama and stefan 1984 1985 garcia 1993 bradford and katopodes 1999a 1999b was also discussed huang et al 2005 developed a hydrodynamics model also with rans formulation and k ϵ modeling to investigate the vertical profiles of the velocity and sediment concentration of turbidity currents on a deforming bed that can be adjusted due to deposition and erosion kassem and imran 2001 presented pioneering simulation results of plunging river plumes in both laboratory and field scales using the commercial navier stokes flow solver fluent in contrast to the 2dv equations in choi and garcia 2002 both kassem and imran 2001 and huang et al 2005 adopted three dimensional 3d formulation in their flow solvers however since the models were applied for comparison with past 2dv laboratory experiments only the 2dv results were presented khan et al 2005 investigated hyperpycnal plumes interaction with the along shore current and the resulting bed forms in a field scale idealized setting the computational framework in khan et al 2005 includes a depth integrated two dimensional horizontal 2dh model hyper and a 3d flow solver fluent the 2dh model which is based on the earlier works of bradford and katopodes 1999a b is intended to capture the large scale dynamics of the undercurrent and the resulting bed forms whereas the 3d flow solver is used to provide the relevant flow parameters of plunging for 2dh model during which the strong vertical motion cannot be simulated by the 2dh model the approach that uses the 3d flow solver for plunging provides a flexible and practical alternative to adopting the results from the theoretical derivation such as akiyama and stefan 1984 for modeling field scale plunging hyperpycnal plumes however like kassem and imran 2001 perhaps owing to the considerable computational power required for field scale modeling khan et al 2005 presented only 2dv modeling of plunging in the field scale with fluent which disregards the lateral variation more recently el gawad et al 2012 applied a three dimensional flow solver to simulate turbidity currents in a submarine channel on the seafloor of the niger delta by applying the field bathymetric data the model realistically predicts the flow field and its evolution over the complex topography it shows strong lateral flow from the inner to the outer bank at the bends of the submarine channel the study demonstrates that the 3d flow solver is a useful tool for understanding the dynamics of the field scale turbidity currents and their deposition in complex environmental settings another study by chen et al 2013 also conducted 3d simulation using the regional ocean modeling system roms which solved the primitive equations under the hydrostatic assumption to investigate hyperpycnal plumes on sloping continental shelves with idealized domain settings in their study different slopes were applied to examine the transition from the depositional to the auto suspension regime of the plume their simulation results revealed the complete evolution of the plunging hyperpycnal plume discharged from the river mouth to the continental slopes however the discussion was limited to the undercurrent in fact as it disregards transport of the vertical momentum the capability of the hydrostatic model to correctly capture the plunging of the plume remains questionable and requires further assessment moreover as full 3d numerical modeling for field scale cases remains computationally challenging the hybrid predictive framework such as in khan et al 2005 may still provide a feasible and practical approach however the validity of the 2dv prediction determined by either theories or flow solvers and the three dimensionality of the plunging river plume in the field require more detailed investigation therefore the present study aims to examine the nonhydrostatic effect in field scale modeling and to reveal the 3d flow structure from nonhydrostatic simulations in this study we present the 3d simulation results of plunging hyperpycnal plumes on sloping continental shelves with an idealized domain setting similar to that in chen et al 2013 we use the 3d hydrodynamics model suntans which solves momentum and mass transport equations on the grid that are unstructured and triangular in the horizontal dimension and z level in the vertical dimension fringer et al 2006 the triangular grid enables local refinement of the resolution of interest such as plunging the model allows for both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculation in the former case it solves the primitive equations under the hydrostatic assumption like other ocean models e g roms whereas in the latter the full navier stokes equations are considered and a standard fraction step method armfield and street 2000 is used to guarantee divergence free of the velocity field via nonhydrostatic pressure in fact as discussed in section 2 the major difference between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations is consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum in the latter case whereas the former case obtains the vertical velocity only based on mass conservation the hydrostatic calculation which has been widely used in modern hydrodynamics models to solve geophysical flows is a valid approximation for problems in which the horizontal scale is much greater than the vertical scale a condition that applies to most geophysical and environmental conditions however it may not be valid when the vertical motion is significant such as with internal waves zhang et al 2011 and plunging of the river plume in this study in this study with the use of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations using suntans we first address the importance of nonhydrostatic pressure i e consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum for modeling the complete evolution of a hyperpycnal plume we discuss the dependence of the modeled nonhydrostatic effect on the grid resolution this is of critical importance regarding 3d numerical modeling of the hyperpycnal plume in the field scale cases second we aim to reveal plume s 3d flow structures and discuss the resulting bulk effects through the depth integrated analysis this can be useful when the simplified models such as 2dv and 2dh models are considered 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 nonhydrostatic modeling in the nonhydrostatic calculation we solve the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the boussinesq approximation if one splits the total pressure p into the hydrostatic pressure p and the nonhydrostatic pressure q i e p p q the governing equations are 1 u t u u 1 ρ 0 h q 1 ρ 0 h p h ν h h u z ν v u z 2 ω u 2 w t u w 1 ρ 0 q z h ν h h w z ν v w z 3 u 0 4 p z ρ g where u u v is the horizontal component of the velocity field u u v w h x y is the horizontal gradient operator ρ 0 is the constant reference fresh water density νh and νv are the summation of the turbulent and molecular viscosities in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively ω is the angular velocity vector of earth rotation ρ is the total density and g is the gravitational acceleration in the present study for the sake of clarity we neglect the coriolis force i e ω 0 in all simulations the difference between the present model equations eqs 1 and 2 for the momentum and the traditional hydrostatic primitive equations is in the consideration of the vertical momentum a simple scaling argument can be derived to show that the hydrostatic calculation can be a good approximation for most geophysical flow in which the horizontal scales are usually much larger than the vertical scales however when the vertical motion is strong such as the plunging of the hyperpycnal plume in the present study the hydrostatic assumption can make the solution deviate significantly from its nonhydrostatic counterpart which is discussed in detail in the remainder of the paper the evolution of the free surface height h is calculated using the depth averaged continuity equation 5 h t h d h u d z 0 where d is the water depth in the present study we consider the density stratification due to salinity s and suspended sediment concentration ssc ϕ in the present study ϕ has units of g l 1 and the volume fraction φ of sediment is calculated by φ ϕ ρ s where ρ s 2650 kg m 3 is the density of the sediment particle the total density ρ is thus expressed as 6 ρ ρ b ρ s ρ b φ 1 β s ρ 0 ρ s 1 β s ρ 0 φ where ρb is the background density ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the density of pure water and β 7 5 10 4 psu 1 is the expansion coefficient of salt both salinity and ssc are modeled using the mass transport equations respectively 7 s t u s h γ h h s z γ v s z 8 ϕ t u ϕ w s ϕ z h γ h h ϕ z γ v ϕ z where γh and γv are the horizontal and vertical diffusivities respectively and ws is the settling speed 2 2 numerical methods in the present study we use the unstructured grid coastal model suntans fringer et al 2006 for numerical simulation it includes both the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations and it simply solves the traditional primitive equations in the hydrostatic calculation in the nonhydrostatic calculation following the fractional step method by armfield and street 2000 it first calculates the predictive velocity field u by solving eqs 1 and 2 using the nonhydrostatic pressure at the previous time step a nonhydrostatic pressure correction qc is then obtained by solving the discretized pressure poisson equation that enforces the continuity i e 9 l q c 1 δ t u where δt is the computational time step l is the discrete laplacian operator and is the discrete divergence operator at the nth computational time step the nonhydrostatic pressure for the next step q n 1 2 is then updated with 10 q n 1 2 q n 1 2 q c and the horizontal velocity is obtained by correcting the predicted value with 11 u n 1 u δ t q c where is the discrete gradient operator the vertical velocity is then calculated from the local continuity equation eq 3 12 w n 1 z δ z w n 1 z z z δ z h u n 1 η d η with the no penetration condition w 0 at the bottom boundary 3 simulation setup following chen et al 2013 the idealized domain used in the present study consists of a straight river channel and an open ocean as shown in fig 2 the river channel is 10 km long and 1 km wide and the open ocean is 20 and 40 km in the cross and along shore directions respectively the domain configuration was originally designed for the cases when the coriolis force was taken into account therefore the channel is not centered north south relative to the ocean portion however as the coriolis force is disregarded in the present study we focus on the domain that is symmetric with respect to the line in alignment with the central line of the channel this line is defined as the central line of the domain and its along shore coordinate is set to 0 see fig 2 the channel has a constant depth of 5 m and the open ocean part has a constant slope along the cross shore direction which represents the shelf slope in the present study we use three different slopes 0 003 0 005 and 0 01 which are named gentle medium and steep slopes respectively two grid resolutions are used see fig 2 the simulation cases that use the fine grid resolution are the base cases and the coarse resolution is used only to investigate the grid dependence the number of the horizontal cells in the fine grid case is 33 928 and is 9 962 in the coarse grid case in both cases the grid resolution is refined near the river mouth and becomes coarser as the distance from the river mouth increases as a result the distance between two voronoi points ranges from 2 7 m to 600 m with a mean distance 78 m in the fine grid case and ranges from 15 9 m to 600 m with a mean distance 212 m in the coarse grid the numbers of the vertical layer are chosen such that the vertical grid resolution 0 3 m in all simulation cases table 1 summarizes the details of the domain set up in each case in addition to demonstrate the three dimensional effect two more sloping channel cases medium and steep slopes are simulated in these two cases simulations are conducted in sloping channels with a constant width 1 km which is wide enough to neglect the side wall effect at the central line where the flow can thus be treated as 2d the computations are carried out on the dell poweredge m620 supercomputer cluster using 32 processors the simulation wall clock times for one computation step in all the river ocean cases are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that in the fine grid cases the computational time for the nonhydrostatic simulation is about twice as much as the hydrostatic simulation time and this ratio slightly increases as the bottom slope increases i e more grid cells in the present cases a fresh water inflow discharge that contains suspended sediment is specified as an inflow boundary condition for the river channel in the 3d cases open boundary condition is specified for all ocean boundaries to allow for the fluid flowing out of the domain the ssc ϕ of 50 g l 1 is specified at the river and inflow discharge which is well above the threshold of ssc for which the hyperpycnal discharge occurs for a typical range of temperature and salinity according to mulder and syvitski 1995 in the ocean the salinity is set to 32 psu and ssc is initially 0 as a result the initial bulk density is 1 031 kg m 3 at the river and 1 024 kg m 3 in the ocean the inflow velocity of the river flow is set to 2 m s 1 corresponding to a strong discharge event given by the current inflow conditions at the channel chen et al 2013 argued that the hyperpycnal condition is limited to a range of the small settling speed i e w s 0 05 0 5 mm s 1 that is within this range of the settling speed the flow power is able to maintain sediment in suspension winterwerp 2001 and the baroclinic force persists therefore as the plunging is a result of a balance between the baroclinic forcing and flow inertia one can expect that under the hyperpycnal condition plumes with different ws cases behave similar before plunging but may differ from each other after plunging when the flow energy is greatly reduced in that the coarser sediments settle more rapidly thus reducing the propagation distance of the front here the settling speed ws is set to 0 1 mm s 1 corresponding to a particle of 12 µm in diameter according to stokes law and is consistent with the previous observations of sediment discharge in a hyperpycnal river e g kao et al 2008 in all simulation cases we allow for the settling of suspended sediment through the bottom boundary the settling flux through the bottom boundary is simply calculated by ϕbws in which ϕb denotes ϕ in the lowest grid cell for the sake of simplicity and clarity for demonstrating hydrodynamics sediment erosion at the bottom is deactivated which eliminates the uncertainties arising from the sophisticated empirical parameterizations for modeling erosion processes 4 results 4 1 plume dynamics and structure fig 3 a h shows a series of snapshots of ssc in the vertical transect at the central line y 0 see fig 2 and the corresponding planviews at the surface at representative time steps in the medium slope case in nonhydrostatic simulation as shown in fig 3 a at the starting stage when the sediment laden river plume enters the shelf a leading underflow forms due to sinking of the plume at the head region at this stage the surface ssc as presented in fig 3 e shows a pair of strong vortices due to baroclinic forcing the plume continues to propagate until it first reaches the plunging point as shown in fig 3 b which is a result of a balance between the flow inertia and baroclinic pressure forcing in the mean time as shown in fig 3 f a triangular pattern of ssc along with residual vortices at the plume head forms at the surface and is retained as shown in figs 3 g and h the 3d structure of the plume during the steady state can be seen from the isosurface of ssc 20 g l 1 in fig 4 the mechanism that leads to the triangular pattern of the surface ssc is due to the fact that plunging is a result of a balance between the flow inertia and baroclinic forcing hauenstein and dracos 1984 that is using the froude number fr obtained with hauenstein and dracos 1984 13 f r u p g p d p where dp is the water depth at plunging 14 u p 1 d p d p 0 u z d z and 15 g p 1 d p d p 0 g ρ z ρ 0 ρ 0 d z fr is expected to be a constant and close to an order of 1 in the plunging region as the plume leaves the channel one can expect that the streamwise velocity cross shore velocity peaks at the central line and decreases in the spanwise direction which is similar to the free turbulent jet as a result to maintain a constant fr the plunging depth dp peaks at the central line and decreases as one moves away from the central line in the along shore direction leading to the present triangular pattern in addition as demonstrated by johnson et al 1987 using a series of experiments in diverging channels the triangular pattern of ssc in the near surface region is a typical pattern when the negatively buoyant plume enters a horizontally diverging channel with a large diffuser angle as discussed in section 5 2 the triangular pattern which exhibits strong lateral variability has important influences on the plume s bulk behavior upon reaching the plunging point the undercurrent continues to propagate downslope while the near surface portion of the plume soon moves slightly toward the river mouth as shown in figs 3 b and c and then reaches its steady state as shown in fig 3 d fig 5 shows planviews of the representative ssc snapshots in the surface and near bed regions at the steady state in three different slope cases as shown in figs 5 a c the aforementioned triangular ssc pattern is a common feature at the surface in each case and has a shorter distance in the along shore direction when the slope is steeper indicating that the plume plunges earlier in each case along the perimeter of the triangular ssc interface is the plunging region at which the froude number fr is nearly a constant for each slope in the cases of slopes of 0 01 and 0 005 f r 1 2 1 4 and 1 0 1 2 respectively whereas in the case of slope of 0 003 f r 0 7 0 8 as shown in figs 5 d f once the river plume enters the continental slope the plume begins to spread in the along shore direction spreading of the plume is weaker when the bed slope is steeper i e the ssc is more concentrated at the central line which is also found in chen et al 2013 as previously mentioned an important issue in the context of density current is the entrainment at the density interface the examination of the entrainment versus the bulk froude number is given in appendix a which shows good agreement between the present simulation results and those in previous experimental studies 4 2 nonhydrostatic effect as the nonhydrostatic calculation deviates from the hydrostatic cases due to consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum the significant difference between the two cases can be found at the plunging point where the vertical motion is strongest to show this difference figs 3 i p present representative snapshots of the ssc in the hydrostatic case corresponding to each panel in figs 3 a h for the medium slope case during the transient stage comparison between figs 3 b and c and figs 3 j and k shows that near the plunging point the ssc in the nonhydrostatic case drops much more quickly than in the hydrostatic case so the backward movement of the plunging point is slower in the latter case because the modeled eddy diffusivity is significantly higher making the simulation overly diffusive at the plume ocean interface the vertical eddy diffusivity γt in the suntans model is obtained with γ t ν t σ t where νt is the eddy viscosity obtained from the turbulence model and σt is the turbulence schmidt number which is set to 1 here simpson 1982 nielsen and teakle 2004 the mellor yamada level 2 5 my2 5 mellor and yamada 2005 turbulence closure scheme is used to compute νt the my2 5 scheme solves transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy and the master length scale with the shear production as the source mellor and yamada 2005 as shown in fig 6 where we show the horizontal velocity and vertical eddy diffusivity corresponding to figs 3 d and l without considering transport of vertical momentum the horizontal velocity in the hydrostatic case exhibits unrealistic fluctuations before plunging see fig 6a the resulting stronger velocity gradient in the vertical direction u z in the hydrostatic case leads to the stronger shear production which significantly enhances the eddy diffusivity as shown in fig 6 c fluctuations of the horizontal velocity in the hydrostatic simulation are due to the undissipated vertical velocity obtained from mass conservation as shown in fig 9 a detailed discussion of which is given in section 5 1 at the surface fluctuations in the modeled velocity in the hydrostatic case lead to oscillation of the ssc front during the transient state as can be seen from the asymmetry of the ssc front in fig 3 o when the plume reaches the steady state comparison of figs 3 d and l does not show a strong difference in ssc between the two cases except that the plunging point predicted by the hydrostatic model is about 200 m further seaward than that predicted by the nonhydrostatic model a notable feature in the hydrostatic calculation is the fluctuation of the ssc before plunging as can be seen from the spatially fluctuated contour lines of ssc 50 g l 1 in figs 3 i l in the hydrostatic case the vertical velocity is calculated only on the basis of mass conservation which cannot be properly damped while the vertical momentum is disregarded this in turn leads to fluctuations in the modeled horizontal velocity and ssc as shown in fig 3 d and l when the plume becomes an undercurrent after plunging the results of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations are similar due to the dominance of the horizontal motion during the propagation of the undercurrent as the vertical motion becomes minor also the front is another flow region where the vertical velocity is significant and the nonhydrostatic effect can be important the vertical velocity at the front region is due to mass conservation of a relatively uniform flow and its dissipation in the model depends on the resolvability of the bottom boundary layer however because after plunging the plume is relatively thin i e vertical scale horizontal scale 1 and in typical circulation models the under resolved boundary layer flow can only be modeled using boundary layer parameters such as the drag law used here fringer et al 2006 as a result hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations give nearly identical flow features at the front and the nonhydrostatic effect cannot be shown at the front in the latter case 5 discussion 5 1 resolution dependence for numerical modeling it is critical to know the dependence of the modeled nonhydrostatic effect on the grid resolution as mentioned in section 2 nonhydrostatic modeling indicates consideration of the vertical momentum transport without proper diffusion and advection the vertical velocity that is solely based on continuity in the hydrostatic model may strongly fluctuate resulting in an unrealistic flow field a typical example was demonstrated in fringer et al 2006 using the laboratory scale lock exchange flow however such unrealistic velocity fluctuation may not be seen in most field scale hydrostatic modeling results because the horizontal diffusion is so strong that the fluctuations can be smeared as a result no significant fluctuation in the velocity field is found in the overly diffusive calculation and the nonhydrostatic simulation may differ negligibly from hydrostatic results however the dominance of the diffusion in the hydrostatic calculation can easily lead to an erroneous prediction and the simulation result will not converge with the refining grid resolution a similar issue was addressed by vitousek and fringer 2011 for the simulation of internal solitary waves the study showed that given a minimum horizontal length scale ls that needs to be resolved by the model due to numerical dispersion the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models converged when δx ls was large but only the nonhydrostatic model converged to the analytical solution when δx ls became small that is the modeled nonhydrostatic effect i e the calculation of vertical momentum transport emerges only when the grid size is sufficiently small that the model resolves the smallest scale this smallest scale ls depends on both the flow condition and the model i e the grid configuration in fig 7 we show the ssc and the cross shore velocity component at the steady state in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic cases using coarse resolution along with the fine resolution nonhydrostatic case for comparison unlike the fine resolution case the coarse resolution case shows almost no difference in both the ssc and cross shore velocity between the two cases this is due to the excessive numerical diffusion in the horizontal momentum equation which smears the horizontal velocity gradient and makes the vertical velocity based on continuity relatively weak and the nonhydrostatic effect unimportant the numerical diffusion arises from the truncation error associated with discretization in all of the numerical schemes moin 2001 for example in the present study we use a first order upwind scheme for the calculation of the nonlinear advection term the numerical viscosity νnum of which is given by 16 ν n u m δ h 2 2 δ t c f l 1 c f l where δh is the horizontal grid size i e the distance between the voronoi points for unstructured grids δt is the computational time step and c f l u c δ t δ h fig 8 presents the numerical viscosity calculated using eq 16 in both the coarse and fine grid cases in the medium slope case during the steady state it can be seen that νnum ranges from 15 to 30 m2 s 1 in the coarse grid case and from 0 to 10 m2 s 1 in the fine grid case to justify this and to obtain a criterion for which the nonhydrostatic effect can be important we invoke a advection diffusion length scale lad defined as 17 l a d ν n u m u c where νnum is the numerical viscosity and uc is the characteristic velocity in the horizontal direction the scale lad represents a length scale for which the advection and numerical diffusion are of the same order of magnitude which should be made as small as possible in the numerical model the next step is to find the length scale ls such that if the ratio ls lad is sufficiently large i e 1 the numerical diffusion is so small that the variation of the resolved horizontal velocity is not smeared appreciably in the present simulation the highest fluctuation in the vertical velocity in the hydrostatic solution is found on the slope before plunging see fig 9 where the plume is subject to significant changes in both the vertical and spanwise directions as shown in fig 9 in the hydrostatic calculation fluctuations can be much reduced by numerical diffusion as the grid size increases to a certain level see fig 9 c in this case the nonhydrostatic effect becomes insignificant and the nonhydrostatic pressure makes almost no difference from the hydrostatic results as shown in fig 9 d fluctuations in the vertical velocity can become stronger when the grid size is refined see fig 9 a due to the lack of proper dissipation for the vertical momentum and it can only be fixed by the consideration of the nonhydrostatic pressure as the fluctuation is dominated by the grid discretization one can obtain a relevant horizontal length scale l s from discretized continuity given by 18 δ w δ z l s δ u c where δ indicates the variation of the associated physical quantity δz is the vertical grid size and l s is either the problem or model specified length scale as relevant scaling for δw on the slope before plunging is δw slope δuc the scale for l s can be obtained with 19 l s δ z slope in other words l s is the shortest horizontal length of the stair step at the sloping bottom topography in the model which gives the horizontal length scale of the fluctuation of the vertical velocity when the grid resolution is sufficiently fine such that the numerical diffusion is not dominant in the solutions of the momentum due to continuity l s becomes the length scale of the variation in uc see eq 18 hence the ratio between the fluctuation scale l s and the diffusion length scale lad provides a measure of the extent to which the discretization induced velocity fluctuation can be smeared here from eqs 17 and 19 the ratio is given in analogy with the reynolds number as 20 r e l l s l a d u c l s ν n u m u c δ z slope ν n u m which is a model parameter to indicate the extent to which the fluctuation of the continuity based vertical velocity in the hydrostatic simulation are smeared by the numerical diffusion if rel is large i e 1 fluctuations of the vertical velocity in the hydrostatic case cannot be sufficiently smeared by the numerical diffusion and only in this case the simulation can reveal the nonhydrostatic effect moreover substitution of eq 16 into 20 and replacing the first cfl with its definition c f l u c δ t δ h gives 21 r e l 2 δ z slope δ h 1 c f l now using eq 21 and requiring that rel 1 one can obtain the resolution requirement for which the nonhydrostatic pressure is important for the present case i e 22 δ h 2 δ z slope 1 c f l in the present study δz 0 3 m is used in each simulation case which gives l s 60 m for the medium slope slope 0 005 as uc 1 m s 1 in the region before plunging one can obtain that in most of the region before plunging rel ranges from 2 to 4 in the coarse grid case and much greater rel o 10 in the fine grid case as a result the modeled nonhydrostatic vertical momentum transport is effective only in the fine grid case it should be noted that the last identity in eq 20 is derived specifically for the flow over the bottom topography and eq 22 is derived based on numerical schemes in suntans for different flow conditions or numerical methods it needs to be rederived based on the first identity of eq 20 in fact any flow phenomenon in nature can span a wide range of spatial scales such as turbulence and buoyancy length scales i e different ls s associated with each length scale is the significant momentum variations once the grid resolution is sufficiently fine to resolve one of these scales i e ls lad 1 regardless of the eddy viscosity the results in the hydrostatic case can show unrealistically strong velocity fluctuations due to undissipated vertical momentum in this case the nonhydrostatic effect becomes important one example for which ls is the scale of the kelvin helmholtz billows in the lock exchange flow can be found in fringer et al 2006 in additional to these length scales in the hydrostatic numerical model the stair step feature of the bottom grid introduces an additional length scale in the present study as one refining the grid resolution this length scale appears to be the first scale for which the velocities in the hydrostatic case fluctuate significantly and deviate from the nonhydrostatic results that is l s is the coarsest length scale level that gives the first resolution criterion for which the nonhydrostatic effect is important 5 2 depth integrated momentum budget analysis due to the large horizontal scale relative to the vertical scale studies of geophysical flows often apply two dimensional flow models based on the depth averaged equations of motion therefore in this section analysis of the depth integrated momentum budget is conducted to examine the bulk contribution of the bed slope the nonhydrostatic effect and the three dimensional flow structures 5 2 1 slope effect according to the derivation in appendix b the depth integrated momentum equation along the central line can be written as 23 δ x k u x δ x p x p b θ f d u s u v y d u x at y 0 where p b θ is the along slope component of the gravitational force f d u is the modified drag at the sloping bottom s u v y represents the lateral transport of the horizontal momentum d u x represents the horizontal diffusion and δ x k u x and δ x p x represent the cross shore variations of the depth integrated horizontal momentum and the baroclinic pressure potential respectively the mathematical expressions of all the terms in eq 23 are given by eqs b 13 b 18 in eq 23 the bed slope tan θ directly affects the plume dynamics via two forcing factors the first p b θ is the along slope component of the gravitational force which is also called the gravity potential it is zero when there is no slope and is dominant when the undercurrent becomes fully developed i e δ x 0 the second f d u is due to the slope modified bottom drag f d u c b u b u b tan θ u b see eq b 16 in which the subscript b indicates the bottom fig 10 shows the spatial evolutions along the central line y 0 of all the terms in eq 23 in each slope case it can be seen that flows can be simply divided into two distinct regions separated by the plunging point upon entering the shelf slope from the channel the current begins to lose momentum due to the increase of the current depth so that δ x k u initially decreases with the distance from the river mouth when the slope becomes steeper s u v y increases due to the lateral transport as mentioned in section 4 1 plunging results in a triangular pattern of the ssc contour at the surface as shown in fig 4 the triangular pattern is retained in the water column until the plume becomes an undercurrent the convergence of the horizontal flow toward the central line results in the lateral transport of both mass and momentum toward the central line this can be clearly seen in fig 11 f which presents the vertical transect in the along shore direction of the along shore velocity component in the steep slope case it shows the significant flow convergence within the plume before plunging and divergence after plunging as shown in fig 10 when the slope becomes steeper the plume plunges closer to the river mouth leading to a faster flow convergence and stronger lateral transport of momentum toward the central line before plunging while the pressure potential p is in balance with the gravity potential p b θ fig 10 indicates that the lateral transport s u v y and the modified bottom drag f d u are the two major forcing terms that dominate the propagation of the plume as shown in fig 10 upon plunging s u v y drops and then becomes negative in all slope cases which indicates that the plume becomes horizontally divergent as it becomes the undercurrent as also demonstrated in figs 11 j through l after plunging the gravity potential p b θ is the dominant potential forcing for the undercurrent at this stage fig 10 shows that p b θ is in balance with the bottom drag f d u and lateral spreading s u v y the present simulation results indicate the importance of lateral momentum transport due to spanwise spreading when the plume becomes the undercurrent the comparison for each slope case in fig 10 indicates that the contribution of the lateral transport to the momentum balance in the undercurrent is increasingly important when the slope becomes steeper the depth integration analysis for the evolution of the along shore momentum is also conducted based on eq b 19 derived in appendix b the depth integrated equation for the analysis is expressed as 24 δ y k v y δ y p y f d v s u v x d v h where f d v is the modified drag at the sloping bottom s u v x represents the lateral transport d v h is the horizontal diffusion and δ y k v y and δ y p y represent the along shore variations of the depth integrated horizontal momentum and the baroclinic pressure potential respectively the mathematical expressions of all terms in eq 24 are given by eqs b 20 b 24 a notable difference between the cross shore eq 23 and along shore momentum transport eq 24 equations is the absence of the gravity potential in the latter fig 11 presents the spatial evolution of all the terms in eq 24 at representative vertical transects in the along shore direction along with the corresponding horizontal velocities and ssc distributions in each slope case in fig 11 the locations the cross shore coordinates of the transects in each case are chosen so that depths are all the same it can be seen from figs 11 a through c that in each slope case there is no significant transport of the along shore momentum before plunging i e along shore distance 0 25 km the apparent along shore momentum component emerges once the plume plunges and becomes an undercurrent which propagates in the along shore direction however the relatively small v makes δ y k v negligible compared with the other dominant terms unlike the cross shore momentum transport in which the plume has an initial momentum input and the bed slope consistently acts as a momentum source the baroclinic pressure potential p is the only forcing that drives the lateral spreading of the undercurrent which is almost in balance with the cross transport component s u v x due to stronger convergence in u the plume on the steeper slope is associated with less lateral along shore spreading of ssc and less δ y k v in conjunction with the stronger gravity potential acting along the cross shore direction on the steeper slope the lateral spreading of the undercurrent is weaker when the slope becomes steeper as indicated by less δ y k v and more concentrated ssc toward the center in the steeper slope case in fig 11 5 2 2 three dimensional effect to highlight the 3d effect we show the difference between the two dimensional 2d and 3d plumes by conducting two additional 2d nonhydrostatic simulations for the medium and steep slope cases details of the simulation set up are described in section 3 and summarized in table 1 unlike that in the 3d cases the undercurrent in the 2d cases can hit the seaward boundary due to the insufficient dissipation therefore the runs stop once the undercurrent is close to the outflow boundary which is the time when the plunging point has been retained in its steady state as shown in fig 12 which presents the results of the depth integrated momentum analysis for the cross shore component in the 2d cases without lateral momentum transport in the 2d cases before plunging the cross shore momentum component δ x k u decays after entering the shelf slope upon plunging δ x k u reaches its minimum and then increases with the distance from the river mouth when it becomes an undercurrent an important difference between the 2d and 3d cases is the down slope acceleration of the plume after plunging in the former case in the absence of the lateral momentum transport i e spreading the drag and diffusion are insufficient to balance the gravitational forcing caused by the bed slope the three dimensionality of the plume can also alter the location of plunging typically the lateral spreading of the plume makes the cross shore momentum decay much faster in the 3d case than it does in the 2d case which makes the plume plunge earlier in the former case i e closer to the river mouth this can be confirmed by comparing figs 10 b and fig 12 a for the medium slope cases comparison of the 2d fig 12 and 3d fig 10 plumes also shows the significant deviation in the evolution of the cross shore momentum between the two cases due to the lateral transport of momentum s u v y as the lateral transport becomes a momentum sink after plunging without s u v y the 2d undercurrent is much more energetic than the 3d undercurrent which implies a similar condition for underwater turbidity currents in marine canyons 5 2 3 hydrostatic vs nonhydrostatic simulation the difference between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulation cases is also examined from the depth integrated results as it ignores the vertical momentum transport the flow motion before plunging cannot be properly calculated by the hydrostatic calculation as mentioned in section 4 2 as a result the greatest difference in the depth integrated results between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations appears in the longitudinal δ x k u and lateral s u v y transport of the momentum fig 13 compares the spatial evolution of these two terms in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations for each slope case it shows that when the slope is gentle slope 0 003 the hydrostatic calculation does not differ significantly from the nonhydrostatic results see fig 13 a as the slope increases which results in stronger variation in the horizontal directions the erroneous prediction by the hydrostatic model is more apparent this is especially significant before plunging when the plume becomes the undercurrent after plunging only little difference is found between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations in the cases of milder slopes s 0 003 and 0 005 see figs 13 a and b this is because in the fully developed undercurrent disregarding turbulent fluctuations the vertical momentum becomes insignificant and the hydrostatic model can be a relevant approximation however in the steep slope case slope 0 01 the incapability of solving the vertical momentum transport in the hydrostatic calculation results in an erroneous prediction of s u v y that does not become negative i e divergent flow after plunging as a result the horizontal diffusion due to the numerical viscosity dominates the propagation of the undercurrent in the steep slope case in this case d u x 5 m3 s 2 after plunging in the nonhydrostatic calculation see fig 10 c but 25 m3 s 2 in the hydrostatic calculation which makes the undercurrent diffusion dominant in the latter case this result is inconsistent with the cases of gentle and medium slopes in which the lateral transport s u v y dominates in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations that is in the present study although the motion of undercurrent can be captured by the hydrostatic approximation in the gentle and mild slope cases it can only be correctly predicted by the nonhydrostatic simulation when the slope is steep 6 conclusions we use the suntans model to simulate plunging hyperpycnal plumes on different shelf slopes in idealized domains the hydrodynamics model allows for both nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic calculations and the unstructured grid enables local refinement for specific need such as plunging our nonhydrostatic simulations reveal detailed three dimensional flow structures in both transient and steady states an important flow feature is the formation of the triangular ssc pattern at the surface which results in a flow convergence upon plunging and closely relates to the plume s three dimensional flow structure as the slope is steeper the triangular patter becomes shorter in the cross shore distance resulting in stronger flow convergence a series of hydrostatic simulations are also conducted to examine the importance of nonhydrostatic effect due to the consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum we show that the nonhydrostatic effect is particularly important before plunging where the plume is subject to a significant change in the vertical direction moreover the great fluctuations of the velocity field from the hydrostatic calculation result in a much higher eddy diffusivity compared with the nonhydrostatic case leading to slower sink of the plume while plunging during the transient state however once the plume becomes an undercurrent because of the weak vertical variation the small difference between the two cases confirms that the hydrostatic model can be a good approximation if the slope is not too steep moreover a grid dependence study showed that the nonhydrostatic effect i e consideration of transport of the vertical momentum can be seen only when the grid resolution is sufficiently fine that the calculation is not overly diffusive a criterion analogous to the reynolds number but using numerical diffusion is then presented we also conduct depth integration analysis of both the cross and along shore momentum components to examine the bulk effect of the shelf slope the three dimensional flow structure and the nonhydrostatic pressure we find that the flow convergence due to plunging of the plume provides strong lateral transport of the cross shore velocity component toward the central line which leads to the difference between three and two dimensional plumes the flow becomes divergent when the plume forms an undercurrent in which the lateral transport becomes an important momentum sink therefore in the two dimensional cases due to insufficient dissipation lack lateral transport the plumes maintain their energy after plunging during the simulation we also perform depth integration analysis to examine the nonhydrostatic effect in the bulk we find that the difference between the hydrostatic cases and nonhydrostatic is more significant when the slope becomes steeper and in the steep slope case neglect of transport of vertical momentum in the hydrostatic case can give an erroneous prediction of the undercurrent the present simulations show the three dimensional flow structures and nonhydrostatic effects in the field scale to our knowledge this is the first field scale nonhydrostatic simulation for plunging hyperpycnal plumes our findings have great importance regarding the field scale numerical modeling for sediment laden river plumes however we notice that the flow structures and dynamics can be much more complex in the realistic field cases such complexities include the coriolis force the presence of the marine canyon currents erodible bed

institute of mathematical science tims at national taiwan university which is also gratefully acknowledged appendix a entrainment entrainment of a density current leads to mass and momentum exchange between the current body and ambient flow which plays a key role in the dynamics of the current birman et al 2009 meiburg and kneller 2010 for the hyperpycnal plume entrainment results from different mechanisms in two different flow regimes for the undercurrent entrainment is a result of interfacial instabilities caused by velocity shear at the density interface whereas in the plunging region entrainment is caused by intensified velocity shear and ssc gradients due to the abrupt change of the current thickness accompanied by the strong vertical transport of momentum akiyama and stefan 1984 here following chen et al 2013 we use the normalized ssc ϕ ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ 0 is ssc from the river discharge as a cutoff indicator to distinguish between the undercurrent and ambient flow and introduce the cross sectional mass transport m of the undercurrent which is written as a 1 m t u d y d z t 1 if ϕ 0 3 0 if ϕ 0 3 as indicated by cv1 in fig 3 d we set the first control distance in the cross shore direction to cover the region from the river mouth to the location at which the height of the undercurrent becomes uniform and set the second control distance as indicated by cv2 in fig 3 d to cover a region of the undercurrent i e the main body the spanwise coverages of the two control boxes are set based on the cutoff indicator given by eq a 1 in the present study following legg et al 2006 entrainment is indicated by the entrainment coefficient ce defined as a 2 c e m o u t m i n u a c where subscripts out and in indicate the outflow and inflow to the control box respectively u is the mean cross shore velocity of the plume averaged over the portion of the flow where t 1 in the control volume and ac is the interfacial area between the ambient fluid and the current between the portion of the flow where t 1 and t 0 in the control volume the entrainment coefficient ce quantifies the increased plume mass due to the entrainment of the ambient fluid e g c e 0 means no net entrainment of ambient water into the plume table a 2 presents ce s in all of the slope cases the obtained ce s as a function of the bulk froude number frb in the present study are compared with the previous experimental results and empirical formulae in fig a 14 here frb is defined as chen et al 2013 a 3 f r b u g d where the overbar indicates the mean value averaged over the control volume fig a 14 shows that the entrainment strengthens when the slope is steeper as ce s at both plunging and undercurrent regions are plotted it can be seen that entrainment at the plunging region is stronger than that due to interfacial instabilities at the undercurrent akiyama and stefan 1984 moreover it can be seen from fig a 14 that present ce s at the undercurrent region are in good agreement with the previous experimental data appendix b derivation of depth integrated momentum equation the hydrostatic pressure eq 4 can be separated into barotropic and baroclinic pressures i e b 1 p z ρ 0 ρ g in the present study changes of the free surface height h are negligible so forcing is mainly due to the baroclinic pressure the baroclinic pressure head is given by b 2 r 1 ρ 0 z 0 ρ d z thus the steady

subscripts t and b indicate the top and bottom of the water column respectively in the large scale numerical simulation due to the horizontal grid size the resulting numerical diffusion cannot be ignored therefore given a prescribed constant background viscosity ν h 0 for the analysis of the numerical results it is more relevant to rewrite the horizontal diffusion term the last term on rhs of eq b 3 as b 8 d x 0 h ν h h u d z d x 0 ν h 0 ν n u m h 2 u d z where νnum is the numerical viscosity in the preset study it can be obtained from eq 16 for the first order upwind transport scheme in the present study both the stress and vertical velocity are zero at the water surface also without the coriolis force the flow is symmetric about the line y 0 such that v 0 and u y 0 therefore for the

terms in eq b 9 integrated along the x direction in the medium slope case which shows that the nonhydrostatic pressure term is relatively small and has a negligible effect on the modeled depth

the terms that relate only to the bottom quantities for the sake of simplicity we define a modified drag as b 10 f d u τ x b u b 2 d d x d x c b u b u b u b 2 d d x d x where cb is the bottom drag coefficient in the present study the water depth increases with the decreasing negative x coordinate such that b 11 d d x d x tan θ where θ is the slope angle thus neglecting q and qb and using eq b

24117,a three dimensional nonhydrostatic coastal model suntans is used to study hyperpycnal plumes on sloping continental shelves with idealized domain setup the study aims to examine the nonhydrostatic effect of the plunging hyperpycnal plume and the associated flow structures on different shelf slopes the unstructured triangular grid in suntans allows for local refinement of the grid size for regions in which the flow varies abruptly while retaining low cost computation using the coarse grid resolution for regions in which the flow is more uniform these nonhydrostatic simulations reveal detailed three dimensional flow structures in both transient and steady states via comparison with the hydrostatic simulation we show that the nonhydrostatic effect is particularly important before plunging when the plume is subject to significant changes in both the along shore and vertical directions after plunging where the plume becomes an undercurrent that is more spatially uniform little difference is found between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations in the present gentle and mild slope cases a grid dependence study shows that the nonhydrostatic effect can be seen only when the grid resolution is sufficiently fine that the calculation is not overly diffusive a depth integrated momentum budget analysis is then conducted to show that the flow convergence due to plunging is an important factor in the three dimensional flow structures moreover it shows that the nonhydrostatic effect becomes more important as the slope increases and in the steep slope case neglect of transport of the vertical momentum during plunging in the hydrostatic case further leads to an erroneous prediction for the undercurrent keywords hyperpycnal plume suntans nonhydrostatic effect plunging 1 introduction hyperpycnal plume is a type of turbidity current which is a sediment laden current that moves down a slope in water it is driven by gravity and frequently occurs in natural environments such as lakes reservoirs and estuaries van rijn 1984 chikita and okumura 1990 when the suspended concentration of sediment in a river is so great that the bulk density of the river water is greater than the density of the ambient water the hyperpycnal plume forms a flowing undercurrent driven by the difference in density between the current and the ambient fluid meiburg and kneller 2010 this typically occurs during or after storms or typhoon events when considerable suspended sediments are transported by the flood along the river and finally discharge into reservoirs or the sea mulder and syvitski 1995 hyperpycnal plumes play an important role in sediment transport in the ocean which can in turn significantly alter the underwater environment in the ocean milliman and syvitski 1992 warrick and milliman 2003 dadson et al 2005 liu et al 2013 in general hyperpycnal plumes can be divided into three parts plunging the main body and the head region kassem and imran 2001 as shown in fig 1 due to the degree of dilution the flow instability and mixing at the leading head determine the propagation distance of the underwater turbidity current within the main body the vertical profiles of the velocity and the sediment concentration are responsible for scouring and deposition on the sea floor in the plunging region where the plume begins to sink beneath the ambient fluid to become an undercurrent the strong entrainment is critical to the subsequent plume dynamics in the main body entrainment due to the interfacial shear instability between the ambient ocean fluid and the undercurrent also plays an important role in plume dynamics numerous early studies used theoretical derivations and laboratory experiments to obtain a better understanding of hyperpycnal plumes e g benjamin 1968 ellison and turner 1959 britter and linden 1980 huppert and simpson 1980 parker et al 1987 garcia 1993 altinakar et al 1996 kneller et al 1999 these studies focused on turbidity currents and provided insights into both the leading head and main body of the plume however studies of the plunging region remain relatively rare and have been limited to theoretical argument hauenstein and dracos 1984 akiyama and stefan 1984 recently owing to great advances in computational techniques and resources two or three dimensional hydrodynamic modeling has become an important approach for the study of sediment laden plumes two dimensional vertical 2dv modeling along with turbulence closure models are widely conducted to simulate the laboratory scale turbidity currents for investigating the flow structure and small scale dynamics for example choi and garcia 2002 used 2dv reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations along with a k ϵ turbulence model to investigate the mean flow structure and modeled turbulent kinetic energy of a dense undercurrent on a constant slope in their study comparison with the depth integrated model which was commonly used in earlier theoretical and computational works e g ellison and turner 1959 parker et al 1986 akiyama and stefan 1984 1985 garcia 1993 bradford and katopodes 1999a 1999b was also discussed huang et al 2005 developed a hydrodynamics model also with rans formulation and k ϵ modeling to investigate the vertical profiles of the velocity and sediment concentration of turbidity currents on a deforming bed that can be adjusted due to deposition and erosion kassem and imran 2001 presented pioneering simulation results of plunging river plumes in both laboratory and field scales using the commercial navier stokes flow solver fluent in contrast to the 2dv equations in choi and garcia 2002 both kassem and imran 2001 and huang et al 2005 adopted three dimensional 3d formulation in their flow solvers however since the models were applied for comparison with past 2dv laboratory experiments only the 2dv results were presented khan et al 2005 investigated hyperpycnal plumes interaction with the along shore current and the resulting bed forms in a field scale idealized setting the computational framework in khan et al 2005 includes a depth integrated two dimensional horizontal 2dh model hyper and a 3d flow solver fluent the 2dh model which is based on the earlier works of bradford and katopodes 1999a b is intended to capture the large scale dynamics of the undercurrent and the resulting bed forms whereas the 3d flow solver is used to provide the relevant flow parameters of plunging for 2dh model during which the strong vertical motion cannot be simulated by the 2dh model the approach that uses the 3d flow solver for plunging provides a flexible and practical alternative to adopting the results from the theoretical derivation such as akiyama and stefan 1984 for modeling field scale plunging hyperpycnal plumes however like kassem and imran 2001 perhaps owing to the considerable computational power required for field scale modeling khan et al 2005 presented only 2dv modeling of plunging in the field scale with fluent which disregards the lateral variation more recently el gawad et al 2012 applied a three dimensional flow solver to simulate turbidity currents in a submarine channel on the seafloor of the niger delta by applying the field bathymetric data the model realistically predicts the flow field and its evolution over the complex topography it shows strong lateral flow from the inner to the outer bank at the bends of the submarine channel the study demonstrates that the 3d flow solver is a useful tool for understanding the dynamics of the field scale turbidity currents and their deposition in complex environmental settings another study by chen et al 2013 also conducted 3d simulation using the regional ocean modeling system roms which solved the primitive equations under the hydrostatic assumption to investigate hyperpycnal plumes on sloping continental shelves with idealized domain settings in their study different slopes were applied to examine the transition from the depositional to the auto suspension regime of the plume their simulation results revealed the complete evolution of the plunging hyperpycnal plume discharged from the river mouth to the continental slopes however the discussion was limited to the undercurrent in fact as it disregards transport of the vertical momentum the capability of the hydrostatic model to correctly capture the plunging of the plume remains questionable and requires further assessment moreover as full 3d numerical modeling for field scale cases remains computationally challenging the hybrid predictive framework such as in khan et al 2005 may still provide a feasible and practical approach however the validity of the 2dv prediction determined by either theories or flow solvers and the three dimensionality of the plunging river plume in the field require more detailed investigation therefore the present study aims to examine the nonhydrostatic effect in field scale modeling and to reveal the 3d flow structure from nonhydrostatic simulations in this study we present the 3d simulation results of plunging hyperpycnal plumes on sloping continental shelves with an idealized domain setting similar to that in chen et al 2013 we use the 3d hydrodynamics model suntans which solves momentum and mass transport equations on the grid that are unstructured and triangular in the horizontal dimension and z level in the vertical dimension fringer et al 2006 the triangular grid enables local refinement of the resolution of interest such as plunging the model allows for both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculation in the former case it solves the primitive equations under the hydrostatic assumption like other ocean models e g roms whereas in the latter the full navier stokes equations are considered and a standard fraction step method armfield and street 2000 is used to guarantee divergence free of the velocity field via nonhydrostatic pressure in fact as discussed in section 2 the major difference between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations is consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum in the latter case whereas the former case obtains the vertical velocity only based on mass conservation the hydrostatic calculation which has been widely used in modern hydrodynamics models to solve geophysical flows is a valid approximation for problems in which the horizontal scale is much greater than the vertical scale a condition that applies to most geophysical and environmental conditions however it may not be valid when the vertical motion is significant such as with internal waves zhang et al 2011 and plunging of the river plume in this study in this study with the use of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations using suntans we first address the importance of nonhydrostatic pressure i e consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum for modeling the complete evolution of a hyperpycnal plume we discuss the dependence of the modeled nonhydrostatic effect on the grid resolution this is of critical importance regarding 3d numerical modeling of the hyperpycnal plume in the field scale cases second we aim to reveal plume s 3d flow structures and discuss the resulting bulk effects through the depth integrated analysis this can be useful when the simplified models such as 2dv and 2dh models are considered 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 nonhydrostatic modeling in the nonhydrostatic calculation we solve the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the boussinesq approximation if one splits the total pressure p into the hydrostatic pressure p and the nonhydrostatic pressure q i e p p q the governing equations are 1 u t u u 1 ρ 0 h q 1 ρ 0 h p h ν h h u z ν v u z 2 ω u 2 w t u w 1 ρ 0 q z h ν h h w z ν v w z 3 u 0 4 p z ρ g where u u v is the horizontal component of the velocity field u u v w h x y is the horizontal gradient operator ρ 0 is the constant reference fresh water density νh and νv are the summation of the turbulent and molecular viscosities in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively ω is the angular velocity vector of earth rotation ρ is the total density and g is the gravitational acceleration in the present study for the sake of clarity we neglect the coriolis force i e ω 0 in all simulations the difference between the present model equations eqs 1 and 2 for the momentum and the traditional hydrostatic primitive equations is in the consideration of the vertical momentum a simple scaling argument can be derived to show that the hydrostatic calculation can be a good approximation for most geophysical flow in which the horizontal scales are usually much larger than the vertical scales however when the vertical motion is strong such as the plunging of the hyperpycnal plume in the present study the hydrostatic assumption can make the solution deviate significantly from its nonhydrostatic counterpart which is discussed in detail in the remainder of the paper the evolution of the free surface height h is calculated using the depth averaged continuity equation 5 h t h d h u d z 0 where d is the water depth in the present study we consider the density stratification due to salinity s and suspended sediment concentration ssc ϕ in the present study ϕ has units of g l 1 and the volume fraction φ of sediment is calculated by φ ϕ ρ s where ρ s 2650 kg m 3 is the density of the sediment particle the total density ρ is thus expressed as 6 ρ ρ b ρ s ρ b φ 1 β s ρ 0 ρ s 1 β s ρ 0 φ where ρb is the background density ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the density of pure water and β 7 5 10 4 psu 1 is the expansion coefficient of salt both salinity and ssc are modeled using the mass transport equations respectively 7 s t u s h γ h h s z γ v s z 8 ϕ t u ϕ w s ϕ z h γ h h ϕ z γ v ϕ z where γh and γv are the horizontal and vertical diffusivities respectively and ws is the settling speed 2 2 numerical methods in the present study we use the unstructured grid coastal model suntans fringer et al 2006 for numerical simulation it includes both the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations and it simply solves the traditional primitive equations in the hydrostatic calculation in the nonhydrostatic calculation following the fractional step method by armfield and street 2000 it first calculates the predictive velocity field u by solving eqs 1 and 2 using the nonhydrostatic pressure at the previous time step a nonhydrostatic pressure correction qc is then obtained by solving the discretized pressure poisson equation that enforces the continuity i e 9 l q c 1 δ t u where δt is the computational time step l is the discrete laplacian operator and is the discrete divergence operator at the nth computational time step the nonhydrostatic pressure for the next step q n 1 2 is then updated with 10 q n 1 2 q n 1 2 q c and the horizontal velocity is obtained by correcting the predicted value with 11 u n 1 u δ t q c where is the discrete gradient operator the vertical velocity is then calculated from the local continuity equation eq 3 12 w n 1 z δ z w n 1 z z z δ z h u n 1 η d η with the no penetration condition w 0 at the bottom boundary 3 simulation setup following chen et al 2013 the idealized domain used in the present study consists of a straight river channel and an open ocean as shown in fig 2 the river channel is 10 km long and 1 km wide and the open ocean is 20 and 40 km in the cross and along shore directions respectively the domain configuration was originally designed for the cases when the coriolis force was taken into account therefore the channel is not centered north south relative to the ocean portion however as the coriolis force is disregarded in the present study we focus on the domain that is symmetric with respect to the line in alignment with the central line of the channel this line is defined as the central line of the domain and its along shore coordinate is set to 0 see fig 2 the channel has a constant depth of 5 m and the open ocean part has a constant slope along the cross shore direction which represents the shelf slope in the present study we use three different slopes 0 003 0 005 and 0 01 which are named gentle medium and steep slopes respectively two grid resolutions are used see fig 2 the simulation cases that use the fine grid resolution are the base cases and the coarse resolution is used only to investigate the grid dependence the number of the horizontal cells in the fine grid case is 33 928 and is 9 962 in the coarse grid case in both cases the grid resolution is refined near the river mouth and becomes coarser as the distance from the river mouth increases as a result the distance between two voronoi points ranges from 2 7 m to 600 m with a mean distance 78 m in the fine grid case and ranges from 15 9 m to 600 m with a mean distance 212 m in the coarse grid the numbers of the vertical layer are chosen such that the vertical grid resolution 0 3 m in all simulation cases table 1 summarizes the details of the domain set up in each case in addition to demonstrate the three dimensional effect two more sloping channel cases medium and steep slopes are simulated in these two cases simulations are conducted in sloping channels with a constant width 1 km which is wide enough to neglect the side wall effect at the central line where the flow can thus be treated as 2d the computations are carried out on the dell poweredge m620 supercomputer cluster using 32 processors the simulation wall clock times for one computation step in all the river ocean cases are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that in the fine grid cases the computational time for the nonhydrostatic simulation is about twice as much as the hydrostatic simulation time and this ratio slightly increases as the bottom slope increases i e more grid cells in the present cases a fresh water inflow discharge that contains suspended sediment is specified as an inflow boundary condition for the river channel in the 3d cases open boundary condition is specified for all ocean boundaries to allow for the fluid flowing out of the domain the ssc ϕ of 50 g l 1 is specified at the river and inflow discharge which is well above the threshold of ssc for which the hyperpycnal discharge occurs for a typical range of temperature and salinity according to mulder and syvitski 1995 in the ocean the salinity is set to 32 psu and ssc is initially 0 as a result the initial bulk density is 1 031 kg m 3 at the river and 1 024 kg m 3 in the ocean the inflow velocity of the river flow is set to 2 m s 1 corresponding to a strong discharge event given by the current inflow conditions at the channel chen et al 2013 argued that the hyperpycnal condition is limited to a range of the small settling speed i e w s 0 05 0 5 mm s 1 that is within this range of the settling speed the flow power is able to maintain sediment in suspension winterwerp 2001 and the baroclinic force persists therefore as the plunging is a result of a balance between the baroclinic forcing and flow inertia one can expect that under the hyperpycnal condition plumes with different ws cases behave similar before plunging but may differ from each other after plunging when the flow energy is greatly reduced in that the coarser sediments settle more rapidly thus reducing the propagation distance of the front here the settling speed ws is set to 0 1 mm s 1 corresponding to a particle of 12 µm in diameter according to stokes law and is consistent with the previous observations of sediment discharge in a hyperpycnal river e g kao et al 2008 in all simulation cases we allow for the settling of suspended sediment through the bottom boundary the settling flux through the bottom boundary is simply calculated by ϕbws in which ϕb denotes ϕ in the lowest grid cell for the sake of simplicity and clarity for demonstrating hydrodynamics sediment erosion at the bottom is deactivated which eliminates the uncertainties arising from the sophisticated empirical parameterizations for modeling erosion processes 4 results 4 1 plume dynamics and structure fig 3 a h shows a series of snapshots of ssc in the vertical transect at the central line y 0 see fig 2 and the corresponding planviews at the surface at representative time steps in the medium slope case in nonhydrostatic simulation as shown in fig 3 a at the starting stage when the sediment laden river plume enters the shelf a leading underflow forms due to sinking of the plume at the head region at this stage the surface ssc as presented in fig 3 e shows a pair of strong vortices due to baroclinic forcing the plume continues to propagate until it first reaches the plunging point as shown in fig 3 b which is a result of a balance between the flow inertia and baroclinic pressure forcing in the mean time as shown in fig 3 f a triangular pattern of ssc along with residual vortices at the plume head forms at the surface and is retained as shown in figs 3 g and h the 3d structure of the plume during the steady state can be seen from the isosurface of ssc 20 g l 1 in fig 4 the mechanism that leads to the triangular pattern of the surface ssc is due to the fact that plunging is a result of a balance between the flow inertia and baroclinic forcing hauenstein and dracos 1984 that is using the froude number fr obtained with hauenstein and dracos 1984 13 f r u p g p d p where dp is the water depth at plunging 14 u p 1 d p d p 0 u z d z and 15 g p 1 d p d p 0 g ρ z ρ 0 ρ 0 d z fr is expected to be a constant and close to an order of 1 in the plunging region as the plume leaves the channel one can expect that the streamwise velocity cross shore velocity peaks at the central line and decreases in the spanwise direction which is similar to the free turbulent jet as a result to maintain a constant fr the plunging depth dp peaks at the central line and decreases as one moves away from the central line in the along shore direction leading to the present triangular pattern in addition as demonstrated by johnson et al 1987 using a series of experiments in diverging channels the triangular pattern of ssc in the near surface region is a typical pattern when the negatively buoyant plume enters a horizontally diverging channel with a large diffuser angle as discussed in section 5 2 the triangular pattern which exhibits strong lateral variability has important influences on the plume s bulk behavior upon reaching the plunging point the undercurrent continues to propagate downslope while the near surface portion of the plume soon moves slightly toward the river mouth as shown in figs 3 b and c and then reaches its steady state as shown in fig 3 d fig 5 shows planviews of the representative ssc snapshots in the surface and near bed regions at the steady state in three different slope cases as shown in figs 5 a c the aforementioned triangular ssc pattern is a common feature at the surface in each case and has a shorter distance in the along shore direction when the slope is steeper indicating that the plume plunges earlier in each case along the perimeter of the triangular ssc interface is the plunging region at which the froude number fr is nearly a constant for each slope in the cases of slopes of 0 01 and 0 005 f r 1 2 1 4 and 1 0 1 2 respectively whereas in the case of slope of 0 003 f r 0 7 0 8 as shown in figs 5 d f once the river plume enters the continental slope the plume begins to spread in the along shore direction spreading of the plume is weaker when the bed slope is steeper i e the ssc is more concentrated at the central line which is also found in chen et al 2013 as previously mentioned an important issue in the context of density current is the entrainment at the density interface the examination of the entrainment versus the bulk froude number is given in appendix a which shows good agreement between the present simulation results and those in previous experimental studies 4 2 nonhydrostatic effect as the nonhydrostatic calculation deviates from the hydrostatic cases due to consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum the significant difference between the two cases can be found at the plunging point where the vertical motion is strongest to show this difference figs 3 i p present representative snapshots of the ssc in the hydrostatic case corresponding to each panel in figs 3 a h for the medium slope case during the transient stage comparison between figs 3 b and c and figs 3 j and k shows that near the plunging point the ssc in the nonhydrostatic case drops much more quickly than in the hydrostatic case so the backward movement of the plunging point is slower in the latter case because the modeled eddy diffusivity is significantly higher making the simulation overly diffusive at the plume ocean interface the vertical eddy diffusivity γt in the suntans model is obtained with γ t ν t σ t where νt is the eddy viscosity obtained from the turbulence model and σt is the turbulence schmidt number which is set to 1 here simpson 1982 nielsen and teakle 2004 the mellor yamada level 2 5 my2 5 mellor and yamada 2005 turbulence closure scheme is used to compute νt the my2 5 scheme solves transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy and the master length scale with the shear production as the source mellor and yamada 2005 as shown in fig 6 where we show the horizontal velocity and vertical eddy diffusivity corresponding to figs 3 d and l without considering transport of vertical momentum the horizontal velocity in the hydrostatic case exhibits unrealistic fluctuations before plunging see fig 6a the resulting stronger velocity gradient in the vertical direction u z in the hydrostatic case leads to the stronger shear production which significantly enhances the eddy diffusivity as shown in fig 6 c fluctuations of the horizontal velocity in the hydrostatic simulation are due to the undissipated vertical velocity obtained from mass conservation as shown in fig 9 a detailed discussion of which is given in section 5 1 at the surface fluctuations in the modeled velocity in the hydrostatic case lead to oscillation of the ssc front during the transient state as can be seen from the asymmetry of the ssc front in fig 3 o when the plume reaches the steady state comparison of figs 3 d and l does not show a strong difference in ssc between the two cases except that the plunging point predicted by the hydrostatic model is about 200 m further seaward than that predicted by the nonhydrostatic model a notable feature in the hydrostatic calculation is the fluctuation of the ssc before plunging as can be seen from the spatially fluctuated contour lines of ssc 50 g l 1 in figs 3 i l in the hydrostatic case the vertical velocity is calculated only on the basis of mass conservation which cannot be properly damped while the vertical momentum is disregarded this in turn leads to fluctuations in the modeled horizontal velocity and ssc as shown in fig 3 d and l when the plume becomes an undercurrent after plunging the results of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic calculations are similar due to the dominance of the horizontal motion during the propagation of the undercurrent as the vertical motion becomes minor also the front is another flow region where the vertical velocity is significant and the nonhydrostatic effect can be important the vertical velocity at the front region is due to mass conservation of a relatively uniform flow and its dissipation in the model depends on the resolvability of the bottom boundary layer however because after plunging the plume is relatively thin i e vertical scale horizontal scale 1 and in typical circulation models the under resolved boundary layer flow can only be modeled using boundary layer parameters such as the drag law used here fringer et al 2006 as a result hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations give nearly identical flow features at the front and the nonhydrostatic effect cannot be shown at the front in the latter case 5 discussion 5 1 resolution dependence for numerical modeling it is critical to know the dependence of the modeled nonhydrostatic effect on the grid resolution as mentioned in section 2 nonhydrostatic modeling indicates consideration of the vertical momentum transport without proper diffusion and advection the vertical velocity that is solely based on continuity in the hydrostatic model may strongly fluctuate resulting in an unrealistic flow field a typical example was demonstrated in fringer et al 2006 using the laboratory scale lock exchange flow however such unrealistic velocity fluctuation may not be seen in most field scale hydrostatic modeling results because the horizontal diffusion is so strong that the fluctuations can be smeared as a result no significant fluctuation in the velocity field is found in the overly diffusive calculation and the nonhydrostatic simulation may differ negligibly from hydrostatic results however the dominance of the diffusion in the hydrostatic calculation can easily lead to an erroneous prediction and the simulation result will not converge with the refining grid resolution a similar issue was addressed by vitousek and fringer 2011 for the simulation of internal solitary waves the study showed that given a minimum horizontal length scale ls that needs to be resolved by the model due to numerical dispersion the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models converged when δx ls was large but only the nonhydrostatic model converged to the analytical solution when δx ls became small that is the modeled nonhydrostatic effect i e the calculation of vertical momentum transport emerges only when the grid size is sufficiently small that the model resolves the smallest scale this smallest scale ls depends on both the flow condition and the model i e the grid configuration in fig 7 we show the ssc and the cross shore velocity component at the steady state in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic cases using coarse resolution along with the fine resolution nonhydrostatic case for comparison unlike the fine resolution case the coarse resolution case shows almost no difference in both the ssc and cross shore velocity between the two cases this is due to the excessive numerical diffusion in the horizontal momentum equation which smears the horizontal velocity gradient and makes the vertical velocity based on continuity relatively weak and the nonhydrostatic effect unimportant the numerical diffusion arises from the truncation error associated with discretization in all of the numerical schemes moin 2001 for example in the present study we use a first order upwind scheme for the calculation of the nonlinear advection term the numerical viscosity νnum of which is given by 16 ν n u m δ h 2 2 δ t c f l 1 c f l where δh is the horizontal grid size i e the distance between the voronoi points for unstructured grids δt is the computational time step and c f l u c δ t δ h fig 8 presents the numerical viscosity calculated using eq 16 in both the coarse and fine grid cases in the medium slope case during the steady state it can be seen that νnum ranges from 15 to 30 m2 s 1 in the coarse grid case and from 0 to 10 m2 s 1 in the fine grid case to justify this and to obtain a criterion for which the nonhydrostatic effect can be important we invoke a advection diffusion length scale lad defined as 17 l a d ν n u m u c where νnum is the numerical viscosity and uc is the characteristic velocity in the horizontal direction the scale lad represents a length scale for which the advection and numerical diffusion are of the same order of magnitude which should be made as small as possible in the numerical model the next step is to find the length scale ls such that if the ratio ls lad is sufficiently large i e 1 the numerical diffusion is so small that the variation of the resolved horizontal velocity is not smeared appreciably in the present simulation the highest fluctuation in the vertical velocity in the hydrostatic solution is found on the slope before plunging see fig 9 where the plume is subject to significant changes in both the vertical and spanwise directions as shown in fig 9 in the hydrostatic calculation fluctuations can be much reduced by numerical diffusion as the grid size increases to a certain level see fig 9 c in this case the nonhydrostatic effect becomes insignificant and the nonhydrostatic pressure makes almost no difference from the hydrostatic results as shown in fig 9 d fluctuations in the vertical velocity can become stronger when the grid size is refined see fig 9 a due to the lack of proper dissipation for the vertical momentum and it can only be fixed by the consideration of the nonhydrostatic pressure as the fluctuation is dominated by the grid discretization one can obtain a relevant horizontal length scale l s from discretized continuity given by 18 δ w δ z l s δ u c where δ indicates the variation of the associated physical quantity δz is the vertical grid size and l s is either the problem or model specified length scale as relevant scaling for δw on the slope before plunging is δw slope δuc the scale for l s can be obtained with 19 l s δ z slope in other words l s is the shortest horizontal length of the stair step at the sloping bottom topography in the model which gives the horizontal length scale of the fluctuation of the vertical velocity when the grid resolution is sufficiently fine such that the numerical diffusion is not dominant in the solutions of the momentum due to continuity l s becomes the length scale of the variation in uc see eq 18 hence the ratio between the fluctuation scale l s and the diffusion length scale lad provides a measure of the extent to which the discretization induced velocity fluctuation can be smeared here from eqs 17 and 19 the ratio is given in analogy with the reynolds number as 20 r e l l s l a d u c l s ν n u m u c δ z slope ν n u m which is a model parameter to indicate the extent to which the fluctuation of the continuity based vertical velocity in the hydrostatic simulation are smeared by the numerical diffusion if rel is large i e 1 fluctuations of the vertical velocity in the hydrostatic case cannot be sufficiently smeared by the numerical diffusion and only in this case the simulation can reveal the nonhydrostatic effect moreover substitution of eq 16 into 20 and replacing the first cfl with its definition c f l u c δ t δ h gives 21 r e l 2 δ z slope δ h 1 c f l now using eq 21 and requiring that rel 1 one can obtain the resolution requirement for which the nonhydrostatic pressure is important for the present case i e 22 δ h 2 δ z slope 1 c f l in the present study δz 0 3 m is used in each simulation case which gives l s 60 m for the medium slope slope 0 005 as uc 1 m s 1 in the region before plunging one can obtain that in most of the region before plunging rel ranges from 2 to 4 in the coarse grid case and much greater rel o 10 in the fine grid case as a result the modeled nonhydrostatic vertical momentum transport is effective only in the fine grid case it should be noted that the last identity in eq 20 is derived specifically for the flow over the bottom topography and eq 22 is derived based on numerical schemes in suntans for different flow conditions or numerical methods it needs to be rederived based on the first identity of eq 20 in fact any flow phenomenon in nature can span a wide range of spatial scales such as turbulence and buoyancy length scales i e different ls s associated with each length scale is the significant momentum variations once the grid resolution is sufficiently fine to resolve one of these scales i e ls lad 1 regardless of the eddy viscosity the results in the hydrostatic case can show unrealistically strong velocity fluctuations due to undissipated vertical momentum in this case the nonhydrostatic effect becomes important one example for which ls is the scale of the kelvin helmholtz billows in the lock exchange flow can be found in fringer et al 2006 in additional to these length scales in the hydrostatic numerical model the stair step feature of the bottom grid introduces an additional length scale in the present study as one refining the grid resolution this length scale appears to be the first scale for which the velocities in the hydrostatic case fluctuate significantly and deviate from the nonhydrostatic results that is l s is the coarsest length scale level that gives the first resolution criterion for which the nonhydrostatic effect is important 5 2 depth integrated momentum budget analysis due to the large horizontal scale relative to the vertical scale studies of geophysical flows often apply two dimensional flow models based on the depth averaged equations of motion therefore in this section analysis of the depth integrated momentum budget is conducted to examine the bulk contribution of the bed slope the nonhydrostatic effect and the three dimensional flow structures 5 2 1 slope effect according to the derivation in appendix b the depth integrated momentum equation along the central line can be written as 23 δ x k u x δ x p x p b θ f d u s u v y d u x at y 0 where p b θ is the along slope component of the gravitational force f d u is the modified drag at the sloping bottom s u v y represents the lateral transport of the horizontal momentum d u x represents the horizontal diffusion and δ x k u x and δ x p x represent the cross shore variations of the depth integrated horizontal momentum and the baroclinic pressure potential respectively the mathematical expressions of all the terms in eq 23 are given by eqs b 13 b 18 in eq 23 the bed slope tan θ directly affects the plume dynamics via two forcing factors the first p b θ is the along slope component of the gravitational force which is also called the gravity potential it is zero when there is no slope and is dominant when the undercurrent becomes fully developed i e δ x 0 the second f d u is due to the slope modified bottom drag f d u c b u b u b tan θ u b see eq b 16 in which the subscript b indicates the bottom fig 10 shows the spatial evolutions along the central line y 0 of all the terms in eq 23 in each slope case it can be seen that flows can be simply divided into two distinct regions separated by the plunging point upon entering the shelf slope from the channel the current begins to lose momentum due to the increase of the current depth so that δ x k u initially decreases with the distance from the river mouth when the slope becomes steeper s u v y increases due to the lateral transport as mentioned in section 4 1 plunging results in a triangular pattern of the ssc contour at the surface as shown in fig 4 the triangular pattern is retained in the water column until the plume becomes an undercurrent the convergence of the horizontal flow toward the central line results in the lateral transport of both mass and momentum toward the central line this can be clearly seen in fig 11 f which presents the vertical transect in the along shore direction of the along shore velocity component in the steep slope case it shows the significant flow convergence within the plume before plunging and divergence after plunging as shown in fig 10 when the slope becomes steeper the plume plunges closer to the river mouth leading to a faster flow convergence and stronger lateral transport of momentum toward the central line before plunging while the pressure potential p is in balance with the gravity potential p b θ fig 10 indicates that the lateral transport s u v y and the modified bottom drag f d u are the two major forcing terms that dominate the propagation of the plume as shown in fig 10 upon plunging s u v y drops and then becomes negative in all slope cases which indicates that the plume becomes horizontally divergent as it becomes the undercurrent as also demonstrated in figs 11 j through l after plunging the gravity potential p b θ is the dominant potential forcing for the undercurrent at this stage fig 10 shows that p b θ is in balance with the bottom drag f d u and lateral spreading s u v y the present simulation results indicate the importance of lateral momentum transport due to spanwise spreading when the plume becomes the undercurrent the comparison for each slope case in fig 10 indicates that the contribution of the lateral transport to the momentum balance in the undercurrent is increasingly important when the slope becomes steeper the depth integration analysis for the evolution of the along shore momentum is also conducted based on eq b 19 derived in appendix b the depth integrated equation for the analysis is expressed as 24 δ y k v y δ y p y f d v s u v x d v h where f d v is the modified drag at the sloping bottom s u v x represents the lateral transport d v h is the horizontal diffusion and δ y k v y and δ y p y represent the along shore variations of the depth integrated horizontal momentum and the baroclinic pressure potential respectively the mathematical expressions of all terms in eq 24 are given by eqs b 20 b 24 a notable difference between the cross shore eq 23 and along shore momentum transport eq 24 equations is the absence of the gravity potential in the latter fig 11 presents the spatial evolution of all the terms in eq 24 at representative vertical transects in the along shore direction along with the corresponding horizontal velocities and ssc distributions in each slope case in fig 11 the locations the cross shore coordinates of the transects in each case are chosen so that depths are all the same it can be seen from figs 11 a through c that in each slope case there is no significant transport of the along shore momentum before plunging i e along shore distance 0 25 km the apparent along shore momentum component emerges once the plume plunges and becomes an undercurrent which propagates in the along shore direction however the relatively small v makes δ y k v negligible compared with the other dominant terms unlike the cross shore momentum transport in which the plume has an initial momentum input and the bed slope consistently acts as a momentum source the baroclinic pressure potential p is the only forcing that drives the lateral spreading of the undercurrent which is almost in balance with the cross transport component s u v x due to stronger convergence in u the plume on the steeper slope is associated with less lateral along shore spreading of ssc and less δ y k v in conjunction with the stronger gravity potential acting along the cross shore direction on the steeper slope the lateral spreading of the undercurrent is weaker when the slope becomes steeper as indicated by less δ y k v and more concentrated ssc toward the center in the steeper slope case in fig 11 5 2 2 three dimensional effect to highlight the 3d effect we show the difference between the two dimensional 2d and 3d plumes by conducting two additional 2d nonhydrostatic simulations for the medium and steep slope cases details of the simulation set up are described in section 3 and summarized in table 1 unlike that in the 3d cases the undercurrent in the 2d cases can hit the seaward boundary due to the insufficient dissipation therefore the runs stop once the undercurrent is close to the outflow boundary which is the time when the plunging point has been retained in its steady state as shown in fig 12 which presents the results of the depth integrated momentum analysis for the cross shore component in the 2d cases without lateral momentum transport in the 2d cases before plunging the cross shore momentum component δ x k u decays after entering the shelf slope upon plunging δ x k u reaches its minimum and then increases with the distance from the river mouth when it becomes an undercurrent an important difference between the 2d and 3d cases is the down slope acceleration of the plume after plunging in the former case in the absence of the lateral momentum transport i e spreading the drag and diffusion are insufficient to balance the gravitational forcing caused by the bed slope the three dimensionality of the plume can also alter the location of plunging typically the lateral spreading of the plume makes the cross shore momentum decay much faster in the 3d case than it does in the 2d case which makes the plume plunge earlier in the former case i e closer to the river mouth this can be confirmed by comparing figs 10 b and fig 12 a for the medium slope cases comparison of the 2d fig 12 and 3d fig 10 plumes also shows the significant deviation in the evolution of the cross shore momentum between the two cases due to the lateral transport of momentum s u v y as the lateral transport becomes a momentum sink after plunging without s u v y the 2d undercurrent is much more energetic than the 3d undercurrent which implies a similar condition for underwater turbidity currents in marine canyons 5 2 3 hydrostatic vs nonhydrostatic simulation the difference between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulation cases is also examined from the depth integrated results as it ignores the vertical momentum transport the flow motion before plunging cannot be properly calculated by the hydrostatic calculation as mentioned in section 4 2 as a result the greatest difference in the depth integrated results between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations appears in the longitudinal δ x k u and lateral s u v y transport of the momentum fig 13 compares the spatial evolution of these two terms in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations for each slope case it shows that when the slope is gentle slope 0 003 the hydrostatic calculation does not differ significantly from the nonhydrostatic results see fig 13 a as the slope increases which results in stronger variation in the horizontal directions the erroneous prediction by the hydrostatic model is more apparent this is especially significant before plunging when the plume becomes the undercurrent after plunging only little difference is found between the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations in the cases of milder slopes s 0 003 and 0 005 see figs 13 a and b this is because in the fully developed undercurrent disregarding turbulent fluctuations the vertical momentum becomes insignificant and the hydrostatic model can be a relevant approximation however in the steep slope case slope 0 01 the incapability of solving the vertical momentum transport in the hydrostatic calculation results in an erroneous prediction of s u v y that does not become negative i e divergent flow after plunging as a result the horizontal diffusion due to the numerical viscosity dominates the propagation of the undercurrent in the steep slope case in this case d u x 5 m3 s 2 after plunging in the nonhydrostatic calculation see fig 10 c but 25 m3 s 2 in the hydrostatic calculation which makes the undercurrent diffusion dominant in the latter case this result is inconsistent with the cases of gentle and medium slopes in which the lateral transport s u v y dominates in both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic simulations that is in the present study although the motion of undercurrent can be captured by the hydrostatic approximation in the gentle and mild slope cases it can only be correctly predicted by the nonhydrostatic simulation when the slope is steep 6 conclusions we use the suntans model to simulate plunging hyperpycnal plumes on different shelf slopes in idealized domains the hydrodynamics model allows for both nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic calculations and the unstructured grid enables local refinement for specific need such as plunging our nonhydrostatic simulations reveal detailed three dimensional flow structures in both transient and steady states an important flow feature is the formation of the triangular ssc pattern at the surface which results in a flow convergence upon plunging and closely relates to the plume s three dimensional flow structure as the slope is steeper the triangular patter becomes shorter in the cross shore distance resulting in stronger flow convergence a series of hydrostatic simulations are also conducted to examine the importance of nonhydrostatic effect due to the consideration of the transport of the vertical momentum we show that the nonhydrostatic effect is particularly important before plunging where the plume is subject to a significant change in the vertical direction moreover the great fluctuations of the velocity field from the hydrostatic calculation result in a much higher eddy diffusivity compared with the nonhydrostatic case leading to slower sink of the plume while plunging during the transient state however once the plume becomes an undercurrent because of the weak vertical variation the small difference between the two cases confirms that the hydrostatic model can be a good approximation if the slope is not too steep moreover a grid dependence study showed that the nonhydrostatic effect i e consideration of transport of the vertical momentum can be seen only when the grid resolution is sufficiently fine that the calculation is not overly diffusive a criterion analogous to the reynolds number but using numerical diffusion is then presented we also conduct depth integration analysis of both the cross and along shore momentum components to examine the bulk effect of the shelf slope the three dimensional flow structure and the nonhydrostatic pressure we find that the flow convergence due to plunging of the plume provides strong lateral transport of the cross shore velocity component toward the central line which leads to the difference between three and two dimensional plumes the flow becomes divergent when the plume forms an undercurrent in which the lateral transport becomes an important momentum sink therefore in the two dimensional cases due to insufficient dissipation lack lateral transport the plumes maintain their energy after plunging during the simulation we also perform depth integration analysis to examine the nonhydrostatic effect in the bulk we find that the difference between the hydrostatic cases and nonhydrostatic is more significant when the slope becomes steeper and in the steep slope case neglect of transport of vertical momentum in the hydrostatic case can give an erroneous prediction of the undercurrent the present simulations show the three dimensional flow structures and nonhydrostatic effects in the field scale to our knowledge this is the first field scale nonhydrostatic simulation for plunging hyperpycnal plumes our findings have great importance regarding the field scale numerical modeling for sediment laden river plumes however we notice that the flow structures and dynamics can be much more complex in the realistic field cases such complexities include the coriolis force the presence of the marine canyon currents erodible bed

between the current body and ambient flow which plays a key role in the dynamics of the current birman et al 2009 meiburg and kneller 2010 for the hyperpycnal plume entrainment results from different mechanisms in two different flow regimes for the undercurrent entrainment is a result of interfacial instabilities caused by velocity shear at the density interface whereas in the plunging region entrainment is caused by intensified velocity shear and ssc gradients due to the abrupt change of the current thickness accompanied by the strong vertical transport of momentum akiyama and stefan 1984 here following chen et al 2013 we use the normalized ssc ϕ ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ 0 is ssc from the river discharge as a cutoff indicator to distinguish between the undercurrent and ambient flow and introduce the cross sectional mass transport m of the undercurrent which is written as a 1 m t u d y d z t 1 if ϕ 0 3 0 if ϕ 0 3 as indicated by cv1 in fig 3 d we set the first control distance in the cross shore direction to cover the region from the river mouth to the location at which the height of the undercurrent becomes uniform and set the second control distance as indicated by cv2 in fig 3 d to cover a region of the undercurrent i e the main body the spanwise coverages of the two control boxes are set based on the cutoff indicator given by eq a 1 in the present study following legg et al 2006 entrainment is indicated by the entrainment coefficient ce defined as a 2 c e m o u t m i n u a c where subscripts out and in indicate the outflow and inflow to the control box respectively u is the mean cross shore velocity of the plume averaged over the portion of the flow where t 1 in the control volume and ac is the interfacial area between the ambient fluid and the current between the portion of the flow where t 1 and t 0 in the control volume the entrainment coefficient ce quantifies the increased plume mass due to the entrainment of the ambient fluid e g c e 0 means no net entrainment of ambient water into the plume table a 2 presents ce s in all of the slope cases the obtained ce s as a function of the bulk froude number frb in the present study are compared with the previous experimental results and empirical formulae in fig a 14 here frb is defined as chen et al 2013 a 3 f r b u g d where the overbar indicates the mean value averaged over the control volume fig a 14 shows that the entrainment strengthens when the slope is steeper as ce s at both plunging and undercurrent regions are plotted it can be seen that entrainment at the plunging region is stronger than that due to interfacial instabilities at the undercurrent akiyama and stefan 1984 moreover it can be seen from fig a 14 that present ce s at the undercurrent region are in good agreement with the previous experimental data appendix b derivation of depth integrated momentum equation the hydrostatic pressure eq 4 can be separated into barotropic and baroclinic pressures i e b 1 p z ρ 0 ρ g in the present study changes of the free surface height h are negligible so forcing is mainly due to the baroclinic pressure the baroclinic pressure head is given by b 2 r 1 ρ 0 z 0 ρ d z thus the steady

subscripts t and b indicate the top and bottom of the water column respectively in the large scale numerical simulation due to the horizontal grid size the resulting numerical diffusion cannot be ignored therefore given a prescribed constant background viscosity ν h 0 for the analysis of the numerical results it is more relevant to rewrite the horizontal diffusion term the last term on rhs of eq b 3 as b 8 d x 0 h ν h h u d z d x 0 ν h 0 ν n u m h 2 u d z where νnum is the numerical viscosity in the preset study it can be obtained from eq 16 for the first order upwind transport scheme in the present study both the stress and vertical velocity are zero at the water surface also without the coriolis force the flow is symmetric about the line y 0 such that v 0 and u y 0 therefore for the

terms in eq b 9 integrated along the x direction in the medium slope case which shows that the nonhydrostatic pressure term is relatively small and has a negligible effect on the modeled depth integrated momentum therefore we neglect the terms involving the nonhydrostatic pressure second and fourth terms in eq b 9 in the depth integration analysis in rhs of eq b 9 the parentheses encompass the terms that relate only to the bottom quantities for the sake of simplicity we define a modified drag as b 10 f d u τ x b u b 2 d d x d x c b u b u b u b 2 d d x d x where cb is the bottom drag coefficient in the present study the water depth increases with the decreasing negative x coordinate such that b 11 d d x d x tan θ where θ is the slope angle thus neglecting q and qb and using eq b

24118,a multiple scale perturbation approach is implemented to solve the navier stokes equations while including bottom boundary layer effects under a single wave and under two interacting waves in this approach fluid velocities and the pressure field are decomposed into two components a potential component and a rotational component in this study the two components are exist throughout the entire water column and each is scaled with appropriate length and time scales a one way coupling between the two components is implemented the potential component is assumed to be known analytically or numerically a prior and the rotational component is forced by the potential component through order of magnitude analysis it is found that the leading order coupling between the two components occurs through the vertical convective acceleration it is shown that this coupling plays an important role in the bottom boundary layer behavior its effect on the results is discussed for different wave forcing conditions purely harmonic forcing and impurely harmonic forcing the approach is then applied to derive the governing equations for the bottom boundary layer developed under two interacting wave motions both motions the shorter and the longer wave are decomposed into two components potential and rotational as it is done in the single wave test cases are presented wherein two different wave forcings are simulated 1 two periodic oscillatory motions and 2 short waves interacting with a solitary wave the analysis of the two periodic motions indicates that nonlinear effects in the rotational solution may be significant even though nonlinear effects are negligible in the potential forcing the local differences in the rotational velocity due to the nonlinear vertical convection coupling term are found to be on the order of 30 of the maximum boundary layer velocity for the cases simulated in this paper this difference is expected to increase with the increase in wave nonlinearity keywords multiple scale perturbation two oscillatory motions swell solitary motions σ coordinate bottom boundary layer 1 introduction oscillatory bottom boundary layers have been extensively studied in the literature through experiments and numerical models experiments are often performed using an oscillating water tunnel for laminar and turbulent boundary layers riedel et al 1972 kamphuis 1975 jonsson and carlsen 1976 sleath 1987 jensen et al 1989 however the oscillating tunnel does not represent the flow under dispersive wave conditions where vertical velocity could play an important role in the vicinity of the bed other experiments are performed in wave flumes such as van doorn 1981 and mirfenderesk and young 2003 numerical models have been developed to include the bottom boundary layer effects under wave propagation using different approaches one approach is through incorporating extra terms into the governing equations for example liu and orfila 2004 and liu 2006 account for boundary layer effects by including a convolution integral in the depth integrated continuity equation and solving boussinesq type wave equations for laminar and turbulent boundary layer flows other approaches tend to solve two sets of models one set for the flow kinematics inside the boundary layer and another for the flow kinematics outside the boundary layer this approach suffers from the need to assume a boundary layer thickness before solving the problem for example lee and cheung 1999 obtain flow kinematics by solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations inside the viscous flow region and the laplace equation outside the viscous flow region while implementing fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions gilbert et al 2007 couple a numerical wave tank nwt potential flow solver with a large eddy simulation solver and study the sediment transport over partially buried obstacles harris and grilli 2012 state due to the limitation on the grid size used in the large eddy simulation model this type of coupling is efficient when simulating simple cases harris and grilli 2012 couple an extended version of the zang et al 1994 model of the large eddy simulation solver with a nwt and simulate velocity fields under any arbitrary finite amplitude wave motion other researchers have used direct numerical simulation dns of the three dimensional navier stokes equations this approach provides more accurate solutions but is numerically expensive for instance lin and zhang 2008 simulate laminar bottom boundary layers generated under various wave motions including sinusoidal stokes cnoidal and solitary waves vittori and blondeaux 2008 similarly use direct numerical simulation to predict turbulent bottom boundary layers generated under solitary waves many of these solutions and models are either too sophisticated to implement or numerically very demanding for large complex problems the shallow water wave models that have been used extensively in the literature are considered to be good practical approximations to nonlinear wave hydrodynamics and coastal processes in the near shore zone however these models lack an accurate way to include boundary layer effects and thus bottom shear stresses kim et al 2009 derive depth integrated boussinesq type wave equations from navier stokes ns equations and includes bottom induced turbulence they retain integrated horizontal and vertical vorticity terms however the vertical profile of the shear stress has to be assumed a priori we aim to develop a practical yet accurate approach including bottom boundary layer effects for complex near shore environments with multiple wave components the approach followed here in this study differs from the existing boundary layer theories in the order of the decomposition of the flow and the scaling in this study the decomposition of the flow is done before the scaling contrary to other theories where decomposition of the flow is done after the scaling i e liu and orfila 2004 and liu 2006 also there has been insufficient research on bottom boundary layers generated under interacting oscillatory motions although this interaction commonly exists in near shore zones therefore a multiple scale approach to include bottom boundary layer effects under two wave motions is investigated in this study each wave motion is decomposed into a potential component and a rotational component where each component is distinctly scaled the derived governing equations including bottom boundary layer effects under single wave motion are presented in section 2 along with the development of the one dimensional numerical model with σ coordinate transformation section 3 covers the model validation and comparison to available experimental and numerical data section 4 outlines the derivation of the governing equations for two wave motions and the corresponding model results the main conclusions and future recommendations are stated in section 5 2 model derivation and governing equations for single oscillatory motion the first step in deriving our equation set is to decompose the wave motion into two components potential and rotational the basis for this decomposition and eventual scaling is that the potential irrotational component exists everywhere throughout the water column whereas the rotational motion exists strongly near the bottom and decreases with increasing distance from the bottom in the absence of wind stresses this decomposition is used to scale the vertical coordinate for each component in addition the time scale for each component could be different depending on the characteristics of the problem therefore the multiple scale perturbation approach is used to derive the governing equations in this analysis two time scales are presented a convective time scale that is used to scale the potential component and viscous time scale that is used to scale the rotational component consequently the horizontal velocity the vertical velocity and the pressure for the two components are scaled differently as will be shown later in the paper one of the advantages of this decomposition is that it results in a numerically simpler set of equations for the rotational component while maintaining the interaction between the two components rotational and potential of the wave motion the allowance of the rotational component to exist throughout the water column enables us to apply boundary conditions only at the bottom and water surface thus there is no need to assume that the boundary layer thickness extends to infinity or diminishes at some ad hoc depth this approach overcomes the need to use different models for the flow kinematics inside and for outside of the boundary layer also viscous effects are allowed to have the same order of magnitude as the dispersion effects contrary to some previous models in which viscous effects are assumed to be weaker than dispersion and nonlinear effects liu and orfila 2004 liu 2006 orfila et al 2007 2 1 dimensionless governing equations in this section the propagation of an oscillatory wave train in a constant water depth h surface elevation η x y t frequency ω and wave amplitude a is considered the wave motion is decomposed into two components where the superscript p denotes the potential component and r denotes the rotational component this decomposition is done before scaling the physical quantities unlike other approaches where wave motion is decomposed after scaling the decomposition are given as 1 u u p u r w w p w r p p p p r where the prime denotes dimensional variables substituting the previous decomposition into the governing equations gives the continuity equation and the momentum equations in the x and z directions respectively are 2 u p x u r x w p z p w r z r 0 3 u p t p u r t r u p u p x u p u r x u r u p x u r u r x w p u p z p w p u r z r w r u p z p w r u r z r 1 ρ p p x 1 ρ p r x ν

w r x r 2 ν 2 w p z p 2 ν 2 w r z r 2 the governing equations are non dimensionalized by choosing the appropriate length scale and time scale for each of the two components shallow water wave scaling is presumed for the potential component the wavelength l is used for the horizontal length scale the water depth h is used for the vertical length scale and l g h is used for the time scale for the rotational component the wavelength l is used for the horizontal length scale as with the potential component the parameter δ is defined as δ δ h where δ is the dimensional boundary layer thickness the magnitude of δ goes from near zero in the very smooth bottom limit to 1 in the limit when the boundary layer occupies the whole water column i e for long waves or currents over rough bottoms other researchers have incorporated this parameter δ in their scaling for example vittori and blondeaux 2008 and blondeaux and vittori 2012 use the boundary layer thickness defined as 2 ν h g h as a viscous length scale to scale the horizontal and vertical dimensions inside the bottom boundary layer the horizontal rotational velocity is scaled by the friction velocity u as usually done in boundary layer flows in this study the friction velocity is represented by the bottom velocity ub multiplied by a parameter the parameter is β 1 for the horizontal rotational velocity and β 2 for the vertical rotational velocity the order of magnitude of these two parameters will be discussed the rotational pressure is considered to be a dynamic pressure and hence connected to the velocity scaling it is scaled by the square of the velocity and hence the parameter is β 1 2 the time scale for the rotational component is taken to be the viscous time this time scale is defined as length scale divided by viscosity δ h 2 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity in the case of the laminar boundary layer and the eddy viscosity in the case of turbulent boundary layer as it is mentioned before the flow is decomposed into potential component and rotational component where the rotational component is driven by the potential component however the potential forcing has a convective time scale that differs from the time scale for rotational component which is taken to be the viscous time scale in this study the behavior of the rotational component is very much related to the viscosity and thus the use of the viscosity in the time scale meant to represent the diffusion viscous time scale lastly the pressure is scaled by the density multiplied by the wave amplitude and gravity for both the potential and the rotational components 2 2 derivation of the governing equations the propagation of two dimensional waves are considered where the x axis is taken to be in the direction of wave propagation and

order of magnitude for the small parameters β 1 and β 2 the leading order solution for the rotational component will depend on the order of magnitude of parameters β 1 andβ 2 the order of magnitude for the parameter β 2 can be estimated by looking at the continuity eq 13 for the two dimensional problem the two gradient terms must balance such that o β 2 o δ μ β 1 hence the two parameters are related the order of magnitude for the parameter β 1 can be estimated the velocity scale β 1 ɛ g h approximates the friction velocity u which it is usually represented as a function of the maximum bottom shear stress and or the maximum bottom particle velocity for example friction velocity can be given as u 2 τ b m a x ρ 1 2 f w u b 2 where fw is the friction factor τbmax is the maximum bottom shear stress and ub is the maximum bottom particle velocity in this paper the friction velocity is represented as a function of the maximum bottom particle velocity ub multiplied by the parameter β 1 where u β 1 u b applying the previous relations and with simple manipulations the order of magnitude of the parameter β 1 is found to be proportional to the square root of the friction factor fw therefore the order of magnitude for β 1 will depend on the characteristics of the problem under investigation the friction factor is often assumed to be a function of the reynolds number and the bottom surface characteristics smooth or rough e g cox et al 1996 for laminar bottom boundary layers there are various methods to calculate the friction factor for example nielsen 1992 uses the maximum bottom shear stress defined as τ b m a x ρ ν ω u b to obtain friction factor defined as f w 2 ρ ω u b mirfenderesk and young 2003 represents the friction factor as a function of the reynolds number f w 2 r e where the reynolds number is calculated as r e a b u b ν with ab is the maximum particle excursion at the bottom here the definition for the friction factor will be used mirfenderesk and young 2003 therefore a typical value for the parameter β 1 in a laminar boundary layer would be in the range of o 0 01 0 1 in turbulent boundary layer the above analysis will need further investigation 3 numerical model and results a one dimensional numerical model is developed to solve the governing equations for the rotational component this numerical model will be called the viscous sigma model in this paper the σ coordinate transformation is applied in the vertical direction to ensure fine resolution near the bottom to properly resolve the boundary layer the following transformation is implemented 16 σ z h h η 1 n where n is a free power used to adjust the resolution of the numerical grid we used a value of n 2 as this provided acceptable resolution near the bottom yielding numerical convergent results before applying the viscous sigma model the leading order solution for the rotational component is found this step requires an estimate of the relative order of magnitude of the parameter β 1 and the other small parameters μ δ and ϵ from the x momentum eq 14 the local acceleration term and the diffusion term are of the same order of magnitude it is also noticed that the coupling term w o p u o r z with the coefficient ɛ δ could have a comparable order of magnitude to both the local acceleration and the diffusion terms when o δ has the same order of magnitude as ϵ the other terms in the x momentum eq 14 have a higher order of magnitude and thus will be neglected in this study in this study the coupling term w o p u o r z is examined to quantify its effect on the bottom boundary layer behavior under various wave forcing types including purely harmonic forcing i e oscillatory waves and transient forcing i e solitary waves numerical calculations of the boundary layer are performed by specifying the potential component as an input to the viscous sigma model the numerical simulation is run twice for each forcing type in the first simulation the horizontal momentum equation is solved without the coupling term w o p u o r z the horizontal rotational velocity is obtained via solving the x momentum eq 18 and it will be called the linear model solution in the second simulation the coupling term is retained the horizontal rotational velocity is obtained via solving the x momentum eq 19 and it will be called the nonlinear model solution the two solutions will be plotted against experimental data to investigate the effect of this coupling term the dimensional continuity the x momentum governing equations and the boundary conditions for the rotational motion are 17 u r x w r z r 0 18 u r t r 2 u r z r 2 19 u r t r w p u r z r 2 u r z r 2 the no slip boundary condition at the bottom and zero shear stress is assumed at the water surface 20 u r u p at z h 21 u r z r 0 at z 0 it is clear that the developed scaling in this study produces a simple solution for obtaining the rotational velocity component where only the vertical and time dimensions are required to solve the equations the needed quantities to solve the above equations are the horizontal potential velocity at the bottom along with the vertical profile of the vertical potential velocity 3 1 oscillatory wave the first set of simulations examines the boundary layer generated under oscillatory wave motion linear wave theory is used to provide the potential component in this case the model results are compared to the experimental data of mirfenderesk and young 2003 for case s1 and the linear analytical solution by lamb 1932 the lamb 1932 solution for the total horizontal velocity is given as 22 u u m cos k x ω t exp β z cos k x ω t β z where um is the maximum horizontal velocity near the bottom k is the wave number β ω 2 ν is the boundary layer parameter and z is the distance from the bottom the single harmonic wave characteristics used in the experiment are wave height of 0 12 m wave period of 2 s wavelength of 4 21 m and a constant water depth of 0 55 m the values of μ and ϵ are 0 13 and 0 11 respectively the mesh in the viscous sigma model computational domain is composed of 201 grid points in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 1 5 e 005 m near the bottom a constant time step of δ t 0 0001 s is used the simulation is run for 30 wave periods to ensure a fully developed boundary layer the comparison of the model result with the experimental data and the analytical solution of lamb 1932 are shown in fig 1 only the accelerating phase is shown here as is shown in the figure the linear model results agree very well with the analytical solution of lamb 1932 however the nonlinear model results provide a better match to the experimental data an explanation for this remark could be due to the weakly nonlinear nature of this configuration the ratio ɛ δ is of order o 1 in this case further indicating that the coupling term is important and likely influences the solution the second oscillatory data set used for comparison is the numerical solution of the three dimensional navier stokes equations by lin and zhang 2008 in this case the wave height is 0 01 m the wave period of 3 s and the wave propagates in a constant water depth of 1 0 m ɛ 0 005 and μ 0 1 201 grid points are used in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 2 5 e 005 m near the bottom the model is run for 30 wave periods with a constant time step of δ t 0 0001 s in this case both the linear and nonlinear model results agree very well with the numerical results of lin and zhang 2008 as shown in fig 2 in this case ɛ δ is less than o 1 thus the effect of the coupling term in this test case is small compared to the previous data set it is worth noting that the computational cost for running our model is much less than the full three dimensional model of lin and zhang 2008 while obtaining the same accuracy 3 2 solitary wave the next set of simulations examines the boundary layer generated under solitary waves in these simulations the potential component is numerically obtained by solving the one dimensional boussinesq type wave model of lynett and liu 2002 the dimensional continuity equation and the horizontal momentum equation are 23 η t x h η u α x h η h 2 6 1 2 z α 2 u α x 1 2 η h z α h u α x x 0 24 u α t 1 2 u α 2 x g η x t 1 2 z α 2 u α x z α h u α x x 0 where uα is the velocity at the reference level zα and is taken as 0 531 h nwogu 1993 the vertical profiles for the horizontal and vertical velocities are obtained via the equations 25 u u α 1 2 z 2 z α 2 u α x x z z α h u α x x 26 w z α u α x h u α x an adams bashforth moulton predictor corrector scheme is used to integrate the continuity eq 23 and the x momentum eq 24 the potential horizontal and vertical velocities are obtained along with the surface elevation and both are passed to the viscous sigma model finally the potential component is added to the rotational component to obtain the total velocity field two data sets of the experiment done by liu et al 2007 are used for comparison the first set uses a water depth of 0 1 m and a solitary wave height of 0 02 m the dispersion and the nonlinearity parameters ϵ and μ are 0 2 and 0 0658 respectively the computational domain of the one dimensional boussinesq model consists of 7000 grid points in the x direction with δ x 0 001 m the viscous sigma model has 201 grid points in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 2 5 e 006 m near the bottom a constant time step of δ t 3 e 005 s is used first the numerical solution is compared with the experimental data both linear and nonlinear solutions of the viscous sigma model are obtained in general both solutions agree well with the experimental data in the accelerating phase however a remarkable difference between the linear solution and the nonlinear solution in the decelerating phase is noticed as shown in fig 3 the results of the nonlinear model show better agreement with the experimental data in the decelerating phase the coupling term in the x momentum equation is presumed to have an effect in the decelerating phase it is also noticed that the computational time for the linear model and the nonlinear model are very close as the vertical potential velocity is known bottom shear stresses are calculated using the rotational velocity gradient at the bottom and are shown in fig 4 the calculated bottom shear stresses agree with both the experimental results and the analytical solution of liu et al 2007 the change in sign in the bottom shear stress is captured by the model results even though the velocity outside the boundary layer is always in the direction of the wave propagation there are very small differences between the bottom shear stress computed from the linear and the nonlinear model and the comparison has been separated in two plots for clearness this result suggests our approach is an accurate and practical way for calculating bottom shear stress compared to for example the quadratic drag law driven by the bottom potential velocity the characteristics of the second data set of liu et al 2007 are water depth of 0 1 m and wave height of 0 03 with ϵ and μ equal 0 3 and 0 0813 respectively the viscous sigma model has 201 grid points in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 2 5 e 006 m near the bottom and a constant time step of δ t 3 4 e 005 s the comparison with the experimental data is shown in fig 5 both the linear and nonlinear model solutions are able to predict the velocity profile in the accelerating phase with the tendency of the nonlinear solution to better match the experimental data in the decelerating phase bottom shear stress is calculated and compared with the experimental solitary wave data set ɛ 0 2 to investigate the effect of wave nonlinearity decreasing shear stress with increasing wave nonlinearity ϵ is clear in fig 6 this is shown liu et al 2007 as well the top panel in fig 6 shows the comparison of bottom shear stress calculated using the linear model for ϵ 0 2 and ϵ 0 3 the bottom panel in the figure shows the comparison of bottom shear stress calculated using the nonlinear model for ϵ 0 2 and ϵ 0 3 vittori and blondeaux 2008 mention that for small amplitude waves the boundary layer tends to remain laminar and the negative velocities during the flow reversal in the decelerating phase persist they show that the flow reversal intensity and time duration decreases with increase in ϵ the same properties are evident here while comparing the experiment data sets with the numerical solutions 4 model

governing equations have ten small parameters which are μs μl β 1s β 1l β 2s β 2l ϵ s ϵ l δs and δl we attempt to find approximate relations to group these parameters together and thus decreasing their number first we note that the parameters β 1s and β 1l are multiplied by the bottom velocity to represent the friction velocities as in single wave motion therefore by comparing the friction factors of these two motions the relative order of magnitude of the parameters β 1s and β 1l can be estimated as o β 1l β 1s o res rel here the reynolds number is given as r e u b 2 ω ν where the expression for the maximum particle excursion is used after using the maximum bottom velocity expressions for the two motions and performing simple manipulations the following relations are obtained 32 o r e s r e l o ɛ s 2 μ l ɛ l 2 μ s o β 1 l o β 1 s μ s m 1 4 ɛ s ɛ l second it is presumed that the dispersion parameter of the shorter wave and the longer wave can be related as o μ l o μ s m where m is a free power that depends on the characteristics of the problem third it is assumed that the two waves have comparable amplitude o ϵ s o ϵ l therefore the reynolds number of the shorter wave is smaller than the reynolds number of the longer wave o res o rel thus the friction factor of the longer wave is smaller than the friction factor of the shorter wave fwl fws and the parameter β 1 of the longer wave is smaller than β 1 of the shorter wave this leads to β 1l β 1s by substituting the previous relations into the governing equations the number of small parameters are reduced to eight β 1s β 2s β 2l μs ϵ s ϵ l δs and δl finally it is assumed that o β 2 s o β 1 s δ s μ s and o β 2 l o β 1 l δ l μ l as it is done in the single motion therefore it is possible to reduce the number of small parameters to six finally each wave motion is assumed to follow the boussinesq assumption thus o ɛ s o μ s 2 1 and the same for the longer motion o ɛ l o μ l 2 1 by applying this final assumption the number of the free parameters is decreased to four 4 2 model results the bottom boundary layers generated under the interaction of short and long waves with different long wave forcings are investigated in this section the first interaction type consists of two periodic short and long waves the second interaction type consists of short waves interacting with a solitary wave the first case represents periodic forcing whereas the second case represents transient forcing the boundary layer response under these two different forcings is discussed 4 3 two oscillatory motions in this section the bottom boundary layer generated under two interacting oscillatory wave motions is presented the parameters of the problem are ɛ s 0 05 ɛ l 0 005 μ s 0 12 μ l 0 04 and thus m 1 5 the reynolds number and the friction factor are calculated and o β 1s o 0 01 it is assumed that o δ s o ɛ s and o δ l o β 1 s after applying these relations and keeping only the leading order terms the

u s r t s r u l r t l r w s p u s r z s r w s p u l r z l r 2 u s r z s r 2 2 u l r z l r 2 two boundary conditions are required in order to solve the equations the velocity gradient at the top boundary and the bottom velocity the shorter wave motion is superimposed on an existing longer wave in this study therefore the combined potential of the short and the long wave is the forcing mechanism the bottom boundary condition is taken to satisfy the no slip boundary condition and zero shear stress is assumed at the water surface 38 u t r u t p at z h 39 u t r z r 0 at z η where u t r is the total rotational horizontal velocity and u t p is the total potential horizontal velocity the computational domain length is chosen to be 50 wavelengths of the longer wave the simulation is run for 80 wave periods of the longer wave to ensure a fully developed boundary layer the computational domain has δ x 0 03 m δ z 0 00001 m and δ t 0 0005 s with 0 5 m water depth sponge layers are used on the left and right boundaries to absorb the wave energy the two oscillatory waves are generated using the source function as described in wei and kirby 1995 inside the one dimensional boussinesq type wave model the potential velocities of the short wave and the long wave are passed to the viscous sigma model the viscous sigma model solves the eqs 36 and 37 with the two boundary conditions 38 and 39 to obtain the vertical profile of the combined rotational velocity two different simulations are presented in this section in the first simulation the effect of the coupling term under the interaction of two waves is quantified the potential forcing is fixed and the horizontal momentum equation is solved twice one time with the coupling terms the third and fourth terms in the eq 37 nonlinear model solution and a second time without the coupling terms linear model solution the combined velocity profile at different locations are shown in fig 7 where u α u g h η η h and z z h it is noticed that the boundary layer response is different in these two cases despite the same potential forcing the nonlinear model solution is larger in the accelerating phase while the linear model solution is larger in the decelerating phase thus the superposition principle should be used carefully while studying bottom boundary layer and sediment transports under wave interacting also we expect the flow outside the boundary layer to be reasonably well captured using the boussinesq model and under the linear forcing in this case and hence the comparison for the flow outside the boundary won t be presented here 4 4 periodic waves over solitary wave in this simulation the bottom boundary layer is forced by the interaction of a solitary wave and short periodic waves the short waves are generated in the boussinesq numerical wave model using the source function the initial location of the solitary wave is set behind the source location the characteristics of the short wave are as before ɛ s 0 05 and μ s 0 12 and the solitary wave has ɛ l 0 005 the differences in the velocity profile in this test case are more pronounced as compared to the difference seen in the two oscillatory motions as shown in fig 8 moreover the combined velocity profiles show inflection points in the accelerating phase this remark does not exist in the velocity profile under a single solitary wave an explanation for this remark could be to the rapid acceleration and deceleration phases of the solitary wave compared to those of the oscillatory long wave also the effect of the solitary wave is found in the boundary layer even after it passes see fig 8 f 5 conclusions this work aims to incorporate bottom boundary layer effects forced by a single wave and under two interacting waves the multiple scale approach is applied to the navier stokes equations where the fluid velocities and pressure are decomposed into two components potential and rotational both components are allowed to coexist in the entire water column different time scales are employed for the two components a convective time scale is used for the potential component and a viscous time scale for the rotational component the friction velocity is used to scale the rotational velocity component it is represented here as a small parameter β 1 multiplied by the bottom velocity ub i e u β 1 u b the order of magnitude of the coefficient β 1 is found from the analysis and is related to the friction factor which depends on the characteristics of the problem under consideration by applying this approach a set of equations for the rotational velocity component are derived the boundary layer thickness is not assumed to be finite and therefore it is not necessary to use different models to solve for the flow kinematics inside and outside the boundary layer a one dimensional numerical model with σ coordinate transformation in the vertical direction is used the single wave forcing consists of harmonic forcing e g oscillatory wave and transient forcing e g solitary wave linear wave theory is used to obtain the potential velocity component for the oscillatory wave motion case while a one dimensional boussinesq type equation is solved numerically to obtain the potential velocity component in the solitary wave motion case a one way coupling is used where the potential horizontal bottom velocity and the vertical component of the potential velocity are passed to the viscous sigma model to solve for the rotational velocity component finally the two components potential and rotational are summed to obtain the total velocity field the order of magnitude analysis shows that the leading order coupling between the potential and rotational components occurs through the vertical convective acceleration term wp ur z the model results agree well with the available experimental data and the numerical solutions for different forcing conditions with better matching when including the coupling term under the various wave forcings under solitary waves the bottom shear stress undergoes a change in sign during the wave cycle although the velocity outside the boundary layer is always positive in the direction of wave propagation the conventional way of calculating bottom shear stresses i e the quadratic law using the bottom velocity will not be able to predict this change in sign in the approach outlined in this paper the bottom shear stress is calculated using the rotational velocity gradient at the bottom and the sign change is captured for the two wave motion cases the governing equations for the bottom boundary layer forced by the interaction of two distinct wave motions are derived both motions the shorter and the longer waves are decomposed into two components potential and rotational laminar boundary layer approximations are used to reduce the number of small parameters that appear in the governing equations different examples of the boundary layer under two wave motions are presented here 1 the interaction of long and short oscillatory wave motions and 2 the interaction of a solitary wave with periodic waves the analysis of the two wave motions indicates that nonlinear effects in the rotational solution may be significant even when nonlinear effects in the potential forcing are negligible these results suggest the careful use of the superposition principle in case of interacting two wave motions 
24118,a multiple scale perturbation approach is implemented to solve the navier stokes equations while including bottom boundary layer effects under a single wave and under two interacting waves in this approach fluid velocities and the pressure field are decomposed into two components a potential component and a rotational component in this study the two components are exist throughout the entire water column and each is scaled with appropriate length and time scales a one way coupling between the two components is implemented the potential component is assumed to be known analytically or numerically a prior and the rotational component is forced by the potential component through order of magnitude analysis it is found that the leading order coupling between the two components occurs through the vertical convective acceleration it is shown that this coupling plays an important role in the bottom boundary layer behavior its effect on the results is discussed for different wave forcing conditions purely harmonic forcing and impurely harmonic forcing the approach is then applied to derive the governing equations for the bottom boundary layer developed under two interacting wave motions both motions the shorter and the longer wave are decomposed into two components potential and rotational as it is done in the single wave test cases are presented wherein two different wave forcings are simulated 1 two periodic oscillatory motions and 2 short waves interacting with a solitary wave the analysis of the two periodic motions indicates that nonlinear effects in the rotational solution may be significant even though nonlinear effects are negligible in the potential forcing the local differences in the rotational velocity due to the nonlinear vertical convection coupling term are found to be on the order of 30 of the maximum boundary layer velocity for the cases simulated in this paper this difference is expected to increase with the increase in wave nonlinearity keywords multiple scale perturbation two oscillatory motions swell solitary motions σ coordinate bottom boundary layer 1 introduction oscillatory bottom boundary layers have been extensively studied in the literature through experiments and numerical models experiments are often performed using an oscillating water tunnel for laminar and turbulent boundary layers riedel et al 1972 kamphuis 1975 jonsson and carlsen 1976 sleath 1987 jensen et al 1989 however the oscillating tunnel does not represent the flow under dispersive wave conditions where vertical velocity could play an important role in the vicinity of the bed other experiments are performed in wave flumes such as van doorn 1981 and mirfenderesk and young 2003 numerical models have been developed to include the bottom boundary layer effects under wave propagation using different approaches one approach is through incorporating extra terms into the governing equations for example liu and orfila 2004 and liu 2006 account for boundary layer effects by including a convolution integral in the depth integrated continuity equation and solving boussinesq type wave equations for laminar and turbulent boundary layer flows other approaches tend to solve two sets of models one set for the flow kinematics inside the boundary layer and another for the flow kinematics outside the boundary layer this approach suffers from the need to assume a boundary layer thickness before solving the problem for example lee and cheung 1999 obtain flow kinematics by solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations inside the viscous flow region and the laplace equation outside the viscous flow region while implementing fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions gilbert et al 2007 couple a numerical wave tank nwt potential flow solver with a large eddy simulation solver and study the sediment transport over partially buried obstacles harris and grilli 2012 state due to the limitation on the grid size used in the large eddy simulation model this type of coupling is efficient when simulating simple cases harris and grilli 2012 couple an extended version of the zang et al 1994 model of the large eddy simulation solver with a nwt and simulate velocity fields under any arbitrary finite amplitude wave motion other researchers have used direct numerical simulation dns of the three dimensional navier stokes equations this approach provides more accurate solutions but is numerically expensive for instance lin and zhang 2008 simulate laminar bottom boundary layers generated under various wave motions including sinusoidal stokes cnoidal and solitary waves vittori and blondeaux 2008 similarly use direct numerical simulation to predict turbulent bottom boundary layers generated under solitary waves many of these solutions and models are either too sophisticated to implement or numerically very demanding for large complex problems the shallow water wave models that have been used extensively in the literature are considered to be good practical approximations to nonlinear wave hydrodynamics and coastal processes in the near shore zone however these models lack an accurate way to include boundary layer effects and thus bottom shear stresses kim et al 2009 derive depth integrated boussinesq type wave equations from navier stokes ns equations and includes bottom induced turbulence they retain integrated horizontal and vertical vorticity terms however the vertical profile of the shear stress has to be assumed a priori we aim to develop a practical yet accurate approach including bottom boundary layer effects for complex near shore environments with multiple wave components the approach followed here in this study differs from the existing boundary layer theories in the order of the decomposition of the flow and the scaling in this study the decomposition of the flow is done before the scaling contrary to other theories where decomposition of the flow is done after the scaling i e liu and orfila 2004 and liu 2006 also there has been insufficient research on bottom boundary layers generated under interacting oscillatory motions although this interaction commonly exists in near shore zones therefore a multiple scale approach to include bottom boundary layer effects under two wave motions is investigated in this study each wave motion is decomposed into a potential component and a rotational component where each component is distinctly scaled the derived governing equations including bottom boundary layer effects under single wave motion are presented in section 2 along with the development of the one dimensional numerical model with σ coordinate transformation section 3 covers the model validation and comparison to available experimental and numerical data section 4 outlines the derivation of the governing equations for two wave motions and the corresponding model results the main conclusions and future recommendations are stated in section 5 2 model derivation and governing equations for single oscillatory motion the first step in deriving our equation set is to decompose the wave motion into two components potential and rotational the basis for this decomposition and eventual scaling is that the potential irrotational component exists everywhere throughout the water column whereas the rotational motion exists strongly near the bottom and decreases with increasing distance from the bottom in the absence of wind stresses this decomposition is used to scale the vertical coordinate for each component in addition the time scale for each component could be different depending on the characteristics of the problem therefore the multiple scale perturbation approach is used to derive the governing equations in this analysis two time scales are presented a convective time scale that is used to scale the potential component and viscous time scale that is used to scale the rotational component consequently the horizontal velocity the vertical velocity and the pressure for the two components are scaled differently as will be shown later in the paper one of the advantages of this decomposition is that it results in a numerically simpler set of equations for the rotational component while maintaining the interaction between the two components rotational and potential of the wave motion the allowance of the rotational component to exist throughout the water column enables us to apply boundary conditions only at the bottom and water surface thus there is no need to assume that the boundary layer thickness extends to infinity or diminishes at some ad hoc depth this approach overcomes the need to use different models for the flow kinematics inside and for outside of the boundary layer also viscous effects are allowed to have the same order of magnitude as the dispersion effects contrary to some previous models in which viscous effects are assumed to be weaker than dispersion and nonlinear effects liu and orfila 2004 liu 2006 orfila et al 2007 2 1 dimensionless governing equations in this section the propagation of an oscillatory wave train in a constant water depth h surface elevation η x y t frequency ω and wave amplitude a is considered the wave motion is decomposed into two components where the superscript p denotes the potential component and r denotes the rotational component this decomposition is done before scaling the physical quantities unlike other approaches where wave motion is decomposed after scaling the decomposition are given as 1 u u p u r w w p w r p p p p r where the prime denotes dimensional variables substituting the previous decomposition into the governing equations gives the continuity equation and the momentum equations in the x and z directions respectively are 2 u p x u r x w p z p w r z r 0 3 u p t p u r t r u p u p x u p u r x u r u p x u r u r x w p u p z p w p u r z r w r u p z p w r u r z r 1 ρ p p x 1 ρ p r x ν

w r x r 2 ν 2 w p z p 2 ν 2 w r z r 2 the governing equations are non dimensionalized by choosing the appropriate length scale and time scale for each of the two components shallow water wave scaling is presumed for the potential component the wavelength l is used for the horizontal length scale the water depth h is used for the vertical length scale and l g h is used for the time scale for the rotational component the wavelength l is used for the horizontal length scale as with the potential component the parameter δ is defined as δ δ h where δ is the dimensional boundary layer thickness the magnitude of δ goes from near zero in the very smooth bottom limit to 1 in the limit when the boundary layer occupies the whole water column i e for long waves or currents over rough bottoms other researchers have incorporated this parameter δ in their scaling for example vittori and blondeaux 2008 and blondeaux and vittori 2012 use the boundary layer thickness defined as 2 ν h g h as a viscous length scale to scale the horizontal and vertical dimensions inside the bottom boundary layer the horizontal rotational velocity is scaled by the friction velocity u as usually done in boundary layer flows in this study the friction velocity is represented by the bottom velocity ub multiplied by a parameter the parameter is β 1 for the horizontal rotational velocity and β 2 for the vertical rotational velocity the order of magnitude of these two parameters will be discussed the rotational pressure is considered to be a dynamic pressure and hence connected to the velocity scaling it is scaled by the square of the velocity and hence the parameter is β 1 2 the time scale for the rotational component is taken to be the viscous time this time scale is defined as length scale divided by viscosity δ h 2 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity in the case of the laminar boundary layer and the eddy viscosity in the case of turbulent boundary layer as it is mentioned before the flow is decomposed into potential component and rotational component where the rotational component is driven by the potential component however the potential forcing has a convective time scale that differs from the time scale for rotational component which is taken to be the viscous time scale in this study the behavior of the rotational component is very much related to the viscosity and thus the use of the viscosity in the time scale meant to represent the diffusion viscous time scale lastly the pressure is scaled by the density multiplied by the wave amplitude and gravity for both the potential and the rotational components 2 2 derivation of the governing equations the propagation of two dimensional waves are considered where the x axis is taken to be in the direction of wave propagation and the positive z axis points vertically upward with zero at the still water level the following dimensionless variables are introduced 5 x y x y l z p z h z r z δ h t p g h t l t r ν t r δ 2 h 2 u p v p

order of magnitude for the small parameters β 1 and β 2 the leading order solution for the rotational component will depend on the order of magnitude of parameters β 1 andβ 2 the order of magnitude for the parameter β 2 can be estimated by looking at the continuity eq 13 for the two dimensional problem the two gradient terms must balance such that o β 2 o δ μ β 1 hence the two parameters are related the order of magnitude for the parameter β 1 can be estimated the velocity scale β 1 ɛ g h approximates the friction velocity u which it is usually represented as a function of the maximum bottom shear stress and or the maximum bottom particle velocity for example friction velocity can be given as u 2 τ b m a x ρ 1 2 f w u b 2 where fw is the friction factor τbmax is the maximum bottom shear stress and ub is the maximum bottom particle velocity in this paper the friction velocity is represented as a function of the maximum bottom particle velocity ub multiplied by the parameter β 1 where u β 1 u b applying the previous relations and with simple manipulations the order of magnitude of the parameter β 1 is found to be proportional to the square root of the friction factor fw therefore the order of magnitude for β 1 will depend on the characteristics of the problem under investigation the friction factor is often assumed to be a function of the reynolds number and the bottom surface characteristics smooth or rough e g cox et al 1996 for laminar bottom boundary layers there are various methods to calculate the friction factor for example nielsen 1992 uses the maximum bottom shear stress defined as τ b m a x ρ ν ω u b to obtain friction factor defined as f w 2 ρ ω u b mirfenderesk and young 2003 represents the friction factor as a function of the reynolds number f w 2 r e where the reynolds number is calculated as r e a b u b ν with ab is the maximum particle excursion at the bottom here the definition for the friction factor will be used mirfenderesk and young 2003 therefore a typical value for the parameter β 1 in a laminar boundary layer would be in the range of o 0 01 0 1 in turbulent boundary layer the above analysis will need further investigation 3 numerical model and results a one dimensional numerical model is developed to solve the governing equations for the rotational component this numerical model will be called the viscous sigma model in this paper the σ coordinate transformation is applied in the vertical direction to ensure fine resolution near the bottom to properly resolve the boundary layer the following transformation is implemented 16 σ z h h η 1 n where n is a free power used to adjust the resolution of the numerical grid we used a value of n 2 as this provided acceptable resolution near the bottom yielding numerical convergent results before applying the viscous sigma model the leading order solution for the rotational component is found this step requires an estimate of the relative order of magnitude of the parameter β 1 and the other small parameters μ δ and ϵ from the x momentum eq 14 the local acceleration term and the diffusion term are of the same order of magnitude it is also noticed that the coupling term w o p u o r z with the coefficient ɛ δ could have a comparable order of magnitude to both the local acceleration and the diffusion terms when o δ has the same order of magnitude as ϵ the other terms in the x momentum eq 14 have a higher order of magnitude and thus will be neglected in this study in this study the coupling term w o p u o r z is examined to quantify its effect on the bottom boundary layer behavior under various wave forcing types including purely harmonic forcing i e oscillatory waves and transient forcing i e solitary waves numerical calculations of the boundary layer are performed by specifying the potential component as an input to the viscous sigma model the numerical simulation is run twice for each forcing type in the first simulation the horizontal momentum equation is solved without the coupling term w o p u o r z the horizontal rotational velocity is obtained via solving the x momentum eq 18 and it will be called the linear model solution in the second simulation the coupling term is retained the horizontal rotational velocity is obtained via solving the x momentum eq 19 and it will be called the nonlinear model solution the two solutions will be plotted against experimental data to investigate the effect of this coupling term the dimensional continuity the x momentum governing equations and the boundary conditions for the rotational motion are 17 u r x w r z r 0 18 u r t r 2 u r z r 2 19 u r t r w p u r z r 2 u r z r 2 the no slip boundary condition at the bottom and zero shear stress is assumed at the water surface 20 u r u p at z h 21 u r z r 0 at z 0 it is clear that the developed scaling in this study produces a simple solution for obtaining the rotational velocity component where only the vertical and time dimensions are required to solve the equations the needed quantities to solve the above equations are the horizontal potential velocity at the bottom along with the vertical profile of the vertical potential velocity 3 1 oscillatory wave the first set of simulations examines the boundary layer generated under oscillatory wave motion linear wave theory is used to provide the potential component in this case the model results are compared to the experimental data of mirfenderesk and young 2003 for case s1 and the linear analytical solution by lamb 1932 the lamb 1932 solution for the total horizontal velocity is given as 22 u u m cos k x ω t exp β z cos k x ω t β z where um is the maximum horizontal velocity near the bottom k is the wave number β ω 2 ν is the boundary layer parameter and z is the distance from the bottom the single harmonic wave characteristics used in the experiment are wave height of 0 12 m wave period of 2 s wavelength of 4 21 m and a constant water depth of 0 55 m the values of μ and ϵ are 0 13 and 0 11 respectively the mesh in the viscous sigma model computational domain is composed of 201 grid points in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 1 5 e 005 m near the bottom a constant time step of δ t 0 0001 s is used the simulation is run for 30 wave periods to ensure a fully developed boundary layer the comparison of the model result with the experimental data and the analytical solution of lamb 1932 are shown in fig 1 only the accelerating phase is shown here as is shown in the figure the linear model results agree very well with the analytical solution of lamb 1932 however the nonlinear model results provide a better match to the experimental data an explanation for this remark could be due to the weakly nonlinear nature of this configuration the ratio ɛ δ is of order o 1 in this case further indicating that the coupling term is important and likely influences the solution the second oscillatory data set used for comparison is the numerical solution of the three dimensional navier stokes equations by lin and zhang 2008 in this case the wave height is 0 01 m the wave period of 3 s and the wave propagates in a constant water depth of 1 0 m ɛ 0 005 and μ 0 1 201 grid points are used in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 2 5 e 005 m near the bottom the model is run for 30 wave periods with a constant time step of δ t 0 0001 s in this case both the linear and nonlinear model results agree very well with the numerical results of lin and zhang 2008 as shown in fig 2 in this case ɛ δ is less than o 1 thus the effect of the coupling term in this test case is small compared to the previous data set it is worth noting that the computational cost for running our model is much less than the full three dimensional model of lin and zhang 2008 while obtaining the same accuracy 3 2 solitary wave the next set of simulations examines the boundary layer generated under solitary waves in these simulations the potential component is numerically obtained by solving the one dimensional boussinesq type wave model of lynett and liu 2002 the dimensional continuity equation and the horizontal momentum equation are 23 η t x h η u α x h η h 2 6 1 2 z α 2 u α x 1 2 η h z α h u α x x 0 24 u α t 1 2 u α 2 x g η x t 1 2 z α 2 u α x z α h u α x x 0 where uα is the velocity at the reference level zα and is taken as 0 531 h nwogu 1993 the vertical profiles for the horizontal and vertical velocities are obtained via the equations 25 u u α 1 2 z 2 z α 2 u α x x z z α h u α x x 26 w z α u α x h u α x an adams bashforth moulton predictor corrector scheme is used to integrate the continuity eq 23 and the x momentum eq 24 the potential horizontal and vertical velocities are obtained along with the surface elevation and both are passed to the viscous sigma model finally the potential component is added to the rotational component to obtain the total velocity field two data sets of the experiment done by liu et al 2007 are used for comparison the first set uses a water depth of 0 1 m and a solitary wave height of 0 02 m the dispersion and the nonlinearity parameters ϵ and μ are 0 2 and 0 0658 respectively the computational domain of the one dimensional boussinesq model consists of 7000 grid points in the x direction with δ x 0 001 m the viscous sigma model has 201 grid points in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 2 5 e 006 m near the bottom a constant time step of δ t 3 e 005 s is used first the numerical solution is compared with the experimental data both linear and nonlinear solutions of the viscous sigma model are obtained in general both solutions agree well with the experimental data in the accelerating phase however a remarkable difference between the linear solution and the nonlinear solution in the decelerating phase is noticed as shown in fig 3 the results of the nonlinear model show better agreement with the experimental data in the decelerating phase the coupling term in the x momentum equation is presumed to have an effect in the decelerating phase it is also noticed that the computational time for the linear model and the nonlinear model are very close as the vertical potential velocity is known bottom shear stresses are calculated using the rotational velocity gradient at the bottom and are shown in fig 4 the calculated bottom shear stresses agree with both the experimental results and the analytical solution of liu et al 2007 the change in sign in the bottom shear stress is captured by the model results even though the velocity outside the boundary layer is always in the direction of the wave propagation there are very small differences between the bottom shear stress computed from the linear and the nonlinear model and the comparison has been separated in two plots for clearness this result suggests our approach is an accurate and practical way for calculating bottom shear stress compared to for example the quadratic drag law driven by the bottom potential velocity the characteristics of the second data set of liu et al 2007 are water depth of 0 1 m and wave height of 0 03 with ϵ and μ equal 0 3 and 0 0813 respectively the viscous sigma model has 201 grid points in the vertical direction with minimum δ z 2 5 e 006 m near the bottom and a constant time step of δ t 3 4 e 005 s the comparison with the experimental data is shown in fig 5 both the linear and nonlinear model solutions are able to predict the velocity profile in the accelerating phase with the tendency of the nonlinear solution to better match the experimental data in the decelerating phase bottom shear stress is calculated and compared with the experimental solitary wave data set ɛ 0 2 to investigate the effect of wave nonlinearity decreasing shear stress with increasing wave nonlinearity ϵ is clear in fig 6 this is shown liu et al 2007 as well the top panel in fig 6 shows the comparison of bottom shear stress calculated using the linear model for ϵ 0 2 and ϵ 0 3 the bottom panel in the figure shows the comparison of bottom shear stress calculated using the nonlinear model for ϵ 0 2 and ϵ 0 3 vittori and blondeaux 2008 mention that for small amplitude waves the boundary layer tends to remain laminar and the negative velocities during the flow reversal in the decelerating phase persist they show that the flow reversal intensity and time duration decreases with increase in ϵ the same properties are evident here while comparing the experiment data sets with the numerical solutions 4 model derivation and governing equations for two wave motions in this section the propagation of a wave train in a constant water depth is considered the shorter wave motion has a surface elevation of η s x y t a frequency ωs and a wave amplitude a s interacting with a longer wave motion that has a surface elevation of η l x y t a frequency ωl and a wave amplitude a l the decomposition of each wave motion of the two interacting waves into potential and rotational components is done here the governing equations are non dimensionalized by the appropriate length and time scales for each component of each wave the following decomposition is used 27 u s u s p u s r u l u l p u l r w s w s p w s r w l w l p w l r p s p s p p s r p l p l p p l r where the prime denotes dimensional variables the

governing equations have ten small parameters which are μs μl β 1s β 1l β 2s β 2l ϵ s ϵ l δs and δl we attempt to find approximate relations to group these parameters together and thus decreasing their number first we note that the parameters β 1s and β 1l are multiplied by the bottom velocity to represent the friction velocities as in single wave motion therefore by comparing the friction factors of these two motions the relative order of magnitude of the parameters β 1s and β 1l can be estimated as o β 1l β 1s o res rel here the reynolds number is given as r e u b 2 ω ν where the expression for the maximum particle excursion is used after using the maximum bottom velocity expressions for the two motions and performing simple manipulations the following relations are obtained 32 o r e s r e l o ɛ s 2 μ l ɛ l 2 μ s o β 1 l o β 1 s μ s m 1 4 ɛ s ɛ l second it is presumed that the dispersion parameter of the shorter wave and the longer wave can be related as o μ l o μ s m where m is a free power that depends on the characteristics of the problem third it is assumed that the two waves have comparable amplitude o ϵ s o ϵ l therefore the reynolds number of the shorter wave is smaller than the reynolds number of the longer wave o res o rel thus the friction factor of the longer wave is smaller than the friction factor of the shorter wave fwl fws and the parameter β 1 of the longer wave is smaller than β 1 of the shorter wave this leads to β 1l β 1s by substituting the previous relations into the governing equations the number of small parameters are reduced to

number of small parameters to six finally each wave motion is assumed to follow the boussinesq assumption thus o ɛ s o μ s 2 1 and the same for the longer motion o ɛ l o μ l 2 1 by applying this final assumption the number of the free parameters is decreased to four 4 2 model results the bottom boundary layers generated under the interaction of short and long waves with different long wave forcings are investigated in this section the first interaction type consists of two periodic short and long waves the second interaction type consists of short waves interacting with a solitary wave the first case represents periodic forcing whereas the second case represents transient forcing the boundary layer response under these two different forcings is discussed 4 3 two oscillatory motions in this section the bottom boundary layer generated under two interacting oscillatory wave motions is presented the parameters of the problem are ɛ s 0 05 ɛ l 0 005 μ s 0 12 μ l 0 04 and thus m 1 5 the reynolds number and the friction factor are calculated and o β 1s o 0 01 it is assumed that o δ s o ɛ s and o δ l o β 1 s after applying these relations and keeping only the leading order terms the

u s r t s r u l r t l r w s p u s r z s r w s p u l r z l r 2 u s r z s r 2 2 u l r z l r 2 two boundary conditions are required in order to solve the equations the velocity gradient at the top boundary and the bottom velocity the shorter wave motion is superimposed on an existing longer wave in this study therefore the combined potential of the short and the long wave is the forcing mechanism the bottom boundary condition is taken to satisfy the no slip boundary condition and zero shear stress is assumed at the water surface 38 u t r u t p at z h 39 u t r z r 0 at z η where u t r is the total rotational horizontal velocity and u t p is the total potential horizontal velocity the computational domain length is chosen to be 50 wavelengths of the longer wave the simulation is run for 80 wave periods of the longer wave to ensure a fully developed boundary layer the computational domain has δ x 0 03 m δ z 0 00001 m and δ t 0 0005 s with 0 5 m water depth sponge layers are used on the left and right boundaries to absorb the wave energy the two oscillatory waves are generated using the source function as described in wei and kirby 1995 inside the one dimensional boussinesq type wave model the potential velocities of the short wave and the long wave are passed to the viscous sigma model the viscous sigma model solves the eqs 36 and 37 with the two boundary conditions 38 and 39 to obtain the vertical profile of the combined rotational velocity two different simulations are presented in this section in the first simulation the effect of the coupling term under the interaction of two waves is quantified the potential forcing is fixed and the horizontal momentum equation is solved twice one time with the coupling terms the third and fourth terms in the eq 37 nonlinear model solution and a second time without the coupling terms linear model solution the combined velocity profile at different locations are shown in fig 7 where u α u g h η η h and z z h it is noticed that the boundary layer response is different in these two cases despite the same potential forcing the nonlinear model solution is larger in the accelerating phase while the linear model solution is larger in the decelerating phase thus the superposition principle should be used carefully while studying bottom boundary layer and sediment transports under wave interacting also we expect the flow outside the boundary layer to be reasonably well captured using the boussinesq model and under the linear forcing in this case and hence the comparison for the flow outside the boundary won t be presented here 4 4 periodic waves over solitary wave in this simulation the bottom boundary layer is forced by the interaction of a solitary wave and short periodic waves the short waves are generated in the boussinesq numerical wave model using the source function the initial location of the solitary wave is set behind the source location the characteristics of the short wave are as before ɛ s 0 05 and μ s 0 12 and the solitary wave has ɛ l 0 005 the differences in the velocity profile in this test case are more pronounced as compared to the difference seen in the two oscillatory motions as shown in fig 8 moreover the combined velocity profiles show inflection points in the accelerating phase this remark does not exist in the velocity profile under a single solitary wave an explanation for this remark could be to the rapid acceleration and deceleration phases of the solitary wave compared to those of the oscillatory long wave also the effect of the solitary wave is found in the boundary layer even after it passes see fig 8 f 5 conclusions this work aims to incorporate bottom boundary layer effects forced by a single wave and under two interacting waves the multiple scale approach is applied to the navier stokes equations where the fluid velocities and pressure are decomposed into two components potential and rotational both components are allowed to coexist in the entire water column different time scales are employed for the two components a convective time scale is used for the potential component and a viscous time scale for the rotational component the friction velocity is used to scale the rotational velocity component it is represented here as a small parameter β 1 multiplied by the bottom velocity ub i e u β 1 u b the order of magnitude of the coefficient β 1 is found from the analysis and is related to the friction factor which depends on the characteristics of the problem under consideration by applying this approach a set of equations for the rotational velocity component are derived the boundary layer thickness is not assumed to be finite and therefore it is not necessary to use different models to solve for the flow kinematics inside and outside the boundary layer a one dimensional numerical model with σ coordinate transformation in the vertical direction is used the single wave forcing consists of harmonic forcing e g oscillatory wave and transient forcing e g solitary wave linear wave theory is used to obtain the potential velocity component for the oscillatory wave motion case while a one dimensional boussinesq type equation is solved numerically to obtain the potential velocity component in the solitary wave motion case a one way coupling is used where the potential horizontal bottom velocity and the vertical component of the potential velocity are passed to the viscous sigma model to solve for the rotational velocity component finally the two components potential and rotational are summed to obtain the total velocity field the order of magnitude analysis shows that the leading order coupling between the potential and rotational components occurs through the vertical convective acceleration term wp ur z the model results agree well with the available experimental data and the numerical solutions for different forcing conditions with better matching when including the coupling term under the various wave forcings under solitary waves the bottom shear stress undergoes a change in sign during the wave cycle although the velocity outside the boundary layer is always positive in the direction of wave propagation the conventional way of calculating bottom shear stresses i e the quadratic law using the bottom velocity will not be able to predict this change in sign in the approach outlined in this paper the bottom shear stress is calculated using the rotational velocity gradient at the bottom and the sign change is captured for the two wave motion cases the governing equations for the bottom boundary layer forced by the interaction of two distinct wave motions are derived both motions the shorter and the longer waves are decomposed into two components potential and rotational laminar boundary layer approximations are used to reduce the number of small parameters that appear in the governing equations different examples of the boundary layer under two wave motions are presented here 1 the interaction of long and short oscillatory wave motions and 2 the interaction of a solitary wave with periodic waves the analysis of the two wave motions indicates that nonlinear effects in the rotational solution may be significant even when nonlinear effects in the potential forcing are negligible these results suggest the careful use of the superposition principle in case of interacting two wave motions 
24119,the latest tsunami evacuation maps of hawaii include an extreme scenario triggered by an mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake with large near trench rupture the tectonic plate motion produces concentrated seafloor uplift toward the deepest part of the trench generating a tsunami with strong non hydrostatic characters a parametric study shows the skewed seafloor uplift produces a dispersive leading crest followed by a prominent trough in the form of an n wave the trough maintains its depth across the ocean in the absence of side lobes and dispersion shifting of the uplift toward the trench tends to deepen the trough but has diminishing effects on the wave crest away from the source while the attenuated leading crest produces relatively moderate runup on north facing shores of the hawaiian islands with matching of the n wave and shelf resonance periods the trough produces an impulsive drawdown followed by an energetic upswing with unprecedented runup for a far field tsunami a set of control computations without dispersion reaffirms that a non hydrostatic model is essential to account for these complex wave processes from the source to the shore this case study highlights the unique tsunami hazards posed by the aleutians to hawaii and the role of wave troughs in delineating the impacts for hazard assessment and engineering design keywords shelf resonance dispersion non hydrostatic models tsunamis tsunami drawdown tsunami runup 1 introduction hawaii s mid ocean location makes it susceptible to tsunamis from subduction zones around the pacific rim the aleutians poses the highest threat due to its proximity and location directly due north see fig 1 for location and relief maps there were five statewide destructive tsunamis during the last two centuries and the well documented runup observations had provided the criteria for modeling and mapping of evacuation zones cox 1961 curtis 1991 the 1946 aleutian tsunami was by far the most severe with wide spread damage

the 2011 tohoku tsunami in japan the state of hawaii adopted an mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake for development of an inundation scenario beyond what can be inferred from historical records for emergency management and planning the selected magnitude is conservative but is within the range of 9 2 to 9 6 for potential aleutian earthquakes in the global earthquake model berryman et al 2015 the interconnected insular shelves of hawaii as shown in fig 1b function as a multi modal resonator for tsunami waves across the entire pacific basin bai et al 2015 numerical modeling of recent tsunamis has shown connection of the observed impacts with the earthquake source mechanism through inter island and shelf resonance modes e g cheung et al 2013 lay et al 2013a b bai et al 2014 however the lack of a well defined source hampers any detailed modeling effort to explain the impacts of the 1946 aleutian tsunami in hawaii being from the same segment of the aleutian subduction zone observations of the 1946 tsunami do ominously portend the impacts of one generated by an mw 9 3 earthquake even with proper evacuation of coastal residents such a mega tsunami will be catastrophic to the economy and infrastructure of hawaii understanding of the hazards is imperative for development of response plans and mitigation strategies this paper provides a comparative study through hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of the tsunami from the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario as well as a parametric analysis of the propagation and nearshore processes in relation to the source mechanism the north shores of kauai and oahu which experienced large runup from the 1946 tsunami serve as a case study to elucidate the physical processes and a reference to gauge the severity of the impact for the state 2 non hydrostatic model we utilize neowave of yamazaki et al 2009 2011a for modeling of tsunami generation propagation and inundation the model includes the non hydrostatic pressure and vertical

staggered finite difference scheme integrates the continuity equation 1 for ζ and the hydrostatic terms in the horizontal momentum equations 2 and 3 for u v the shock capturing method of stelling and duinmeijer 2003 which is adapted with a first order upwind scheme for improved stability provides the advection speed for modeling of bores or hydraulic jumps the vertical momentum equation 4 is

the surface elevation ζ from the continuity equation 1 the low order scheme facilitates implementation of two way grid nesting for computation of multi scale nonlinear and dispersive processes without external transfer of initial and boundary conditions neowave has been validated with two dimensional and three dimensional laboratory model experiments by the national tsunami hazard mitigation program for inundation mapping yamazaki et al 2012b a recent benchmarking study has shown that such a low order three dimensional model is superior to high order two dimensional models in describing shear and separation driven currents lynett et al 2017 the vertical velocity term in the non hydrostatic formulation also facilitates modeling of tsunami generation from seafloor deformation with accurate reproduction of observed near and far field tsunami waves e g yamazaki et al 2011b li et al 2016a b bai et al 2017 the most comprehensive field validation comes from data recorded during and after the 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami in which the model results agree with records from 15 near shore buoys adjacent to the earthquake source and runup along 2000 km of east japan coasts yamazaki et al 2013 2018 29 dart stations across the pacific bai et al 2015 six nearshore water level stations and 19 adcps in hawaii waters yamazaki et al 2012a cheung et al 2013 bai and cheung 2016 and a hfdr on the south shore of oahu benjamin et al 2016 reproduction of the diverse datasets from the catastrophic tsunami event reassures neowave s capability in predicting extreme runup from the mw 9 3 aleutian scenario for mitigation planning and emergency management in hawaii 3 model setup and initial conditions modeling of tsunami propagation across the north pacific simultaneously with inundation at hawaii s coastlines requires four levels of two way nested computational grids fig 1 shows the grid systems telescoping to the north shores of kauai and oahu the bathymetry and topography are derived from lidar multibeam and etopo1 data at 1 3 m 50 m and 1 1800 m resolution the level 1 grid describes propagation of the tsunami from the aleutians to hawaii as well as radiation of the incident and scattered waves through the ocean boundaries the 2 3600 m resolution is adequate for the open ocean with large scale features such as the seamounts and fracture zones to the north of hawaii the level 2 grid captures transformation and trapping of tsunami waves along the major hawaiian islands at higher resolution of 24 720 m and serves as a transition to the 3 90 m level 3 grids which resolve standing edge waves over the insular slopes and shelves the shelves exhibit two distinct levels at the 100 and 1000 m contours while steep slopes connect the two levels and the abyssal seafloor at 4000 5000 m depth level 4 grids are placed along the shore and its resolution of 0 3 9 m is needed to depict reefs and channels as well as coastal terrains that can influence the local flow conditions in delineating the inundation the examples at hanalei kauai and haleiwa oahu cover 20 and 14 km of coastlines representative of the tropical environment of hawaii the fringing reefs extend to 20 m depth and the coastal plain is below the 10 m contour where volcanic mountains rise sharply with alternating ridges and gullies bretschneider et al 1986 suggested a manning coefficient of n 0 035 for modeling of the sub grid roughness associated with the nearshore reefs and volcanic substrates neowave describes tsunami generation from a user prescribed fault slip model consisting of the tectonic plate geometries and motions fig 2a illustrates the rupture and earth surface deformation from the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario based on the seismological and historical studies of butler 2012 and butler et al 2014 the aleutian alaska subduction zone between the pacific and north america plates extends 4 130 km from yakataga alaska to komandorsky islands russia berrymen et al 2015 the selected 700 km long segment which saddles between the 1946 and 1957 aleutian earthquakes has insignificant fault displacement in more than a century and tsunami directivity most critical to hawaii the 100 km width of the rupture which comes from the fault geometries and tectonic parameters compiled by gica et al 2008 is consistent with the range of 90 to 115 km estimated for the 1946 and 1957 earthquakes butler 2012 in the absence of a recorded history the scaling to a maximum probable earthquake is based on the 35 m average slip inferred for the largest recorded 1960 earthquake in chile kanamori and cipar 1974 cifuentes 1989 and henry and das 2001 the motion is assumed to be normal to the trench in accordance to the plate convergence along this segment of the subduction zone demets et al 2010 a nominal rigidity of 4 4 10 11 dyne cm2 gives a moment magnitude of 9 3 as a reference for comparison with historical events the current convergence rate of 7 cm year and the preferred coupling coefficient of 0 5 from berrymen et al 2015 suggest a period of 1000 years to accumulate the earthquake energy the slip distribution of a megathrust earthquake especially of this magnitude is non uniform the slip in fig 2a extends 50 km down dip at 50 m and has a smaller value of 20 m in the deeper 50 km segment the pattern with large near trench slip is consistent with the shallow megathrust ruptures inferred for the 1946 and 1957 aleutian earthquakes by von huene et al 2014 and nicolsky et al 2016 respectively as well as the hypothetical mw 9 1 alaska earthquake used in the usgs science application for risk reduction safrr scenario by ross et al 2013 a planar fault model based on the half space solution of okada 1985 defines the elastic crustal deformation from the slip distribution the slip has an average value of 35 m but its non uniform distribution skews the deformation toward the trench this results in large average uplift of 12 8 m and moderate average subsidence of 3 1 m within the rupture zone that are proportionally comparable to the recorded ranges of 3 6 and 1 3 m for the 2011 mw 9 0 tohoku earthquake ito et al 2011 sato et al 2011 simons et al 2011 the average values instead of the maxima are more representative of the resulting tsunami due to dispersion of high frequency components nevertheless the narrow uplift patch adjacent to the deepest part of the trench of 7200 m has significant implications for tsunami generation we consider a control experiment with uniform slip of 35 m over the entire fault as shown in fig 2b the earth surface deformation has 8 1 and 4 8 m of average uplift and subsidence over the rupture region and a more gentle distribution across the continental margin to contrast the model results from the non uniform slip tsunamis generated by large near trench slip can be dispersive making neowave an effective model to describe the pertinent processes lay et al 2013a b li et al 2016a b yamazaki et al 2018 since nonlinear shallow water models remain the primary tool for tsunami hazard assessment and warning guidance products development we consider a second control experiment utilizing the hydrostatic mode of neowave to model inundation for the mw 9 3 aleutian tsunami scenario this is an extension of the comparative study by bai and cheung 2016 who investigated effects of dispersion on surges generated by the 2011 tohoku tsunami at the honolulu coast to a wider parameter space including a catastrophic event the use of the same computational grid system and initial condition allows direct comparison of the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic predictions to isolate effects of dispersion on wave propagation and coastal inundation numerical dispersion is presence in both solutions but plays a secondary role in this inter comparison which focuses on the difference between the two solutions to shed light on practical application for such an extreme event the computation is performed at the mean higher high water mhhw level which is 0 3 m above the mean sea level msl at the honolulu tide gauge as a standard practice for flood hazard mapping and engineering design the tidal currents are typically too weak to modify tsunami propagation around the hawaiian islands and are not considered in this study but might be strong enough to influence inundation around large estuaries and rivers on continental coasts zhang et al 2011 4 tsunami source and dispersion the vertical component of the crustal deformation in the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario defines the initial sea surface elevation for tsunami modeling fig 3 plots the time series and spectra from the non hydrostatic solutions at waypoints across the open ocean see fig 1 for location map waves generated by the subsidence are partly trapped over the shallow continental shelves and those that propagate offshore would lag behind with their amplitude reduced by reverse shoaling on the continental slopes the energetic initial waveform is primarily a result of the energy released by the uplift near the trench the leading crest from the non uniform slip is initially larger and more dispersive due to the skewed uplift but is losing amplitude at a higher rate through generation of a trailing wave train with decreasing period the crest is immediately followed by a prominent trough generated by damped oscillations of the initial sea surface pulse under locally dispersive conditions along the deep trench the resulting profile is analogous to the leading elevation n wave discussed by tadepalli and synolakis 1994 but with a notably larger trough than the crest in contrast to those attributed to the uplift and subsidence profile or the horizontal seafloor displacement e g titov et al 2016 song et al 2008 2017 the trough which becomes more distinct as the dispersed waves lag behind remains relatively stable across the ocean shifting of the slip toward the trench produces a deeper and more impulsive trough but has unnoticeable influence on the leading crest in the far field dispersion appears to have less influence on the trough as detailed features of the uplift would have propagated away along with the leading crest as higher harmonics during the initial sea surface descent the lag time between the crest and trough increases gradually across the ocean reaching approximately 6 min north of hawaii regardless of the slip distributions the uniform and non uniform slip distributions produce comparable waveforms with the same set of spectral peaks despite the notable difference in the initial conditions shown in fig 2 the peak period of 45 min is the primary harmonic associated with the uplift and subsidence across the subduction zone the signal is weak in the time series but its persistence gives rise to the large spectral density the 5 30 min peaks which results from the higher harmonics of the seafloor deformation dominate the initial waveform increasing the slip toward the trench shifts the energy from the 45 min to the 5 30 min components to resolve the skewed seafloor uplift since the wave components reflect primarily the slip distribution the amplitude spectra at the waypoints remain largely unchanged in the hydrostatic predictions shown in fig 4 the waveforms however are uniquely different from the non hydrostatic solution due to phase locking in the non dispersive wave system for the non uniform slip majority of the higher harmonics remain locked with the initial peak resulting in twice the far field amplitude comparing to the non hydrostatic prediction numerical dispersion at the grid resolution of 2 appears to have the most influence on wave components 5 min period or shorter the subtle beat phenomenon in the trailing waves suggests these components are not segregated due to limited resolution of the propagation speed the initial sea surface uplift does develop a moderate trough which is obscured or exaggerated by the short period trailing waves during the trans oceanic propagation both the crest and trough of the n wave are more impulsive and have a lag time of 3 min at vg5 nearest to hawaii versus 6 min from the non hydrostatic solution the uniform slip does not generate an n wave the somewhat obscured gentle trough lagging behind the initial crest is originated from the subsidence over the continental margin the non uniform slip distribution in fig 2a which is more representative of mega aleutian earthquakes as inferred from von huene et al 2014 and nicolsky et al 2016 for the 1946 and 1957 events was used in the inundation mapping for the state of hawaii and is considered in the subsequent comparative study here the corresponding n wave shows similarity with the honolulu tide gauge record of the 1946 aleutian tsunami which includes a gentle leading crest followed by a deep trough approximately 7 min later see appendix a the stretch of north pacific between the aleutians and hawaii has relatively uniform water depth with few islands and atolls that can scatter the tsunami waves see fig 1a the unique waveform with a prominent crest and trough exposes hawaii to energetic initial tsunami waves fig 5 a plots the maximum surface elevations from the non hydrostatic and hydrostatic solutions to demonstrate the manifestation of the skewed seafloor uplift through wave dispersion both solutions show similar patterns of main and side lobes radiating from the tsunami source the leading wave from the non hydrostatic solution attenuates rapidly across the ocean and reduces to 1 8 3 m amplitude 10 km north of the hawaiian islands the larger amplitude off kauai is a result of energy focusing over the musicians seamounts to the north in the absence of dispersion the hydrostatic solution gives larger values of 3 5 m at the same locations the overestimation of the wave amplitude which is appreciable due to limited dispersion of the energetic higher harmonics from the leading crest was also reported in numerical model studies of the 2011 tohoku tsunami generated by an earthquake with large near trench slip e g kirby et al 2013 bai and cheung 2016 baba et al 2017 the effects of dispersion on wave troughs have not been studied to the same extent as the crest the minimum or lowest surface elevation in fig 5b is representative in large part of the depth of the trough immediately behind the leading crest the non hydrostatic solution shows gradual deepening of the trough south of the aleutian trench as the dispersed waves lag behind the trough depth remains relatively uniform across mid ocean albeit with subtle modulations by the surveyor mendocino and murray fracture zones running approximately in the east west direction see fig 1a for location map the depth of 2 4 m off the insular shelves of hawaii are larger compared to the leading crest amplitude at the same locations being generated by damped oscillations of the initial pulse the trough itself is less susceptible to dispersion and is more stable across the ocean due to the absence of short period harmonics the lack of side lobes provides another explanation for the stable trough in constrast to the steadily attenuating leading crest across the ocean this has significant implications for far field tsunami hazards as a trough can be more effective in maintaining the energy level during trans oceanic propagation the hydrostatic solution shows an even more persistent trough away from the source and larger variation of the depth across the main energy lobe compared to the non hydrostatic prediction the slightly deeper abyssal plain east of the musicians seamounts and hawaiian islands enhances numerical dispersion which stands out the trough from short period waves 5 min or less emitted by the leading crest the results still contain numerical artifacts due to the lack of physical dispersion to describe generation of the trough from the concentrated sea surface uplift adjacent to the deep trench of 7200 m 5 tsunami waveform and impact the non hydrostatic solution provides a lucid account of the dispersive leading crest as well as the prominent trough from the large near trench slip of the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario inclusion of the depth integrated vertical velocity and the shock capturing scheme is important for accurate description of tsunami flows over the steep volcanic slopes and abrupt shelf breaks around the major hawaiian islands the 5 30 min tsunami waves associated with the higher harmonics of the source coincide with the standing edge wave modes at the shore cheung et al 2013 significant amplification arises from resonance oscillations over the insular slopes and shelves as illustrated by the computed maximum and minimum surface elevations in fig 6 a the band of heightened surface elevations along the island chain is due to alignment of the broadband 45 min spectral peak with the 43 min inter island resonance mode areas with wide coastal plains will be susceptible to extensive inundation from the long period flows the control test with the hydrostatic calculation shows substantial overestimation of the approaching crest and the response ampitude over the insular shelves as shown by the maximum surface elevation in fig 6b the modulation of the minimum surface elevation in the direction of tsunami propagation becomes more evident due to constructive and destructive interference of the trough by the short period numerically dispersed waves as noted in fig 4 other than that the hydrostatic solution gives rather similar patterns albeit with slightly lower values compared to the non hydrostatic solution the computed surface elevations show the north facing shores experience the most significant impact in the great aleutian tsunami scenario we utilize the high resolution results for kauai and oahu which have distinct insular slope and shelf structures to demonstrate how the unique tsunami waveform exacerbates the impact in the volcanic island environment the north facing shores of kauai have been prone to tsunamis from the aleutians loomis 1976 the insular slope is rather steep reaching 3 10 17 at the 100 m shelf break fig 1c fig 7 a shows a sequence of wave actions from the non hydrostatic solution the crest reaches 8 m elevation over the shelf 4 h and 13 min after the earthquake as the on shore floodwater begins to run up the mountain slopes and inundate the low lying coastal plains the surge on the shelf is subsiding this results in a lag time of the subsequent runup and inundation from the surge on the shelf the trough arrives 6 min after the crest the abrupt increase of the ebb flow over the steep insular slopes generates an impulsive drawdown to 26 m below msl extending beyond the shelf break the potential energy is far greater in level and extent comparing to the initial surge the energetic upswing from the drawdown produces a surge to 23 m elevation over the shelf within 6 min and a second flood wave onto the shores the wider shelf off the west facing shore and its more southerly location lead to a 6 min delay of the initial surge and drawdown sequence but in contrast to the north facing shore the second more energetic surge does not arrive until 10 min afterward the runup reaching 44 m on the north and west facing shores are unprecedented for a far field tsunami the hydrostatic solution in fig 7b infers a different sequence of impacts due to the shorter 3 min lag time of the trough the crest arrives at the same time as in the non hydrostatic solution but reaches much higher elevation of 20 m over the shelf due to its larger amplitude the trough arrives 3 min later amidst the strong receding flow producing a larger but much narrower band of drawdown to 32 m associated with the shorter n wave the subsequent upswings on the north and west facing shores are considerably lower than the initial surge the runup reaching 41 m on the mountain slope is produced by the much larger non dispersive initial surge rather than the upswing from the drawdown as in the non hydrostatic solution the non hydrostatic solution shows the deep trough generated by the near trench slip off the aleutians is the primary source of energy in producing the large runup on kauai the shallow insular shelves and reefs of hawaii are prone to multi scale standing waves which also play a role in the impact of the tsunami even when it is comprised of a crest and a trough cheung et al 2013 extracted the resonance modes from model results of the 2011 tohoku tsunami around the hawaiian islands as shown in fig 8 a the insular shelves of kauai have dominant resonance modes of 11 5 and 14 min with relatively continuous oscillations and 20 5 min with separate antinodes on the west and north shores these resonance modes define the natural response of the nearshore water to large scale excitations despite the gentle rise of the initial surge the local bathymetry controls the receding flow in triggering oscillations over the shelves alignment of the receding flow and the arriving trough combines their energy for the second surge on the north and west shores 6 and 10 min after the drawdown the timing for the upswings corresponds to half cycles of the 11 5 14 and 20 5 min resonance modes the trough from hydrostatic solution has a smaller lag time of 3 min behind the crest the shorter n wave fails to resonate with the 11 5 and 14 min modes on the north facing shore as manifested in the notably smaller extent of the drawdown compared to the shelf width the belated drawdown over the wider shelf on the west does trigger the 20 5 min mode but with a considerably smaller amplitude the trailing dispersed waves below 10 min period in the non hydrostatic solution are known to excite progressive and standing edge waves in the fringing reef environment of hawaii bricker et al 2007 yamazaki et al 2012a b the subsequent oscillations generate persistent strong currents along the coast bai and cheung 2016 but do not contribute to greater runup due to their short periods the wider and concave shelf of north oahu has resonance modes of 22 5 15 and 14 min period with one two and three antinodes as illustrated in fig 8b the well defined nodes in the 14 and 15 min modes indicate an abrupt 180 phase shift that produces swift changes of flow conditions along the shore commonly reported by eyewitnesses the sequence of wave actions from the non hydrostatic solution in fig 9 a shows the leading crest reaching 8 and 6 m elevation on the east and west sides of the shelf at 4 22 and arrival of the trough 6 min later amidst the receding flow from the initial surge the receding flow of various scales takes half of the resonance periods to reach the lowest elevations and does not fully synchronize with the trough arrival the combined effects do augment the drawdown to 18 m over the wide shelf and gentle insular slope the upswing from the rather uniform drawdown triggers the 14 and 22 5 min resonance modes with symmetric standing waves about the central shore the surges to 12 and 16 m elevation on the east and west sides of the shelf 7 min after the maximum drawdown reflect a half cycle of the 14 min mode and the respective antinodes the more energetic antinode on the west side results in 20 m of runup at the adjacent headland the central antinode with a 180 phase shift is masked by the upswing of the 22 5 min mode which subsequently reaches 20 m elevation over the shelf 11 min after the maximum drawdown the runup at the central coast is augmented by the 14 min mode to reach 25 m on the mountain slope in the absence of dispersion the control test in fig 9b gives a more impulsive initial surge to 15 and 12 m over the east and west sides of the shelf the deeper drawdown to 20 m occurs 6 min later from the unsynchronized receding flow and trough arrival the upswing reaches elevations of 9 and 15 m over the east and west sides of the shelf 7 min later the higher initial surge on the east is responsible for the 19 m runup at the adjacent headland but the more energetic second surge on the west gives much higher runup of 33 m on the headland the subsequent oscillations which are dominated by the 14 and 22 5 min resonance modes are very similar to the non hydrostatic solution in accounting for the 25 runup at the central part of the coast the case study has demonstrated the role of n waves in exciting the second surge to substantially higher elevations than the first through resonance of the crest and trough over the insular slope and shelf this highlights the role of energy trapping and resonance oscillations in delineating the overall impact in addition to the persistent surges commonly seen from tsunamis in hawaii bricker et al 2007 yamazaki et al 2012a b cheung et al 2013 bai et al 2014 non hydrostatic modeling can elucidate these intricate generation propagation and runup processes of the mw 9 3 aleutian tsunami scenario but the hydrostatic solution produces comparable trends of the runup except at a few locations as shown in fig 10 a comparison of the vg5 wave spectra from the two solutions in figs 3 and 4 show the very similar distributions and energy levels that define the overall response in the hydrodynamic system this is supported by the findings of bai and cheung 2016 for the surges of the 2011 tohoku tsunami in hawaii waters the phase distribution which determines the waveform and timing produces variations of the impact dependent on the local terrain steep mountain slopes tend to amplify runup from impulsive waves while coastal plains are prone to inundation from persistent onshore flow in general the hydrostatic solution underestimates the runup along most of the north kauai coast because the energetic upswing from the drawdown in the non hydrostatic solution produces a more impulsive surge than the non dispersive leading crest on the steep mountain slope the offset between the n wave and resonance periods on north oahu results in a less impulsive surge from the drawdown with the non hydrostatic solution the non dispersive leading crest in the hydrostatic solution dominates the runup on the east side of the shelf while the drawdown and upswing of the impulsive initial surge produces larger runup on the west such dependence of the runup process on the phase distribution in addition to the spectral content and landform has significant implications for selection of tsunami models for hazard assessment we computed inundation along 1330 km or two third of hawaii s coastlines at 9 m resolution for extreme tsunami scenarios in support of emergency management and hazard mitigation the rests of the coastlines which are uninhabited or uninhabitable were modeled at 90 m resolution through the level 3 grid around each island or island group where applicable the 9 and 90 m data sets have been merged into single map layers in arcgis and kml formats for each of the four counties in hawaii despite the lengthy computation the use of the non hydrostatic mode of neowave ensures adequate reproduction of the physical processes in mapping of the flood hazards the computed runup of the mw 9 3 tsunami scenario has similar features as the records from the five most destructive historical events but is typically two to three times larger as illustrated in fig 10 for the north shores of kauai and oahu these five historical events include the 1946 and 1957 aleutian tsunamis the 1952 kamchatka tsunami the 1960 chile tsunami and the 1964 alaska tsunami with the runup records compiled and collated by walker 2004 from historical documents and archives the modeling effort provided a second set of inundation maps for infrequent and high impact events to supplement the long standing maps inferred from the runup records of the five historical tsunamis three of the four hawaii counties have already developed two tier evacuation maps to systematically account for catastrophic and more frequent tsunami events see https www honolulu gov demevacuate tsunamimaps html for example such development has prompted modification of the operating procedures and data products of the pacific tsunami warning center to differentiate the two categories of events in its advice to the state during a tsunami in progress the two tier evacuation which strikes a balance between public safety and the economic cost of an evacuation provides an effective measure to manage and mitigate tsunami hazards in hawaii 6 conclusions and recommendations the aleutian subduction zone poses the highest tsunami threat to hawaii due to its geometry and propensity for large near trench slip in addition to the directionality and proximity already known to the community the fault geometry defines the spectral contents of the tsunami earthquake rupture extending to the trench will generate tsunamis with a 45 min broadband spectral peak which coincides with the most energetic interisland resonance mode amplifying and sustaining large scale oscillations along the island chain details of the seafloor uplift would manifest as higher harmonics of the tsunami source with periods from 5 to 30 min matching the shelf and reef resonance modes of the individual islands and producing large runup on steep volcanic slopes the seafloor uplift adjacent to the deepest part of the trench produces a dispersive leading crest followed by a prominent trough in the form of an n wave shifting the slip toward the trench has negligible effects on the leading crest due to enhanced dispersion but markedly increases the depth of the following trough the accompanied energy transfer from the 45 min component to the higher harmonics and dispersive waves poses increasing danger to areas with narrow insular shelves this study has elucidated the generation of n waves with a deep following trough from large near trench slip and the corresponding impact in the insular environment of hawaii both the crest and trough of an n wave are equal means of energy transmission from the source to the far field the absence of islands and atolls between the aleutians and hawaii helps maintain this unique and high impact waveform across the open ocean the trough which has a relatively stable depth due to the lack of dispersion and side lobes can maintain a high level of energy across the ocean and serve as a determining factor of coastal impacts although the impact from the leading crest might be moderate alignment of the dominant tsunami and resonance periods combines the energy of the crest and trough to produce devastating impacts normally observed in the near field the impulsive drawdown can create excessive pore water pressure in sediment causing damage to coastal and telecommunication infrastructure a non hydrostatic model with multiple levels of two way nested grids can adequately describe the propagation of such tsunami across the ocean from the earthquake source and delineate the inundation for emergency management or infrastructure design for local site specific analysis an n wave with a leading crest can define the input conditions at the offshore boundary or wave generator e g rossetto et al 2011 chock 2016 gao et al 2017 such analysis where appropriate should include the continental or insular slope and shelf to fully realize the combined impact of the crest and trough at the shore the tsunami crest and trough can both contribute to a single surge producing large runup when the wave periods coincide with the local resonance modes however the offshore wave crest amplitude estimated from non dispersive shallow water models has been a primary proxy for warning guidance and probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment e g whitmore 2003 selva et al 2016 chock 2016 overestimation of the crest amplitude is substantial especially in the far field and might need reconcillation in the implementation for local site specific analysis it is also a common practice to use the maximum surface elevation as an indication of tsunami energy attenuation across the ocean in research papers and public information announcements this might be adequate under most situations where the crest amplitude is larger than the trough depth a notable exception would be tsunami n waves generated by mega aleutian earthquakes with large near trench slip in that the trough can carry considerably more energy across the ocean than the crest non hydrostatic modeling of tsunamis from the source to the shore and the use of the maximum wave height between successive crests and troughs as a proxy in local analysis will be more appropriate for engineering design emergency response and hazard assessment

example of a tsunami earthquake which generates a tsunami much larger than what is inferred from the earthquake magnitude kanamori 1972 the latest estimate of the moment magnitude is 8 6 okal and hébert 2007 but the resulting tsunami produced runup reaching 35 m on unimak island immediately landward of the source and 16 m in hawaii 3500 km away lander 1996 walker 2004 the recorded signal at the honolulu tide gauge first reported by green 1946 and reproduced in figure a1 shows a gentle crest followed by a prominent trough 7 min later in the form of an n wave the wave height is moderate due to the leeward location of the tide gauge but there are reports of local flooding on the honolulu coast studies using hydrostatic models have been able to match the leading crest through tweaking of the earthquake source or inversion of recorded tsunami waveforms but could not reproduce the prominent trough at the same time e g johnson and satake 1997 johnson 1998 a non hydrostatic or boussinesq type model is necessary to reproduce the full record at the honolulu tide gauge tanioka and seno 2001 
24119,the latest tsunami evacuation maps of hawaii include an extreme scenario triggered by an mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake with large near trench rupture the tectonic plate motion produces concentrated seafloor uplift toward the deepest part of the trench generating a tsunami with strong non hydrostatic characters a parametric study shows the skewed seafloor uplift produces a dispersive leading crest followed by a prominent trough in the form of an n wave the trough maintains its depth across the ocean in the absence of side lobes and dispersion shifting of the uplift toward the trench tends to deepen the trough but has diminishing effects on the wave crest away from the source while the attenuated leading crest produces relatively moderate runup on north facing shores of the hawaiian islands with matching of the n wave and shelf resonance periods the trough produces an impulsive drawdown followed by an energetic upswing with unprecedented runup for a far field tsunami a set of control computations without dispersion reaffirms that a non hydrostatic model is essential to account for these complex wave processes from the source to the shore this case study highlights the unique tsunami hazards posed by the aleutians to hawaii and the role of wave troughs in delineating the impacts for hazard assessment and engineering design keywords shelf resonance dispersion non hydrostatic models tsunamis tsunami drawdown tsunami runup 1 introduction hawaii s mid ocean location makes it susceptible to tsunamis from subduction zones around the pacific rim the aleutians poses the highest threat due to its proximity and location directly due north see fig 1 for location and relief maps there were five statewide destructive tsunamis during the last two centuries and the well documented runup observations had provided the criteria for modeling and mapping of evacuation zones cox 1961 curtis 1991 the 1946 aleutian tsunami was by far the most severe with wide spread damage across the state and runup reaching 10 4 and 13 7 m on north oahu and kauai loomis 1976 walker 2004 damage reports allude to highly energetic flows at the shore despite observed gentle initial rise of the sea surface shepard et al 1949 the tsunami produced extensive inundation and carried coral blocks as large as 3 6 m diameter 150 m inland and withdrawal of the floodwater left a riverbed almost dry for 150 m inland on kauai while the source mechanism and observed impacts have been a subject of debate e g johnson and satake 1997 fryer et al 2004 rathburn et al 2009 okal and hébert 2007 inferred a triggering earthquake of mw 8 6 from modeling of tsunami runup observations in south pacific islands re examination of the historical earthquakes and geodetic records shows potential of mw 9 events with significant implications for tsunami hazards across the pacific basin butler 2012 ryan et al 2012 this is substantiated by witter et al 2016 who reported six distinct marine deposits in the aleutians that can be attributed to large tsunamis occurring every 300 to 340 years during the last 1700 years butler et al 2014 inferred an mw 9 25 aleutian earthquake from global seismicity and instrumentally recorded events as a worse case scenario for hawaii numerical modeling of the tsunami shows overtopping of a sinkhole at 10 m elevation on kauai s south shore that contains a thick marine deposit dating back 1425 1665 burney et al 2001 in comparison the recorded runup from the 1946 aleutian tsunami reached 2 4 m around the area walker 2004 prompted by the devastating impacts of the 2011 tohoku tsunami in japan the state of hawaii adopted an mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake for development of an inundation scenario beyond what can be inferred from historical records for emergency management and planning the selected magnitude is conservative but is within the range of 9 2 to 9 6 for potential aleutian earthquakes in the global earthquake model berryman et al 2015 the interconnected insular shelves of hawaii as shown in fig 1b function as a multi modal resonator for tsunami waves across the entire pacific basin bai et al 2015 numerical modeling of recent tsunamis has shown connection of the observed impacts with the earthquake source mechanism through inter island and shelf resonance modes e g cheung et al 2013 lay et al 2013a b bai et al 2014 however the lack of a well defined source hampers any detailed modeling effort to explain the impacts of the 1946 aleutian tsunami in hawaii being from the same segment of the aleutian subduction zone observations of the 1946 tsunami do ominously portend the impacts of one generated by an mw 9 3 earthquake even with proper evacuation of coastal residents such a mega tsunami will be catastrophic to the economy and infrastructure of hawaii understanding of the hazards is imperative for development of response plans and mitigation strategies this paper provides a comparative study through hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of the tsunami from the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario as well as a parametric analysis of the propagation and nearshore processes in relation to the source mechanism the north shores of kauai and oahu which experienced large runup from the 1946 tsunami serve as a case study to elucidate the physical processes and a reference to gauge the severity of the impact for the state 2 non hydrostatic model we utilize neowave of yamazaki et al 2009 2011a for modeling of tsunami generation propagation and inundation the model includes the non hydrostatic pressure and vertical velocity in lieu of high order derivatives as in boussinesq type equations to account for wave dispersion bai et al 2018 let r ω and g denote the earth radius angular velocity and gravitational acceleration ρ the water density and n the manning coefficient for bottom roughness the evolution of the flow in time t over varying depth d follows the continuity equation and the momentum equations

reduce to the nonlinear shallow water equations a semi implicit approach evaluates the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic components sequentially from the governing equations zijlema and stelling 2008 a staggered finite difference scheme integrates the continuity equation 1 for ζ and the hydrostatic terms in the horizontal momentum equations 2 and 3 for u v the shock capturing method of stelling and duinmeijer 2003 which is adapted with a first order upwind scheme for improved stability provides the advection speed for modeling of bores or hydraulic jumps the vertical momentum equation 4 is

implicitly from the vertical momentum equations 4 via a poisson equation the horizontal velocity u v is then updated from integration of the non hydrostatic terms in the momentum equations 2 and 3 and the surface elevation ζ from the continuity equation 1 the low order scheme facilitates implementation of two way grid nesting for computation of multi scale nonlinear and dispersive processes without external transfer of initial and boundary conditions neowave has been validated with two dimensional and three dimensional laboratory model experiments by the national tsunami hazard mitigation program for inundation mapping yamazaki et al 2012b a recent benchmarking study has shown that such a low order three dimensional model is superior to high order two dimensional models in describing shear and separation driven currents lynett et al 2017 the vertical velocity term in the non hydrostatic formulation also facilitates modeling of tsunami generation from seafloor deformation with accurate reproduction of observed near and far field tsunami waves e g yamazaki et al 2011b li et al 2016a b bai et al 2017 the most comprehensive field validation comes from data recorded during and after the 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami in which the model results agree with records from 15 near shore buoys adjacent to the earthquake source and runup along 2000 km of east japan coasts yamazaki et al 2013 2018 29 dart stations across the pacific bai et al 2015 six nearshore water level stations and 19 adcps in hawaii waters yamazaki et al 2012a cheung et al 2013 bai and cheung 2016 and a hfdr on the south shore of oahu benjamin et al 2016 reproduction of the diverse datasets from the catastrophic tsunami event reassures neowave s capability in predicting extreme runup from the mw 9 3 aleutian scenario for mitigation planning and emergency management in hawaii 3 model setup and initial conditions modeling of tsunami propagation across the north pacific simultaneously with inundation at hawaii s coastlines requires four levels of two way nested computational grids fig 1 shows the grid systems telescoping to the north shores of kauai and oahu the bathymetry and topography are derived from lidar multibeam and etopo1 data at 1 3 m 50 m and 1 1800 m resolution the level 1 grid describes propagation of the tsunami from the aleutians to hawaii as well as radiation of the incident and scattered waves through the ocean boundaries the 2 3600 m resolution is adequate for the open ocean with large scale features such as the seamounts and fracture zones to the north of hawaii the level 2 grid captures transformation and trapping of tsunami waves along the major hawaiian islands at higher resolution of 24 720 m and serves as a transition to the 3 90 m level 3 grids which resolve standing edge waves over the insular slopes and shelves the shelves exhibit two distinct levels at the 100 and 1000 m contours while steep slopes connect the two levels and the abyssal seafloor at 4000 5000 m depth level 4 grids are placed along the shore and its resolution of 0 3 9 m is needed to depict reefs and channels as well as coastal terrains that can influence the local flow conditions in delineating the inundation the examples at hanalei kauai and haleiwa oahu cover 20 and 14 km of coastlines representative of the tropical environment of hawaii the fringing reefs extend to 20 m depth and the coastal plain is below the 10 m contour where volcanic mountains rise sharply with alternating ridges and gullies bretschneider et al 1986 suggested a manning coefficient of n 0 035 for modeling of the sub grid roughness associated with the nearshore reefs and volcanic substrates neowave describes tsunami generation from a user prescribed fault slip model consisting of the tectonic plate geometries and motions fig 2a illustrates the rupture and earth surface deformation from the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario based on the seismological and historical studies of butler 2012 and butler et al 2014 the aleutian alaska subduction zone between the pacific and north america plates extends 4 130 km from yakataga alaska to komandorsky islands russia berrymen et al 2015 the selected 700 km long segment which saddles between the 1946 and 1957 aleutian earthquakes has insignificant fault displacement in more than a century and tsunami directivity most critical to hawaii the 100 km width of the rupture which comes from the fault geometries and tectonic parameters compiled by gica et al 2008 is consistent with the range of 90 to 115 km estimated for the 1946 and 1957 earthquakes butler 2012 in the absence of a recorded history the scaling to a maximum probable earthquake is based on the 35 m average slip inferred for the largest recorded 1960 earthquake in chile kanamori and cipar 1974 cifuentes 1989 and henry and das 2001 the motion is assumed to be normal to the trench in accordance to the plate convergence along this segment of the subduction zone demets et al 2010 a nominal rigidity of 4 4 10 11 dyne cm2 gives a moment magnitude of 9 3 as a reference for comparison with historical events the current convergence rate of 7 cm year and the preferred coupling coefficient of 0 5 from berrymen et al 2015 suggest a period of 1000 years to accumulate the earthquake energy the slip distribution of a megathrust earthquake especially of this magnitude is non uniform the slip in fig 2a extends 50 km down dip at 50 m and has a smaller value of 20 m in the deeper 50 km segment the pattern with large near trench slip is consistent with the shallow megathrust ruptures inferred for the 1946 and 1957 aleutian earthquakes by von huene et al 2014 and nicolsky et al 2016 respectively as well as the hypothetical mw 9 1 alaska earthquake used in the usgs science application for risk reduction safrr scenario by ross et al 2013 a planar fault model based on the half space solution of okada 1985 defines the elastic crustal deformation from the slip distribution the slip has an average value of 35 m but its non uniform distribution skews the deformation toward the trench this results in large average uplift of 12 8 m and moderate average subsidence of 3 1 m within the rupture zone that are proportionally comparable to the recorded ranges of 3 6 and 1 3 m for the 2011 mw 9 0 tohoku earthquake ito et al 2011 sato et al 2011 simons et al 2011 the average values instead of the maxima are more representative of the resulting tsunami due to dispersion of high frequency components nevertheless the narrow uplift patch adjacent to the deepest part of the trench of 7200 m has significant implications for tsunami generation we consider a control experiment with uniform slip of 35 m over the entire fault as shown in fig 2b the earth surface deformation has 8 1 and 4 8 m of average uplift and subsidence over the rupture region and a more gentle distribution across the continental margin to contrast the model results from the non uniform slip tsunamis generated by large near trench slip can be dispersive making neowave an effective model to describe the pertinent processes lay et al 2013a b li et al 2016a b yamazaki et al 2018 since nonlinear shallow water models remain the primary tool for tsunami hazard assessment and warning guidance products development we consider a second control experiment utilizing the hydrostatic mode of neowave to model inundation for the mw 9 3 aleutian tsunami scenario this is an extension of the comparative study by bai and cheung 2016 who investigated effects of dispersion on surges generated by the 2011 tohoku tsunami at the honolulu coast to a wider parameter space including a catastrophic event the use of the same computational grid system and initial condition allows direct comparison of the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic predictions to isolate effects of dispersion on wave propagation and coastal inundation numerical dispersion is presence in both solutions but plays a secondary role in this inter comparison which focuses on the difference between the two solutions to shed light on practical application for such an extreme event the computation is performed at the mean higher high water mhhw level which is 0 3 m above the mean sea level msl at the honolulu tide gauge as a standard practice for flood hazard mapping and engineering design the tidal currents are typically too weak to modify tsunami propagation around the hawaiian islands and are not considered in this study but might be strong enough to influence inundation around large estuaries and rivers on continental coasts zhang et al 2011 4 tsunami source and dispersion the vertical component of the crustal deformation in the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario defines the initial sea surface elevation for tsunami modeling fig 3 plots the time series and spectra from the non hydrostatic solutions at waypoints across the open ocean see fig 1 for location map waves generated by the subsidence are partly trapped over the shallow continental shelves and those that propagate offshore would lag behind with their amplitude reduced by reverse shoaling on the continental slopes the energetic initial waveform is primarily a result of the energy released by the uplift near the trench the leading crest from the non uniform slip is initially larger and more dispersive due to the skewed uplift but is losing amplitude at a higher rate through generation of a trailing wave train with decreasing period the crest is immediately followed by a prominent trough generated by damped oscillations of the initial sea surface pulse under locally dispersive conditions along the deep trench the resulting profile is analogous to the leading elevation n wave discussed by tadepalli and synolakis 1994 but with a notably larger trough than the crest in contrast to those attributed to the uplift and subsidence profile or the horizontal seafloor displacement e g titov et al 2016 song et al 2008 2017 the trough which becomes more distinct as the dispersed waves lag behind remains relatively stable across the ocean shifting of the slip toward the trench produces a deeper and more impulsive trough but has unnoticeable influence on the leading crest in the far field dispersion appears to have less influence on the trough as detailed features of the uplift would have propagated away along with the leading crest as higher harmonics during the initial sea surface descent the lag time between the crest and trough increases gradually across the ocean reaching approximately 6 min north of hawaii regardless of the slip distributions the uniform and non uniform slip distributions produce comparable waveforms with the same set of spectral peaks despite the notable difference in the initial conditions shown in fig 2 the peak period of 45 min is the primary harmonic associated with the uplift and subsidence across the subduction zone the signal is weak in the time series but its persistence gives rise to the large spectral density the 5 30 min peaks which results from the higher harmonics of the seafloor deformation dominate the initial waveform increasing the slip toward the trench shifts the energy from the 45 min to the 5 30 min components to resolve the skewed seafloor uplift since the wave components reflect primarily the slip distribution the amplitude spectra at the waypoints remain largely unchanged in the hydrostatic predictions shown in fig 4 the waveforms however are uniquely different from the non hydrostatic solution due to phase locking in the non dispersive wave system for the non uniform slip majority of the higher harmonics remain locked with the initial peak resulting in twice the far field amplitude comparing to the non hydrostatic prediction numerical dispersion at the grid resolution of 2 appears to have the most influence on wave components 5 min period or shorter the subtle beat phenomenon in the trailing waves suggests these components are not segregated due to limited resolution of the propagation speed the initial sea surface uplift does develop a moderate trough which is obscured or exaggerated by the short period trailing waves during the trans oceanic propagation both the crest and trough of the n wave are more impulsive and have a lag time of 3 min at vg5 nearest to hawaii versus 6 min from the non hydrostatic solution the uniform slip does not generate an n wave the somewhat obscured gentle trough lagging behind the initial crest is originated from the subsidence over the continental margin the non uniform slip distribution in fig 2a which is more representative of mega aleutian earthquakes as inferred from von huene et al 2014 and nicolsky et al 2016 for the 1946 and 1957 events was used in the inundation mapping for the state of hawaii and is considered in the subsequent comparative study here the corresponding n wave shows similarity with the honolulu tide gauge record of the 1946 aleutian tsunami which includes a gentle leading crest followed by a deep trough approximately 7 min later see appendix a the stretch of north pacific between the aleutians and hawaii has relatively uniform water depth with few islands and atolls that can scatter the tsunami waves see fig 1a the unique waveform with a prominent crest and trough exposes hawaii to energetic initial tsunami waves fig 5 a plots the maximum surface elevations from the non hydrostatic and hydrostatic solutions to demonstrate the manifestation of the skewed seafloor uplift through wave dispersion both solutions show similar patterns of main and side lobes radiating from the tsunami source the leading wave from the non hydrostatic solution attenuates rapidly across the ocean and reduces to 1 8 3 m amplitude 10 km north of the hawaiian islands the larger amplitude off kauai is a result of energy focusing over the musicians seamounts to the north in the absence of dispersion the hydrostatic solution gives larger values of 3 5 m at the same locations the overestimation of the wave amplitude which is appreciable due to limited dispersion of the energetic higher harmonics from the leading crest was also reported in numerical model studies of the 2011 tohoku tsunami generated by an earthquake with large near trench slip e g kirby et al 2013 bai and cheung 2016 baba et al 2017 the effects of dispersion on wave troughs have not been studied to the same extent as the crest the minimum or lowest surface elevation in fig 5b is representative in large part of the depth of the trough immediately behind the leading crest the non hydrostatic solution shows gradual deepening of the trough south of the aleutian trench as the dispersed waves lag behind the trough depth remains relatively uniform across mid ocean albeit with subtle modulations by the surveyor mendocino and murray fracture zones running approximately in the east west direction see fig 1a for location map the depth of 2 4 m off the insular shelves of hawaii are larger compared to the leading crest amplitude at the same locations being generated by damped oscillations of the initial pulse the trough itself is less susceptible to dispersion and is more stable across the ocean due to the absence of short period harmonics the lack of side lobes provides another explanation for the stable trough in constrast to the steadily attenuating leading crest across the ocean this has significant implications for far field tsunami hazards as a trough can be more effective in maintaining the energy level during trans oceanic propagation the hydrostatic solution shows an even more persistent trough away from the source and larger variation of the depth across the main energy lobe compared to the non hydrostatic prediction the slightly deeper abyssal plain east of the musicians seamounts and hawaiian islands enhances numerical dispersion which stands out the trough from short period waves 5 min or less emitted by the leading crest the results still contain numerical artifacts due to the lack of physical dispersion to describe generation of the trough from the concentrated sea surface uplift adjacent to the deep trench of 7200 m 5 tsunami waveform and impact the non hydrostatic solution provides a lucid account of the dispersive leading crest as well as the prominent trough from the large near trench slip of the mw 9 3 aleutian earthquake scenario inclusion of the depth integrated vertical velocity and the shock capturing scheme is important for accurate description of tsunami flows over the steep volcanic slopes and abrupt shelf breaks around the major hawaiian islands the 5 30 min tsunami waves associated with the higher harmonics of the source coincide with the standing edge wave modes at the shore cheung et al 2013 significant amplification arises from resonance oscillations over the insular slopes and shelves as illustrated by the computed maximum and minimum surface elevations in fig 6 a the band of heightened surface elevations along the island chain is due to alignment of the broadband 45 min spectral peak with the 43 min inter island resonance mode areas with wide coastal plains will be susceptible to extensive inundation from the long period flows the control test with the hydrostatic calculation shows substantial overestimation of the approaching crest and the response ampitude over the insular shelves as shown by the maximum surface elevation in fig 6b the modulation of the minimum surface elevation in the direction of tsunami propagation becomes more evident due to constructive and destructive interference of the trough by the short period numerically dispersed waves as noted in fig 4 other than that the hydrostatic solution gives rather similar patterns albeit with slightly lower values compared to the non hydrostatic solution the computed surface elevations show the north facing shores experience the most significant impact in the great aleutian tsunami scenario we utilize the high resolution results for kauai and oahu which have distinct insular slope and shelf structures to demonstrate how the unique tsunami waveform exacerbates the impact in the volcanic island environment the north facing shores of kauai have been prone to tsunamis from the aleutians loomis 1976 the insular slope is rather steep reaching 3 10 17 at the 100 m shelf break fig 1c fig 7 a shows a sequence of wave actions from the non hydrostatic solution the crest reaches 8 m elevation over the shelf 4 h and 13 min after the earthquake as the on shore floodwater begins to run up the mountain slopes and inundate the low lying coastal plains the surge on the shelf is subsiding this results in a lag time of the subsequent runup and inundation from the surge on the shelf the trough arrives 6 min after the crest the abrupt increase of the ebb flow over the steep insular slopes generates an impulsive drawdown to 26 m below msl extending beyond the shelf break the potential energy is far greater in level and extent comparing to the initial surge the energetic upswing from the drawdown produces a surge to 23 m elevation over the shelf within 6 min and a second flood wave onto the shores the wider shelf off the west facing shore and its more southerly location lead to a 6 min delay of the initial surge and drawdown sequence but in contrast to the north facing shore the second more energetic surge does not arrive until 10 min afterward the runup reaching 44 m on the north and west facing shores are unprecedented for a far field tsunami the hydrostatic solution in fig 7b infers a different sequence of impacts due to the shorter 3 min lag time of the trough the crest arrives at the same time as in the non hydrostatic solution but reaches much higher elevation of 20 m over the shelf due to its larger amplitude the trough arrives 3 min later amidst the strong receding flow producing a larger but much narrower band of drawdown to 32 m associated with the shorter n wave the subsequent upswings on the north and west facing shores are considerably lower than the initial surge the runup reaching 41 m on the mountain slope is produced by the much larger non dispersive initial surge rather than the upswing from the drawdown as in the non hydrostatic solution the non hydrostatic solution shows the deep trough generated by the near trench slip off the aleutians is the primary source of energy in producing the large runup on kauai the shallow insular shelves and reefs of hawaii are prone to multi scale standing waves which also play a role in the impact of the tsunami even when it is comprised of a crest and a trough cheung et al 2013 extracted the resonance modes from model results of the 2011 tohoku tsunami around the hawaiian islands as shown in fig 8 a the insular shelves of kauai have dominant resonance modes of 11 5 and 14 min with relatively continuous oscillations and 20 5 min with separate antinodes on the west and north shores these resonance modes define the natural response of the nearshore water to large scale excitations despite the gentle rise of the initial surge the local bathymetry controls the receding flow in triggering oscillations over the shelves alignment of the receding flow and the arriving trough combines their energy for the second surge on the north and west shores 6 and 10 min after the drawdown the timing for the upswings corresponds to half cycles of the 11 5 14 and 20 5 min resonance modes the trough from hydrostatic solution has a smaller lag time of 3 min behind the crest the shorter n wave fails to resonate with the 11 5 and 14 min modes on the north facing shore as manifested in the notably smaller extent of the drawdown compared to the shelf width the belated drawdown over the wider shelf on the west does trigger the 20 5 min mode but with a considerably smaller amplitude the trailing dispersed waves below 10 min period in the non hydrostatic solution are known to excite progressive and standing edge waves in the fringing reef environment of hawaii bricker et al 2007 yamazaki et al 2012a b the subsequent oscillations generate persistent strong currents along the coast bai and cheung 2016 but do not contribute to greater runup due to their short periods the wider and concave shelf of north oahu has resonance modes of 22 5 15 and 14 min period with one two and three antinodes as illustrated in fig 8b the well defined nodes in the 14 and 15 min modes indicate an abrupt 180 phase shift that produces swift changes of flow conditions along the shore commonly reported by eyewitnesses the sequence of wave actions from the non hydrostatic solution in fig 9 a shows the leading crest reaching 8 and 6 m elevation on the east and west sides of the shelf at 4 22 and arrival of the trough 6 min later amidst the receding flow from the initial surge the receding flow of various scales takes half of the resonance periods to reach the lowest elevations and does not fully synchronize with the trough arrival the combined effects do augment the drawdown to 18 m over the wide shelf and gentle insular slope the upswing from the rather uniform drawdown triggers the 14 and 22 5 min resonance modes with symmetric standing waves about the central shore the surges to 12 and 16 m elevation on the east and west sides of the shelf 7 min after the maximum drawdown reflect a half cycle of the 14 min mode and the respective antinodes the more energetic antinode on the west side results in 20 m of runup at the adjacent headland the central antinode with a 180 phase shift is masked by the upswing of the 22 5 min mode which subsequently reaches 20 m elevation over the shelf 11 min after the maximum drawdown the runup at the central coast is augmented by the 14 min mode to reach 25 m on the mountain slope in the absence of dispersion the control test in fig 9b gives a more impulsive initial surge to 15 and 12 m over the east and west sides of the shelf the deeper drawdown to 20 m occurs 6 min later from the unsynchronized receding flow and trough arrival the upswing reaches elevations of 9 and 15 m over the east and west sides of the shelf 7 min later the higher initial surge on the east is responsible for the 19 m runup at the adjacent headland but the more energetic second surge on the west gives much higher runup of 33 m on the headland the subsequent oscillations which are dominated by the 14 and 22 5 min resonance modes are very similar to the non hydrostatic solution in accounting for the 25 runup at the central part of the coast the case study has demonstrated the role of n waves in exciting the second surge to substantially higher elevations than the first through resonance of the crest and trough over the insular slope and shelf this highlights the role of energy trapping and resonance oscillations in delineating the overall impact in addition to the persistent surges commonly seen from tsunamis in hawaii bricker et al 2007 yamazaki et al 2012a b cheung et al 2013 bai et al 2014 non hydrostatic modeling can elucidate these intricate generation propagation and runup processes of the mw 9 3 aleutian tsunami scenario but the hydrostatic solution produces comparable trends of the runup except at a few locations as shown in fig 10 a comparison of the vg5 wave spectra from the two solutions in figs 3 and 4 show the very similar distributions and energy levels that define the overall response in the hydrodynamic system this is supported by the findings of bai and cheung 2016 for the surges of the 2011 tohoku tsunami in hawaii waters the phase distribution which determines the waveform and timing produces variations of the impact dependent on the local terrain steep mountain slopes tend to amplify runup from impulsive waves while coastal plains are prone to inundation from persistent onshore flow in general the hydrostatic solution underestimates the runup along most of the north kauai coast because the energetic upswing from the drawdown in the non hydrostatic solution produces a more impulsive surge than the non dispersive leading crest on the steep mountain slope the offset between the n wave and resonance periods on north oahu results in a less impulsive surge from the drawdown with the non hydrostatic solution the non dispersive leading crest in the hydrostatic solution dominates the runup on the east side of the shelf while the drawdown and upswing of the impulsive initial surge produces larger runup on the west such dependence of the runup process on the phase distribution in addition to the spectral content and landform has significant implications for selection of tsunami models for hazard assessment we computed inundation along 1330 km or two third of hawaii s coastlines at 9 m resolution for extreme tsunami scenarios in support of emergency management and hazard mitigation the rests of the coastlines which are uninhabited or uninhabitable were modeled at 90 m resolution through the level 3 grid around each island or island group where applicable the 9 and 90 m data sets have been merged into single map layers in arcgis and kml formats for each of the four counties in hawaii despite the lengthy computation the use of the non hydrostatic mode of neowave ensures adequate reproduction of the physical processes in mapping of the flood hazards the computed runup of the mw 9 3 tsunami scenario has similar features as the records from the five most destructive historical events but is typically two to three times larger as illustrated in fig 10 for the north shores of kauai and oahu these five historical events include the 1946 and 1957 aleutian tsunamis the 1952 kamchatka tsunami the 1960 chile tsunami and the 1964 alaska tsunami with the runup records compiled and collated by walker 2004 from historical documents and archives the modeling effort provided a second set of inundation maps for infrequent and high impact events to supplement the long standing maps inferred from the runup records of the five historical tsunamis three of the four hawaii counties have already developed two tier evacuation maps to systematically account for catastrophic and more frequent tsunami events see https www honolulu gov demevacuate tsunamimaps html for example such development has prompted modification of the operating procedures and data products of the pacific tsunami warning center to differentiate the two categories of events in its advice to the state during a tsunami in progress the two tier evacuation which strikes a balance between public safety and the economic cost of an evacuation provides an effective measure to manage and mitigate tsunami hazards in hawaii 6 conclusions and recommendations the aleutian subduction zone poses the highest tsunami threat to hawaii due to its geometry and propensity for large near trench slip in addition to the directionality and proximity already known to the community the fault geometry defines the spectral contents of the tsunami earthquake rupture extending to the trench will generate tsunamis with a 45 min broadband spectral peak which coincides with the most energetic interisland resonance mode amplifying and sustaining large scale oscillations along the island chain details of the seafloor uplift would manifest as higher harmonics of the tsunami source with periods from 5 to 30 min matching the shelf and reef resonance modes of the individual islands and producing large runup on steep volcanic slopes the seafloor uplift adjacent to the deepest part of the trench produces a dispersive leading crest followed by a prominent trough in the form of an n wave shifting the slip toward the trench has negligible effects on the leading crest due to enhanced dispersion but markedly increases the depth of the following trough the accompanied energy transfer from the 45 min component to the higher harmonics and dispersive waves poses increasing danger to areas with narrow insular shelves this study has elucidated the generation of n waves with a deep following trough from large near trench slip and the corresponding impact in the insular environment of hawaii both the crest and trough of an n wave are equal means of energy transmission from the source to the far field the absence of islands and atolls between the aleutians and hawaii helps maintain this unique and high impact waveform across the open ocean the trough which has a relatively stable depth due to the lack of dispersion and side lobes can maintain a high level of energy across the ocean and serve as a determining factor of coastal impacts although the impact from the leading crest might be moderate alignment of the dominant tsunami and resonance periods combines the energy of the crest and trough to produce devastating impacts normally observed in the near field the impulsive drawdown can create excessive pore water pressure in sediment causing damage to coastal and telecommunication infrastructure a non hydrostatic model with multiple levels of two way nested grids can adequately describe the propagation of such tsunami across the ocean from the earthquake source and delineate the inundation for emergency management or infrastructure design for local site specific analysis an n wave with a leading crest can define the input conditions at the offshore boundary or wave generator e g rossetto et al 2011 chock 2016 gao et al 2017 such analysis where appropriate should include the continental or insular slope and shelf to fully realize the combined impact of the crest and trough at the shore the tsunami crest and trough can both contribute to a single surge producing large runup when the wave periods coincide with the local resonance modes however the offshore wave crest amplitude estimated from non dispersive shallow water models has been a primary proxy for warning guidance and probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment e g whitmore 2003 selva et al 2016 chock 2016 overestimation of the crest amplitude is substantial especially in the far field and might need reconcillation in the implementation for local site specific analysis it is also a common practice to use the maximum surface elevation as an indication of tsunami energy attenuation across the ocean in research papers and public information announcements this might be adequate under most situations where the crest amplitude is larger than the trough depth a notable exception would be tsunami n waves generated by mega aleutian earthquakes with large near trench slip in that the trough can carry considerably more energy across the ocean than the crest non hydrostatic modeling of tsunamis from the source to the shore and the use of the maximum wave height between successive crests and troughs as a proxy in local analysis will be more appropriate for engineering design emergency response and hazard assessment

for their constructive criticisms that enhanced the contents and conclusions of this paper soest contribution no 10330 appendix a the 1946 aleutian tsunami the 1946 aleutian earthquake is a classic example of a tsunami earthquake which generates a tsunami much larger than what is inferred from the earthquake magnitude kanamori 1972 the latest estimate of the moment magnitude is 8 6 okal and hébert 2007 but the resulting tsunami produced runup reaching 35 m on unimak island immediately landward of the source and 16 m in hawaii 3500 km away lander 1996 walker 2004 the recorded signal at the honolulu tide gauge first reported by green 1946 and reproduced in figure a1 shows a gentle crest followed by a prominent trough 7 min later in the form of an n wave the wave height is moderate due to the leeward location of the tide gauge but there are reports of local flooding on the honolulu coast studies using hydrostatic models have been able to match the leading crest through tweaking of the earthquake source or inversion of recorded tsunami waveforms but could not reproduce the prominent trough at the same time e g johnson and satake 1997 johnson 1998 a non hydrostatic or boussinesq type model is necessary to reproduce the full record at the honolulu tide gauge tanioka and seno 2001
