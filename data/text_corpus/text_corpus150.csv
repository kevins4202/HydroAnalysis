750,fines migration is considered one of the mechanisms of permeability alteration associated with water injection in aquifers and oil reservoirs however there has been limited direct evidence of fines migration this paper presents conclusive evidence for the migration and capture of fines obtained from experiments utilising 3d micro ct imaging a single phase flooding experiment was performed on a berea sandstone core plug first a micro ct image of the dry core plug was taken before flooding then the core plug was saturated with 4 nacl brine further injected with 4 nacl brine and finally flushed with fresh water the pressure difference across the core plug was monitored during these fluid injections and produced water samples were analysed for fines concentration and type by combining particle counting methods and scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds analysis after the flooding experiment the core plug was reimaged and the second micro ct image was compared to the first to quantify the fines migration laboratory measurements showed an 80 decrease in permeability during fresh water injection which was accompanied by a large concentration of fines in the produced water samples sem eds analysis of those fines showed them to be clay comparison of initial and final tomogram images showed increased micro ct intensity in the flow direction near the core outlet due to relocation of clay permeability computations made on micro ct images showed a 50 decrease in permeability during fresh water injection due to fines straining near the core outlet

hydraulic connectivity chrysikopoulos et al 2009 many approaches have been developed to depress fines migration thomas and crowe 1981 dria et al 1988 huang et al 2002 habibi et al 2012 yuan et al 2016 yuan 2017 yuan and moghanloo 2017 and thereby reduce the detrimental effects of fines induced permeability decline on well productivity and injectivity the above studies have been conducted to better understand fines migration under various conditions the current paper focuses on fines migration effects associated with fines detachment due to decrease in ionic strength of the reservoir water martin 1959 studied waterflooding in core samples containing clays he observed that low salinity water injection resulted in additional recovery which he attributed to clay swelling and emulsification khilar and fogler 1984 found that if the salinity of the injected brine fell below a critical salt concentration clay fines were mobilized causing pore blockage and subsequent reduction in permeability permeability reduction during fines migration was confirmed by sarkar and sharma 1990 tang and morrow 1999 hussain et al 2013 guo et al 2016 and al yaseri et al 2016 fogden et al 2011 and kumar et al 2011 found that high resolution images from a scanning electron microscope sem and field emission scanning electron microscope fesem showed mobilization of mixed wet kaolinite particles al yaseri et al 2017 and othman et al 2018 observed production of quartz and kaolinite during co2 injection in berea sandstone fines migration in porous media has been mathematically modeled by bradford et al 2003 cvetkovic et al 2004 lemon et al 2011 cvetkovic and frampton 2012 zeinijahromi et al 2013 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 and chrysikopoulos et al 2017 the traditional mathematical model for fines migration in porous media assumes the kinetic equation for detaching rate which is proportional to the difference between the current and equilibrium values of variables such as velocity ionic strength ph attached fines concentration and temperature bradford et al 2003 cvetkovic et al 2004 cvetkovic and frampton 2012 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 and chrysikopoulos et al 2017 however the traditional model fails to reflect the instant permeability response to variation in these variables which has been observed in many laboratory tests ochi and vernoux 1998 the traditional model also fails to capture the microscale condition of mechanical equilibrium for particles yet the mechanical equilibrium condition for an attached particle subject to electrostatic and drag forces implies the existence of so called maximum retention concentration as a function of velocity ionic strength and temperature the maximum retention function is derived from the particle torque balance condition bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 thus the maximum retention function as a model for particle detachment is free of the above mentioned shortcomings and is used in the present study the analytical models for fines migration using the maximum retention function as a model for fine particle detachment encompass high concentration fines transport yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 axi symmetric flow towards well you et al 2015 two

the rock and fluid properties section 2 2 describes the micro ct imaging section 2 3 presents the methodology of the flow experiment 2 1 rock and fluid systems the experiment used a berea sandstone core plug of 5 mm diameter and 15 mm length we selected a small core plug to achieve high micro ct resolution mineral identification and quantification were performed using x ray diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf on berea sandstone and the result is presented in table 1 pore volume of the core was measured gravimetrically using the brine saturated and dry core weights porosity was calculated by dividing pore volume by bulk volume the latter of which was calculated using core plug dimensions initial permeability was measured by injecting 4 nacl brine porosity and initial measured permeability of the core plug were 24 3 and 1560 mdarcy respectively ultra pure deaerated milliq water was used to prepare brine for the experiment 4 nacl brine and milliq water were used as injection fluids 2 2 micro ct imaging before the experiment the core plug was imaged on the tyree micro ct facility at unsw sydney double helical scanning mode was applied for exact 3d reconstruction which allows imaging of the whole core plug the micro ct facility consists of a high resolution 180 kv sub µm x ray source with varian 4343cb flat panel detector 3072 3072 pixels 3 75 frames s readout rate the facility is housed in a lead lined room with stringent temperature and humidity control images were obtained with x ray energy of 100 kv applying a 2 mm aluminium filter and collecting 3 images per rotation angle and exposure time of 1 s image acquisition took about 20 h in double helix mode and the resulting raw projection data sum to about 438 gb a long image acquisition time was set to obtain a high signal to noise ratio snr while keeping the desired spatial resolution jin et al 2015 feali et al 2012 snr was 10 3 for micro ct scan before the experiment 3d tomographic reconstruction was carried out on the australian national computing infrastructure nci utilizing about 1 tb of memory in parallel processing and 384 processors the voxel size was 2 33 µm further details of imaging and reconstruction methodologies can be found in varslot et al 2011 and sheppard et al 2014 2 3 flow experiment after the first micro ct image was taken the core plug was saturated with 4 nacl brine the core plug was then mounted in a hassler core holder figure 1 a brine at the same concentration was injected through the core plug at a constant flow rate of 3 ml h and the pressure difference across the core was continuously recorded using an accurate pressure transducer 0 005 psi after 75 pore volumes of 4 nacl brine were injected 4555 pore volumes of fresh water were injected over 4 days produced water samples were collected continuously to characterize the produced fines the concentration of fines in the produced water was measured by a spectrex pc2200 laser particle counter then each produced water sample was filtered to separate the produced fines fig 1b the separated fines were then analysed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray sem eds spectroscopy after the experiment the core plug used for the laboratory measurement was re imaged and registered with the first image using the method described in latham et al 2008 and kumar 2009 3 results this section presents the results section 3 1 presents measured permeability during the flow experiment section 3 2 presents mineral and chemical characterisation of the produced clay fines section 3 3 presents segmentation of ct images section 3 4 presents permeability calculations based on ct images 3 1 permeability measurement permeability during the flow experiment is shown in fig 2 a it decreased by about 80 between the initial injection of high salinity water and the final injection of fresh water this is less severe than the 90 decrease found in hussain et al 2013 however this might be because the core plug used in this study was much smaller some of the mobilized particles were strained in core plug pores along the core plug length while the rest exited the core plug with produced water a shorter core means that chances of straining are lower permeability damage due to fines migration can be explained by analysing the force balance acting on fines zeinijahromi et al 2013 a fine particle on a rock surface is subject to drag fd lift fl electrostatic force fe and gravity fg zeinijahromi et al 2013 introduced a ratio ε between the attaching and detaching torques eq 1 1 ɛ l d l n f d u f l u f e f g where u is the darcy velocity and ld and ln are the levers of the drag and normal force respectively during the current experiment when the salinity of injected water was reduced electrostatic force was also reduced which can mobilize particles permeability damage should stabilize after 1 pore volume of fresh water injection bedrikovetsky et al 2011 however permeability became constant in the present study only after injecting almost 2000 pore volumes of fresh water figure 2a the stabilization delay has been attributed to the slow drift of the mobilized fines near the pore walls oliveira et al 2014 yang et al 2016 following oliveira et al 2014 ratio between average particle velocity and water flow velocity is 0 0005 1 2000 the mobilized particle velocity us is much smaller than the bulk velocity of the fluids u 3 2 characterization of produced fines the particle counter used in this study could not count fines smaller than 3 µm in diameter therefore the fines concentration is qualitative only high fines concentration occurring between 85 and 1200 pore volumes which involved fresh water injection is consistent with the 70 permeability drop during this period fig 2 however the two produced water samples collected between 2500 and 3500 pore volumes show high concentrations of fines but no permeability drop occurred during this period the ph of injected water was measured to be between 6 0 and 7 0 mostly the ph of produced water was same as injected water but occasionally it increased up to 7 5 the ph of the flowing water can increase due to dissolution of intergranular minerals mcguire et al 2005 austad 2013 mohan et al 1993 this increase in ph can mobilize fines austad 2013 noticeable increase in fines concentration at 1000 and 2400 pvi was accompanied by a corresponding increase in ph fig 2b we separated fines from produced water samples using a ptfe membrane fig 1b then more than 300 particles were randomly selected and analyzed using sem eds eds spectrum shows the chemical elements of the scanned particle from which we can determine the particle type kaolinite was identified when ai si and o appeared simultaneously on the spectrum quartz was identified when si and o appeared simultaneously on the spectrum statistics of particles analysed are presented in fig 3 most of the particles produced during high salinity water injection were quartz with a very small amount of clay there is a delay in clay production during early stage of the fresh water injection which further supports the theory of slow drift of the mobilized fines yang et al 2016 during fresh water injection clay fines production reached just over 80 and then reduces to almost 50 with considerable quartz production most of the clay produced during fresh water injection was kaolinite an sem image of quartz particles is given in fig 4 a and the eds spectrum in fig 4b confirms the presence of silicate in fig 5 the eds spectrum of another particle shows the presence of silica and aluminium which confirms that the particle is kaolinite 3 3 registration of micro ct images to analyse the changes in the pore space due to fines migration the second tomogram was registered to the one taken before the flow experiment the registration process aligns the two images at voxel accuracy such that the images overlay with maximal similarity latham et al 2008 fig 6 depicts slices through the registered tomograms before and after the flow experiment the tomograms intensities in the clay region appear to be between grain and pore intensities which is due to the volume of the voxels partially filled with clay the slices show some movement of clays fig 7 shows enlarged images highlighting the changes in the pore space in a few instances especially near the core plug outlet there was an increase in the clay mineral fig 7a and 7b there were several instances near the inlet where clay disappeared in the post test image fig 7c and 7d the images also showed displacement of grains sand fig 7e and 7f near inlet fig 8 a shows the ct intensity profiles of the images before and after the flow experiment near the core plug injection end 3000 to 4000 voxels ct intensity decreased after the flow experiment whereas near the production end 0 to 1000 voxels the intensity increased fig 8b this x ray intensity shift might represent transfer of mass from the injection end of the core plug toward the production end which supports the theory of fines mobilization and subsequent straining 3 4 segmentation of micro ct images the registered tomogram images figs 6 and 7 show high contrast between quartz and pore space but not enough contrast between clay and either quartz or pore space due to partially filled clay voxels to further explain our argument we plot the nominal frequency of x ray intensity of the micro ct image taken before flow experiment fig 9 clay intensities are very similar to grain and pore intensities which makes it difficult to segment clays in tomogram images this was addressed by a semi automatic three step segmentation approach first intensity values near grain and pore boundaries were chosen to separate pore space from grains ignoring the result of clay identification high definite grain intensity and low definite pore intensity thresholds were used to define seed regions these regions were grown using a converging active contour algorithm cac sheppard 2014 next two clay segmentation were performed separately from only the initial grain segmented region and then from only the initial pore segmented region finally the two clay segmentations were merged to form a segmented image of three phases grain pore and clay although considerable sand particles were observed fig 3 the segmented images show no change in grain phase sand from before water injection to after water injection fig 10 a this might mean that the amount of produced sand is negligible compared to the mass of sand present in the core plug there is noticeable decrease and increase in clay phase fraction around the core injection production end respectively fig 10b clay fines mobilize and gets strained in the flow direction which explains the observations in fig 10b the clay migration causes a local increase in porosity near the injection end and a decrease in porosity near the core production end fig 10a to further support this argument fraction of displaced strained and unchanged clay phases are plotted in fig 11 clay phase is being displaced consistently throughout the core length the displaced or migrated clay is continuously being strained the straining is more near the core production end 3 5 image based permeability computations micro ct images can be used to compute various single phase and two phase flow properties arns et al 2004 we computed absolute permeability from the ct images using the methodology described by arns et al 2004 to model the laboratory experiment the lateral surfaces of the cylindrical core plug were set to no flow boundary conditions the fluid pressure gradient along the longitudinal axis of the core plug z direction was modelled by a body force the solid fluid interface was set to no slip boundary condition the navier stokes equation was solved using the lattice boltzmann lb approach martys et al 1999 as a result of mounting the core in the experimental facility the ends of the core plug were damaged fig 12 to exclude the physically damaged part permeability was computed on two subsets of the whole core image fig 12b computations were run for a large cylindrical subset 5 mm diameter 12 mm length which excludes almost 3 mm length of the damaged core plug and a small subset from the middle of the image 2 5 mm 2 5 mm 9 mm permeability prior to the flow experiment was computed on the large subset 1470 mdarcy and found to match the laboratory measurement within the experimental error fig 13 the smaller subset had lower initial permeability 970 mdarcy and does not show any permeability drop after the flow experiment however our previous observations showed that the clay content straining was most likely near the production end of the core plug whereas the subset was taken from the middle of the core plug this is further supported by the computation run on the large subset which showed a 50 decrease in permeability but was less than the laboratory measurement of an 80 decrease in permeability a probable explanation is that the entire core plug is 3 mm longer than is the large subset which also includes the area around the production end where most of the particle straining would be expected to further test this conjecture we ran cluster size analysis on the clay phase knackstedt et al 2007 of our micro ct images figs 14 and 15 3d visualization of the cluster sizes show that numerous clay clusters accumulated near the core production end fig 14 these migrated clays were not captured in the smaller subset 2 5 mm 2 5 mm 9 mm hence no permeability decline was found in the smaller subset computations the cluster analysis also shows that after the injection clay cluster sizes reduced consistently fig 15 which supports the clay leaflets mobilization theory bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 4 mathematical modelling of fines detachment mobilisation migration and straining this section presents the mathematical modelling of the experimental observations made in section 3 section 4 1 presents basic equations and exact solutions for one dimensional flow with fines detachment mobilisation migration and straining section 4 2 presents the comparison between mathematical model and the experimental data 4 1 basic equations and analytical model for fines migration and permeability damage the governing system of fines migration in porous media contains mass balance of suspended and retained particles and the rate equation for particle straining bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 mass balance of detached and attached fines is 2 ϕ s σ c σ t u c f σ x 0 where ϕ is porosity s is accessibility factor c is suspended fines concentration σ is retained fines concentration u is darcy velocity and f is drift delay factor rate of fines straining is defined as 3 σ t λ σ f σ u c where λ is the filtration coefficient darcy s law with permeability as a function of formation damage is 4 u k 0 μ 1 β σ σ p x where k 0 is initial permeability µ is viscosity of water β is the formation damage coefficient and p is the pressure fines rolling speed us at the matrix surface is significantly slower than the carrier water velocity u due to slow drift of fines yuan and shapiro 2010 yuan and shapiro 2011 sefrioui et al 2013 oliveira et al 2014 to model fines velocity drift delay factor is used to account for slow fines migration the constant drift delay factor α was defined as oliveira et al 2014 5 α f s u s u where f is drift delay factor and s is accessibility factor eqs 2 to 4 which reflect slow migration of fines were solved to provide linear and nonlinear solutions yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 both solutions assume constant accessibility factor s and drift delay factor α the langmuir blocking filtration function is applied in both models 6 λ s λ 0 1 s s m where λ is the filtration coefficient λ0 is the initial filtration coefficient s is dimensionless retention concentration and sm is maximum vacancy concentration the linear model assumes a constant filtration coefficient this is because retained fines concentration s is negligible compared with the maximum vacancy concentration sm therefore the filtration coefficient λ λ0 does not change with the fines retention process eq 6 the resultant linear solution is given in eqs 7 and 8 7 s x t s 1 e α λ 0 t x α t s 1 e λ 0 x x α t 8 c x t e λ 0 α t x α t 0 x α t where s is the accessibility factor and c is the dimensionless breakthrough suspended fines concentration eqs 9 and 10 present a non linear model in which filtration coefficient λ decreases as retention concentration s increases 9 s x t λ 0 s e λ 0 λ 0 s m s x 1 λ 0 e λ 0 λ 0

micro ct clay phase analysis fig 11 initial filtration coefficient λ0 maximum vacancy concentration sm and accessibility factor s were tuned to match the experimental data table 2 the nonlinear model of retained fines concentration closely matched our experimental data fig 16 in contrast the linear model did not reflect the experimental trend the matching parameters λ0 sm and s obtained from fig 17 were used to match breakthrough suspended fines concentration fig 17 the constant drift delay factor α u s u was estimated from fig 2a it is estimated from the permeability drop that permeability stabilized at around 2000 pore volumes this means that the ratio of fines velocity us over darcy velocity u 0 0005 hence the value of drift delay factor α as 0 0005 was adopted to get suspended fines concentration again the nonlinear model matched the experimental data the type curves show a concave retention concentration curve and a convex breakthrough suspended fines concentration curve these indicate that filtration coefficient increases during filling retention vacancies from s 0 to s sm yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 sensitivity analyses of the nonlinear model shows that the lower the maximum vacancy concentration sm the higher the constant b the lower the retention profile fig 18 a and the higher the breakthrough fines concentration in the water fig 18b the higher the drift delay factor α the faster the fines move and arrive at the outlet fig 19 5 conclusion and recommendations an integrated coreflooding and micro ct approach has been presented to understand the effect of fines migration on permeability the results show ability of micro ct imaging to investigate fines induced permeability damage during water flow the following conclusions are drawn fresh water injection leads to a sharp increase in clay particle production although sand was produced in both high salinity and fresh water injection no change in resolved sand phase fraction was noted during fresh water injection clay near the injection end of the core plug was mobilized some of this mobilized clay was strained near the production end of the core plug and the rest was produced computations run on a small subset of a micro ct image did not show any permeability damage but computations run on a large subset showed 50 decrease in permeability this shows that the production end of the core plug was damaged due to clay fines straining the computed permeability decrease 50 was less than the laboratory measured permeability decrease 80 which could be attributed to the micro ct computations not being run on the entire core plug analytical modelling showed that retention concentration and breakthrough suspended fines concentration were nonlinear the concave retention concentration and convex breakthrough suspended fines concentration profiles indicate that filtration coefficient increases during the fines retention process the above experimental evidence of fines migration induced permeability damage during fresh water waterflooding supports the mobility control oil recovery mechanism during fines assisted low salinity waterflooding the present study includes measurements of the breakthrough concentration and retention profile along the core breakthrough concentrations are measured by particle counter micro ct imaging provides measurements of retained concentrations pressure measurements require simple and robust equipment providing high accuracy while particle counters and micro ct imaging are cumbersome and expensive with low accuracy of concentration measurements the alternative or complimentary option is the use of pressure difference across the core sections together with the overall pressure difference this so called 3 point pressure method has been successfully developed for characterisation of suspension colloidal transport without detachment bedrikovetsky et al 2001 application of 3 point pressure test for fines migration could simplify the equipment and increase the accuracy of measurements yielding cheaper and more reliable laboratory based and field scale predictions the micro ct imaging approach developed can be extended for two phase and three phase colloidal suspension flow with salinity alteration causing fines detachment mobilisation migration and size exclusion iglauer et al 2011 2015 besides electrostatic and drag forces during two phase transport the attached particles are subject to capillary forces exerting from the menisci between two phases zhang and hassanizadeh 2017 the particles attached to menisci are transported by the phase separating surface which is not determined by the darcy velocity the full system of equations includes maxwell constitutive equations shapiro 2016 2018 during three phase flow fines can be detached by adhesion and drag forces al mansoori et al 2009 the developed laboratory based 1d analytical model for fines migration has been applied for analysis of filed case in bastrykskoye oil reservoir where low salinity water has been injected for enhanced oil recovery purposes ahmetgareev et al 2015 the intensive fines production accompanied incremental oil production close match between the stream line quasi 3d model based on the 1d analytical model and production history has been achieved the methodology developed in this study can be applied to model permeability damage during fresh water storage underground water disposal and oil recovery to simulate permeability damage in a real field experiments should be performed using real formation core

the rock and fluid properties section 2 2 describes the micro ct imaging section 2 3 presents the methodology of the flow experiment 2 1 rock and fluid systems the experiment used a berea sandstone core plug of 5 mm diameter and 15 mm length we selected a small core plug to achieve high micro ct resolution mineral identification and quantification were performed using x ray diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf on berea sandstone and the result is presented in table 1 pore volume of the core was measured gravimetrically using the brine saturated and dry core weights porosity was calculated by dividing pore volume by bulk volume the latter of which was calculated using core plug dimensions initial permeability was measured by injecting 4 nacl brine porosity and initial measured permeability of the core plug were 24 3 and 1560 mdarcy respectively ultra pure deaerated milliq water was used to prepare brine for the experiment 4 nacl brine and milliq water were used as injection fluids 2 2 micro ct imaging before the experiment the core plug was imaged on the tyree micro ct facility at unsw sydney double helical scanning mode was applied for exact 3d reconstruction which allows imaging of the whole core plug the micro ct facility consists of a high resolution 180 kv sub µm x ray source with varian 4343cb flat panel detector 3072 3072 pixels 3 75 frames s readout rate the facility is housed in a lead lined room with stringent temperature and humidity control images were obtained with x ray energy of 100 kv applying a 2 mm aluminium filter and collecting 3 images per rotation angle and exposure time of 1 s image acquisition took about 20 h in double helix mode and the resulting raw projection data sum to about 438 gb a long image acquisition time was set to obtain a high signal to noise ratio snr while keeping the desired spatial resolution jin et al 2015 feali et al 2012 snr was 10 3 for micro ct scan before the experiment 3d tomographic reconstruction was carried out on the australian national computing infrastructure nci utilizing about 1 tb of memory in parallel processing and 384 processors the voxel size was 2 33 µm further details of imaging and reconstruction methodologies can be found in varslot et al 2011 and sheppard et al 2014 2 3 flow experiment after the first micro ct image was taken the core plug was saturated with 4 nacl brine the core plug was then mounted in a hassler core holder figure 1 a brine at the same concentration was injected through the core plug at a constant flow rate of 3 ml h and the pressure difference across the core was continuously recorded using an accurate pressure transducer 0 005 psi after 75 pore volumes of 4 nacl brine were injected 4555 pore volumes of fresh water were injected over 4 days produced water samples were collected continuously to characterize the produced fines the concentration of fines in the produced water was measured by a spectrex pc2200 laser particle counter then each produced water sample was filtered to separate the produced fines fig 1b the separated fines were then analysed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray sem eds spectroscopy after the experiment the core plug used for the laboratory measurement was re imaged and registered with the first image using the method described in latham et al 2008 and kumar 2009 3 results this section presents the results section 3 1 presents measured permeability during the flow experiment section 3 2 presents mineral and chemical characterisation of the produced clay fines section 3 3 presents segmentation of ct images section 3 4 presents permeability calculations based on ct images 3 1 permeability measurement permeability during the flow experiment is shown in fig 2 a it decreased by about 80 between the initial injection of high salinity water and the final injection of fresh water this is less severe than the 90 decrease found in hussain et al 2013 however this might be because the core plug used in this study was much smaller some of the mobilized particles were strained in core plug pores along the core plug length while the rest exited the core plug with produced water a shorter core means that chances of straining are lower permeability damage due to fines migration can be explained by analysing the force balance acting on fines zeinijahromi et al 2013 a fine particle on a rock surface is subject to drag fd lift fl electrostatic force fe and gravity fg zeinijahromi et al 2013 introduced a ratio ε between the attaching and detaching torques eq 1 1 ɛ l d l n f d u f l u f e f g where u is the darcy velocity and ld and ln are the levers of the drag and normal force respectively during the current experiment when the salinity of injected water was reduced electrostatic force was also reduced which can mobilize particles permeability damage should stabilize after 1 pore volume of fresh water injection bedrikovetsky et al 2011 however permeability became constant in the present study only after injecting almost 2000 pore volumes of fresh water figure 2a the stabilization delay has been attributed to the slow drift of the mobilized fines near the pore walls oliveira et al 2014 yang et al 2016 following oliveira et al 2014 ratio between average particle velocity and water flow velocity is 0 0005 1 2000 the mobilized particle velocity us is much smaller than the bulk velocity of the fluids u 3 2 characterization of produced fines the particle counter used in this study could not count fines smaller than 3 µm in diameter therefore the fines concentration is qualitative only high fines concentration occurring between 85 and 1200 pore volumes which involved fresh water injection is consistent with the 70 permeability drop during this period fig 2 however the two produced water samples collected between 2500 and 3500 pore volumes show high concentrations of fines but no permeability drop occurred during this period the ph of injected water was measured to be between 6 0 and 7 0 mostly the ph of produced water was same as injected water but occasionally it increased up to 7 5 the ph of the flowing water can increase due to dissolution of intergranular minerals mcguire et al 2005 austad 2013 mohan et al 1993 this increase in ph can mobilize fines austad 2013 noticeable increase in fines concentration at 1000 and 2400 pvi was accompanied by a corresponding increase in ph fig 2b we separated fines from produced water samples using a ptfe membrane fig 1b then more than 300 particles were randomly selected and analyzed using sem eds eds spectrum shows the chemical elements of the scanned particle from which we can determine the particle type kaolinite was identified when ai si and o appeared simultaneously on the spectrum quartz was identified when si and o appeared simultaneously on the spectrum statistics of particles analysed are presented in fig 3 most of the particles produced during high salinity water injection were quartz with a very small amount of clay there is a delay in clay production during early stage of the fresh water injection which further supports the theory of slow drift of the mobilized fines yang et al 2016 during fresh water injection clay fines production reached just over 80 and then reduces to almost 50 with considerable quartz production most of the clay produced during fresh water injection was kaolinite an sem image of quartz particles is given in fig 4 a and the eds spectrum in fig 4b confirms the presence of silicate in fig 5 the eds spectrum of another particle shows the presence of silica and aluminium which confirms that the particle is kaolinite 3 3 registration of micro ct images to analyse the changes in the pore space due to fines migration the second tomogram was registered to the one taken before the flow experiment the registration process aligns the two images at voxel accuracy such that the images overlay with maximal similarity latham et al 2008 fig 6 depicts slices through the registered tomograms before and after the flow experiment the tomograms intensities in the clay region appear to be between grain and pore intensities which is due to the volume of the voxels partially filled with clay the slices show some movement of clays fig 7 shows enlarged images highlighting the changes in the pore space in a few instances especially near the core plug outlet there was an increase in the clay mineral fig 7a and 7b there were several instances near the inlet where clay disappeared in the post test image fig 7c and 7d the images also showed displacement of grains sand fig 7e and 7f near inlet fig 8 a shows the ct intensity profiles of the images before and after the flow experiment near the core plug injection end 3000 to 4000 voxels ct intensity decreased after the flow experiment whereas near the production end 0 to 1000 voxels the intensity increased fig 8b this x ray intensity shift might represent transfer of mass from the injection end of the core plug toward the production end which supports the theory of fines mobilization and subsequent straining 3 4 segmentation of micro ct images the registered tomogram images figs 6 and 7 show high contrast between quartz and pore space but not enough contrast between clay and either quartz or pore space due to partially filled clay voxels to further explain our argument we plot the nominal frequency of x ray intensity of the micro ct image taken before flow experiment fig 9 clay intensities are very similar to grain and pore intensities which makes it difficult to segment clays in tomogram images this was addressed by a semi automatic three step segmentation approach first intensity values near grain and pore boundaries were chosen to separate pore space from grains ignoring the result of clay identification high definite grain intensity and low definite pore intensity thresholds were used to define seed regions these regions were grown using a converging active contour algorithm cac sheppard 2014 next two clay segmentation were performed separately from only the initial grain segmented region and then from only the initial pore segmented region finally the two clay segmentations were merged to form a segmented image of three phases grain pore and clay although considerable sand particles were observed fig 3 the segmented images show no change in grain phase sand from before water injection to after water injection fig 10 a this might mean that the amount of produced sand is negligible compared to the mass of sand present in the core plug there is noticeable decrease and increase in clay phase fraction around the core injection production end respectively fig 10b clay fines mobilize and gets strained in the flow direction which explains the observations in fig 10b the clay migration causes a local increase in porosity near the injection end and a decrease in porosity near the core production end fig 10a to further support this argument fraction of displaced strained and unchanged clay phases are plotted in fig 11 clay phase is being displaced consistently throughout the core length the displaced or migrated clay is continuously being strained the straining is more near the core production end 3 5 image based permeability computations micro ct images can be used to compute various single phase and two phase flow properties arns et al 2004 we computed absolute permeability from the ct images using the methodology described by arns et al 2004 to model the laboratory experiment the lateral surfaces of the cylindrical core plug were set to no flow boundary conditions the fluid pressure gradient along the longitudinal axis of the core plug z direction was modelled by a body force the solid fluid interface was set to no slip boundary condition the navier stokes equation was solved using the lattice boltzmann lb approach martys et al 1999 as a result of mounting the core in the experimental facility the ends of the core plug were damaged fig 12 to exclude the physically damaged part permeability was computed on two subsets of the whole core image fig 12b computations were run for a large cylindrical subset 5 mm diameter 12 mm length which excludes almost 3 mm length of the damaged core plug and a small subset from the middle of the image 2 5 mm 2 5 mm 9 mm permeability prior to the flow experiment was computed on the large subset 1470 mdarcy and found to match the laboratory measurement within the experimental error fig 13 the smaller subset had lower initial permeability 970 mdarcy and does not show any permeability drop after the flow experiment however our previous observations showed that the clay content straining was most likely near the production end of the core plug whereas the subset was taken from the middle of the core plug this is further supported by the computation run on the large subset which showed a 50 decrease in permeability but was less than the laboratory measurement of an 80 decrease in permeability a probable explanation is that the entire core plug is 3 mm longer than is the large subset which also includes the area around the production end where most of the particle straining would be expected to further test this conjecture we ran cluster size analysis on the clay phase knackstedt et al 2007 of our micro ct images figs 14 and 15 3d visualization of the cluster sizes show that numerous clay clusters accumulated near the core production end fig 14 these migrated clays were not captured in the smaller subset 2 5 mm 2 5 mm 9 mm hence no permeability decline was found in the smaller subset computations the cluster analysis also shows that after the injection clay cluster sizes reduced consistently fig 15 which supports the clay leaflets mobilization theory bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 4 mathematical modelling of fines detachment mobilisation migration and straining this section presents the mathematical modelling of the experimental observations made in section 3 section 4 1 presents basic equations and exact solutions for one dimensional flow with fines detachment mobilisation migration and straining section 4 2 presents the comparison between mathematical model and the experimental data 4 1 basic equations and analytical model for fines migration and permeability damage the governing system of fines migration in porous media contains mass balance of suspended and retained particles and the rate equation for particle straining bedrikovetsky et al 2011 2012 mass balance of detached and attached fines is 2 ϕ s σ c σ t u c f σ x 0 where ϕ is porosity s is accessibility factor c is suspended fines concentration σ is retained fines concentration u is darcy velocity and f is drift delay factor rate of fines straining is defined as 3 σ t λ σ f σ u c where λ is the filtration coefficient darcy s law with permeability as a function of formation damage is 4 u k 0 μ 1 β σ σ p x where k 0 is initial permeability µ is viscosity of water β is the formation damage coefficient and p is the pressure fines rolling speed us at the matrix surface is significantly slower than the carrier water velocity u due to slow drift of fines yuan and shapiro 2010 yuan and shapiro 2011 sefrioui et al 2013 oliveira et al 2014 to model fines velocity drift delay factor is used to account for slow fines migration the constant drift delay factor α was defined as oliveira et al 2014 5 α f s u s u where f is drift delay factor and s is accessibility factor eqs 2 to 4 which reflect slow migration of fines were solved to provide linear and nonlinear solutions yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 both solutions assume constant accessibility factor s and drift delay factor α the langmuir blocking filtration function is applied in both models 6 λ s λ 0 1 s s m where λ is the filtration coefficient λ0 is the initial filtration coefficient s is dimensionless retention concentration and sm is maximum vacancy concentration the linear model assumes a constant filtration coefficient this is because retained fines concentration s is negligible compared with the maximum vacancy concentration sm therefore the filtration coefficient λ λ0 does not change with the fines retention process eq 6 the resultant linear solution is given in eqs 7 and 8 7 s x t s 1 e α λ 0 t x α t s 1 e λ 0 x x α t 8 c x t e λ 0 α t x α t 0 x α t where s is the accessibility factor and c is the dimensionless breakthrough suspended fines concentration eqs 9 and 10 present a non linear model in which filtration coefficient λ decreases as retention concentration s increases 9 s x t λ 0 s e λ 0 λ 0 s m s x 1 λ 0 e λ 0 λ 0 s m s x λ 0 s m s x α t 10 c x t λ 0 λ 0 s m s λ 0 e λ 0 λ 0 s m s α t λ 0 s m s 4 2 matching the imaging data by the analytical models experimental data of retained concentration was obtained from micro ct clay phase analysis fig 11 initial filtration coefficient λ0 maximum vacancy concentration sm and accessibility factor s were tuned to match the experimental data table 2 the nonlinear model of retained fines concentration closely matched our experimental data fig 16 in contrast the linear model did not reflect the experimental trend the matching parameters λ0 sm and s obtained from fig 17 were used to match breakthrough suspended fines concentration fig 17 the constant drift delay factor α u s u was estimated from fig 2a it is estimated from the permeability drop that permeability stabilized at around 2000 pore volumes this means that the ratio of fines velocity us over darcy velocity u 0 0005 hence the value of drift delay factor α as 0 0005 was adopted to get suspended fines concentration again the nonlinear model matched the experimental data the type curves show a concave retention concentration curve and a convex breakthrough suspended fines concentration curve these indicate that filtration coefficient increases during filling retention vacancies from s 0 to s sm yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 sensitivity analyses of the nonlinear model shows that the lower the maximum vacancy concentration sm the higher the constant b the lower the retention profile fig 18 a and the higher the breakthrough fines concentration in the water fig 18b the higher the drift delay factor α the faster the fines move and arrive at the outlet fig 19 5 conclusion and recommendations an integrated coreflooding and micro ct approach has been presented to understand the effect of fines migration on permeability the results show ability of micro ct imaging to investigate fines induced permeability damage during water flow the following conclusions are drawn fresh water injection leads to a sharp increase in clay particle production although sand was produced in both high salinity and fresh water injection no change in resolved sand phase fraction was noted during fresh water injection clay near the injection end of the core plug was mobilized some of this mobilized clay was strained near the production end of the core plug and the rest was produced computations run on a small subset of a micro ct image did not show any permeability damage but computations run on a large subset showed 50 decrease in permeability this shows that the production end of the core plug was damaged due to clay fines straining the computed permeability decrease 50 was less than the laboratory measured permeability decrease 80 which could be attributed to the micro ct computations not being run on the entire core plug analytical modelling showed that retention concentration and breakthrough suspended fines concentration were nonlinear the concave retention concentration and convex breakthrough suspended fines concentration profiles indicate that filtration coefficient increases during the fines retention process the above experimental evidence of fines migration induced permeability damage during fresh water waterflooding supports the mobility control oil recovery mechanism during fines assisted low salinity waterflooding the present study includes measurements of the breakthrough concentration and retention profile along the core breakthrough concentrations are measured by particle counter micro ct imaging provides measurements of retained concentrations pressure measurements require simple and robust equipment providing high accuracy while particle counters and micro ct imaging are cumbersome and expensive with low accuracy of concentration measurements the alternative or complimentary option is the use of pressure difference across the core sections together with the overall pressure difference this so called 3 point pressure method has been successfully developed for characterisation of suspension colloidal transport without detachment bedrikovetsky et al 2001 application of 3 point pressure test for fines migration could simplify the equipment and increase the accuracy of measurements yielding cheaper and more reliable laboratory based and field scale predictions the micro ct imaging approach developed can be extended for two phase and three phase colloidal suspension flow with salinity alteration causing fines detachment mobilisation migration and size exclusion iglauer et al 2011 2015 besides electrostatic and drag forces during two phase transport the attached particles are subject to capillary forces exerting from the menisci between two phases zhang and hassanizadeh 2017 the particles attached to menisci are transported by the phase separating surface which is not determined by the darcy velocity the full system of equations includes maxwell constitutive equations shapiro 2016 2018 during three phase flow fines can be detached by adhesion and drag forces al mansoori et al 2009 the developed laboratory based 1d analytical model for fines migration has been applied for analysis of filed case in bastrykskoye oil reservoir where low salinity water has been injected for enhanced oil recovery purposes ahmetgareev et al 2015 the intensive fines production accompanied incremental oil production close match between the stream line quasi 3d model based on the 1d analytical model and production history has been achieved the methodology developed in this study can be applied to model permeability damage during fresh water storage underground water disposal and oil recovery to simulate permeability damage in a real field experiments should be performed using real formation core

751,breakthrough pressure and permeability control the structural sealing capacity of mudrocks in hydrocarbon reservoirs and co2 sequestration sites breakthrough pressure studies show a wide array of results due to the natural heterogeneity of mudrocks this includes the effects of variability in grain size distribution fine sediment fraction and mineral composition resedimentation techniques have been widely applied to the study of mudrock permeability but little work focused on breakthrough pressure here we perform a parametric study on breakthrough pressure and permeability in resedimented mudrocks using samples composed of ternary mixtures of kaolinite quartz and lime the texture or grain size distributions and composition or mineralogical concentration of our mudrock fabric is systematically varied we show that lime is effective in cementing resedimented samples producing mechanically competent mudrocks and allowing for robust mercury injection capillary porosimetry we observed that breakthrough pressure increases and permeability decreases with fine grained void ratio rather than bulk void ratio according to power law relationships the fine grained void ratio is defined as the ratio of the volume of voids to volume of fine grains where the size of the fine grains is controlled by the structure of the coarse grained percolating network these relationships can be used to estimate the sealing capacity of shaly sandstones and sandy mudrocks and highlight the variability of transport properties in coarse fine sediment mixtures plain language summary carbon dioxide co2 a greenhouse gas can be injected into and sequestered within deep brine filled aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs to reduce atmospheric emissions after injection co2 rises buoyantly until it collects beneath a rock formation that is much less permeable than the reservoir these formations which trap co2 are often mudrocks predicting how well a mudrock can hold back the co2 from rising to the surface is vital to the success of any underground sequestration effort but this is a daunting task given the wide variability in natural mudrocks to address this problem we created artificial mudrocks in the laboratory and measured the amount of pressure it takes for co2 to first begin to flow or breakthrough the rocks we determined that the breakthrough pressure of mudrocks can be predicted by the relative amounts of pores present within the fine and coarse grained size fractions in each mudrock keywords percolation threshold breakthrough pressure displacement pressure resedimentation co2 sequestration caprock integrity mudrock permeability 1 introduction the effort to mitigate climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions has been considered as the apollo program of our time king et al 2015 one promising strategy is the permanent sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide co2 in deep saline reservoirs benson and cook 2005 target reservoirs are often composed of massive sandstone formations reservoirs capped by low permeability shales caprocks downey 1984 espinoza and santamarina 2017 under which the co2 collects and remains trapped caprock integrity is also important when evaluating hydrocarbon reserves if the reservoir pressure exceeds the sealing capacity of the caprock then over geologic timescales the reservoir will be depleted until the pressures are equilibrated with the capillary forces thus the successful evaluation of hydrocarbon reservoirs and the security of co2 sequestration in deep geologic formations as a climate change mitigation strategy hinges on how well the caprocks function as seals the sealing capacity of a caprock directly depends on two related factors how much pressure is needed for a non wetting fluid e g co2 oil or gas to break through the barrier and how much pressure builds up under the caprock the pressure difference experienced at the caprock interface by a continuous buoyant non wetting plume with height h is 1 δ p ρ b ρ g g h where ρb is the brine mass density ρg is the non wetting phase mass density and g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height or thickness of the non wetting plume usually referred to as the co2 oil gas column peters 2012 schowalter 1979 the breakthrough pressure pc or displacement pressure of a given porous medium can be theoretically calculated using the young laplace equation laplace et al 1829 young 1805 2 p c 2 σ cos θ r c where θ is the contact angle of formation brine in the presence of the non wetting fluid σ is the interfacial tension between the brine and the non wetting fluid and rc the critical pore radius is the minimum pore radius along an interconnected and continuous path of pores across the porous medium at breakthrough the breakthrough pressure is the minimum pressure differential for a nonwetting fluid to begin to flow across a sample or formation mercury intrusion capillary porosimetry micp is widely used in the oil industry to investigate entry pressure breakthrough pressure and estimate the permeability of porous media this method utilizes the laplace equation and an understanding of the contact angle of mercury to develop a pore throat distribution once this pore throat distribution is known an assumed contact angle can be used to estimate the entry pressure and breakthrough pressure of any fluid this technique is easy to run and readily reproduced making it ideal for conducting a large number of breakthrough pressure experiments the disadvantages of this technique are due to the uncertainties in contact angle and the possibility for shrinking of clays during the drying processes for these reasons the best way to establish definitive breakthrough pressures of co2 in a particular shale is through co2 breakthrough pressure experiments in this paper we present our micp estimates in terms of co2 however our goal is to understand the fundamental controls on breakthrough pressure and not the absolute value of any one particular sample fluid combination co2 breakthrough pressure measurements on a variety of natural formations range from approximately 0 1 mpa to 5 mpa harrington et al 2009 hildenbrand et al 2002 2004 wollenweber et al 2010 evaporites exhibit some of the highest breakthrough pressures with values as great as 21 mpa for co2 li et al 2005 co2 breakthrough pressure experiments on resedimented samples have shown that rc eq 2 is generally larger than the mean pore throat radius in homogeneous porous media espinoza and santamarina 2010 a summary of recent breakthrough pressure experiments highlights the role of particle size distribution and specific surface on pc espinoza and santamarina 2017 makhnenko et al 2017 breakthrough pressure plays an important role in the sleipner co2 sequestration project in the north sea for example where nearly a million tons of co2 have been injected each year since 1996 arts et al 2004 chadwick et al 2010 monitoring of the co2 plume with 4d seismic surveys reveal that the plume has ascended rapidly through eight thin shaly barriers at unexpectedly low breakthrough pressures before being trapped beneath a large competent caprock cavanagh and haszeldine 2014 this unexpected plume behavior suggests that some properties of the co2 plume barriers have not been accurately characterized the causes for such phenomenon partly originate on the spatial variability and heterogeneous nature of mudrocks mudrocks are usually recognized by its amount of clay minerals in the rock matrix typically well logging measurements such as gamma ray emission and spontaneous potential measure bulk volume fractions of clay content in shaly sediments but cannot tell the location of clays within the rock matrix and their effect on transport properties peters 2012 hence it is not straightforward to assess the sealing capacity of shaly sandstones or sandy shales from gamma ray or spontaneous potential only the study of synthetic resedimented mudrock samples helps understand better these sediment mixtures resedimentation is the process by which slurries are incrementally compressed to high effective stress under oedometric conditions one dimensional strain to mimic the sedimentation process germaine and germaine 2009 the process can be used to create synthetic mudrocks with prescribed mineralogy grain size and a target porosity or effective stress the creation of resedimented mudrocks allows for the systematic study of a single factor such as the mineral composition grain size or effective stress thus reducing the variability produced by the study of natural materials schneider et al 2011 resedimentation experiments have been used to explore permeability porosity and compressibility as a function of mineralogical composition however generally employing a narrow grain size distribution and or low effective stress as required for studying deep mudrocks bandini and sathiskumar 2009 dewhurst et al 1999 1998 espinoza and santamarina 2017 mondol et al 2008 2007 reece et al 2013 schneider et al 2011 shafiee 2008 for example schneider et al 2011 used resedimentation techniques on a natural illitic mudrock that was mixed with silt sized silica to create five different mixtures ranging in composition from 36 to 57 clay by weight each sample was consolidated to a maximum vertical effective stress of 2 4 mpa and vertical permeability was calculated assuming a constant strain rate during consolidation increments scanning electron microscopy sem analysis of these samples showed that the silt sized silica grains formed silt bridges which allowed for increased permeability with decreasing clay fraction they proposed a dual porosity model where the clay and silt fractions have separate permeabilities which contribute to the overall effective permeability espinoza and santamarina 2017 used resedimentation experiments to explore breakthrough pressure in sediments with co2 the authors consolidated homogeneous specimens of fine sand calcium carbonate kaolinite and montmorillonite to a maximum effective stress of 3 mpa within a spring loaded oedometer flow through cell they found that breakthrough pressure corresponded with pore throats larger than the mean for their specimens with breakthrough pressures ranging from 0 11 mpa in silt sized calcium carbonate to a maximum of 3 0 mpa in pure montmorillonite clay however their work did not explore various sediment mixtures which is more representative of real mudrocks makhnenko et al 2017 conducted co2 breakthrough pressure experiments on a resedimented opalinus clay and found good agreement between resedimented and natural samples our work presented here builds on that of espinoza and santamarina 2017 and schneider et al 2011 as well as other previous studies of resedimented mudrocks by exploring the effect of mixtures of quartz kaolinite and lime on the transport properties of mudrocks these are representative of typical constituents of mudrocks fine siliciclastic grains represented by quartz clay kaolinite and a carbonate cement lime by mixing three minerals into our slurries we produce samples with varied mineralogy porosity and pore structure this helps achieve our goal of developing predictive relationships between mineral composition and grain texture with mudrock permeability and breakthrough pressure simultaneously here for the first time we analyze the entry pressure breakthrough pressure and permeability estimated from micp of controlled sediment mixtures consolidated to high effective stresses we synthesize the results by regression and then compare them to previous work 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials and consolidation technique three types of minerals were used fine grained quartz hydrated lime and kaolinite table 1 the quartz was supplied by allied compounds and passed a 200 mesh 74 µm the hydrated lime was supplied by aqua phoenix scientific with 94 passing a 325 mesh 44 µm and 99 passing a 200 mesh a hydrometer was used to measure the particle size distribution for each mineral component according to astm d7928 fig 1 a high powered commercial blender waring model 37bl19 was used to create a slurry by mixing the minerals with a 5 m ionic strength brine composed of sodium chloride calcium chloride magnesium chloride potassium chloride and potassium bromide this brine approximately matches the brine in the mount simon formation a potential target for co2 geologic storage botto et al 2017 next the slurry was loaded into the oedometer consolidation device 1d strain deformation for incremental stress loading fig 2 to minimize side wall friction the plunger and consolidation sleeve are machined smooth and lubricated by the brine bath weights are added to the lever arm of the oedometer to produce stress on the consolidation device the small diameter of the consolidation device and the lever arm allow for high effective stresses to be achieved without the use of a large hydraulic press in this case the application of 12 kg of weight with the lever arm set to a 10 1 multiple results in 36 mpa of effective vertical stress sixteen stress increments were conducted beginning at 0 015 mpa and doubled until reaching 36 mpa for all samples displacement was monitored with a linear displacement transducer to ensure that primary consolidation pore pressure dissipation was complete before the next stress increment was begun an example of the strain time series signature is presented in fig 3 a permeability was calculated from the incremental consolidation tests according to terzaghi s theory of consolidation terzaghi and peck 1948 using the log time method first proposed by casagrande and fadum 1940 and outlined in detail in germaine and germaine 2009 this graphical technique fig 3b is used to estimate t50 and ε50 the time and axial strain at 50 consolidation respectively which allow computing vertical permeability kv

mercury injection capillary porosimetry mercury injection capillary porosimetry was conducted on each sample using a micromeritics autopore iv 9500 device before micp each sample was oven dried for 24 hours at 80 c pressure was incremented in 53 steps up to a maximum of 413 7 mpa 60 000 psi fig 4 a pore size distributions were calculated using the young laplace equation eq 2 a contact angle for mercury of 130 and an interfacial tension of 0 485 n m permeability was estimated using the modified purcell s model purcell 1949 where the capillary tubes are exchanged for sheets brown 2015 and with a lithology factor of 0 085 the minimum calculated by purcell the lithology factor represents the tortuosity of the tubes or sheets and is lowest in mudrocks pc and rc were determined by fitting a curve to the cumulative intrusion data plotted against the logarithm of pressure the point of greatest slope on this curve corresponds to pc and rc katz and thompson 1987 and is located at the local minimum of the second derivative of the curve fig 4b c in our experiments entry pressure was selected as the first point which deviated from the initial straight line portion of the micp curve the pressures observed during micp only apply to the liquid vapor mercury system pressures were converted to brine co2 capillary pressures by scaling with the ratio of interfacial tensions and contact angles schowalter 1979 4 p c c o 2 p c h g σ b c o 2 cos θ b c o 2 σ h g cos θ h g where σb co2 and σhg are the interfacial tensions between brine co2 and liquid vapor mercury respectively and θ b co2 and θ hg are the contact angles between brine co2 and mercury for this study we assumed that co2 is completely nonwetting with respect to brine θ b co2 was assumed to be 0 σb co2 is strongly dependent upon pressure and temperature for these experiments we assumed a reservoir temperature of 60 c and 13 8 mpa 2 000 psi which results in a σb co2 of approximately 0 030 n m bachu and bennion 2009 3 results table 2 and fig 5 a c summarize the mineralogical compositions of the resedimented samples the co2 entry pressure breakthrough pressure and permeability from micp analysis the edges of the ternary diagrams represent two component mixing lines e g the lower edge of the ternary triangle corresponds to mixtures moving from 100 quartz at the lower left to 100 kaolinite at the lower right these two component mixing ratios are defined so that they increase as the finer grained component increases e g from quartz to kaolinite or lime to kaolinite and are displayed in fig 5 d f 3 1 entry pressure entry pressure pe is the pressure necessary to enter the largest pore throats accessible on the perimeter of the sample our results show a wide range of entry pressures from 0 06 mpa in the 100 quartz sample to 1 26 mpa in the 100 kaolinite sample fig 5a these pressures correspond to the largest pore throat diameters in the samples which are 1 04 µm for pure quartz 0 05 µm for pure kaolinite and 0 28 µm for pure lime entry pressure generally increases with the addition of kaolinite and lime fig 5a two component mixing experiments reveal exponential relationships between each mineral pair as a function of volume fraction fig 5d entry pressure increases most rapidly along the quartz to kaolinite mixing line blue dashed line in fig 5d while the quartz to lime relationship is nearly linear orange dashed line in fig 5d 3 2 breakthrough pressure the breakthrough pressure or the minimum pressure difference necessary to begin the flow of a co2 across our samples ranges from 0 06 mpa in the pure quartz sample to 2 0 mpa in the pure kaolinite sample fig 5b this corresponds to a range of rc 0 93 µm to 0 03 µm respectively the breakthrough pressure of the three component mixtures are strongly controlled by the concentration of kaolinite and lime in the two component samples the breakthrough pressure is exponentially related to increasing kaolinite or lime concentration with the greatest increase along the mixing line from 100 quartz to 100 kaolinite blue dashed line in fig 5e the complex response of multi component mixtures emphasizes the need to look beyond two component mixtures when studying transport behavior in resedimented samples 3 3 permeability permeability ranges over three orders of magnitude from a high of 2 7 10 3 d 2 7 10 15 m2 2 57 logd fig 5c in the 100 quartz sample to 2 8 10 6d 2 8 10 18 m2 5 55 logd fig 5c in the 100 kaolinite sample fig 5c permeability generally decreases as the volume fraction of lime and kaolinite increases lime mixtures are generally less permeable than quartz mixtures with the same fraction of kaolinite two component mixing line results reveal an exponential relationship between the mineral pairs with the permeability decreasing the greatest along the quartz to kaolinite mixing line fig 5f in three component samples there is no discernible correlation to any one mineral concentration which highlights the need to explore other parameters such as void ratio and clay fraction 4 discussion 4 1 suitability of mercury intrusion to estimate transport properties on uncemented and fine grained sediments permeability and entry pressure of mudrocks can be difficult to estimate during micp due to conformance and compressibility errors comisky et al 2011 peng et al 2017 conformance errors are due to surface vugs large grains and irregularities at the surface and are limited when using whole non crushed samples peng et al 2017 for the purposes of this study we assume conformance issues are negligible during the early phase of micp compression errors occur when the voids not yet intruded by mercury begin to compress in response to the increased exterior capillary pressure at high pressure compression errors occur due to compression of organic material and other low density materials peng et al 2017 due to the lack of cementation resedimented samples are likely to experience erroneous prediction of capillary entry pressures due to compressibility errors to prevent this artifact we created calcite cementation through the use of hydrated lime during the consolidation process however our samples are still subject to some early compression particularly in samples without lime to correct for this artifact we assume all mercury intrusion prior to the selected entry pressure is due to compression and subtract this intrusion from our porosity and permeability calculations at 60 000 psi 414 mpa the final stress increment during micp mercury will intrude pore throats as small as 3 nm while substantial porosity in shales may exist beneath 3 nm we assume that porosity in this range is negligible in our samples civil engineering applications often use hydrated lime to stabilize soils sherwood 1993 hydrated lime converts to water and calcium carbonate by absorbing co2 from air here we use this process to create cemented sediments without the unnatural silicates found in concrete unlike resedimented samples without lime our samples remain competent even when saturated with water this trait could prove useful for further flow and transport investigations as well as mechanical studies after consolidation was complete scanning electron microscopy paired with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds was used to examine the fabric of sample 12 20 quartz 40 kaolinite 40 lime fig 6 imaging revealed carbon and calcium signatures present throughout the matrix which corresponds to the lime calcite the addition of lime helps strengthen the resedimented samples and decreases compression during the initial phase of micp a comparison of three high clay content samples one created with hydrated lime and two without shows the difference between samples created with and without cementation fig 7 another artifact introduced by micp measurements is pore structure alteration induced by oven drying capillary forces during drying can move fine grained sediments to grain contacts and pore throats and induce capillary driven cracks shin and santamarina 2011 we limit this process through our use of kaolinite a non swelling clay however all clays swell and shrink to some extent so it cannot be entirely discounted despite some of the mentioned artifacts involved in micp these type of measurements are extremely useful to perform parametric studies with a large number of samples section 4 3 discusses a comparison of the results in transport properties derived from micp with other methods 4 2 fine grained control on transport properties the void ratio e quantifies the space available in a sediment for flow or compression and is proportional to porosity e φ 1 φ the void ratio of a sample is defined as the volume of voids vv divided by the total volume of solid grains vs here we find it insightful to define a fine grained void ratio ef 5 e f v v v s f where vsf is the volume of fine grains similarly a coarse grained void ratio ec can be defined as 6 e c v v v s f v s c where vsc is the volume of coarse grains ef is similar to the definition of void ratio but instead represents how tightly packed the fine grains are regardless of the presence of coarse grains the definition of ec differs from the typical definition of void ratio because it includes the volume of voids and volume of fines in the numerator this ratio represents how tightly packed the coarse grains are with respect to the pores and fine gains a clean sandstone can have a porosity of approximately 33 which corresponds to ec 0 5 therefore 0 5 should be considered the approximate lower bound for ec and the point at which the entire skeleton is composed of coarse grains in contact with one another schneider et al 2011 show that in sediments with silt fractions of 43 and consolidated to 2 4 mpa the coarse grains disturb the alignment of fine grains and contribute to permeability jung et al 2012 propose that above a critical fines content permeability decreases to the permeability of fines in our experiments no particular dependence on ec is apparent instead ef appears to control the transport properties of our samples throughout the range tested this is apparent in the breakthrough pressure bubble plot shown in fig 8 a 8b illustrates the concept of an ec ef space within which the breakthrough pressure is plotted the fine grained void ratio defined above is similar to the void ratio of the clay fraction defined by schneider et al 2011 however we do not define vf as the volume of grains that are clay sized in these experiments we find that vf chosen as the volume of grains smaller than 10 µm yields a suitable power law relationship between pc and ef fig 9 a fig 9b shows the results of an error analysis where the fine grained void ratio was recalculated using different grain size diameter cutoffs and power law functions were fit to the corresponding pc and ef distributions the best correlation r2 closest to 1 occurs at 10 µm we justify the use of 10 µm from a fundamental standpoint by observing that the breakthrough radius or critical pore throat radius rc of the pure quartz sample is 0 9 µm critical path analysis reveals that the transport properties of porous media are primarily controlled by pores which have a radius equal or greater than rc daigle 2016 in sandstones the aspect ratio of pore throats to pore bodies ranges from 5 1 to 10 1 hartmann and beaumont 1999 this means that the percolating pore network of our pure sand sample is most strongly controlled by pore throats that are 1 8 µm in diameter and pore bodies that are approximately 9 18 µm fig 10 in samples that are not pure sand we still expect a similar coarse grained pore network to form as the coarse grained void ratio approaches the lower limit however in these samples the network may be partially filled with grains 10 µm in diameter we hypothesize that the grain diameters which are larger than the pore bodies of the percolating network do not have a significant influence on the advective transport properties of these samples therefore the coarse grains within a mudstone determine the structure of the percolating network while the void ratio within the network controls the breakthrough pressure 4 3 comparison of micp transport properties with other methods given the uncertainties associated with estimating transport properties from micp we compare our findings with those found in the literature permeability crawford et al 2008 consolidated mixtures of fine grained quartz and kaolinite to 50 mpa to evaluate the permeability of fault gouge they measured permeability using water for high permeability samples and argon for lower permeability samples our mixtures from quartz to kaolinite are very similar to these samples and our permeability estimates using purcell s theory agree very closely with their permeability measurements fig 11 a in addition we compared our purcell estimates to permeability measured during consolidation for three of our samples fig 11b despite differences between these samples due to drying and expansion during unloading we show that our purcell estimates are reasonable yang and aplin 2010 developed an empirical relationship between void ratio and permeability based on 376 data points in the literature comprising natural and resedimented mudstones based on the fractional content of grains less than 2 µm and the total void ratio e eq 4 in cited reference the equation is empirical and heavily parametrized but has a coefficient of regression r2 equal to 0 93 and is thus a useful way of comparing our data to the larger literature applying this equation to our data we find that it agrees within an order of magnitude to our permeability estimates from micp data using the purcell model fig 12 a in our purcell model we used the smallest lithology factor used by purcell however given the fine grained nature of our samples a smaller lithology factor could be justified the greatest disagreement between the micp purcell estimates and those derived using yang and aplin 2010 occurs for the 100 quartz sample which is to be expected as their equation was originally fit only to fine grained mudrocks overall we find that micp permeability with purcell s method agrees relatively well with mudrock permeability in the literature entry pressure and breakthrough pressure uncertainty in the contact angle of mercury with minerals adds uncertainty to entry and breakthrough pressure values experiments have found the contact angle between mercury and air on kaolinite is 160 penumadu and dean 2000 however the wettability of kaolinite is difficult to constrain due to the possibility that it contains both a water wet surface and a non water wet surface šolc et al 2011 like pc pe is power law correlated with ef fig 12b this behavior can also be understood by the clogging of larger pores along the perimeter of the sample with fine grains the difference between pc and pe increases with decreasing ef fig 12c which is to be expected given their respective power law relationships fundamentally this difference represents the increase in non wetting phase saturation needed to reach the breakthrough pressure the greatest difference in pc and pe was observed in our pure kaolinite sample which had a non wetting phase saturation of 0 31 at pc the smallest difference was observed in the 75 quartz 25 kaolinite sample which had a non wetting phase saturation of 0 06 at pc these micp capillary entry and breakthrough pressure values from 0 06 to 2 mpa are in good agreement with those reported previously with direct pressure breakthrough measurements for scco2 in silty and clay rich mudrocks ranging from 0 04 to 1 3 mpa espinoza and santamarina 2017 4 4 implications on caprock sealing capacity inserting the breakthrough pressures measured in our experiments into eq 1 we can predict the height of a co2 plume at the onset of percolation across a mudstone caprock for the entire range of sediment mixtures used in our study at 13 8 mpa 2000 psi and 60 c ρ co2 is approximately 600 kg m3 nordbotten et al 2005 and for simplicity ρ b can be estimated as 1000 kg m3 hence the expected co2 plume height would range from 16 4 m in our pure quartz silty sample to as much as 509 m in the pure kaolinite sample a conceptual diagram indicating some of the maximum co2 plume heights that can be held beneath a caprock composed of our resedimented samples is shown in fig 13 the large variability of results highlights the impact of mudrock heterogeneity on potential mudrock sealing capacity ultimately the buoyant flow of co2 in the subsurface is controlled by the heterogeneity of the reservoir lithology including the bedding and facies distribution that compose the reservoir and caprock each of the samples in this study can be characterized with a single ef in reality the ef of a caprock will vary across the formation the use of geophysical tools such as gamma and neturon logs presents an opportunity to characterize the distribution of ef across lithological units understanding this distribution is critical to predict caprock integrity invasion percolation modeling is often used to model this long term buoyant fluid flow behavior due to its ability to include heterogeneity and its computational efficiency trevisan et al 2017 however applying experimental entry pressures during modeling efforts may not be sufficient to predict co2 flow as seen at sleipner cavanagh and haszeldine 2014 in addition to sediment deposition architecture a detailed understanding of the lithology and an understanding of how pc scales with ef will yield better prediction of the plume geometry at the basin scale caprock wettability may be as important as caprock pore structure for determining sealing capacity in this study we have assumed completely water wet caprock θ b co2 0 however there is evidence of contact angles greater than 40 in quartz and clay minerals and even greater than 90 in organic matter rich mudrocks arif et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2015 espinoza and santamarina 2010 guiltinan et al 2017 iglauer et al 2015 roshan et al 2016 a co2 wet caprock may favor co2 storage within the caprock itself but could lead to leaks in the long term if the storage capacity is surpassed 5 conclusions we resedimented samples composed of fine grained quartz kaolinite and lime the addition of lime is shown to be an effective method for cementing resedimented samples micp analysis shows that the breakthrough pressure of these samples is correlated to the fine grained void ratio when the fine grains are taken to be those grains less than approximately 10 µm we hypothesize that the 10 µm threshold for these samples correlates to the pore body and pore throats of the connected pathway at the percolation threshold this means that the coarse grains control the structure of the percolating network while the void ratio within that network controls the transport properties the simplicity of the power law relationship we observe between pc and ef is ideal because estimates of these parameters can be made using geophysical techniques such as gamma and neutron logs permeability estimates of our samples compare well with literature data and we show that the yang and aplin 2010 empirical relationship based upon clay fraction and void ratio validates the results of our micp purcell estimation our results are applicable to mudrocks that have undergone limited diagenesis and may not apply to shales where the percolating pore network can be filled with authigenic minerals while the heterogeneity of natural mudrocks makes them difficult to systematically study future work following our approach could be done to investigate if these relationships persists acknowledgments the authors would like thank glen baum for his help with micp

751,breakthrough pressure and permeability control the structural sealing capacity of mudrocks in hydrocarbon reservoirs and co2 sequestration sites breakthrough pressure studies show a wide array of results due to the natural heterogeneity of mudrocks this includes the effects of variability in grain size distribution fine sediment fraction and mineral composition resedimentation techniques have been widely applied to the study of mudrock permeability but little work focused on breakthrough pressure here we perform a parametric study on breakthrough pressure and permeability in resedimented mudrocks using samples composed of ternary mixtures of kaolinite quartz and lime the texture or grain size distributions and composition or mineralogical concentration of our mudrock fabric is systematically varied we show that lime is effective in cementing resedimented samples producing mechanically competent mudrocks and allowing for robust mercury injection capillary porosimetry we observed that breakthrough pressure increases and permeability decreases with fine grained void ratio rather than bulk void ratio according to power law relationships the fine grained void ratio is defined as the ratio of the volume of voids to volume of fine grains where the size of the fine grains is controlled by the structure of the coarse grained percolating network these relationships can be used to estimate the sealing capacity of shaly sandstones and sandy mudrocks and highlight the variability of transport properties in coarse fine sediment mixtures plain language summary carbon dioxide co2 a greenhouse gas can be injected into and sequestered within deep brine filled aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs to reduce atmospheric emissions after injection co2 rises buoyantly until it collects beneath a rock formation that is much less permeable than the reservoir these formations which trap co2 are often mudrocks predicting how well a mudrock can hold back the co2 from rising to the surface is vital to the success of any underground sequestration effort but this is a daunting task given the wide variability in natural mudrocks to address this problem we created artificial mudrocks in the laboratory and measured the amount of pressure it takes for co2 to first begin to flow or breakthrough the rocks we determined that the breakthrough pressure of mudrocks can be predicted by the relative amounts of pores present within the fine and coarse grained size fractions in each mudrock keywords percolation threshold breakthrough pressure displacement pressure resedimentation co2 sequestration caprock integrity mudrock permeability 1 introduction the effort to mitigate climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions has been considered as the apollo program of our time king et al 2015 one promising strategy is the permanent sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide co2 in deep saline reservoirs benson and cook 2005 target reservoirs are often composed of massive sandstone formations reservoirs capped by low permeability shales caprocks downey 1984 espinoza and santamarina 2017 under which the co2 collects and remains trapped caprock integrity is also important when evaluating hydrocarbon reserves if the reservoir pressure exceeds the sealing capacity of the caprock then over geologic timescales the reservoir will be depleted until the pressures are equilibrated with the capillary forces thus the successful evaluation of hydrocarbon reservoirs and the security of co2 sequestration in deep geologic formations as a climate change mitigation strategy hinges on how well the caprocks function as seals the sealing capacity of a caprock directly depends on two related factors how much pressure is needed for a non wetting fluid e g co2 oil or gas to break through the barrier and how much pressure builds up under the caprock the pressure difference experienced at the caprock interface by a continuous buoyant non wetting plume with height h is 1 δ p ρ b ρ g g h where ρb is the brine mass density ρg is the non wetting phase mass density and g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height or thickness of the non wetting plume usually referred to as the co2 oil gas column peters 2012 schowalter 1979 the breakthrough pressure pc or displacement pressure of a given porous medium can be theoretically calculated using the young laplace equation laplace et al 1829 young 1805 2 p c 2 σ cos θ r c where θ is the contact angle of formation brine in the presence of the non wetting fluid σ is the interfacial tension between the brine and the non wetting fluid and rc the critical pore radius is the minimum pore radius along an interconnected and continuous path of pores across the porous medium at breakthrough the breakthrough pressure is the minimum pressure differential for a nonwetting fluid to begin to flow across a sample or formation mercury intrusion capillary porosimetry micp is widely used in the oil industry to investigate entry pressure breakthrough pressure and estimate the permeability of porous media this method utilizes the laplace equation and an understanding of the contact angle of mercury to develop a pore throat distribution once this pore throat distribution is known an assumed contact angle can be used to estimate the entry pressure and breakthrough pressure of any fluid this technique is easy to run and readily reproduced making it ideal for conducting a large number of breakthrough pressure experiments the disadvantages of this technique are due to the uncertainties in contact angle and the possibility for shrinking of clays during the drying processes for these reasons the best way to establish definitive breakthrough pressures of co2 in a particular shale is through co2 breakthrough pressure experiments in this paper we present our micp estimates in terms of co2 however our goal is to understand the fundamental controls on breakthrough pressure and not the absolute value of any one particular sample fluid combination co2 breakthrough pressure measurements on a variety of natural formations range from approximately 0 1 mpa to 5 mpa harrington et al 2009 hildenbrand et al 2002 2004 wollenweber et al 2010 evaporites exhibit some of the highest breakthrough pressures with values as great as 21 mpa for co2 li et al 2005 co2 breakthrough pressure experiments on resedimented samples have shown that rc eq 2 is generally larger than the mean pore throat radius in homogeneous porous media espinoza and santamarina 2010 a summary of recent breakthrough pressure experiments highlights the role of particle size distribution and specific surface on pc espinoza and santamarina 2017 makhnenko et al 2017 breakthrough pressure plays an important role in the sleipner co2 sequestration project in the north sea for example where nearly a million tons of co2 have been injected each year since 1996 arts et al 2004 chadwick et al 2010 monitoring of the co2 plume with 4d seismic surveys reveal that the plume has ascended rapidly through eight thin shaly barriers at unexpectedly low breakthrough pressures before being trapped beneath a large competent caprock cavanagh and haszeldine 2014 this unexpected plume behavior suggests that some properties of the co2 plume barriers have not been accurately characterized the causes for such phenomenon partly originate on the spatial variability and heterogeneous nature of mudrocks mudrocks are usually recognized by its amount of clay minerals in the rock matrix typically well logging measurements such as gamma ray emission and spontaneous potential measure bulk volume fractions of clay content in shaly sediments but cannot tell the location of clays within the rock matrix and their effect on transport properties peters 2012 hence it is not straightforward to assess the sealing capacity of shaly sandstones or sandy shales from gamma ray or spontaneous potential only the study of synthetic resedimented mudrock samples helps understand better these sediment mixtures resedimentation is the process by which slurries are incrementally compressed to high effective stress under oedometric conditions one dimensional strain to mimic the sedimentation process germaine and germaine 2009 the process can be used to create synthetic mudrocks with prescribed mineralogy grain size and a target porosity or effective stress the creation of resedimented mudrocks allows for the systematic study of a single factor such as the mineral composition grain size or effective stress thus reducing the variability produced by the study of natural materials schneider et al 2011 resedimentation experiments have been used to explore permeability porosity and compressibility as a function of mineralogical composition however generally employing a narrow grain size distribution and or low effective stress as required for studying deep mudrocks bandini and sathiskumar 2009 dewhurst et al 1999 1998 espinoza and santamarina 2017 mondol et al 2008 2007 reece et al 2013 schneider et al 2011 shafiee 2008 for example schneider et al 2011 used resedimentation techniques on a natural illitic mudrock that was mixed with silt sized silica to create five different mixtures ranging in composition from 36 to 57 clay by weight each sample was consolidated to a maximum vertical effective stress of 2 4 mpa and vertical permeability was calculated assuming a constant strain rate during consolidation increments scanning electron microscopy sem analysis of these samples showed that the silt sized silica grains formed silt bridges which allowed for increased permeability with decreasing clay fraction they proposed a dual porosity model where the clay and silt fractions have separate permeabilities which contribute to the overall effective permeability espinoza and santamarina 2017 used resedimentation experiments to explore breakthrough pressure in sediments with co2 the authors consolidated homogeneous specimens of fine sand calcium carbonate kaolinite and montmorillonite to a maximum effective stress of 3 mpa within a spring loaded oedometer flow through cell they found that breakthrough pressure corresponded with pore throats larger than the mean for their specimens with breakthrough pressures ranging from 0 11 mpa in silt sized calcium carbonate to a maximum of 3 0 mpa in pure montmorillonite clay however their work did not explore various sediment mixtures which is more representative of real mudrocks makhnenko et al 2017 conducted co2 breakthrough pressure experiments on a resedimented opalinus clay and found good agreement between resedimented and natural samples our work presented here builds on that of espinoza and santamarina 2017 and schneider et al 2011 as well as other previous studies of resedimented mudrocks by exploring the effect of mixtures of quartz kaolinite and lime on the transport properties of mudrocks these are representative of typical constituents of mudrocks fine siliciclastic grains represented by quartz clay kaolinite and a carbonate cement lime by mixing three minerals into our slurries we produce samples with varied mineralogy porosity and pore structure this helps achieve our goal of developing predictive relationships between mineral composition and grain texture with mudrock permeability and breakthrough pressure simultaneously here for the first time we analyze the entry pressure breakthrough pressure and permeability estimated from micp of controlled sediment mixtures consolidated to high effective stresses we synthesize the results by regression and then compare them to previous work 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials and consolidation technique three types of minerals were used fine grained quartz hydrated lime and kaolinite table 1 the quartz was supplied by allied compounds and passed a 200 mesh 74 µm the hydrated lime was supplied by aqua phoenix scientific with 94 passing a 325 mesh 44 µm and 99 passing a 200 mesh a hydrometer was used to measure the particle size distribution for each mineral component according to astm d7928 fig 1 a high powered commercial blender waring model 37bl19 was used to create a slurry by mixing the minerals with a 5 m ionic strength brine composed of sodium chloride calcium chloride magnesium chloride potassium chloride and potassium bromide this brine approximately matches the brine in the mount simon formation a potential target for co2 geologic storage botto et al 2017 next the slurry was loaded into the oedometer consolidation device 1d strain deformation for incremental stress loading fig 2 to minimize side wall friction the plunger and consolidation sleeve are machined smooth and lubricated by the brine bath weights are added to the lever arm of the oedometer to produce stress on the consolidation device the small diameter of the consolidation device and the lever arm allow for high effective stresses to be achieved without the use of a large hydraulic press in this case the application of 12 kg of weight with the lever arm set to a 10 1 multiple results in 36 mpa of effective vertical stress sixteen stress increments were conducted beginning at 0 015 mpa and doubled until reaching 36 mpa for all samples displacement was monitored with a linear displacement transducer to ensure that primary consolidation pore pressure dissipation was complete before the next stress increment was begun an example of the strain time series signature is presented in fig 3 a permeability was calculated from the incremental consolidation tests according to terzaghi s theory of consolidation terzaghi and peck 1948 using the log time method first proposed by casagrande and fadum 1940 and outlined in detail in germaine and germaine 2009 this graphical technique fig 3b is used to estimate t50 and ε50 the time and axial strain at 50 consolidation respectively which allow computing vertical permeability kv

mercury injection capillary porosimetry mercury injection capillary porosimetry was conducted on each sample using a micromeritics autopore iv 9500 device before micp each sample was oven dried for 24 hours at 80 c pressure was incremented in 53 steps up to a maximum of 413 7 mpa 60 000 psi fig 4 a pore size distributions were calculated using the young laplace equation eq 2 a contact angle for mercury of 130 and an interfacial tension of 0 485 n m permeability was estimated using the modified purcell s model purcell 1949 where the capillary tubes are exchanged for sheets brown 2015 and with a lithology factor of 0 085 the minimum calculated by purcell the lithology factor represents the tortuosity of the tubes or sheets and is lowest in mudrocks pc and rc were determined by fitting a curve to the cumulative intrusion data plotted against the logarithm of pressure the point of greatest slope on this curve corresponds to pc and rc katz and thompson 1987 and is located at the local minimum of the second derivative of the curve fig 4b c in our experiments entry pressure was selected as the first point which deviated from the initial straight line portion of the micp curve the pressures observed during micp only apply to the liquid vapor mercury system pressures were converted to brine co2 capillary pressures by scaling with the ratio of interfacial tensions and contact angles schowalter 1979 4 p c c o 2 p c h g σ b c o 2 cos θ b c o 2 σ h g cos θ h g where σb co2 and σhg are the interfacial tensions between brine co2 and liquid vapor mercury respectively and θ b co2 and θ hg are the contact angles between brine co2 and mercury for this study we assumed that co2 is completely nonwetting with respect to brine θ b co2 was assumed to be 0 σb co2 is strongly dependent upon pressure and temperature for these experiments we assumed a reservoir temperature of 60 c and 13 8 mpa 2 000 psi which results in a σb co2 of approximately 0 030 n m bachu and bennion 2009 3 results table 2 and fig 5 a c summarize the mineralogical compositions of the resedimented samples the co2 entry pressure breakthrough pressure and permeability from micp analysis the edges of the ternary diagrams represent two component mixing lines e g the lower edge of the ternary triangle corresponds to mixtures moving from 100 quartz at the lower left to 100 kaolinite at the lower right these two component mixing ratios are defined so that they increase as the finer grained component increases e g from quartz to kaolinite or lime to kaolinite and are displayed in fig 5 d f 3 1 entry pressure entry pressure pe is the pressure necessary to enter the largest pore throats accessible on the perimeter of the sample our results show a wide range of entry pressures from 0 06 mpa in the 100 quartz sample to 1 26 mpa in the 100 kaolinite sample fig 5a these pressures correspond to the largest pore throat diameters in the samples which are 1 04 µm for pure quartz 0 05 µm for pure kaolinite and 0 28 µm for pure lime entry pressure generally increases with the addition of kaolinite and lime fig 5a two component mixing experiments reveal exponential relationships between each mineral pair as a function of volume fraction fig 5d entry pressure increases most rapidly along the quartz to kaolinite mixing line blue dashed line in fig 5d while the quartz to lime relationship is nearly linear orange dashed line in fig 5d 3 2 breakthrough pressure the breakthrough pressure or the minimum pressure difference necessary to begin the flow of a co2 across our samples ranges from 0 06 mpa in the pure quartz sample to 2 0 mpa in the pure kaolinite sample fig 5b this corresponds to a range of rc 0 93 µm to 0 03 µm respectively the breakthrough pressure of the three component mixtures are strongly controlled by the concentration of kaolinite and lime in the two component samples the breakthrough pressure is exponentially related to increasing kaolinite or lime concentration with the greatest increase along the mixing line from 100 quartz to 100 kaolinite blue dashed line in fig 5e the complex response of multi component mixtures emphasizes the need to look beyond two component mixtures when studying transport behavior in resedimented samples 3 3 permeability permeability ranges over three orders of magnitude from a high of 2 7 10 3 d 2 7 10 15 m2 2 57 logd fig 5c in the 100 quartz sample to 2 8 10 6d 2 8 10 18 m2 5 55 logd fig 5c in the 100 kaolinite sample fig 5c permeability generally decreases as the volume fraction of lime and kaolinite increases lime mixtures are generally less permeable than quartz mixtures with the same fraction of kaolinite two component mixing line results reveal an exponential relationship between the mineral pairs with the permeability decreasing the greatest along the quartz to kaolinite mixing line fig 5f in three component samples there is no discernible correlation to any one mineral concentration which highlights the need to explore other parameters such as void ratio and clay fraction 4 discussion 4 1 suitability of mercury intrusion to estimate transport properties on uncemented and fine grained sediments permeability and entry pressure of mudrocks can be difficult to estimate during micp due to conformance and compressibility errors comisky et al 2011 peng et al 2017 conformance errors are due to surface vugs large grains and irregularities at the surface and are limited when using whole non crushed samples peng et al 2017 for the purposes of this study we assume conformance issues are negligible during the early phase of micp compression errors occur when the voids not yet intruded by mercury begin to compress in response to the increased exterior capillary pressure at high pressure compression errors occur due to compression of organic material and other low density materials peng et al 2017 due to the lack of cementation resedimented samples are likely to experience erroneous prediction of capillary entry pressures due to compressibility errors to prevent this artifact we created calcite cementation through the use of hydrated lime during the consolidation process however our samples are still subject to some early compression particularly in samples without lime to correct for this artifact we assume all mercury intrusion prior to the selected entry pressure is due to compression and subtract this intrusion from our porosity and permeability calculations at 60 000 psi 414 mpa the final stress increment during micp mercury will intrude pore throats as small as 3 nm while substantial porosity in shales may exist beneath 3 nm we assume that porosity in this range is negligible in our samples civil engineering applications often use hydrated lime to stabilize soils sherwood 1993 hydrated lime converts to water and calcium carbonate by absorbing co2 from air here we use this process to create cemented sediments without the unnatural silicates found in concrete unlike resedimented samples without lime our samples remain competent even when saturated with water this trait could prove useful for further flow and transport investigations as well as mechanical studies after consolidation was complete scanning electron microscopy paired with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds was used to examine the fabric of sample 12 20 quartz 40 kaolinite 40 lime fig 6 imaging revealed carbon and calcium signatures present throughout the matrix which corresponds to the lime calcite the addition of lime helps strengthen the resedimented samples and decreases compression during the initial phase of micp a comparison of three high clay content samples one created with hydrated lime and two without shows the difference between samples created with and without cementation fig 7 another artifact introduced by micp measurements is pore structure alteration induced by oven drying capillary forces during drying can move fine grained sediments to grain contacts and pore throats and induce capillary driven cracks shin and santamarina 2011 we limit this process through our use of kaolinite a non swelling clay however all clays swell and shrink to some extent so it cannot be entirely discounted despite some of the mentioned artifacts involved in micp these type of measurements are extremely useful to perform parametric studies with a large number of samples section 4 3 discusses a comparison of the results in transport properties derived from micp with other methods 4 2 fine grained control on transport properties the void ratio e quantifies the space available in a sediment for flow or compression and is proportional to porosity e φ 1 φ the void ratio of a sample is defined as the volume of voids vv divided by the total volume of solid grains vs here we find it insightful to define a fine grained void ratio ef 5 e f v v v s f where vsf is the volume of fine grains similarly a coarse grained void ratio ec can be defined as 6 e c v v v s f v s c where vsc is the volume of coarse grains ef is similar to the definition of void ratio but instead represents how tightly packed the fine grains are regardless of the presence of coarse grains the definition of ec differs from the typical definition of void ratio because it includes the volume of voids and volume of fines in the numerator this ratio represents how tightly packed the coarse grains are with respect to the pores and fine gains a clean sandstone can have a porosity of approximately 33 which corresponds to ec 0 5 therefore 0 5 should be considered the approximate lower bound for ec and the point at which the entire skeleton is composed of coarse grains in contact with one another schneider et al 2011 show that in sediments with silt fractions of 43 and consolidated to 2 4 mpa the coarse grains disturb the alignment of fine grains and contribute to permeability jung et al 2012 propose that above a critical fines content permeability decreases to the permeability of fines in our experiments no particular dependence on ec is apparent instead ef appears to control the transport properties of our samples throughout the range tested this is apparent in the breakthrough pressure bubble plot shown in fig 8 a 8b illustrates the concept of an ec ef space within which the breakthrough pressure is plotted the fine grained void ratio defined above is similar to the void ratio of the clay fraction defined by schneider et al 2011 however we do not define vf as the volume of grains that are clay sized in these experiments we find that vf chosen as the volume of grains smaller than 10 µm yields a suitable power law relationship between pc and ef fig 9 a fig 9b shows the results of an error analysis where the fine grained void ratio was recalculated using different grain size diameter cutoffs and power law functions were fit to the corresponding pc and ef distributions the best correlation r2 closest to 1 occurs at 10 µm we justify the use of 10 µm from a fundamental standpoint by observing that the breakthrough radius or critical pore throat radius rc of the pure quartz sample is 0 9 µm critical path analysis reveals that the transport properties of porous media are primarily controlled by pores which have a radius equal or greater than rc daigle 2016 in sandstones the aspect ratio of pore throats to pore bodies ranges from 5 1 to 10 1 hartmann and beaumont 1999 this means that the percolating pore network of our pure sand sample is most strongly controlled by pore throats that are 1 8 µm in diameter and pore bodies that are approximately 9 18 µm fig 10 in samples that are not pure sand we still expect a similar coarse grained pore network to form as the coarse grained void ratio approaches the lower limit however in these samples the network may be partially filled with grains 10 µm in diameter we hypothesize that the grain diameters which are larger than the pore bodies of the percolating network do not have a significant influence on the advective transport properties of these samples therefore the coarse grains within a mudstone determine the structure of the percolating network while the void ratio within the network controls the breakthrough pressure 4 3 comparison of micp transport properties with other methods given the uncertainties associated with estimating transport properties from micp we compare our findings with those found in the literature permeability crawford et al 2008 consolidated mixtures of fine grained quartz and kaolinite to 50 mpa to evaluate the permeability of fault gouge they measured permeability using water for high permeability samples and argon for lower permeability samples our mixtures from quartz to kaolinite are very similar to these samples and our permeability estimates using purcell s theory agree very closely with their permeability measurements fig 11 a in addition we compared our purcell estimates to permeability measured during consolidation for three of our samples fig 11b despite differences between these samples due to drying and expansion during unloading we show that our purcell estimates are reasonable yang and aplin 2010 developed an empirical relationship between void ratio and permeability based on 376 data points in the literature comprising natural and resedimented mudstones based on the fractional content of grains less than 2 µm and the total void ratio e eq 4 in cited reference the equation is empirical and heavily parametrized but has a coefficient of regression r2 equal to 0 93 and is thus a useful way of comparing our data to the larger literature applying this equation to our data we find that it agrees within an order of magnitude to our permeability estimates from micp data using the purcell model fig 12 a in our purcell model we used the smallest lithology factor used by purcell however given the fine grained nature of our samples a smaller lithology factor could be justified the greatest disagreement between the micp purcell estimates and those derived using yang and aplin 2010 occurs for the 100 quartz sample which is to be expected as their equation was originally fit only to fine grained mudrocks overall we find that micp permeability with purcell s method agrees relatively well with mudrock permeability in the literature entry pressure and breakthrough pressure uncertainty in the contact angle of mercury with minerals adds uncertainty to entry and breakthrough pressure values experiments have found the contact angle between mercury and air on kaolinite is 160 penumadu and dean 2000 however the wettability of kaolinite is difficult to constrain due to the possibility that it contains both a water wet surface and a non water wet surface šolc et al 2011 like pc pe is power law correlated with ef fig 12b this behavior can also be understood by the clogging of larger pores along the perimeter of the sample with fine grains the difference between pc and pe increases with decreasing ef fig 12c which is to be expected given their respective power law relationships fundamentally this difference represents the increase in non wetting phase saturation needed to reach the breakthrough pressure the greatest difference in pc and pe was observed in our pure kaolinite sample which had a non wetting phase saturation of 0 31 at pc the smallest difference was observed in the 75 quartz 25 kaolinite sample which had a non wetting phase saturation of 0 06 at pc these micp capillary entry and breakthrough pressure values from 0 06 to 2 mpa are in good agreement with those reported previously with direct pressure breakthrough measurements for scco2 in silty and clay rich mudrocks ranging from 0 04 to 1 3 mpa espinoza and santamarina 2017 4 4 implications on caprock sealing capacity inserting the breakthrough pressures measured in our experiments into eq 1 we can predict the height of a co2 plume at the onset of percolation across a mudstone caprock for the entire range of sediment mixtures used in our study at 13 8 mpa 2000 psi and 60 c ρ co2 is approximately 600 kg m3 nordbotten et al 2005 and for simplicity ρ b can be estimated as 1000 kg m3 hence the expected co2 plume height would range from 16 4 m in our pure quartz silty sample to as much as 509 m in the pure kaolinite sample a conceptual diagram indicating some of the maximum co2 plume heights that can be held beneath a caprock composed of our resedimented samples is shown in fig 13 the large variability of results highlights the impact of mudrock heterogeneity on potential mudrock sealing capacity ultimately the buoyant flow of co2 in the subsurface is controlled by the heterogeneity of the reservoir lithology including the bedding and facies distribution that compose the reservoir and caprock each of the samples in this study can be characterized with a single ef in reality the ef of a caprock will vary across the formation the use of geophysical tools such as gamma and neturon logs presents an opportunity to characterize the distribution of ef across lithological units understanding this distribution is critical to predict caprock integrity invasion percolation modeling is often used to model this long term buoyant fluid flow behavior due to its ability to include heterogeneity and its computational efficiency trevisan et al 2017 however applying experimental entry pressures during modeling efforts may not be sufficient to predict co2 flow as seen at sleipner cavanagh and haszeldine 2014 in addition to sediment deposition architecture a detailed understanding of the lithology and an understanding of how pc scales with ef will yield better prediction of the plume geometry at the basin scale caprock wettability may be as important as caprock pore structure for determining sealing capacity in this study we have assumed completely water wet caprock θ b co2 0 however there is evidence of contact angles greater than 40 in quartz and clay minerals and even greater than 90 in organic matter rich mudrocks arif et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2015 espinoza and santamarina 2010 guiltinan et al 2017 iglauer et al 2015 roshan et al 2016 a co2 wet caprock may favor co2 storage within the caprock itself but could lead to leaks in the long term if the storage capacity is surpassed 5 conclusions we resedimented samples composed of fine grained quartz kaolinite and lime the addition of lime is shown to be an effective method for cementing resedimented samples micp analysis shows that the breakthrough pressure of these samples is correlated to the fine grained void ratio when the fine grains are taken to be those grains less than approximately 10 µm we hypothesize that the 10 µm threshold for these samples correlates to the pore body and pore throats of the connected pathway at the percolation threshold this means that the coarse grains control the structure of the percolating network while the void ratio within that network controls the transport properties the simplicity of the power law relationship we observe between pc and ef is ideal because estimates of these parameters can be made using geophysical techniques such as gamma and neutron logs permeability estimates of our samples compare well with literature data and we show that the yang and aplin 2010 empirical relationship based upon clay fraction and void ratio validates the results of our micp purcell estimation our results are applicable to mudrocks that have undergone limited diagenesis and may not apply to shales where the percolating pore network can be filled with authigenic minerals while the heterogeneity of natural mudrocks makes them difficult to systematically study future work following our approach could be done to investigate if these relationships persists acknowledgments the authors would like thank glen baum for his help with micp

752,the present study investigates the potential of coupled soil moisture analytical relationship smar and ensemble kalman filter enkf based surface soil moisture data assimilation for improving the streamflow simulations for this purpose synthetic and real data assimilation experiments were carried out using soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model in two different sub catchments lying in the krishna river basin india here the satellite based surface soil moisture estimates from soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and advanced scatterometer ascat are used for assimilation results of the synthetic experiment show that the use of physically based smar scheme coupled with enkf for updating profile soil moisture has better ability to improve the surface flow groundwater flow and consequently streamflow over the covariance based updates using enkf only likewise the real data assimilation experiment also shows smar enkf assimilation strategy performs better than the enkf only updates for simulating streamflow however in both the synthetic as well as real data experiment the improvements are only moderate this restricted success in improving streamflow simulations indicate that updating only the soil moisture through any updating scheme adopted here is not sufficient to reduce the effect of the errors in model forcing on subsequent simulation days keywords data assimilation enkf ascat smos smar soil moisture streamflow swat 1 introduction soil moisture is an essential climate variable and a key component of the water cycle supporting terrestrial ecosystem from hydrological viewpoint soil water has fundamental role in partitioning of the rainfall into surface and subsurface runoff subsequently controlling the water movement evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge considering the importance of long term soil moisture data for hydrological and climatological studies in the past decade many satellite missions have been dedicated for accurate spatiotemporal measurements estimations of soil moisture the examples include soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observation science amsr e njoku et al 2003 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 imaoka et al 2010 the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 2013 however these satellite measurements are limited to top few centimeters of the soil profile most of the hydrological applications require the root zone soil moisture estimates for defining antecedent soil moisture conditions therefore several studies have explored the potential of surface soil moisture estimates to update subsurface soil moisture in hydrological models by using data assimilation techniques for example pauwels et al 2002 crow et al 2005 brocca et al 2010 chen et al 2011 han et al 2012 lievens et al 2015 massari et al 2018 among the various data assimilation techniques used in hydrological applications ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 has been widely utilised for updating the root zone soil moisture estimates using surface observations because of its capacity to deal with non linear models ryu et al 2009 chen et al 2011 han et al 2012 lievens et al 2015 enkf updates the subsurface soil moisture from surface observations based on the forecasted error covariance between surface and subsurface soil moisture estimates hence it solely depends on the ability of the model physics to generate the forecast error covariance for surface and subsurface soil moisture states kumar et al 2009 performed a suite of synthetic experiments using four different land surface models catchment mosaic noah and community land model clm and found that the root zone soil moisture estimation can be more skilful when using models that exhibit better coupling between surface to root zone soil moisture moreover they found that overestimating the surface to root zone coupling in the assimilation system can provide more robust skill improvement in the root zone soil moisture estimation similarly li et al 2010 have used higher vertical correlation in web svat model while perturbing the soil moisture states for improving the vertical coupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture and shown that it can improve the profile soil moisture estimates however a study by chen et al 2011 using swat model and enkf technique have shown that despite high vertical error correlation the enkf was able to update the root zone soil moisture moderately with limited improvements in streamflow simulations han et al 2012 conducted a synthetic study using swat model and found limited improvements in the streamflow recently patil and ramsankaran 2017 conducted an enkf based assimilation study using swat model and shown that perturbing the field capacity of soil can improve the coupling between the surface to subsurface layers however it just led to moderate improvement only in the assimilation performance similarly past studies by albergel et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2015 have shown that although the kalman filter based assimilation techniques are useful to update the profile soil moisture their performance in streamflow improvement is still limited all these studies emphasis upon the need to assess more on the added value of satellite based soil moisture estimates for improving streamflow simulations considering the limited success in the past efforts li et al 2010 chen et al 2011 patil and ramsankaran 2017 it seems new strategies for assimilating satellite soil moisture estimates are need to be developed to further improve the streamflow simulations one possible strategy is to use some independent subsurface soil moisture estimation relationships coupled in data assimilation framework till date there are three methods available viz exponential filter linear relationship and soil moisture anlytical relationship smar to estimate root zone soil moisture dynamics from surface measurements wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2008 manfreda et al 2014 these studies were primarily focused on increasing the applicability of the satellite based soil moisture retrievals for estimating root zone soil moisture estimates using time series of the surface measurements wagner et al 1999 proposed an exponential filter which depends on only one parameter and its recursive formulation was given by the albergel et al 2008 use of exponential filter from albergel et al 2008 for estimating subsurface soil moisture prior to assimilation in a hydrologic model with vertically lumped soil profile has been reported by previous studies brocca et al 2010 massari et al 2015 brocca et al 2012 carried out an assimilation of surface and root zone soil moisture products obtained by the exponential filter developed by albergel et al 2008 and shown that the vertically extended soil moisture estimates have resulted clear improvements in the assimilation performance recently manfreda et al 2014 proposed a new physically based approach called soil moisture analytical relationship smar for estimating root zone soil moisture this approach is dependent on total seven parameters relating to the physical characteristics of the soil profile however they also shown that these seven parameters can be further assigned to physically consistent four parameters and calibration of these four parameters on historic time series gave good performance for simulating root zone soil moisture recently baldwin et al 2017 have effectively used the smar approach to predict the root zone soil moisture for conterminous united states and proposed smar enkf model to consider the regional scale biases considering the recent availability of physically based independent subsurface soil moisture estimation relationships like smar it is sensible to explore the efficacy of the smar based subsurface soil moisture estimates when coupled with enkf assimilation to enhance skill improvement of hydrological models at the same time it is also important to analyse such assimilation schemes especially in the widely used hydrological models like swat which has already reported suboptimal assimilation performance for improving streamflow simulations hence to understand and evaluate the performance of enkf to update the profile soil moisture of swat hydrological model when coupled with smar soil moisture estimates a detailed analysis has been carried out using both synthetic as well as real data assimilation experimental runs to validate the applicability of the proposed approach under varied catchment characteristics real data analysis has been carried out in two catchments in krishna river basin india following this introduction section 1 in section 2 a description of the study area dataset used and a brief introduction on swat hydrologic model are given along with the overall methodology adopted section 3 discusses the results obtained for synthetic and real data experiments finally the summary conclusions and future directions are discussed in section 4 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area and datasets to test the proposed methodology two catchments in krishna river basin india are selected in the present study as shown in fig 1 the first catchment is of the wyra river fig 1a covering an area of 1650 km2 up to madhira river gauging site major landuse in this catchment is agriculture 70 6 followed by deciduous forests 14 1 rangeland 6 2 pasture 5 urban 1 7 waterbodies 1 5 and others 0 9 most soils in the study area are clayey loam and clay the catchment receives an average annual rainfall of 1090 mm out of which 90 rainfall is generally received within june to october monsoon period the second catchment is of the varada river fig 1b which covers an area of 5092 km2 up to marol river gauging site major land use in this catchment are agriculture 77 5 followed by deciduous forests 10 7 pasture 5 3 evergreen forest 4 5 and others 2 major soil type in this catchment are clayey loam and sandy clayey loam this catchment lies in the leeward side of the western ghats and receives 1560 mm average annual rainfall the details of the land use land cover lulc digital elevation model dem soil datasets meteorological forcing datasets and observed streamflow and soil moisture datasets for both selected catchments are given in table 1 rainfall data for both the study catchments have been obtained from rain gauge observations for wyara catchment gridded rainfall obtained from india metrological department imd pai et al 2014 has been used for varada catchment tahasil taluk level daily average rainfall data obtained from karnataka state natural disaster monitoring centre ksndmc has been used among thematic datasets food and agriculture fao world harmonized soil dataset hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2009 with two layer soil information 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm is used for wyara catchment for varada catchment soil map from national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup is used based on the requirement of the data assimilation experiments for both catchments only two layers of soil profile with 0 5 cm top layer and 5 100 cm root zone layer were prepared using weighted averaging of original soil profile information to test the proposed methodology in a robust manner and to endorse the validity of the results a detailed analysis have been carried out using two different satellite based soil moisture products therefore depending on the data availability the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission level 3 l3 and advanced scatterometer ascat version h113 soil moisture products are used in the present study the smos soil moisture products provided by catds centre aval de traitement des données are available since january 2010 with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 among the available data quality flags it is found that the data quality index dqx of the retrieval algorithm and the radio frequency interference rfi from local illumination sources are dominant in the present study area and hence they were used for defining observation errors the ascat h113 product is combination of metop a and metop b satellites with spatial sampling of 0 125 0 125 later resampled at 0 25 0 25 these products are distributed by eumetsat satellite application facility on support to operational hydrology and water management h saf among the data quality flags in ascat soil moisture error sm noise is used for defining the observation errors all other datasets such as dem landuse landcover map for both catchments are from common source as given in table 1 2 2 swat hydrological model setup soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 is process based semi distributed continuous time hydrological model which also simulates the crop growth sediments and pollutants yield from a catchment all these modules are dependent mainly on the underlying hydrological model simulating all hydrological processes in a catchment for considering the spatial heterogeneity swat divides the entire catchment into smaller sub basins each sub basin is further sub divided into virtual hydrological response units hru representing areas with same land use soil and slope information all land surface processes are carried out at each hru and final water balance is ensured in the present study the partitioning of rainfall into surface and sub surface runoff is carried out using scs curve number cn scs 1972 method once the surface runoff is computed the remaining water is allowed to flow through each soil layer water entering in the soil profile is routed using storage routing methodology at each hru during this the storage routing methodology first fulfil the field water capacity of upper soil layer and calculate the excess soil water as 1 s w ly excess q perc ly 1 f c ly swly excess is the water content in a soil layer above the field capacity mm qperc ly is the amount of water percolating in lower soil layers mm and fcly is the depth of water in soil layer when it is at field capacity mm from the excess soil water if available the lateral flows are calculated as 2 q lat 0 024 2 s w ly excess k sat ly slp ϕ d l hill where ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h slp is the steepness of a slope m m ϕd is the drainable porosity of soil layer mm mm and lhill is the hillslope length m once the lateral flow requirement is computed this excess soil water is allowed to percolate to deeper soil layers considering the hydraulic conductivity of soil layer as given in eq 3 3 q perc ly s w ly excess 1 exp δ t k sat ly sa t ly f c ly where δt is time step h and satly is the depth of water in soil layer when completely saturated mm if the deeper layer is already saturated then the percolation is restricted and the excess water is allowed to meet the surface runoff similarly the percolation from the lowest layer meets the aquifer system and contributes to groundwater flow all the processes related to flow generation surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow are carried out at each hru and then the different flow components are directly linked to sub basin outlet based on lag routing function once the water enters in to channel then it is routed to basin outlet using linear reservoir concept in the present study the swat hydrologic model is set up for wyra and varada catchments using the datasets described in section 2 1 for a distributed application of the meteorological forcing the catchment is divided into 33 sub basins with areas varying from 20 km2 to 100 km2 fig 1a and b for facilitating the assimilation of coarser grid satellite based soil moisture retrievals at sub basin level one hru per sub basin is delineated as per dominant land use soil type and slope class based on availability of rainfall and river discharge datasets the swat hydrological model was calibrated for seven years 2003 2009 for wyara catchment and four years 2006 2009 for varada catchment with extra two year spin up period model calibration was performed using the available observed discharge at basin outlets located at madhira for wyara catchment and marol for varada catchment fig 1 model input parameters were optimised using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 in swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 to maximise the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of the simulated streamflow total 13 model parameters were selected for calibration based on the past studies arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 patil and ramsankaran 2017 table 2 summarises all calibrated model parameters ranges used for their calibration and the final calibrated values 2 3 soil moisture analytical relationship smar to derive the subsurface soil moisture estimates from surface measurements the soil moisture analytical relationship smar proposed by manfreda et al 2014 has been utilised the smar is a physically based relation between surface and root zone soil moisture derived from soil water balance equations and having physically consistent parameter set which can be measured on the field or can be calibrated smar defines the soil profile in two layers surface layer equivalent to observation depth of satellite soil moisture 5 cm 10 cm and root zone layer 60 cm 150 cm to calculate the water flux between two soil layers in absence of rainfall information the flux from the surface to root zone layer can be considered significant only when the surface layer soil moisture exceeds its field capacity smar assumes that soil water above field capacity in surface layer moves down to root zone layer in one day green and ampt 1911 laio 2006 and horizontal and lateral flows are negligible and hence assumed to be zero therefore the infiltration flux from surface layer to root zone layer can occur instantaneously and the fraction of saturation infiltrating to root zone layer y tj can be given as 4 y t j s 1 t j s fc 1 i f s 1 t j s c 1 0 i f s 1 t j s c 1 where s1 is the relative saturation of the surface soil layer sfc1 is the relative soil saturation of surface layer at field capacity once the infiltrating water to deeper layer is known the root zone soil moisture can be computed using discrete form smar equation as 5 s 2 t j s w 2 s 2 t j 1 s w 2 e a t j t j 1 1 s w 2 b y t j t j t j 1 where s2 is the relative saturation of the root zone soil layer sw2 is the relative saturation of root zone soil layer at wilting point tj is the current time step the parameters a and b can are given as 6 a v 2 1 s w 2 n 2 z 2 b n 1 z 1 1 s w 2 n 2 z 2 where v2 mm day is the soil water loss coefficient accounting all losses at root zone soil layer n1 and n2 are the soil porosity for surface and root zone layers and z1 mm and z2 mm are the depth of soil layer at surface and root zone layers therefore parameter a day 1 is a water loss coefficient which controls the daily root zone water loss and given as ratio of the water loss coefficient to the total root zone storage parameter b is the diffusivity coefficient and given as the ratio of surface soil storage to root zone soil storage considering the parameters a and b it can be said that the first square bracket of eq 5 contributes the amount of moisture lost over a given time step and second square bracket of the eq 5 represents the amount of moisture diffused from surface to root zone layer in the present study due to the absence of field data the four parameters such as sw2 sfc1 a and b were only calibrated for each sub basin following manfreda et al 2014 to keep the calibration period different than the assimilation experiment calibration of the smar was carried out using january 2014 to december 2015 datasets during synthetic and real data experiments a calibration was performed using particle swarm optimization pso approach to match the swat simulated long term subsurface soil moisture with nse as an objective function 2 4 data assimilation 2 4 1 enkf enkf is a monte carlo approximation of the standard kalman filter kalman et al 1960 enkf is sequential data assimilation technique that updates the model predictions by optimally merging the observations to do this enkf explicitly computes the error covariance of model predictions and observations using monte carlo approach and produces an analysis estimate which is the best linear unbiased estimate blue of the priors the brief description of enkf update procedure is given below at given time step t the ensemble model forecast x can be given as 7 x t 1 i m x t i u t i w k 1 where m represents nonlinear model u represents the ensemble of model forcing and w is noise representing overall errors in model forecasts including errors in forcing parametrisation and model physics the superscript i represents the ensemble matrix with sign for prior and sign for posterior similarly the observation ensemble can be derived using model forecast as 8 z t 1 i h t x t 1 i v t 1 where h is the observation operator mapping the model states to the observations z is the model predicted observation and v is noise representing errors in the observation and independent of model errors given this information the data assimilation step in the enkf can be given as 9 x k 1 i x k 1 i k z k 1 i z k 1 i where x k 1 i is an forecasted ensemble state x k 1 i is an ensemble of model state after assimilation i e analysis z k 1 i is an observation ensemble generated using observation covariance matrix σ k 1 z and k is kalman gain ensuring best linear unbiased estimate of model forecast and observation and given as 10 k σ k 1 xz σ k 1 zz σ k 1 z 1 where σ k 1 zz is the covariance of the model predicted observation ensemble obtained from h k x k 1 i and σ k 1 xz is the cross covariance of the model forecast and observation prediction 2 4 2 synthetic experiment firstly to understand and evaluate the ability of the proposed smar based enkf assimilation scheme for improving the swat streamflow simulations a synthetic data assimilation experiment was carried out at wyara river catchment for this purpose four model runs such as true open loop enkf smar enkf were carried out in synthetic experiment the calibrated swat model run from june 2010 to december 2013 in deterministic mode is considered as true run true scenario after that the smar model was calibrated using synthetically generated observations from true surface soil moisture as input to predict the model simulated root zone soil moisture for generation of the open loop synthetic run the true scenario was perturbed and the calibrated swat model was run in an ensemble mode using a degraded precipitation and soil moisture to represent a realistic erroneous model run during enkf assimilation run a synthetically generated ensemble observations were used for updating the ensemble of surface and subsurface soil moisture estimates with the help of inherent covariance based updating procedure in the enkf during the smar enkf assimilation run the swat simulated ensemble of surface soil moisture and subsurface soil moisture were updated using the ensemble of synthetic observations and smar derived ensemble of subsurface soil moisture estimates respectively with the help of enkf it shall be noted that during smar enkf assimilation run the surface and sub surface observations were assimilated independently to each layer for generation of open loop run spatially homogeneous and temporally uncorrelated multiplicative gaussian noise of zero mean and 0 3 mm mm standard deviation was applied to the rainfall data similarly zero mean and 0 05 mm mm and 0 15 mm mm standard deviation gaussian noise was added to the surface and subsurface layer soil moisture during model simulations to account the model as we all as the input parameter uncertainties during the open loop run the swat model was run with a 100 member ensemble realisation for generation of ensemble forecast since the actual error in the input and model uncertainties are known during synthetic experiment through testing of any assimilation scheme is possible accordingly the error characteristics used for degrading rainfall and soil moisture as mentioned earlier were applied for generation of rainfall and soil moisture ensembles as well following patil and ramsankaran 2017 the field capacity of the soil was also perturbed with gaussian noise of zero mean and 0 1 mm mm standard deviation for both surface and subsurface soil layers to maintain minimum ensemble spread during high rainfall days following flores et al 2010 lain hypercube sampling technique was used for generation of random number for all types of sampling in the present study to maintain the quality of the ensembles generated rainfall variable was considered as semi restricted and soil moisture was considered as fully restricted variables for ensemble model simulations as suggested by turner et al 2008 similarly following ryu et al 2009 biases due to ensemble model run were corrected using simple delta change method for generating synthetic observations with observation errors the simulated surface soil moisture obtained in the true scenario was degraded using fixed gaussian noise of zero mean and 0 3 mm mm standard deviation these synthetic observations were used for assimilation purpose during enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs with same observation error covariance used for degrading them following chen et al 2011 a vertical error correlation of one was used for perturbing soil moisture states during enkf run to account for the effect of differences in random errors generated to produce open loop run due to different random seed all synthetic model runs such as open loop smar enkf and enkf were repeated over 25 times to generate an ensemble of simulations this ensemble of simulations would allow us to evaluate the expected model performance during both enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs 2 4 3 real data experiment to evaluate the proposed assimilation approach in real conditions a real data experiment was carried out in both the study catchments in this experiment the level 3 smos retrievals and version h113 ascat retrievals as described in section 2 1 were used as observed soil moisture estimates both these observations were spatially averaged using area weighted averaging approach to represent the sub basin level soil moisture and then bias corrected using the model simulated long term surface layer soil moisture time series through mean variance bias correction approach lievens et al 2015 massari et al 2015 it should be noted that the smar model was calibrated using the bias corrected smos as well as ascat observations for each catchment individually to match the swat simulated sub surface soil moisture as discussed in section 2 3 during the real data experiment the swat model simulations were carried out for the same assimilation period as that of synthetic run i e from june 2010 to dec 2013 the open loop run in the real data experiment is defined as the calibrated swat model run with the ensemble model simulation with no data assimilation during data assimilation in real data study two satellite based soil moisture retrievals smos and ascat were assessed separately for enkf and smar enkf runs therefore total five model runs were assessed in real data experiment namely open loop enkfsmos enkfascat smar enkfsmos and smar enkfascat during open loop run the ensemble model simulations were generated by perturbing rainfall soil moisture and soil moisture field capacity with same input error covariance structure as used during the synthetic experiment like synthetic enkf run a vertical error correlation of one was used for perturbing soil moisture states during enkf run in real data experiment as well for defining the observation error of smos retrievals the observation error was linearly scaled by using the data quality indices such as dqx and rfi available with smos products therefore ensemble of observation was represented by applying dynamic gaussian noise to the observed soil moisture with zero mean and standard deviation of σ obs smos mm mm which is given as 11 σ obs smos α dqx dqx α rfi rfi in both the study area s the dqx is varying from 0 01 to 0 1 and rfi is varying from 0 01 to 0 4 considering the higher rfi in the study catchments and its subsequent effect on smos soil moisture retrievals a 30 observation uncertainty is assumed arbitrarily accordingly considering the dqx and rfi distributions in the available data the dimensionless parameters αdqx and αrfi are set to 1 5 in eq 8 so that the σ obs smos represents the assumed 30 uncertainty i e 0 3 mm mm similarly the observation error for ascat retrievals is defined by linearly scaling the soil moisture noise sm noise provided with ascat products similar to the smos observations ensemble of ascat observations were represented by applying dynamic gaussian noise to the observed soil moisture with zero mean and standard deviation of σ obs smos mm mm which is given as 12 σ obs smos α sm noise sm noise in the present case the sm noise is varying from 0 02 to 0 06 considering the relatively robust soil moisture retrievals from ascat as not much affected by rfi compared to smos soil moisture estimates 10 uncertainty is assumed arbitrary therefore to get the average soil moisture error of 0 1 mm mm the α sm noise was set to 3 in the present study 2 5 performance evaluation performance of the model simulated streamflow were evaluated using rmse pbias nse and assimilation efficiency eff most of these statistics are common and well known therefore formulations for assimilation efficiency eff is only given here following aubert et al 2003 the eff metric is calculated as 13 eff 1 t 1 n q a t q obs t 2 t 1 n q ol t q obs t 2 where qobs qa and qol are observed discharge simulated discharge from assimilation run and open loop run respectively an eff more than zero indicates that the assimilation run shows better streamflow simulations than the open loop model simulations and vice versa 3 results and discussions 3 1 smar calibration distributions of the calibrated smar parameters along with nse of the predicted soil moisture at all sub basins in wyara and varada catchments are plotted as boxplots in fig 2 fig 2a represents the calibration performance while using synthetic observations as input for wyara catchment figs 2b c and d e show the calibration performance in wyara and vardha catchments respectively while using smos and ascat soil moisture estimates as input it shall be noted that the values of all the calibrated parameters of the smar model shown in fig 2 are having similar ranges reported by manfreda et al 2014 for few different observation sites which gives some confidence in the calibration results in absence of observed field data the nse fig 2 of the simulated subsurface soil moisture for both catchments are well above 0 8 during all five calibration runs highlighting the robustness of smar algorithm to accurately simulate sub surface soil moisture under different input soil moisture characteristics at the same time it is noticed that the calibrated range of parameter sfc1 and parameter b in case of wyara catchment are significantly different for smos and ascat soil moisture products in both study catchments fig 2b e even though the calibration was performed using bias corrected data of each satellite product this change in calibrated values might be because of number of observations present in each surface soil moisture dataset for example ascat has higher revisit time over both the study areas when compared to smos revisit time therefore field capacity of surface layer soil moisture sfc1 parameter is showing higher sensitivity as it directly controls the amount of water entering to root zone soil moisture from surface observations to know how the smar derived sub surface soil moisture and swat simulated subsurface soil moisture are varying in each sub basin a comparison of the same for each sub basin is given in figs a1 a5 of the appendix a from figs a1 a5 given in appendix a it can be seen that the smar estimated average subsurface soil moisture is in very good agreement with the swat simulated soil moisture at layer 2 for most of the times in both catchments 3 2 synthetic experiment the results obtained from four model runs such as true open loop enkf and smar enkf carried out during the synthetic experiment at wyara catchment are discussed herein out of the four model runs mentioned above three model runs such as open loop enkf and smar enkf run were repeated 25 times to avoid the ambiguities due to different random number seeds while assessing the model performance with respect to true run therefore the swat model is evaluated for these three model runs to assess its average performance in computation of evapotranspiration et surface runoff sr surface layer layer 1 soil moisture s1 subsurface layer 2 soil moisture s2 profile soil moisture sm lateral flow lt deep percolation from soil profile dp groundwater contribution from shallow aquifer gw and streamflow st the distribution of nse obtained for the aforementioned variables from 25 simulations are shown as boxplots in fig 3a b and c for open loop enkf and smar enkf run respectively the computation of nse is done for all variables after taking the area weighted average over entire basin except streamflow st which represents channel routed streamflow at basin outlet by comparing nse of the open loop run fig 3a and enkf run fig 3b it can be seen that the errors in the evapotranspiration et surface soil moisture s1 subsurface soil moisture s2 and profile soil moisture sm are significantly reduced in enkf run and thus resulted in much higher nse values than the open loop run however these updates were not fully conveyed to the updates in the surface runoff sr lateral flow lt and streamflow st and hence they show only moderate improvements as compared to the open loop run contrarily it is observed that the nse of groundwater gw was not improved significantly during the enkf run fig 3b than open loop run fig 3a which is major contributor to the streamflow around 62 in the true run from fig 3c it is observed that the smar enkf scheme have also obtained very similar improvements for evapotranspiration et and soil moisture s1 s2 and sm like enkf run fig 3b when compared to the open loop run fig 3a similarly though the improvements in the surface runoff sr lateral flow lt groundwater flow gw and streamflow st during smar enkf run fig 3c are moderate when compared to open loop run fig 3a they are still better than the enkf run fig 3b however smar enkf model run gave relatively much better improved nse for groundwater gw flows perhaps as a result of this improvement in nse of the groundwater flow component gw the streamflow st is showing better improvements during smar enkf fig 3c run than the enkf run fig 3b the results of this synthetic study are in accordance with the previous studies by chen et al 2011 brocca et al 2012 fairbairn et al 2015 and massari et al 2018 wherein they have stated that the surface soil moisture assimilation scheme for updating soil moisture profile have resulted in moderate to high improvements in sub surface soil moisture while limited improvements in the simulated streamflow further to understand why the streamflow st is simulated better during smar enkf run than the enkf run a qualitative analysis has been done using the time series plots shown in fig 4 a g fig 4a represents the time series of average rainfall pattern observed in the wyra basin which was used for performing synthetic experiment fig 4b g represents the time series plot of area weighted average of the variables such as sm sr lt dp gw and st except s1 and s2 as sm represents the sum of both obtained from 25 simulations of open loop enkf and smar enkf runs as well as the area weighted average of these variables obtained from true run respectively from fig 4b it is observed that during monsoon season june to september of each year the covariance based updates of enkf run have slightly underestimated the profile soil moisture sm when compared with the true run in the swat model the curve number cn computations are highly sensitive to soil moisture values when soil moisture is around field capacity han et al 2012 patil and ramsankaran 2017 therefore the slight sub optimal performance of enkf run during monsoon season has subsequently caused a reduction in the lateral flow lt fig 4d and substantial reduction in the deep percolation dp yellow line in fig 4e which is an inflow to the shallow aquifer in swat this reduction in the deep percolation dp during enkf run has resulted in a significant drop in the groundwater contribution from shallow aquifer gw for the entire simulation period as shown in fig 4f therefore it can be said that these reductions observed in lt dp gw have resulted in decrease in streamflow st estimates during enkf run when compared to true run as seen in fig 4g from fig 4b it is observed that the updates in the profile soil moisture during smar enkf run are matching well with the true run in the monsoon season june september for each year and it is found to be better than enkf run when compared to true run as a result of this the improvement in the deep percolation dp fig 4e is found to be better than the enkf run for the entire simulation period considering the significant contribution of groundwater flow gw to the streamflow one can say that the above improvement in gw estimates could have resulted in more accurate estimates of the streamflow st fig 4g as confirmed with the nse plots in fig 3c to analyse the skill improvement of the simulated streamflow s at multiple stations a statistical evaluation of the simulated streamflow s obtained from all three model runs at spatially distributed six internal sub basin id s 7 18 22 26 28 and 33 outlets has been carried and thus obtained results are given in table 3 the spatial location of these six sub basin outlets can be found in fig 1a i e wyara catchment from table 3 it can be seen that while both enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs have produced better results than the open loop run smar enkf has outperformed enkf run at five of the six outlet points except sub basin id 7 for all the metrices considered here it is noteworthy to mention that the overall assimilation efficiency eff of the simulated streamflow at the outlet of the catchment i e sub basin id 33 is 18 for enkf run whereas it is improved to 55 during smar enkf run while both assimilation schemes have produced improvements in the simulated streamflow the vertically extended subsurface soil moisture updates using coupled smar enkf scheme presented here has shown that it has better capability to improve the streamflow estimates nevertheless it should be noted that the improvements in the nse of the simulated streamflow during both assimilation runs are still not substantially high than the open loop run even during synthetic experiments from another data assimilation experiment representing an ideal assimilation condition refer appendix b where the surface and sub surface true observations were assimilated into the model using direct insertion approach it was found that the average improvement in streamflow nse was 0 87 despite profile soil moisture having nse close to 1 this experiment which represents an ideal assimilation condition reveals that the effect of the errors in forcing datasets cannot be fully corrected by assimilating only the intermediate model state variables such as soil moisture as highlighted by massari et al 2018 and alvarez garreton et al 2016 this might be another reason which limited the model performance to a moderate level during enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs for streamflow simulations 3 3 real data experiment 3 3 1 at wyra catchment the results obtained from all five model runs viz open loop enkfsmos enkfascat smar enkfsmos and smar enkfascat during the real data experiment in wyra catchment are shown as time series plots in fig 5 a f fig 5a c represents the area weighted average of the simulated soil moisture for layer one s1 and the layer two s2 along with the simulated streamflow q at the basin outlet respectively while using smos observations for assimilation similarly fig 5d f represents the same outputs respectively while using ascat observations for assimilation from figs 5a and d it can be seen that the smos satellite have 2 3 days revisit time over the study area while the ascat satellite have 1 2 days revisit time it should be noted that the surface soil moisture updates during enkf and smar enkf run are same fig 5a and d it is mainly because both assimilation runs update the surface layer soil moisture using observations either smos or ascat under same forecast and observation errors from fig 5b and e it can be seen that the updates of the root zone soil moisture s2 during enkf run possess more variations than open loop run and these variations are more dominant while using ascat soil moisture retrievals which represents higher revisit time at the same time this kind of fluctuations are less common in the subsurface soil moisture updates during smar enkf assimilation runs fig 5b and e especially while using ascat soil moisture for assimilation fig 5e this is because the subsurface soil moisture updates are consistently augmented by the physically derived smar estimates from fig 5c and f it can be seen that the streamflow simulated during smar enkf runs are marginally better match than enkf runs moreover significant updates in the simulated streamflow from both assimilation runs are apparent during low flows than high flows table 4 a shows statistical evaluation results for the simulated streamflow from all five model runs in the real data experiment at wyra catchment from this table it is seen that though both assimilation runs have better results than the open loop run smar enkf assimilation scheme shows better performance than enkf run in all the presented statistics it is also seen that in wyara catchment the smos soil moisture gave better assimilation efficiency 0 26 and 0 31 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively over ascat soil moisture 0 21 and 0 24 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively 3 3 2 at varada catchment the results obtained from the real data experiment runs in varada catchment are shown in fig 6 a f here the nature of the surface soil moisture assimilation fig 6a and d is similar to wyara catchment in terms of revisit time of smos and ascat soil moisture and the closeness in the assimilated surface soil moisture during enkf and smar enkf runs likewise the updates in the root zone soil moisture s2 fig 6b and e are smoother during smar enkf over enkf run as seen in the wyara catchment however while using ascat soil moisture for assimilation using enkf scheme the fluctuations in updated s2 are relatively less in varada catchment fig 6e than the wyara catchment fig 5e among all assimilation runs the simulated streamflow fig 6c and f from smar enkf run matches well with observed streamflow however some significant improvements are seen during low flows only table 4b shows statistical evaluation results for the simulated streamflow obtained during all five model runs from the real data experiment in varada catchment contrary to the wyara catchment use of ascat soil moisture gave better assimilation efficiency 0 20 and 0 27 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively over smos observations 0 28 and 0 37 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively in varada catchment the overall results of the real data experiment from two study catchments clearly show the enhanced ability of the smar enkf scheme to improve streamflow simulations than the traditional enkf scheme these results are in accordance with the results seen during synthetic experiment fig 3 and table 3 further a qualitative analysis of the simulated streamflow shows that both the assimilation schemes could not improve the peak flows while the low flows were improved marginally these results are analogous to the earlier studies by chen et al 2014 and alvarez garreton et al 2016 where they found that the surface soil moisture data assimilation using state correction scheme was able to improve the model simulations during low flows only perhaps the non assurance of the observation and input error variances during real data assimilation experiment might have hampered the assimilation results to some extent additionally the inability of state updating scheme to entirely correct the errors due to inaccurate forcing massari et al 2018 alvarez garreton et al 2016 can be another reason for achieving only moderate improvements in the simulated streamflow 4 summary and conclusions the present study proposes a new assimilation strategy by coupling soil moisture analytical relationship smar with enkf for improving streamflow simulations for this purpose synthetic and real data assimilation experiments were carried out using swat hydrological model to systematically analyse the additional benefits of coupling the smar based subsurface soil moisture estimates in enkf data assimilation framework in synthetic experiment the proposed assimilation scheme is analysed under known forecast and observation error covariance at wyra river catchment lying in krishna basin india in real data assimilation experiment the level 3 soil moisture product of smos and ascat h113 version retrievals were used for assimilating into swat hydrological model all the real data experimental runs were carried out using the available data between june 2010 and december 2013 at wyara and varada catchments lying in the krishna river basin the obtained results from synthetic experiment suggest that the physically based relationship like smar coupled with enkf for smar enkf run can be successfully used to update the sub surface soil moisture which helped to improve the model simulated flow components like surface runoff lateral flows and groundwater flows better than enkf only updates enkf run these improvements during smar enkf run helped in producing reasonably better streamflow estimates than the traditional enkf assimilation scheme during the real data assimilation experiment it is found that the physically consistent subsurface updates from smar enkf produced smoother subsurface soil moisture variations than the covariance based updates by enkf similar to the synthetic experiment in real data experiment too the smar enkf assimilation strategy has shown improved streamflow estimates than enkf run in both study catchments at the same time the overall results indicate that though the proposed smar enkf assimilation scheme is able to improve the streamflow simulations they are only moderate during both synthetic and real data experiments it is found that these improvements were mainly coming from low flow components of the simulated streamflow one of the possible reasons behind the moderate improvements in simulated streamflow could be because at the end of day the soil moisture updates are unable to fully compensate the errors in model simulated flow components surface runoff groundwater flow etc due to the errors in the forcing data rainfall at next day additionally the initial uncertainty distributions assumed for forecast and observations might have also affected the results of real data assimilation in the present study however this has not been analysed herein finally from the overall results it can be concluded that the limitations in the enkf based surface soil moisture data assimilation practices for improving the streamflow simulations can be reasonably overcome by coupling appropriate independent profile soil moisture estimation approaches such as smar within the enkf assimilation framework this finding could be particularly useful for assimilating satellite soil moisture observations in studies such as land surface modelling agricultural drought modelling which seeks accurate root zone soil moisture estimations however further detailed analysis should be carried out to confirm the suitability ability of this proposed approach in different model structures and different climatic conditions acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments to improve the article supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j advwatres 2018 08 010 appendix c supplementary materials image application 1 appendix a appendix b fig b 1 shows the nse for open loop and assimilation runs of swat model with ideal assimilation conditions where the observations and assimilation strategy are assumed to be perfect it is to be noted that the open loop run of this experiment is same as that of the open loop run carried out in synthetic experiment as mentioned in section 2 4 2 during data assimilation run the model simulated surface and subsurface soil moisture states were updated by true soil moisture i e without any observation error using direct insertion assimilation strategy from fig b1 it can be seen that although the assimilation experiment updated the surface and subsurface soil moisture very accurately these improvements did not helped in improvement of surface runoff deep percolation and thus streamflow this is mainly because updating the soil moisture states at end of a simulation day can only improve the antecedent soil moisture conditions which will improve the partitioning of rainfall into surface and subsurface flow components during next simulation day however the errors in the rainfall during next rainy day are not removed by soil moisture assimilation and thus resulted in moderate improvements in the model simulated runoff components such as surface flow deep percolation and streamflow 
752,the present study investigates the potential of coupled soil moisture analytical relationship smar and ensemble kalman filter enkf based surface soil moisture data assimilation for improving the streamflow simulations for this purpose synthetic and real data assimilation experiments were carried out using soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model in two different sub catchments lying in the krishna river basin india here the satellite based surface soil moisture estimates from soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and advanced scatterometer ascat are used for assimilation results of the synthetic experiment show that the use of physically based smar scheme coupled with enkf for updating profile soil moisture has better ability to improve the surface flow groundwater flow and consequently streamflow over the covariance based updates using enkf only likewise the real data assimilation experiment also shows smar enkf assimilation strategy performs better than the enkf only updates for simulating streamflow however in both the synthetic as well as real data experiment the improvements are only moderate this restricted success in improving streamflow simulations indicate that updating only the soil moisture through any updating scheme adopted here is not sufficient to reduce the effect of the errors in model forcing on subsequent simulation days keywords data assimilation enkf ascat smos smar soil moisture streamflow swat 1 introduction soil moisture is an essential climate variable and a key component of the water cycle supporting terrestrial ecosystem from hydrological viewpoint soil water has fundamental role in partitioning of the rainfall into surface and subsurface runoff subsequently controlling the water movement evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge considering the importance of long term soil moisture data for hydrological and climatological studies in the past decade many satellite missions have been dedicated for accurate spatiotemporal measurements estimations of soil moisture the examples include soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observation science amsr e njoku et al 2003 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 imaoka et al 2010 the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 2013 however these satellite measurements are limited to top few centimeters of the soil profile most of the hydrological applications require the root zone soil moisture estimates for defining antecedent soil moisture conditions therefore several studies have explored the potential of surface soil moisture estimates to update subsurface soil moisture in hydrological models by using data assimilation techniques for example pauwels et al 2002 crow et al 2005 brocca et al 2010 chen et al 2011 han et al 2012 lievens et al 2015 massari et al 2018 among the various data assimilation techniques used in hydrological applications ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 has been widely utilised for updating the root zone soil moisture estimates using surface observations because of its capacity to deal with non linear models ryu et al 2009 chen et al 2011 han et al 2012 lievens et al 2015 enkf updates the subsurface soil moisture from surface observations based on the forecasted error covariance between surface and subsurface soil moisture estimates hence it solely depends on the ability of the model physics to generate the forecast error covariance for surface and subsurface soil moisture states kumar et al 2009 performed a suite of synthetic experiments using four different land surface models catchment mosaic noah and community land model clm and found that the root zone soil moisture estimation can be more skilful when using models that exhibit better coupling between surface to root zone soil moisture moreover they found that overestimating the surface to root zone coupling in the assimilation system can provide more robust skill improvement in the root zone soil moisture estimation similarly li et al 2010 have used higher vertical correlation in web svat model while perturbing the soil moisture states for improving the vertical coupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture and shown that it can improve the profile soil moisture estimates however a study by chen et al 2011 using swat model and enkf technique have shown that despite high vertical error correlation the enkf was able to update the root zone soil moisture moderately with limited improvements in streamflow simulations han et al 2012 conducted a synthetic study using swat model and found limited improvements in the streamflow recently patil and ramsankaran 2017 conducted an enkf based assimilation study using swat model and shown that perturbing the field capacity of soil can improve the coupling between the surface to subsurface layers however it just led to moderate improvement only in the assimilation performance similarly past studies by albergel et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2015 have shown that although the kalman filter based assimilation techniques are useful to update the profile soil moisture their performance in streamflow improvement is still limited all these studies emphasis upon the need to assess more on the added value of satellite based soil moisture estimates for improving streamflow simulations considering the limited success in the past efforts li et al 2010 chen et al 2011 patil and ramsankaran 2017 it seems new strategies for assimilating satellite soil moisture estimates are need to be developed to further improve the streamflow simulations one possible strategy is to use some independent subsurface soil moisture estimation relationships coupled in data assimilation framework till date there are three methods available viz exponential filter linear relationship and soil moisture anlytical relationship smar to estimate root zone soil moisture dynamics from surface measurements wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2008 manfreda et al 2014 these studies were primarily focused on increasing the applicability of the satellite based soil moisture retrievals for estimating root zone soil moisture estimates using time series of the surface measurements wagner et al 1999 proposed an exponential filter which depends on only one parameter and its recursive formulation was given by the albergel et al 2008 use of exponential filter from albergel et al 2008 for estimating subsurface soil moisture prior to assimilation in a hydrologic model with vertically lumped soil profile has been reported by previous studies brocca et al 2010 massari et al 2015 brocca et al 2012 carried out an assimilation of surface and root zone soil moisture products obtained by the exponential filter developed by albergel et al 2008 and shown that the vertically extended soil moisture estimates have resulted clear improvements in the assimilation performance recently manfreda et al 2014 proposed a new physically based approach called soil moisture analytical relationship smar for estimating root zone soil moisture this approach is dependent on total seven parameters relating to the physical characteristics of the soil profile however they also shown that these seven parameters can be further assigned to physically consistent four parameters and calibration of these four parameters on historic time series gave good performance for simulating root zone soil moisture recently baldwin et al 2017 have effectively used the smar approach to predict the root zone soil moisture for conterminous united states and proposed smar enkf model to consider the regional scale biases considering the recent availability of physically based independent subsurface soil moisture estimation relationships like smar it is sensible to explore the efficacy of the smar based subsurface soil moisture estimates when coupled with enkf assimilation to enhance skill improvement of hydrological models at the same time it is also important to analyse such assimilation schemes especially in the widely used hydrological models like swat which has already reported suboptimal assimilation performance for improving streamflow simulations hence to understand and evaluate the performance of enkf to update the profile soil moisture of swat hydrological model when coupled with smar soil moisture estimates a detailed analysis has been carried out using both synthetic as well as real data assimilation experimental runs to validate the applicability of the proposed approach under varied catchment characteristics real data analysis has been carried out in two catchments in krishna river basin india following this introduction section 1 in section 2 a description of the study area dataset used and a brief introduction on swat hydrologic model are given along with the overall methodology adopted section 3 discusses the results obtained for synthetic and real data experiments finally the summary conclusions and future directions are discussed in section 4 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area and datasets to test the proposed methodology two catchments in krishna river basin india are selected in the present study as shown in fig 1 the first catchment is of the wyra river fig 1a covering an area of 1650 km2 up to madhira river gauging site major landuse in this catchment is agriculture 70 6 followed by deciduous forests 14 1 rangeland 6 2 pasture 5 urban 1 7 waterbodies 1 5 and others 0 9 most soils in the study area are clayey loam and clay the catchment receives an average annual rainfall of 1090 mm out of which 90 rainfall is generally received within june to october monsoon period the second catchment is of the varada river fig 1b which covers an area of 5092 km2 up to marol river gauging site major land use in this catchment are agriculture 77 5 followed by deciduous forests 10 7 pasture 5 3 evergreen forest 4 5 and others 2 major soil type in this catchment are clayey loam and sandy clayey loam this catchment lies in the leeward side of the western ghats and receives 1560 mm average annual rainfall the details of the land use land cover lulc digital elevation model dem soil datasets meteorological forcing datasets and observed streamflow and soil moisture datasets for both selected catchments are given in table 1 rainfall data for both the study catchments have been obtained from rain gauge observations for wyara catchment gridded rainfall obtained from india metrological department imd pai et al 2014 has been used for varada catchment tahasil taluk level daily average rainfall data obtained from karnataka state natural disaster monitoring centre ksndmc has been used among thematic datasets food and agriculture fao world harmonized soil dataset hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2009 with two layer soil information 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm is used for wyara catchment for varada catchment soil map from national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup is used based on the requirement of the data assimilation experiments for both catchments only two layers of soil profile with 0 5 cm top layer and 5 100 cm root zone layer were prepared using weighted averaging of original soil profile information to test the proposed methodology in a robust manner and to endorse the validity of the results a detailed analysis have been carried out using two different satellite based soil moisture products therefore depending on the data availability the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission level 3 l3 and advanced scatterometer ascat version h113 soil moisture products are used in the present study the smos soil moisture products provided by catds centre aval de traitement des données are available since january 2010 with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 among the available data quality flags it is found that the data quality index dqx of the retrieval algorithm and the radio frequency interference rfi from local illumination sources are dominant in the present study area and hence they were used for defining observation errors the ascat h113 product is combination of metop a and metop b satellites with spatial sampling of 0 125 0 125 later resampled at 0 25 0 25 these products are distributed by eumetsat satellite application facility on support to operational hydrology and water management h saf among the data quality flags in ascat soil moisture error sm noise is used for defining the observation errors all other datasets such as dem landuse landcover map for both catchments are from common source as given in table 1 2 2 swat hydrological model setup soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 is process based semi distributed continuous time hydrological model which also simulates the crop growth sediments and pollutants yield from a catchment all these modules are dependent mainly on the underlying hydrological model simulating all hydrological processes in a catchment for considering the spatial heterogeneity swat divides the entire catchment into smaller sub basins each sub basin is further sub divided into virtual hydrological response units hru representing areas with same land use soil and slope information all land surface processes are carried out at each hru and final water balance is ensured in the present study the partitioning of rainfall into surface and sub surface runoff is carried out using scs curve number cn scs 1972 method once the surface runoff is computed the remaining water is allowed to flow through each soil layer water entering in the soil profile is routed using storage routing methodology at each hru during this the storage routing methodology first fulfil the field water capacity of upper soil layer and calculate the excess soil water as 1 s w ly excess q perc ly 1 f c ly swly excess is the water content in a soil layer above the field capacity mm qperc ly is the amount of water percolating in lower soil layers mm and fcly is the depth of water in soil layer when it is at field capacity mm from the excess soil water if available the lateral flows are calculated as 2 q lat 0 024 2 s w ly excess k sat ly slp ϕ d l hill where ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h slp is the steepness of a slope m m ϕd is the drainable porosity of soil layer mm mm and lhill is the hillslope length m once the lateral flow requirement is computed this excess soil water is allowed to percolate to deeper soil layers considering the hydraulic conductivity of soil layer as given in eq 3 3 q perc ly s w ly excess 1 exp δ t k sat ly sa t ly f c ly where δt is time step h and satly is the depth of water in soil layer when completely saturated mm if the deeper layer is already saturated then the percolation is restricted and the excess water is allowed to meet the surface runoff similarly the percolation from the lowest layer meets the aquifer system and contributes to groundwater flow all the processes related to flow generation surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow are carried out at each hru and then the different flow components are directly linked to sub basin outlet based on lag routing function once the water enters in to channel then it is routed to basin outlet using linear reservoir concept in the present study the swat hydrologic model is set up for wyra and varada catchments using the datasets described in section 2 1 for a distributed application of the meteorological forcing the catchment is divided into 33 sub basins with areas varying from 20 km2 to 100 km2 fig 1a and b for facilitating the assimilation of coarser grid satellite based soil moisture retrievals at sub basin level one hru per sub basin is delineated as per dominant land use soil type and slope class based on availability of rainfall and river discharge datasets the swat hydrological model was calibrated for seven years 2003 2009 for wyara catchment and four years 2006 2009 for varada catchment with extra two year spin up period model calibration was performed using the available observed discharge at basin outlets located at madhira for wyara catchment and marol for varada catchment fig 1 model input parameters were optimised using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 in swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 to maximise the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of the simulated streamflow total 13 model parameters were selected for calibration based on the past studies arnold et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2015 patil and ramsankaran 2017 table 2 summarises all calibrated model parameters ranges used for their calibration and the final calibrated values 2 3 soil moisture analytical relationship smar to derive the subsurface soil moisture estimates from surface measurements the soil moisture analytical relationship smar proposed by manfreda et al 2014 has been utilised the smar is a physically based relation between surface and root zone soil moisture derived from soil water balance equations and having physically consistent parameter set which can be measured on the field or can be calibrated smar defines the soil profile in two layers surface layer equivalent to observation depth of satellite soil moisture 5 cm 10 cm and root zone layer 60 cm 150 cm to calculate the water flux between two soil layers in absence of rainfall information the flux from the surface to root zone layer can be considered significant only when the surface layer soil moisture exceeds its field capacity smar assumes that soil water above field capacity in surface layer moves down to root zone layer in one day green and ampt 1911 laio 2006 and horizontal and lateral flows are negligible and hence assumed to be zero therefore the infiltration flux from surface layer to root zone layer can occur instantaneously and the fraction of saturation infiltrating to root zone layer y tj can be given as 4 y t j s 1 t j s fc 1 i f s 1 t j s c 1 0 i f s 1 t j s c 1 where s1 is the relative saturation of the surface soil layer sfc1 is the relative soil saturation of surface layer at field capacity once the infiltrating water to deeper layer is known the root zone soil moisture can be computed using discrete form smar equation as 5 s 2 t j s w 2 s 2 t j 1 s w 2 e a t j t j 1 1 s w 2 b y t j t j t j 1 where s2 is the relative saturation of the root zone soil layer sw2 is the relative saturation of root zone soil layer at wilting point tj is the current time step the parameters a and b can are given as 6 a v 2 1 s w 2 n 2 z 2 b n 1 z 1 1 s w 2 n 2 z 2 where v2 mm day is the soil water loss coefficient accounting all losses at root zone soil layer n1 and n2 are the soil porosity for surface and root zone layers and z1 mm and z2 mm are the depth of soil layer at surface and root zone layers therefore parameter a day 1 is a water loss coefficient which controls the daily root zone water loss and given as ratio of the water loss coefficient to the total root zone storage parameter b is the diffusivity coefficient and given as the ratio of surface soil storage to root zone soil storage considering the parameters a and b it can be said that the first square bracket of eq 5 contributes the amount of moisture lost over a given time step and second square bracket of the eq 5 represents the amount of moisture diffused from surface to root zone layer in the present study due to the absence of field data the four parameters such as sw2 sfc1 a and b were only calibrated for each sub basin following manfreda et al 2014 to keep the calibration period different than the assimilation experiment calibration of the smar was carried out using january 2014 to december 2015 datasets during synthetic and real data experiments a calibration was performed using particle swarm optimization pso approach to match the swat simulated long term subsurface soil moisture with nse as an objective function 2 4 data assimilation 2 4 1 enkf enkf is a monte carlo approximation of the standard kalman filter kalman et al 1960 enkf is sequential data assimilation technique that updates the model predictions by optimally merging the observations to do this enkf explicitly computes the error covariance of model predictions and observations using monte carlo approach and produces an analysis estimate which is the best linear unbiased estimate blue of the priors the brief description of enkf update procedure is given below at given time step t the ensemble model forecast x can be given as 7 x t 1 i m x t i u t i w k 1 where m represents nonlinear model u represents the ensemble of model forcing and w is noise representing overall errors in model forecasts including errors in forcing parametrisation and model physics the superscript i represents the ensemble matrix with sign for prior and sign for posterior similarly the observation ensemble can be derived using model forecast as 8 z t 1 i h t x t 1 i v t 1 where h is the observation operator mapping the model states to the observations z is the model predicted observation and v is noise representing errors in the observation and independent of model errors given this information the data assimilation step in the enkf can be given as 9 x k 1 i x k 1 i k z k 1 i z k 1 i where x k 1 i is an forecasted ensemble state x k 1 i is an ensemble of model state after assimilation i e analysis z k 1 i is an observation ensemble generated using observation covariance matrix σ k 1 z and k is kalman gain ensuring best linear unbiased estimate of model forecast and observation and given as 10 k σ k 1 xz σ k 1 zz σ k 1 z 1 where σ k 1 zz is the covariance of the model predicted observation ensemble obtained from h k x k 1 i and σ k 1 xz is the cross covariance of the model forecast and observation prediction 2 4 2 synthetic experiment firstly to understand and evaluate the ability of the proposed smar based enkf assimilation scheme for improving the swat streamflow simulations a synthetic data assimilation experiment was carried out at wyara river catchment for this purpose four model runs such as true open loop enkf smar enkf were carried out in synthetic experiment the calibrated swat model run from june 2010 to december 2013 in deterministic mode is considered as true run true scenario after that the smar model was calibrated using synthetically generated observations from true surface soil moisture as input to predict the model simulated root zone soil moisture for generation of the open loop synthetic run the true scenario was perturbed and the calibrated swat model was run in an ensemble mode using a degraded precipitation and soil moisture to represent a realistic erroneous model run during enkf assimilation run a synthetically generated ensemble observations were used for updating the ensemble of surface and subsurface soil moisture estimates with the help of inherent covariance based updating procedure in the enkf during the smar enkf assimilation run the swat simulated ensemble of surface soil moisture and subsurface soil moisture were updated using the ensemble of synthetic observations and smar derived ensemble of subsurface soil moisture estimates respectively with the help of enkf it shall be noted that during smar enkf assimilation run the surface and sub surface observations were assimilated independently to each layer for generation of open loop run spatially homogeneous and temporally uncorrelated multiplicative gaussian noise of zero mean and 0 3 mm mm standard deviation was applied to the rainfall data similarly zero mean and 0 05 mm mm and 0 15 mm mm standard deviation gaussian noise was added to the surface and subsurface layer soil moisture during model simulations to account the model as we all as the input parameter uncertainties during the open loop run the swat model was run with a 100 member ensemble realisation for generation of ensemble forecast since the actual error in the input and model uncertainties are known during synthetic experiment through testing of any assimilation scheme is possible accordingly the error characteristics used for degrading rainfall and soil moisture as mentioned earlier were applied for generation of rainfall and soil moisture ensembles as well following patil and ramsankaran 2017 the field capacity of the soil was also perturbed with gaussian noise of zero mean and 0 1 mm mm standard deviation for both surface and subsurface soil layers to maintain minimum ensemble spread during high rainfall days following flores et al 2010 lain hypercube sampling technique was used for generation of random number for all types of sampling in the present study to maintain the quality of the ensembles generated rainfall variable was considered as semi restricted and soil moisture was considered as fully restricted variables for ensemble model simulations as suggested by turner et al 2008 similarly following ryu et al 2009 biases due to ensemble model run were corrected using simple delta change method for generating synthetic observations with observation errors the simulated surface soil moisture obtained in the true scenario was degraded using fixed gaussian noise of zero mean and 0 3 mm mm standard deviation these synthetic observations were used for assimilation purpose during enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs with same observation error covariance used for degrading them following chen et al 2011 a vertical error correlation of one was used for perturbing soil moisture states during enkf run to account for the effect of differences in random errors generated to produce open loop run due to different random seed all synthetic model runs such as open loop smar enkf and enkf were repeated over 25 times to generate an ensemble of simulations this ensemble of simulations would allow us to evaluate the expected model performance during both enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs 2 4 3 real data experiment to evaluate the proposed assimilation approach in real conditions a real data experiment was carried out in both the study catchments in this experiment the level 3 smos retrievals and version h113 ascat retrievals as described in section 2 1 were used as observed soil moisture estimates both these observations were spatially averaged using area weighted averaging approach to represent the sub basin level soil moisture and then bias corrected using the model simulated long term surface layer soil moisture time series through mean variance bias correction approach lievens et al 2015 massari et al 2015 it should be noted that the smar model was calibrated using the bias corrected smos as well as ascat observations for each catchment individually to match the swat simulated sub surface soil moisture as discussed in section 2 3 during the real data experiment the swat model simulations were carried out for the same assimilation period as that of synthetic run i e from june 2010 to dec 2013 the open loop run in the real data experiment is defined as the calibrated swat model run with the ensemble model simulation with no data assimilation during data assimilation in real data study two satellite based soil moisture retrievals smos and ascat were assessed separately for enkf and smar enkf runs therefore total five model runs were assessed in real data experiment namely open loop enkfsmos enkfascat smar enkfsmos and smar enkfascat during open loop run the ensemble model simulations were generated by perturbing rainfall soil moisture and soil moisture field capacity with same input error covariance structure as used during the synthetic experiment like synthetic enkf run a vertical error correlation of one was used for perturbing soil moisture states during enkf run in real data experiment as well for defining the observation error of smos retrievals the observation error was linearly scaled by using the data quality indices such as dqx and rfi available with smos products therefore ensemble of observation was represented by applying dynamic gaussian noise to the observed soil moisture with zero mean and standard deviation of σ obs smos mm mm which is given as 11 σ obs smos α dqx dqx α rfi rfi in both the study area s the dqx is varying from 0 01 to 0 1 and rfi is varying from 0 01 to 0 4 considering the higher rfi in the study catchments and its subsequent effect on smos soil moisture retrievals a 30 observation uncertainty is assumed arbitrarily accordingly considering the dqx and rfi distributions in the available data the dimensionless parameters αdqx and αrfi are set to 1 5 in eq 8 so that the σ obs smos represents the assumed 30 uncertainty i e 0 3 mm mm similarly the observation error for ascat retrievals is defined by linearly scaling the soil moisture noise sm noise provided with ascat products similar to the smos observations ensemble of ascat observations were represented by applying dynamic gaussian noise to the observed soil moisture with zero mean and standard deviation of σ obs smos mm mm which is given as 12 σ obs smos α sm noise sm noise in the present case the sm noise is varying from 0 02 to 0 06 considering the relatively robust soil moisture retrievals from ascat as not much affected by rfi compared to smos soil moisture estimates 10 uncertainty is assumed arbitrary therefore to get the average soil moisture error of 0 1 mm mm the α sm noise was set to 3 in the present study 2 5 performance evaluation performance of the model simulated streamflow were evaluated using rmse pbias nse and assimilation efficiency eff most of these statistics are common and well known therefore formulations for assimilation efficiency eff is only given here following aubert et al 2003 the eff metric is calculated as 13 eff 1 t 1 n q a t q obs t 2 t 1 n q ol t q obs t 2 where qobs qa and qol are observed discharge simulated discharge from assimilation run and open loop run respectively an eff more than zero indicates that the assimilation run shows better streamflow simulations than the open loop model simulations and vice versa 3 results and discussions 3 1 smar calibration distributions of the calibrated smar parameters along with nse of the predicted soil moisture at all sub basins in wyara and varada catchments are plotted as boxplots in fig 2 fig 2a represents the calibration performance while using synthetic observations as input for wyara catchment figs 2b c and d e show the calibration performance in wyara and vardha catchments respectively while using smos and ascat soil moisture estimates as input it shall be noted that the values of all the calibrated parameters of the smar model shown in fig 2 are having similar ranges reported by manfreda et al 2014 for few different observation sites which gives some confidence in the calibration results in absence of observed field data the nse fig 2 of the simulated subsurface soil moisture for both catchments are well above 0 8 during all five calibration runs highlighting the robustness of smar algorithm to accurately simulate sub surface soil moisture under different input soil moisture characteristics at the same time it is noticed that the calibrated range of parameter sfc1 and parameter b in case of wyara catchment are significantly different for smos and ascat soil moisture products in both study catchments fig 2b e even though the calibration was performed using bias corrected data of each satellite product this change in calibrated values might be because of number of observations present in each surface soil moisture dataset for example ascat has higher revisit time over both the study areas when compared to smos revisit time therefore field capacity of surface layer soil moisture sfc1 parameter is showing higher sensitivity as it directly controls the amount of water entering to root zone soil moisture from surface observations to know how the smar derived sub surface soil moisture and swat simulated subsurface soil moisture are varying in each sub basin a comparison of the same for each sub basin is given in figs a1 a5 of the appendix a from figs a1 a5 given in appendix a it can be seen that the smar estimated average subsurface soil moisture is in very good agreement with the swat simulated soil moisture at layer 2 for most of the times in both catchments 3 2 synthetic experiment the results obtained from four model runs such as true open loop enkf and smar enkf carried out during the synthetic experiment at wyara catchment are discussed herein out of the four model runs mentioned above three model runs such as open loop enkf and smar enkf run were repeated 25 times to avoid the ambiguities due to different random number seeds while assessing the model performance with respect to true run therefore the swat model is evaluated for these three model runs to assess its average performance in computation of evapotranspiration et surface runoff sr surface layer layer 1 soil moisture s1 subsurface layer 2 soil moisture s2 profile soil moisture sm lateral flow lt deep percolation from soil profile dp groundwater contribution from shallow aquifer gw and streamflow st the distribution of nse obtained for the aforementioned variables from 25 simulations are shown as boxplots in fig 3a b and c for open loop enkf and smar enkf run respectively the computation of nse is done for all variables after taking the area weighted average over entire basin except streamflow st which represents channel routed streamflow at basin outlet by comparing nse of the open loop run fig 3a and enkf run fig 3b it can be seen that the errors in the evapotranspiration et surface soil moisture s1 subsurface soil moisture s2 and profile soil moisture sm are significantly reduced in enkf run and thus resulted in much higher nse values than the open loop run however these updates were not fully conveyed to the updates in the surface runoff sr lateral flow lt and streamflow st and hence they show only moderate improvements as compared to the open loop run contrarily it is observed that the nse of groundwater gw was not improved significantly during the enkf run fig 3b than open loop run fig 3a which is major contributor to the streamflow around 62 in the true run from fig 3c it is observed that the smar enkf scheme have also obtained very similar improvements for evapotranspiration et and soil moisture s1 s2 and sm like enkf run fig 3b when compared to the open loop run fig 3a similarly though the improvements in the surface runoff sr lateral flow lt groundwater flow gw and streamflow st during smar enkf run fig 3c are moderate when compared to open loop run fig 3a they are still better than the enkf run fig 3b however smar enkf model run gave relatively much better improved nse for groundwater gw flows perhaps as a result of this improvement in nse of the groundwater flow component gw the streamflow st is showing better improvements during smar enkf fig 3c run than the enkf run fig 3b the results of this synthetic study are in accordance with the previous studies by chen et al 2011 brocca et al 2012 fairbairn et al 2015 and massari et al 2018 wherein they have stated that the surface soil moisture assimilation scheme for updating soil moisture profile have resulted in moderate to high improvements in sub surface soil moisture while limited improvements in the simulated streamflow further to understand why the streamflow st is simulated better during smar enkf run than the enkf run a qualitative analysis has been done using the time series plots shown in fig 4 a g fig 4a represents the time series of average rainfall pattern observed in the wyra basin which was used for performing synthetic experiment fig 4b g represents the time series plot of area weighted average of the variables such as sm sr lt dp gw and st except s1 and s2 as sm represents the sum of both obtained from 25 simulations of open loop enkf and smar enkf runs as well as the area weighted average of these variables obtained from true run respectively from fig 4b it is observed that during monsoon season june to september of each year the covariance based updates of enkf run have slightly underestimated the profile soil moisture sm when compared with the true run in the swat model the curve number cn computations are highly sensitive to soil moisture values when soil moisture is around field capacity han et al 2012 patil and ramsankaran 2017 therefore the slight sub optimal performance of enkf run during monsoon season has subsequently caused a reduction in the lateral flow lt fig 4d and substantial reduction in the deep percolation dp yellow line in fig 4e which is an inflow to the shallow aquifer in swat this reduction in the deep percolation dp during enkf run has resulted in a significant drop in the groundwater contribution from shallow aquifer gw for the entire simulation period as shown in fig 4f therefore it can be said that these reductions observed in lt dp gw have resulted in decrease in streamflow st estimates during enkf run when compared to true run as seen in fig 4g from fig 4b it is observed that the updates in the profile soil moisture during smar enkf run are matching well with the true run in the monsoon season june september for each year and it is found to be better than enkf run when compared to true run as a result of this the improvement in the deep percolation dp fig 4e is found to be better than the enkf run for the entire simulation period considering the significant contribution of groundwater flow gw to the streamflow one can say that the above improvement in gw estimates could have resulted in more accurate estimates of the streamflow st fig 4g as confirmed with the nse plots in fig 3c to analyse the skill improvement of the simulated streamflow s at multiple stations a statistical evaluation of the simulated streamflow s obtained from all three model runs at spatially distributed six internal sub basin id s 7 18 22 26 28 and 33 outlets has been carried and thus obtained results are given in table 3 the spatial location of these six sub basin outlets can be found in fig 1a i e wyara catchment from table 3 it can be seen that while both enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs have produced better results than the open loop run smar enkf has outperformed enkf run at five of the six outlet points except sub basin id 7 for all the metrices considered here it is noteworthy to mention that the overall assimilation efficiency eff of the simulated streamflow at the outlet of the catchment i e sub basin id 33 is 18 for enkf run whereas it is improved to 55 during smar enkf run while both assimilation schemes have produced improvements in the simulated streamflow the vertically extended subsurface soil moisture updates using coupled smar enkf scheme presented here has shown that it has better capability to improve the streamflow estimates nevertheless it should be noted that the improvements in the nse of the simulated streamflow during both assimilation runs are still not substantially high than the open loop run even during synthetic experiments from another data assimilation experiment representing an ideal assimilation condition refer appendix b where the surface and sub surface true observations were assimilated into the model using direct insertion approach it was found that the average improvement in streamflow nse was 0 87 despite profile soil moisture having nse close to 1 this experiment which represents an ideal assimilation condition reveals that the effect of the errors in forcing datasets cannot be fully corrected by assimilating only the intermediate model state variables such as soil moisture as highlighted by massari et al 2018 and alvarez garreton et al 2016 this might be another reason which limited the model performance to a moderate level during enkf and smar enkf assimilation runs for streamflow simulations 3 3 real data experiment 3 3 1 at wyra catchment the results obtained from all five model runs viz open loop enkfsmos enkfascat smar enkfsmos and smar enkfascat during the real data experiment in wyra catchment are shown as time series plots in fig 5 a f fig 5a c represents the area weighted average of the simulated soil moisture for layer one s1 and the layer two s2 along with the simulated streamflow q at the basin outlet respectively while using smos observations for assimilation similarly fig 5d f represents the same outputs respectively while using ascat observations for assimilation from figs 5a and d it can be seen that the smos satellite have 2 3 days revisit time over the study area while the ascat satellite have 1 2 days revisit time it should be noted that the surface soil moisture updates during enkf and smar enkf run are same fig 5a and d it is mainly because both assimilation runs update the surface layer soil moisture using observations either smos or ascat under same forecast and observation errors from fig 5b and e it can be seen that the updates of the root zone soil moisture s2 during enkf run possess more variations than open loop run and these variations are more dominant while using ascat soil moisture retrievals which represents higher revisit time at the same time this kind of fluctuations are less common in the subsurface soil moisture updates during smar enkf assimilation runs fig 5b and e especially while using ascat soil moisture for assimilation fig 5e this is because the subsurface soil moisture updates are consistently augmented by the physically derived smar estimates from fig 5c and f it can be seen that the streamflow simulated during smar enkf runs are marginally better match than enkf runs moreover significant updates in the simulated streamflow from both assimilation runs are apparent during low flows than high flows table 4 a shows statistical evaluation results for the simulated streamflow from all five model runs in the real data experiment at wyra catchment from this table it is seen that though both assimilation runs have better results than the open loop run smar enkf assimilation scheme shows better performance than enkf run in all the presented statistics it is also seen that in wyara catchment the smos soil moisture gave better assimilation efficiency 0 26 and 0 31 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively over ascat soil moisture 0 21 and 0 24 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively 3 3 2 at varada catchment the results obtained from the real data experiment runs in varada catchment are shown in fig 6 a f here the nature of the surface soil moisture assimilation fig 6a and d is similar to wyara catchment in terms of revisit time of smos and ascat soil moisture and the closeness in the assimilated surface soil moisture during enkf and smar enkf runs likewise the updates in the root zone soil moisture s2 fig 6b and e are smoother during smar enkf over enkf run as seen in the wyara catchment however while using ascat soil moisture for assimilation using enkf scheme the fluctuations in updated s2 are relatively less in varada catchment fig 6e than the wyara catchment fig 5e among all assimilation runs the simulated streamflow fig 6c and f from smar enkf run matches well with observed streamflow however some significant improvements are seen during low flows only table 4b shows statistical evaluation results for the simulated streamflow obtained during all five model runs from the real data experiment in varada catchment contrary to the wyara catchment use of ascat soil moisture gave better assimilation efficiency 0 20 and 0 27 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively over smos observations 0 28 and 0 37 for enkf and smar enkf run respectively in varada catchment the overall results of the real data experiment from two study catchments clearly show the enhanced ability of the smar enkf scheme to improve streamflow simulations than the traditional enkf scheme these results are in accordance with the results seen during synthetic experiment fig 3 and table 3 further a qualitative analysis of the simulated streamflow shows that both the assimilation schemes could not improve the peak flows while the low flows were improved marginally these results are analogous to the earlier studies by chen et al 2014 and alvarez garreton et al 2016 where they found that the surface soil moisture data assimilation using state correction scheme was able to improve the model simulations during low flows only perhaps the non assurance of the observation and input error variances during real data assimilation experiment might have hampered the assimilation results to some extent additionally the inability of state updating scheme to entirely correct the errors due to inaccurate forcing massari et al 2018 alvarez garreton et al 2016 can be another reason for achieving only moderate improvements in the simulated streamflow 4 summary and conclusions the present study proposes a new assimilation strategy by coupling soil moisture analytical relationship smar with enkf for improving streamflow simulations for this purpose synthetic and real data assimilation experiments were carried out using swat hydrological model to systematically analyse the additional benefits of coupling the smar based subsurface soil moisture estimates in enkf data assimilation framework in synthetic experiment the proposed assimilation scheme is analysed under known forecast and observation error covariance at wyra river catchment lying in krishna basin india in real data assimilation experiment the level 3 soil moisture product of smos and ascat h113 version retrievals were used for assimilating into swat hydrological model all the real data experimental runs were carried out using the available data between june 2010 and december 2013 at wyara and varada catchments lying in the krishna river basin the obtained results from synthetic experiment suggest that the physically based relationship like smar coupled with enkf for smar enkf run can be successfully used to update the sub surface soil moisture which helped to improve the model simulated flow components like surface runoff lateral flows and groundwater flows better than enkf only updates enkf run these improvements during smar enkf run helped in producing reasonably better streamflow estimates than the traditional enkf assimilation scheme during the real data assimilation experiment it is found that the physically consistent subsurface updates from smar enkf produced smoother subsurface soil moisture variations than the covariance based updates by enkf similar to the synthetic experiment in real data experiment too the smar enkf assimilation strategy has shown improved streamflow estimates than enkf run in both study catchments at the same time the overall results indicate that though the proposed smar enkf assimilation scheme is able to improve the streamflow simulations they are only moderate during both synthetic and real data experiments it is found that these improvements were mainly coming from low flow components of the simulated streamflow one of the possible reasons behind the moderate improvements in simulated streamflow could be because at the end of day the soil moisture updates are unable to fully compensate the errors in model simulated flow components surface runoff groundwater flow etc due to the errors in the forcing data rainfall at next day additionally the initial uncertainty distributions assumed for forecast and observations might have also affected the results of real data assimilation in the present study however this has not been analysed herein finally from the overall results it can be concluded that the limitations in the enkf based surface soil moisture data assimilation practices for improving the streamflow simulations can be reasonably overcome by coupling appropriate independent profile soil moisture estimation approaches such as smar within the enkf assimilation framework this finding could be particularly useful for assimilating satellite soil moisture observations in studies such as land surface modelling agricultural drought modelling which seeks accurate root zone soil moisture estimations however further detailed analysis should be carried out to confirm the suitability ability of this proposed approach in different model structures and different climatic conditions acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments to improve the article supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j advwatres 2018 08 010 appendix c supplementary materials image application 1 appendix a appendix b fig b 1 shows the nse for open loop and assimilation runs of swat model with ideal assimilation conditions where the observations and assimilation strategy are assumed to be perfect it is to be noted that the open loop run of this experiment is same as that of the open loop run carried out in synthetic experiment as mentioned in section 2 4 2 during data assimilation run the model simulated surface and subsurface soil moisture states were updated by true soil moisture i e without any observation error using direct insertion assimilation strategy from fig b1 it can be seen that although the assimilation experiment updated the surface and subsurface soil moisture very accurately these improvements did not helped in improvement of surface runoff deep percolation and thus streamflow this is mainly because updating the soil moisture states at end of a simulation day can only improve the antecedent soil moisture conditions which will improve the partitioning of rainfall into surface and subsurface flow components during next simulation day however the errors in the rainfall during next rainy day are not removed by soil moisture assimilation and thus resulted in moderate improvements in the model simulated runoff components such as surface flow deep percolation and streamflow 
753,addressing spatial variation of extreme precipitation in urban areas is important for urban hydrologic designs climatology of urban areas is in general different from that of its surroundings and the spatial variation of extreme precipitation within the city exhibits shorter spatial range especially for short duration events this work aims at understanding the dependence structure of extreme precipitation within an urban area and its surrounding non urban areas at various durations the spatial dependence of precipitation is analysed with three different measures for examining dependence considering observations from pairs of stations further the spatial precipitation extremes are modelled with the max stable process to include the dependence structure of spatial extremes the city of berlin germany with surrounding non urban area is considered to demonstrate the methodology for this case study the hourly precipitation shows weaker dependence within the city even at small distances whereas the daily precipitation shows a high degree of dependence this dependence structure of the daily precipitation gets masked as more and more surrounding non urban areas are included in the analysis further the extreme precipitation at different durations are modelled considering max stable process different geographical and climatological covariates are considered in the modelling of location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution the geographical covariates are seen to be predominant within the city and the climatological covariates prevail when non urban areas are added these results suggest the importance of quantification of dependence structure of spatial precipitation at the sub daily timescales as well as the need to more precisely model spatial extremes within the urban areas keywords urban precipitation extremes dependence structure max stable process extremal coefficient 1 introduction modifications in extreme precipitation due to urbanization and variation in hydro meteorological variables such as precipitation and temperature across an urban area and its surroundings are of recent research interest quantification of spatial dependence structure of the extremes may lead to better estimates of probability of occurrence of the extreme events aghakouchak et al 2010 it is also important to understand the variation in dependence structure of extreme precipitation in urban and surrounding non urban areas the main objective of this work is to examine the spatial dependence structure within an urban area at different accumulated durations and compare it with its surrounding non urban areas the variation in the dependence structure is also examined at various spatial scales by increasing the region of interest starting from the urban area and progressively including more and more non urban surroundings three different dependence measures are obtained for precipitation considering i the entire time series using kendall s rank correlation coefficient ii the peaks above a threshold using nonparametric tail dependence coefficients and iii the annual maximum series using extremal coefficient further spatial modelling of extreme precipitation at different durations is carried out with the max stable processes and suitable covariates are identified a variety of statistical tools have been used in literature for spatial modelling of extremes including generalized linear models glms copulas bayesian hierarchical models and max stable random fields in addition there are a few studies where the mixed models are considered to estimate marginal parameters and dependence parameters separately zhang 2009 shang et al 2015 bracken et al 2016 developed a nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm to reconstruct multisite streamflows capturing the spatial dependence between the sites with a gaussian elliptical copula they have shown that combining the copula and the nhmm captures the inter site correlations reasonably well each modelling strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages davison et al 2012 turkman et al 2010 several studies in the recent times compared the methods for spatial modelling of extreme precipitation hao and singh 2016 chavez demoulin and davison 2012 cooley et al 2012 davison et al 2012 after initial developments by smith 1990 and schlather 2002 numerous studies employed max stable processes for modelling different variables including extreme snow depths nicolet et al 2016 blanchet and davison 2011 extreme temperature lee et al 2013 extreme wind gusts ribatet 2013 droughts oesting and stein 2018 and extreme river discharges asadi et al 2015 modelling extreme precipitation events including spatial dependence structure was studied by many researchers coles et al 1999 coles and tawn 1996 sang and gelfand 2009 reich and shaby 2012 apputhurai and stephenson 2013 coles 1993 modelled extreme storms using max stable process by classifying the storms and estimating the storm profile buishand et al 2008 estimated return levels of daily average precipitation over north holland they generated high precipitation regions using max stable process turkman et al 2010 concluded that if the objective of the data analysis is to obtain return levels of extreme values in space capturing the correct dependence structure between the extremes is important and max stable processes are better suited for these purposes davison et al 2012 studied the accuracy in estimation of extreme precipitation events and return levels considering the latent process copula and max stable models they concluded through an application to switzerland precipitation data at daily time scale that the latent variable models allow a better fit to marginal distributions like return levels but poorly fit the joint distributions of extremes appropriately chosen copula or max stable models are essential for effective modelling of spatial extremes there are very few studies on studying the precipitation at different durations more recently stephenson et al 2016 extended the latent process model by incorporating an explicit max stable dependence structure eliminating the assumption of conditional independence they studied the pluviometer records at several gauges located on the central coast of new south wales accumulated over different durations ranging from 5 min to 7 days there are very few studies on modelling the spatial dependence behaviour in urban and its surrounding non urban areas fu and butler 2014 used copulas to study the impacts of dependence structure and the marginal distributions on performance of urban drainage systems their work emphasized the importance of considering the dependence structure of precipitation in the context of urban drainage system evaluation and bring out different impacts of dependence structure and marginal distributions on the probabilities of flooding in urban areas though not specific to the urban precipitation bargaoui and bardossy 2015 modelled short duration extreme precipitation patterns using copulas and generalized maximum pseudo likelihood estimation is considered with censoring combining historical and paleo flood information with systematic data however there are no studies with specific focus on understanding the variance in dependence structure within urban areas and its surrounding non urban areas at different accumulated durations this work highlights the importance of examining the variation of dependence structure at different durations in urban areas and obtains the covariates affecting the extremes at different durations a brief introduction of the multivariate models used in the work is provided in the next sub section 1 1 multivariate models spatial data observed at a finite set of locations are often modelled as a realization of spatial process let xi 1 xi 2 xid i 1 n be a sequence of independent d dimensional continuous random vectors and let mn max i 1 n xi 1 max i 1 nxid t and if there exists continuous functions an 0 and bn ℜ 1 pr m n b n a n y g y n g is non degenerate and belongs to class of multivariate max stable distributions cooley et al 2012 ribatet 2013 the depiction of multivariate max stable distributions assumes that the univariate marginal distributions are known and common to all locations in the study region according to the extreme value theory the univariate marginal distributions must be univariate max stable i e generalized extreme value gev distribution for a jth j 1 d component s marginal if μj σj and ξj are the location scale and shape parameters of the gev then 2 pr y j y g j y exp 1 ξ j y μ j σ j 1 ξ j a widely used choice is to assume unit fréchet margins as accounting for each gev marginal is cumbersome and therefore assuming z 1 zd to follow a multivariate max stable distribution with unit fréchet marginal i e pr z j z exp z 1 it follows that pr z z g z exp v z where v z e max j 1 d x y i z j is called the exponent function which characterizes the dependence across the elements of random vector z the details of dependence structure modelling and spatial analysis using max stable process are discussed at relevant places in the subsequent sections in this paper the variation in dependence structure of precipitation at different durations is studied with an aim to examine the differences in dependence structure between urban and its surrounding non urban areas and the spatial precipitation extremes are modelled considering the max stable process at different accumulated durations city of berlin germany and its surroundings are considered as the study region for this work due to ready availability of high resolution data in section 2 details of the study area and the hydrological and meteorological data used in the work are given the variation in dependence structure with duration in and around the city of berlin is discussed in section 3 considering different methods to obtain the spatial dependence in precipitation data the parameters of the marginal gev model as well as the dependence structure are obtained and the covariates affecting the extreme precipitation at different accumulated durations are listed in section 4 followed by conclusions in section 5 2 study area the berlin city capital of germany is one of the largest cities in the european union the precipitation data and the data for other variables including temperature relative humidity and mean sea level pressure are obtained from the germany s national meteorological service the deutscher wetterdienst dwd climate data center cdc website ftp ftp cdc dwd de pub cdc the locations of the observatories recording different variables in and around the city of berlin are shown in fig 1 the data are available at hourly time scale with different record lengths varying from 8 to 21 years the precipitation data at one hour duration are subsequently accumulated over 3 6 12 and 24 h durations annual maximum precipitation time series is obtained for each of these durations at all stations demarcating an urban area with a defined boundary from its rural surrounding is rather subjective the boundary of the city plotted in fig 1 is obtained from the global administrative areas http www gadm org download the approximate area of the city is 1400 km2 ranging from latitude 13 05 e to 13 74 e and longitude 52 37 n to 52 66 n bounding boxes are marked around the city increasing the region of interest progressively by 0 1 latitude and 0 06 longitude the dependence structure and subsequent modelling is carried out by considering the stations within each bounding box the limit of the bounding box is fixed at latitude 51 95 n to 53 08 n and longitude 12 35 e to 14 44 e such that the bounding box is defined by approximately equal distance of length width of the city in all directions a total of 37 stations present inside this bounding box are considered for analysis out of which 11 stations are within the city boundary fig 1a displays the bounding boxes and the stations at which precipitation temperature and mean sea level pressure are measured fig 1b shows the land use classification within the city and its surrounding areas fig 2 shows the box plots of the distributions of annual maximum precipitation for one hour duration at each year the width of the box plot is proportional to the number of sites in that particular year from the figure it is apparent that the data length is small prior to 2004 also a little evidence of temporal trend in precipitation for the study area can be noted from the figure which is neglected in this work 3 dependence structure for different durations in general the dependence measures are based on the association of the distributions of either multiple variables such as precipitation temperature etc at a specified location or a single variable e g precipitation at multiple locations let x i1 x i2 i 1 n be two independent random vectors with common continuous distribution and marginal distribution functions f1 and f2 i e xi 1 and xi 2 are the precipitation time series at two sites separated by a distance h the aim is to investigate the spatial dependence at various durations considering three different ways first is by considering entire time series through concordance second is by considering values above a chosen threshold and third is by considering the annual maxima time series 3 1 dependence measures one of the primary measures of dependence is the pearson s product moment correlation coefficient a measure of linear dependence related to the multivariate gaussian distribution usually obtained by considering the observations at pairwise gauge stations habib et al 2001 ciach and krajewski 2006 yoo and ha 2007 embrechts et al 2002 showed that difficulties arise when data do not follow multivariate gaussian distribution to overcome this limitation habib et al 2001 suggested log transforming the data under the hypothesis of bivariate lognormal distribution to obtain normality ciach and krajewski 2006 analysed the precipitation series in central oklahoma which did not show heavy tail behaviour and observed that the bivariate lognormal mixed distribution is not suitable to model the data also the pearson s linear correlation may not exist for random variables above a certain extreme threshold aghakouchak et al 2010 a possible alternative to pearson s linear correlation coefficient free from distribution of the data is the non parametric rank measure of dependence the kendall s rank correlation coefficient based on a link among variables called concordance serinaldi 2008 bàrdossy 2006 joe 1997 therefore overcoming the assumption of an underlying distribution instead of pearson s linear correlation kendall s τ is considered in this study to examine the spatial dependence of the precipitation time series kendall s τk is the difference between the probability of concordance and the probability of discordance for a pairs of observations randomly chosen i e it is the count of how many concordant and discordant pairs for the signs for all combinations the kendall s for the sample τk joe 1997 is given by 3 τ k n 2 1 i j s i g n x i 1 x j 1 x i 2 x j 2 kendall s τk is based on the association of the entire distribution of a variable at multiple locations however the degree of dependence between extreme values maybe significantly different from that of the rest of the distribution for instance the dependence in tails of a distribution may be stronger than the rest of the distribution an important measure in estimating the dependence of extremes is the tail dependence coefficient tdc which describes the dependence in the tail of a multivariate distribution frahm et al 2005 schmidt and stadtmüller 2006 typically a threshold u is selected and peaks over threshold time series is considered tdc introduced by sibuya 1959 is the degree of association in the upper right quadrant upper tail dependence and lower left quadrant lower tail dependence of a bivariate distribution in a bivariate distribution the tail dependence describes the limiting proportion that one marginal distribution exceeds a given threshold conditioned on the fact that the other margin has already exceeded that threshold aghakouchak et al 2010 coles et al 1999 derived the dependence measure χ u for different thresholds for the gaussian dependence model they showed that as the threshold increases u 1 the effect of dependence is diminished with dependence measure approaching to zero for all correlations less than one when the interest lies in evaluating the occurrence of simultaneous extreme flood events upper tail dependence coefficient λu is considered there are several studies on understanding the behaviour of upper tail dependent coefficients for hydrological variables like precipitation stream flows etc in literature e g poulin et al 2007 aghakouchak et al 2010 serinaldi 2013 serinaldi et al 2015 both parametric and nonparametric approaches have been developed for estimation of the upper tail dependent coefficients huang 1992 frahm et al 2005 there are several works dealing with extensive simulation studies to evaluate the reliability of parametric and nonparametric λu estimators as well listing various caveats about their use in practical analyses e g schmidt 2005 frahm et al 2005 schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 serinaldi et al 2015 frahm et al 2005 concluded that the parametric estimators perform well only if the underlying distribution copula is correct and the estimator s performance is very poor if the assumed model is wrong they concluded that the nonparametric estimators are the best when the sample size is large more than 250 points enough nonparametric estimators based on the concept of a bivariate empirical copula avoid any assumption regarding the underlying distribution but they exhibit large variance schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 aghakouchak et al 2010 however as the tail dependence coefficient may strongly depend on the choice of estimation technique frahm et al 2005 nonparametric tail dependence estimators are considered in this work to examine the dependence of the precipitation time series at various durations though several nonparametric estimators are developed the estimators proposed by schmidt and stadtmüller 2006 and huang 1992 are considered detailed notes on the nonparametric estimators are given in the appendix 1 of the supporting information the tail dependence estimator proposed by schmidt and stadtmüller 2006 is 4 λ u p s s 1 k i 1 n i r x 1 i n k r x 2 i n k where i is an indicator function r x 1 i and r x 2 i denote the ranks of xi 1 xi 2 i 1 n and k 1 n is the threshold rank a parameter chosen by the analyst serinaldi 2008 the tail dependence estimator proposed by huang 1992 is 5 λ u p h 2 1 k i 1 n i r x 1 i n k o r r x 2 i n k in addition to tdc extremal coefficient characterizing the dependence among extreme precipitation is one of the measures to quantify dependence in the extreme data in this case the annual maximum time series is considered schlather and tawn 2003 extensively studied the properties of the dependence measures in the study of extreme values in multivariate and spatial problems they discussed the consistency properties to be satisfied by extremal coefficients and the relations between extremal coefficients of different orders are given in schlather and tawn 2002 several studies considered extremal coefficient to estimate the dependence among the extreme observations of precipitation e g coles et al 1999 cooley et al al 2012 davison et al 2012 extremal coefficient θh is also considered in this work to quantify the dependence among extreme precipitation at different sites and at different accumulated durations cooley et al 2006 introduced f madogram ν and discussed estimation of the extremal coefficient based on the f madogram θ h 1 2ν h 1 2ν h an elaborate explanation of the extremal coefficient and f madogram is given in the appendix 1 of the supporting information if n h denotes the number of pairs s s separated by distance h the sample f madogram is given by 6 ν h 1 n i 1 n 1 2 n h s s n h g x i s g x i s ferreira and ferreira 2012 studied tail dependence coefficients as functions of order statistics and derived general properties for dependence measures which can be expressed through copulas of random vectors i e the three dependent measures used in this work can be formulated in terms of copulas further details and derivations of obtaining kendall s τk and λu from copulas can be found in serinaldi 2008 the relation between the tdc and the extremal coefficient can be found in ferreira and ferreira 2012 3 2 results the spatial dependence estimators are obtained by considering pairwise observations at two gauge stations if x 1 x 2 denotes a random vector of values collected at two gauge stations there could be different possible pairs with rain or no rain scenarios habib et al 2001 ha and yoo 2007 and yoo and ha 2007 analysed four kinds of pairs viz no rain at both the stations x 1 0 x 2 0 positive value at one station and null at the other x 1 0 x 2 0 and vice versa x 1 0 x 2 0 and positive values at both the stations x 1 0 x 2 0 to estimate pearson s coefficient in this study three cases are studied following serinaldi 2008 case a all pairs are considered x 1 0 x 2 0 case b all pairs except those with zero values at x 1 and x 2 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 and case c pairs only with both positive values at x 1 and x 2 x 1 0 x 2 0 the pairwise estimates of kendall s τk upper tail dependence coefficients and the extremal coefficients are obtained at stations for the city of berlin and the bounding boxes shown in fig 1a the results are not presented for all bounding boxes marked but only for four bounding boxes are given for brevity covering the city 13 05 e to 13 74 e 52 37 n to 52 66 n b1 12 75 e to 14 04 e 52 19 n to 52 84 n b2 12 55 e 14 24 e to 52 07 n 52 96 n and b3 12 35 e 14 44 e to 51 95 n 53 08 n the empirical kendall s τk with distance between pairwise stations for the three cases a b and c for different durations and for the four bounding boxes city b1 b2 and b3 are plotted appendix 2 of the supporting information for the case a where all the pairs including the nonzero values of precipitation are considered τk becomes negative as distance increases especially for the shorter durations for the other two cases the τk is positive with a very low correlation at larger distances the shorter durations have a lower correlation compared to that of the larger durations i e as the duration reduces correlation also reduces at all the bounding boxes including the city indicating that the shorter duration events are less correlated also the scattering of τk values increase as the accumulated duration increases this is due to the fact that physical phenomena driving the occurrence of precipitation at the sites could be similar for larger durations serinaldi 2008 there is no appropriate discrimination in the τk values between the city and the other bounding boxes the tdc and or the extremal coefficient should be used for assessing the dependence structure in the extremes the estimates of upper tail dependence with distance are shown in fig 3 for all the cases and bounding boxes the estimates of λ u p s s and λ u p h are similar and therefore fig 3 shows only λ u p s s the estimates of λ u p h are given in the appendix 2 of the supporting information both the tail dependence coefficients show a similar pattern for all the cases and bounding boxes similar to τk the λup s both λ u p s s and λ u p h decrease as the duration increases and as the distance increases the scattering of λup s increases from case a to case c for all the accumulated durations for the case a the estimates are approximately equal for larger durations indicating that the tail dependence is not explicitly noticeable when the nonzero precipitation is considered in the calculations of estimates of tail dependence coefficients a threshold needs to be specified to avoid the subjectivity in the choice of threshold a kernel plateau finding algorithm frahm et al 2005 is generally used for the estimation of the threshold although this algorithm used in this study allows choosing the threshold value objectively different thresholds at 80 85 90 and 95 quantiles are considered to check if variation in λup s is different in urban areas at high thresholds as λ u is a non trivial function of threshold u coles et al 1999 it is observed that as the threshold increases the tail dependence coefficient approaches zero specifically at shorter durations indicating that the λup s are asymptotically independent fig 4 shows the estimates of λ u p s s for the city and the bounding box b3 at a high quantile 95 the tail dependence coefficient approaches zero for case b and case c at shorter durations indicating that at higher thresholds the λup s are asymptotically independent similar to the τk no sharp discrimination in estimates of λup s between the city and the other bounding boxes is noticed the estimates of extremal coefficients are obtained by considering only the extreme precipitation i e annual maximum time series at the stations the estimates are obtained using the r package spatialextremes developed by ribatet 2015 the pairwise estimates as well as the binned estimates of the extremal coefficients are shown in fig 5 for all the bounding boxes and the accumulated durations the estimates of θ s at small distances for hourly durations are much larger compared to those of the 24 h durations indicating that the shorter duration precipitation events are less dependent within the city as the bounding box size increases i e as one moves away from the city the amount of dependence is nearly equal for all the durations including at small distances for bounding box b3 it is evident from the figure that the effect of urbanization is totally concealed the 11 stations within the city are removed from the bounding box b3 and the estimates of θ s are obtained shown in fig 6 the dependence is nearly equal for all the durations in this case as well at small distances a similar result is observed for the bounding box b2 figure not shown for conciseness the estimates of θ s are also calculated by considering the stations all round the city s boundary i e by considering the stations on the north south east and west of the city the estimates of θ s for the city s surrounding areas are also similar i e the dependence for all the durations is more or less equal at small distances therefore it can be concluded from this exercise that within the city the extreme precipitation is less dependent for shorter durations at small distances the kendall s τk and the tail dependence coefficients are similarly obtained at the stations on the north south east and west of the city but the estimates did not show any different variation in correlation dependence from the city 4 modelling dependence structure it is concluded from section 3 that the dependence structure is different at different accumulated durations within the urban areas specifically at short distances it is also important to identify the covariates affecting the precipitation extremes at different durations with different dependence structures within the urban area and at the bounding boxes where the non urban surroundings are included it is therefore important to model the spatial dependence structure in the observations which may otherwise lead to unrealistic spatial inference and prediction katz et al 2002 in this work the spatial extremes at different durations are modelled considering max stable processes accounting the dependence structure according to de haan 1984 and de haan and ferreira 2006 the processes can be described by two components a poisson process π on 0 with intensity dζ ζ 2 and x s is a stochastic process let ζi π be points of the poisson process and xi s is independent realizations of the stochastic process x s with e x s 1 then z s max i 1 ζ i x i s s s is a max stable process with unit fréchet margins different choices of the process xi s lead to different classes of max stable processes including brown resnick process extremal gaussian process davison et al 2012 for more details about the models and their simulation methods one can be refer to ribatet et al 2016 and oesting et al 2016 fitting max stable process to data lacks closed form expressions for joint likelihood in high dimensions padoan et al 2010 developed a likelihood based approach to fit max stable processes by substituting composite likelihood instead of joint likelihood the composite likelihood is a weighted sum of log likelihoods for each event which is maximized to obtain the estimates of parameters termed as maximum composite likelihood estimators mcle or composite likelihood information criterion clic pairwise likelihood is an example of composite likelihood lp given by 7 l p ψ z k 1 n j 1 d 1 j j 1 d log f z k s j z k s j ψ whereψ is a spatial dependence parameter each term f zk sj zk s j ψ is a bivariate density function based on observations at locations j and j the two inner summations add up all unique pairs and the outer summation adds over the n iid replicates mcle obtained by maximizing the pairwise likelihood is consistent and asymptotically normal the variance matrix of the mcle ψ is estimated by an information sandwich of the form v ψ j 1 ψ h ψ j 1 ψ where j 1 ψ is the observed information matrix and h ψ is the estimated variance of the score contributions corresponding to the composite log likelihood lp 4 1 covariates the max stable process with gev as marginal distribution is considered to model the extreme precipitation at all the accumulated durations and bounding boxes parameters of the gev are modelled to vary spatially as a linear function of geographic and climatological covariates in this work only the location and scale parameters are varied spatially and the shape parameter is modelled uniformly across the region of interest the list of covariates used in this study is given in table 1 for the seven covariates first order regression equation with single covariates counting to seven models and second order with two covariates leading to 21 combinations 7c2 of models are considered regression equations beyond second order are not considered to avoid complexity and therefore a total of 28 models are considered the notation of referring the model is considered according to the covariate no in table 1 for example model m25 corresponds to the covariates latitude with covariate no 2 and mean temperature with covariate no 5 the elevation of the region of interest is obtained from the 30 m resolution digital elevation model from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem provided by national aeronautic and space administration nasa http reverb echo nasa gov reverb the climatological covariates mean temperature mean sea level pressure and the mean diurnal temperature range are obtained from the observatories marked in fig 1 the temperature and the pressure data are available at a total of 20 and 14 stations respectively within the region of interest both the datasets are available from 1955 onwards but a number of stations do not have complete data for the entire period therefore data from 2005 to 2015 are considered for obtaining the mean values of the covariates all the covariates are standardised to make them dimensionless 4 2 results fitting of max stable processes to the data is a crucial first step in modelling the dependence structure different choices of the process xi s in the spectral representation lead to different classes of max stable processes for bounding boxes b2 and b3 70 of the stations are considered for model fitting and the remaining are used for checking the validity of the model effort was not made to leave out some stations for the city and the bounding box b1 as the number of stations available for building the model is low a quick investigation on the plots of pairwise and binned estimates of extremal coefficients revealed that the schlather s model and the extremal t model both with whittle matern correlation function are better suitable for modelling the data the estimates of gev and dependence parameters are attained using the spatialextremes package in r the estimates of parameters are obtained for all the 28 models and at each of the bounding box the model selection is based on minimizing the clic which has analogous properties to takeuchi s information criterion tic given by ribatet 2013 8 t i c 2 l p ψ 2 t r j 1 ψ h ψ tic is calculated for each of the model and the model with minimum tic is considered as the best fig 7 shows the five best models based on the tic for all the bounding boxes and accumulated durations and table 2 gives the best model with tic values and the corresponding covariates for obtaining the marginal gev parameters the first two columns of fig 8 show the estimates of extremal coefficients between pairs of stations and the extremal coefficient functions obtained with the fitted schlather s top row and extremal t bottom row model for the city at 1 h first column and 24 h second column durations it is evident from the figure that the schlather s model fits both the durations appropriately specifically for 24 h duration the model estimated accurately the extremal dependence at small distances of less than 25 km however the extremal t model appears to underestimate extremal dependence for both the durations therefore for the city at all the durations schlather s model is considered the last two columns of fig 8 show the pairwise estimates of extremal coefficients and functions obtained with the fitted schlather s top row and extremal t bottom row model for the bounding box b3 at 1 h first column and 24 h second column durations it may be noted that both the models show similar fit for b3 at 24 h duration however for 1 h duration the schlather s model underestimates and extremal t model overestimates the binned estimates of extremal coefficients but provides a reasonably better fit to the pairwise estimates grey points similar results are obtained for the other two bounding boxes b1 and b2 also and therefore schlather s model is considered for all the bounding boxes the plots for other durations and the bounding boxes are not shown for brevity however it is to be noted that the choice of the covariates is not affected by the choice of either schlather s or the extremal t model except for a few cases from the table 2 it may be noted that within the city and for bounding box b1 the geographical covariates prevail and for the bounding boxes b2 and b3 climatological covariates are dominant extreme precipitation within the city is affected by the geography and as one move away from the city the climatological features affect the extreme precipitation more significantly for checking the accuracy of the model in b3 out of 37 stations 26 stations are randomly chosen to fit the model and the remaining 11 are used to validate the model for the bounding box b2 out of 25 stations 18 stations are considered for fitting the model fig 9 shows the comparison between pairwise estimates of the annual maximum data observed and simulated from the model between stations separated by 6 km 54 km and 160 km distance for one hour and 24 h durations there is a good agreement between the modelled and observed annual maxima similar results were obtained for the other durations and the bounding box b2 however the results are not presented here for conciseness synthesizing the results from this section and from section 3 it can be concluded that the extreme precipitation exhibits lower dependence for shorter durations at small distances and the geographical covariates dominate within the city further as the surrounding rural areas are included this dependence at the shorter durations increases and climatological covariates dominate within the city the temperatures are marginally higher compared to the surrounding areas and therefore the chances of high intensity short duration precipitation events with less spatial extent are high due to localized convective storms leading to less dependent extreme precipitation while geography of the city has a major impact on the extreme precipitation climatology plays an important role when a region is considered which includes the city i e the effects of urban features diminish 5 concluding remarks in urban areas the need for accurate estimates of precipitation extremes specifically the spatial return levels has become important in design and planning the urban infrastructure to mitigate flooding spatial variation of extreme precipitation in urban areas is likely to be high and much different from the non urban areas yang et al 2013 2015 in this work the dependence structure of extreme precipitation at different accumulated durations within an urban area and its non urban surroundings is examined three measures of dependence kendall s rank correlation coefficient nonparametric tail dependence coefficient and extremal coefficient are used to examine the variation in dependence structure city of berlin germany and its non urban surroundings are considered as region of interest it is observed that the hourly precipitation extremes within the city exhibit weaker dependence while the 24 h duration extremes show dependence at short distances this may be due to marginally higher temperatures within urban areas which tend to intensify the convective storms leading to high intensity short duration and less spatial extent precipitation events vojinović and abbott 2012 the dependence structure of the daily precipitation in the city gets masked as more and more surrounding non urban areas are included in the analysis the variation in extreme precipitation is more evident when the extremal coefficient is used than when kendall s τk or the tail dependence coefficient is considered max stable processes are used to model the extreme precipitation at various durations within the city and its surroundings the location and scale parameters of gev are considered as linear functions of geographic and climatologic covariates the dependence structure and the gev parameters are modelled at different durations using the schlather s model with whittle matern correlation structure the accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the modelled and observed extreme precipitation at different validation sites further it is observed that the geographic covariates are predominant within the city and the climatological covariates prevail when the surrounding non urban areas are included in the analysis although the spatial analysis attempts to improve the models through pooling information across sites fawcett and walshaw 2013 the available data for the study region is of a rather short length which may lead to high uncertainties in the estimates of parameters davison et al 2012 reported that dependence often decreases for increasingly rare events which points the inadequacies in the formulation as used in this paper wadsworth and tawn 2012 developed models for near independence spatial extremes data to account for sampling uncertainty bayesian inference can be incorporated to the max stable models stephenson et al 2016 reich and shaby 2012 leading to the posterior distributions of parameters also the annual maximum precipitation is considered in this work which may result in loss of some information of extreme events specifically at shorter durations this issue can be addressed by considering threshold maxima kiriliouk 2016 thibaud et al 2016 the non stationarity in the precipitation time series at different durations is not considered in this work while it is relatively straightforward to incorporate non stationarity by considering the underlying marginal parameters depend on the covariates it is more complicated to model non stationarity in the dependence structure huser and genton 2016 furthermore carrying likelihood inference may lead to unreliable estimates if the dataset is not rich spatially even by including meaningful covariates in the dependence structure and the marginal parameters there have been very few attempts to address this problem so far in the literature huser and genton 2016 westra and sisson 2011 stephenson et al 2016 attempted to simultaneously model precipitation over space and accumulated durations within a max stable process framework which could only consider non stationarity in the marginal parameters of the gev they reported that including dependence structure as a function of accumulated durations could lead to impractical computation times other than for small number of sites jiang et al 2015 used a time varying copula to investigate the variations in the dependence structure between river flows at different locations due to reservoirs they have considered a time varying copula model which takes the nonstationarity in the marginal distribution and the dependence structure between different hydrological series as well the copula with the dependence parameter expressed as a function of either time or reservoir index is applied to model the variable dependence between the two low flow series however their study considers only two sites enabling the use of bivariate models in addition to the max stable models copulas and bayesian hierarchical models are also used to model the temporal non stationarity bracken et al 2018 proposed a bayesian hierarchical framework to conduct non stationary frequency analysis considering gaussian elliptical copula to model the joint distribution of variables peak snow water equivalent peak inflow and peak reservoir elevation they concluded that the overall uncertainty is reduced by incorporating multivariate dependence between the variables since most of the studies concentrate on incorporating non stationarity in the marginal gev parameters an interesting extension would be to incorporate non stationarity in the dependence structure as well and model the

753,addressing spatial variation of extreme precipitation in urban areas is important for urban hydrologic designs climatology of urban areas is in general different from that of its surroundings and the spatial variation of extreme precipitation within the city exhibits shorter spatial range especially for short duration events this work aims at understanding the dependence structure of extreme precipitation within an urban area and its surrounding non urban areas at various durations the spatial dependence of precipitation is analysed with three different measures for examining dependence considering observations from pairs of stations further the spatial precipitation extremes are modelled with the max stable process to include the dependence structure of spatial extremes the city of berlin germany with surrounding non urban area is considered to demonstrate the methodology for this case study the hourly precipitation shows weaker dependence within the city even at small distances whereas the daily precipitation shows a high degree of dependence this dependence structure of the daily precipitation gets masked as more and more surrounding non urban areas are included in the analysis further the extreme precipitation at different durations are modelled considering max stable process different geographical and climatological covariates are considered in the modelling of location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution the geographical covariates are seen to be predominant within the city and the climatological covariates prevail when non urban areas are added these results suggest the importance of quantification of dependence structure of spatial precipitation at the sub daily timescales as well as the need to more precisely model spatial extremes within the urban areas keywords urban precipitation extremes dependence structure max stable process extremal coefficient 1 introduction modifications in extreme precipitation due to urbanization and variation in hydro meteorological variables such as precipitation and temperature across an urban area and its surroundings are of recent research interest quantification of spatial dependence structure of the extremes may lead to better estimates of probability of occurrence of the extreme events aghakouchak et al 2010 it is also important to understand the variation in dependence structure of extreme precipitation in urban and surrounding non urban areas the main objective of this work is to examine the spatial dependence structure within an urban area at different accumulated durations and compare it with its surrounding non urban areas the variation in the dependence structure is also examined at various spatial scales by increasing the region of interest starting from the urban area and progressively including more and more non urban surroundings three different dependence measures are obtained for precipitation considering i the entire time series using kendall s rank correlation coefficient ii the peaks above a threshold using nonparametric tail dependence coefficients and iii the annual maximum series using extremal coefficient further spatial modelling of extreme precipitation at different durations is carried out with the max stable processes and suitable covariates are identified a variety of statistical tools have been used in literature for spatial modelling of extremes including generalized linear models glms copulas bayesian hierarchical models and max stable random fields in addition there are a few studies where the mixed models are considered to estimate marginal parameters and dependence parameters separately zhang 2009 shang et al 2015 bracken et al 2016 developed a nonhomogeneous hidden markov model nhmm to reconstruct multisite streamflows capturing the spatial dependence between the sites with a gaussian elliptical copula they have shown that combining the copula and the nhmm captures the inter site correlations reasonably well each modelling strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages davison et al 2012 turkman et al 2010 several studies in the recent times compared the methods for spatial modelling of extreme precipitation hao and singh 2016 chavez demoulin and davison 2012 cooley et al 2012 davison et al 2012 after initial developments by smith 1990 and schlather 2002 numerous studies employed max stable processes for modelling different variables including extreme snow depths nicolet et al 2016 blanchet and davison 2011 extreme temperature lee et al 2013 extreme wind gusts ribatet 2013 droughts oesting and stein 2018 and extreme river discharges asadi et al 2015 modelling extreme precipitation events including spatial dependence structure was studied by many researchers coles et al 1999 coles and tawn 1996 sang and gelfand 2009 reich and shaby 2012 apputhurai and stephenson 2013 coles 1993 modelled extreme storms using max stable process by classifying the storms and estimating the storm profile buishand et al 2008 estimated return levels of daily average precipitation over north holland they generated high precipitation regions using max stable process turkman et al 2010 concluded that if the objective of the data analysis is to obtain return levels of extreme values in space capturing the correct dependence structure between the extremes is important and max stable processes are better suited for these purposes davison et al 2012 studied the accuracy in estimation of extreme precipitation events and return levels considering the latent process copula and max stable models they concluded through an application to switzerland precipitation data at daily time scale that the latent variable models allow a better fit to marginal distributions like return levels but poorly fit the joint distributions of extremes appropriately chosen copula or max stable models are essential for effective modelling of spatial extremes there are very few studies on studying the precipitation at different durations more recently stephenson et al 2016 extended the latent process model by incorporating an explicit max stable dependence structure eliminating the assumption of conditional independence they studied the pluviometer records at several gauges located on the central coast of new south wales accumulated over different durations ranging from 5 min to 7 days there are very few studies on modelling the spatial dependence behaviour in urban and its surrounding non urban areas fu and butler 2014 used copulas to study the impacts of dependence structure and the marginal distributions on performance of urban drainage systems their work emphasized the importance of considering the dependence structure of precipitation in the context of urban drainage system evaluation and bring out different impacts of dependence structure and marginal distributions on the probabilities of flooding in urban areas though not specific to the urban precipitation bargaoui and bardossy 2015 modelled short duration extreme precipitation patterns using copulas and generalized maximum pseudo likelihood estimation is considered with censoring combining historical and paleo flood information with systematic data however there are no studies with specific focus on understanding the variance in dependence structure within urban areas and its surrounding non urban areas at different accumulated durations this work highlights the importance of examining the variation of dependence structure at different durations in urban areas and obtains the covariates affecting the extremes at different durations a brief introduction of the multivariate models used in the work is provided in the next sub section 1 1 multivariate models spatial data observed at a finite set of locations are often modelled as a realization of spatial process let xi 1 xi 2 xid i 1 n be a sequence of independent d dimensional continuous random vectors and let mn max i 1 n xi 1 max i 1 nxid t and if there exists continuous functions an 0 and bn ℜ 1 pr m n b n a n y g y n g is non degenerate and belongs to class of multivariate max stable distributions cooley et al 2012 ribatet 2013 the depiction of multivariate max stable distributions assumes that the univariate marginal distributions are known and common to all locations in the study region according to the extreme value theory the univariate marginal distributions must be univariate max stable i e generalized extreme value gev distribution for a jth j 1 d component s marginal if μj σj and ξj are the location scale and shape parameters of the gev then 2 pr y j y g j y exp 1 ξ j y μ j σ j 1 ξ j a widely used choice is to assume unit fréchet margins as accounting for each gev marginal is cumbersome and therefore assuming z 1 zd to follow a multivariate max stable distribution with unit fréchet marginal i e pr z j z exp z 1 it follows that pr z z g z exp v z where v z e max j 1 d x y i z j is called the exponent function which characterizes the dependence across the elements of random vector z the details of dependence structure modelling and spatial analysis using max stable process are discussed at relevant places in the subsequent sections in this paper the variation in dependence structure of precipitation at different durations is studied with an aim to examine the differences in dependence structure between urban and its surrounding non urban areas and the spatial precipitation extremes are modelled considering the max stable process at different accumulated durations city of berlin germany and its surroundings are considered as the study region for this work due to ready availability of high resolution data in section 2 details of the study area and the hydrological and meteorological data used in the work are given the variation in dependence structure with duration in and around the city of berlin is discussed in section 3 considering different methods to obtain the spatial dependence in precipitation data the parameters of the marginal gev model as well as the dependence structure are obtained and the covariates affecting the extreme precipitation at different accumulated durations are listed in section 4 followed by conclusions in section 5 2 study area the berlin city capital of germany is one of the largest cities in the european union the precipitation data and the data for other variables including temperature relative humidity and mean sea level pressure are obtained from the germany s national meteorological service the deutscher wetterdienst dwd climate data center cdc website ftp ftp cdc dwd de pub cdc the locations of the observatories recording different variables in and around the city of berlin are shown in fig 1 the data are available at hourly time scale with different record lengths varying from 8 to 21 years the precipitation data at one hour duration are subsequently accumulated over 3 6 12 and 24 h durations annual maximum precipitation time series is obtained for each of these durations at all stations demarcating an urban area with a defined boundary from its rural surrounding is rather subjective the boundary of the city plotted in fig 1 is obtained from the global administrative areas http www gadm org download the approximate area of the city is 1400 km2 ranging from latitude 13 05 e to 13 74 e and longitude 52 37 n to 52 66 n bounding boxes are marked around the city increasing the region of interest progressively by 0 1 latitude and 0 06 longitude the dependence structure and subsequent modelling is carried out by considering the stations within each bounding box the limit of the bounding box is fixed at latitude 51 95 n to 53 08 n and longitude 12 35 e to 14 44 e such that the bounding box is defined by approximately equal distance of length width of the city in all directions a total of 37 stations present inside this bounding box are considered for analysis out of which 11 stations are within the city boundary fig 1a displays the bounding boxes and the stations at which precipitation temperature and mean sea level pressure are measured fig 1b shows the land use classification within the city and its surrounding areas fig 2 shows the box plots of the distributions of annual maximum precipitation for one hour duration at each year the width of the box plot is proportional to the number of sites in that particular year from the figure it is apparent that the data length is small prior to 2004 also a little evidence of temporal trend in precipitation for the study area can be noted from the figure which is neglected in this work 3 dependence structure for different durations in general the dependence measures are based on the association of the distributions of either multiple variables such as precipitation temperature etc at a specified location or a single variable e g precipitation at multiple locations let x i1 x i2 i 1 n be two independent random vectors with common continuous distribution and marginal distribution functions f1 and f2 i e xi 1 and xi 2 are the precipitation time series at two sites separated by a distance h the aim is to investigate the spatial dependence at various durations considering three different ways first is by considering entire time series through concordance second is by considering values above a chosen threshold and third is by considering the annual maxima time series 3 1 dependence measures one of the primary measures of dependence is the pearson s product moment correlation coefficient a measure of linear dependence related to the multivariate gaussian distribution usually obtained by considering the observations at pairwise gauge stations habib et al 2001 ciach and krajewski 2006 yoo and ha 2007 embrechts et al 2002 showed that difficulties arise when data do not follow multivariate gaussian distribution to overcome this limitation habib et al 2001 suggested log transforming the data under the hypothesis of bivariate lognormal distribution to obtain normality ciach and krajewski 2006 analysed the precipitation series in central oklahoma which did not show heavy tail behaviour and observed that the bivariate lognormal mixed distribution is not suitable to model the data also the pearson s linear correlation may not exist for random variables above a certain extreme threshold aghakouchak et al 2010 a possible alternative to pearson s linear correlation coefficient free from distribution of the data is the non parametric rank measure of dependence the kendall s rank correlation coefficient based on a link among variables called concordance serinaldi 2008 bàrdossy 2006 joe 1997 therefore overcoming the assumption of an underlying distribution instead of pearson s linear correlation kendall s τ is considered in this study to examine the spatial dependence of the precipitation time series kendall s τk is the difference between the probability of concordance and the probability of discordance for a pairs of observations randomly chosen i e it is the count of how many concordant and discordant pairs for the signs for all combinations the kendall s for the sample τk joe 1997 is given by 3 τ k n 2 1 i j s i g n x i 1 x j 1 x i 2 x j 2 kendall s τk is based on the association of the entire distribution of a variable at multiple locations however the degree of dependence between extreme values maybe significantly different from that of the rest of the distribution for instance the dependence in tails of a distribution may be stronger than the rest of the distribution an important measure in estimating the dependence of extremes is the tail dependence coefficient tdc which describes the dependence in the tail of a multivariate distribution frahm et al 2005 schmidt and stadtmüller 2006 typically a threshold u is selected and peaks over threshold time series is considered tdc introduced by sibuya 1959 is the degree of association in the upper right quadrant upper tail dependence and lower left quadrant lower tail dependence of a bivariate distribution in a bivariate distribution the tail dependence describes the limiting proportion that one marginal distribution exceeds a given threshold conditioned on the fact that the other margin has already exceeded that threshold aghakouchak et al 2010 coles et al 1999 derived the dependence measure χ u for different thresholds for the gaussian dependence model they showed that as the threshold increases u 1 the effect of dependence is diminished with dependence measure approaching to zero for all correlations less than one when the interest lies in evaluating the occurrence of simultaneous extreme flood events upper tail dependence coefficient λu is considered there are several studies on understanding the behaviour of upper tail dependent coefficients for hydrological variables like precipitation stream flows etc in literature e g poulin et al 2007 aghakouchak et al 2010 serinaldi 2013 serinaldi et al 2015 both parametric and nonparametric approaches have been developed for estimation of the upper tail dependent coefficients huang 1992 frahm et al 2005 there are several works dealing with extensive simulation studies to evaluate the reliability of parametric and nonparametric λu estimators as well listing various caveats about their use in practical analyses e g schmidt 2005 frahm et al 2005 schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 serinaldi et al 2015 frahm et al 2005 concluded that the parametric estimators perform well only if the underlying distribution copula is correct and the estimator s performance is very poor if the assumed model is wrong they concluded that the nonparametric estimators are the best when the sample size is large more than 250 points enough nonparametric estimators based on the concept of a bivariate empirical copula avoid any assumption regarding the underlying distribution but they exhibit large variance schmidt and stadtmuller 2006 aghakouchak et al 2010 however as the tail dependence coefficient may strongly depend on the choice of estimation technique frahm et al 2005 nonparametric tail dependence estimators are considered in this work to examine the dependence of the precipitation time series at various durations though several nonparametric estimators are developed the estimators proposed by schmidt and stadtmüller 2006 and huang 1992 are considered detailed notes on the nonparametric estimators are given in the appendix 1 of the supporting information the tail dependence estimator proposed by schmidt and stadtmüller 2006 is 4 λ u p s s 1 k i 1 n i r x 1 i n k r x 2 i n k where i is an indicator function r x 1 i and r x 2 i denote the ranks of xi 1 xi 2 i 1 n and k 1 n is the threshold rank a parameter chosen by the analyst serinaldi 2008 the tail dependence estimator proposed by huang 1992 is 5 λ u p h 2 1 k i 1 n i r x 1 i n k o r r x 2 i n k in addition to tdc extremal coefficient characterizing the dependence among extreme precipitation is one of the measures to quantify dependence in the extreme data in this case the annual maximum time series is considered schlather and tawn 2003 extensively studied the properties of the dependence measures in the study of extreme values in multivariate and spatial problems they discussed the consistency properties to be satisfied by extremal coefficients and the relations between extremal coefficients of different orders are given in schlather and tawn 2002 several studies considered extremal coefficient to estimate the dependence among the extreme observations of precipitation e g coles et al 1999 cooley et al al 2012 davison et al 2012 extremal coefficient θh is also considered in this work to quantify the dependence among extreme precipitation at different sites and at different accumulated durations cooley et al 2006 introduced f madogram ν and discussed estimation of the extremal coefficient based on the f madogram θ h 1 2ν h 1 2ν h an elaborate explanation of the extremal coefficient and f madogram is given in the appendix 1 of the supporting information if n h denotes the number of pairs s s separated by distance h the sample f madogram is given by 6 ν h 1 n i 1 n 1 2 n h s s n h g x i s g x i s ferreira and ferreira 2012 studied tail dependence coefficients as functions of order statistics and derived general properties for dependence measures which can be expressed through copulas of random vectors i e the three dependent measures used in this work can be formulated in terms of copulas further details and derivations of obtaining kendall s τk and λu from copulas can be found in serinaldi 2008 the relation between the tdc and the extremal coefficient can be found in ferreira and ferreira 2012 3 2 results the spatial dependence estimators are obtained by considering pairwise observations at two gauge stations if x 1 x 2 denotes a random vector of values collected at two gauge stations there could be different possible pairs with rain or no rain scenarios habib et al 2001 ha and yoo 2007 and yoo and ha 2007 analysed four kinds of pairs viz no rain at both the stations x 1 0 x 2 0 positive value at one station and null at the other x 1 0 x 2 0 and vice versa x 1 0 x 2 0 and positive values at both the stations x 1 0 x 2 0 to estimate pearson s coefficient in this study three cases are studied following serinaldi 2008 case a all pairs are considered x 1 0 x 2 0 case b all pairs except those with zero values at x 1 and x 2 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 and case c pairs only with both positive values at x 1 and x 2 x 1 0 x 2 0 the pairwise estimates of kendall s τk upper tail dependence coefficients and the extremal coefficients are obtained at stations for the city of berlin and the bounding boxes shown in fig 1a the results are not presented for all bounding boxes marked but only for four bounding boxes are given for brevity covering the city 13 05 e to 13 74 e 52 37 n to 52 66 n b1 12 75 e to 14 04 e 52 19 n to 52 84 n b2 12 55 e 14 24 e to 52 07 n 52 96 n and b3 12 35 e 14 44 e to 51 95 n 53 08 n the empirical kendall s τk with distance between pairwise stations for the three cases a b and c for different durations and for the four bounding boxes city b1 b2 and b3 are plotted appendix 2 of the supporting information for the case a where all the pairs including the nonzero values of precipitation are considered τk becomes negative as distance increases especially for the shorter durations for the other two cases the τk is positive with a very low correlation at larger distances the shorter durations have a lower correlation compared to that of the larger durations i e as the duration reduces correlation also reduces at all the bounding boxes including the city indicating that the shorter duration events are less correlated also the scattering of τk values increase as the accumulated duration increases this is due to the fact that physical phenomena driving the occurrence of precipitation at the sites could be similar for larger durations serinaldi 2008 there is no appropriate discrimination in the τk values between the city and the other bounding boxes the tdc and or the extremal coefficient should be used for assessing the dependence structure in the extremes the estimates of upper tail dependence with distance are shown in fig 3 for all the cases and bounding boxes the estimates of λ u p s s and λ u p h are similar and therefore fig 3 shows only λ u p s s the estimates of λ u p h are given in the appendix 2 of the supporting information both the tail dependence coefficients show a similar pattern for all the cases and bounding boxes similar to τk the λup s both λ u p s s and λ u p h decrease as the duration increases and as the distance increases the scattering of λup s increases from case a to case c for all the accumulated durations for the case a the estimates are approximately equal for larger durations indicating that the tail dependence is not explicitly noticeable when the nonzero precipitation is considered in the calculations of estimates of tail dependence coefficients a threshold needs to be specified to avoid the subjectivity in the choice of threshold a kernel plateau finding algorithm frahm et al 2005 is generally used for the estimation of the threshold although this algorithm used in this study allows choosing the threshold value objectively different thresholds at 80 85 90 and 95 quantiles are considered to check if variation in λup s is different in urban areas at high thresholds as λ u is a non trivial function of threshold u coles et al 1999 it is observed that as the threshold increases the tail dependence coefficient approaches zero specifically at shorter durations indicating that the λup s are asymptotically independent fig 4 shows the estimates of λ u p s s for the city and the bounding box b3 at a high quantile 95 the tail dependence coefficient approaches zero for case b and case c at shorter durations indicating that at higher thresholds the λup s are asymptotically independent similar to the τk no sharp discrimination in estimates of λup s between the city and the other bounding boxes is noticed the estimates of extremal coefficients are obtained by considering only the extreme precipitation i e annual maximum time series at the stations the estimates are obtained using the r package spatialextremes developed by ribatet 2015 the pairwise estimates as well as the binned estimates of the extremal coefficients are shown in fig 5 for all the bounding boxes and the accumulated durations the estimates of θ s at small distances for hourly durations are much larger compared to those of the 24 h durations indicating that the shorter duration precipitation events are less dependent within the city as the bounding box size increases i e as one moves away from the city the amount of dependence is nearly equal for all the durations including at small distances for bounding box b3 it is evident from the figure that the effect of urbanization is totally concealed the 11 stations within the city are removed from the bounding box b3 and the estimates of θ s are obtained shown in fig 6 the dependence is nearly equal for all the durations in this case as well at small distances a similar result is observed for the bounding box b2 figure not shown for conciseness the estimates of θ s are also calculated by considering the stations all round the city s boundary i e by considering the stations on the north south east and west of the city the estimates of θ s for the city s surrounding areas are also similar i e the dependence for all the durations is more or less equal at small distances therefore it can be concluded from this exercise that within the city the extreme precipitation is less dependent for shorter durations at small distances the kendall s τk and the tail dependence coefficients are similarly obtained at the stations on the north south east and west of the city but the estimates did not show any different variation in correlation dependence from the city 4 modelling dependence structure it is concluded from section 3 that the dependence structure is different at different accumulated durations within the urban areas specifically at short distances it is also important to identify the covariates affecting the precipitation extremes at different durations with different dependence structures within the urban area and at the bounding boxes where the non urban surroundings are included it is therefore important to model the spatial dependence structure in the observations which may otherwise lead to unrealistic spatial inference and prediction katz et al 2002 in this work the spatial extremes at different durations are modelled considering max stable processes accounting the dependence structure according to de haan 1984 and de haan and ferreira 2006 the processes can be described by two components a poisson process π on 0 with intensity dζ ζ 2 and x s is a stochastic process let ζi π be points of the poisson process and xi s is independent realizations of the stochastic process x s with e x s 1 then z s max i 1 ζ i x i s s s is a max stable process with unit fréchet margins different choices of the process xi s lead to different classes of max stable processes including brown resnick process extremal gaussian process davison et al 2012 for more details about the models and their simulation methods one can be refer to ribatet et al 2016 and oesting et al 2016 fitting max stable process to data lacks closed form expressions for joint likelihood in high dimensions padoan et al 2010 developed a likelihood based approach to fit max stable processes by substituting composite likelihood instead of joint likelihood the composite likelihood is a weighted sum of log likelihoods for each event which is maximized to obtain the estimates of parameters termed as maximum composite likelihood estimators mcle or composite likelihood information criterion clic pairwise likelihood is an example of composite likelihood lp given by 7 l p ψ z k 1 n j 1 d 1 j j 1 d log f z k s j z k s j ψ whereψ is a spatial dependence parameter each term f zk sj zk s j ψ is a bivariate density function based on observations at locations j and j the two inner summations add up all unique pairs and the outer summation adds over the n iid replicates mcle obtained by maximizing the pairwise likelihood is consistent and asymptotically normal the variance matrix of the mcle ψ is estimated by an information sandwich of the form v ψ j 1 ψ h ψ j 1 ψ where j 1 ψ is the observed information matrix and h ψ is the estimated variance of the score contributions corresponding to the composite log likelihood lp 4 1 covariates the max stable process with gev as marginal distribution is considered to model the extreme precipitation at all the accumulated durations and bounding boxes parameters of the gev are modelled to vary spatially as a linear function of geographic and climatological covariates in this work only the location and scale parameters are varied spatially and the shape parameter is modelled uniformly across the region of interest the list of covariates used in this study is given in table 1 for the seven covariates first order regression equation with single covariates counting to seven models and second order with two covariates leading to 21 combinations 7c2 of models are considered regression equations beyond second order are not considered to avoid complexity and therefore a total of 28 models are considered the notation of referring the model is considered according to the covariate no in table 1 for example model m25 corresponds to the covariates latitude with covariate no 2 and mean temperature with covariate no 5 the elevation of the region of interest is obtained from the 30 m resolution digital elevation model from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem provided by national aeronautic and space administration nasa http reverb echo nasa gov reverb the climatological covariates mean temperature mean sea level pressure and the mean diurnal temperature range are obtained from the observatories marked in fig 1 the temperature and the pressure data are available at a total of 20 and 14 stations respectively within the region of interest both the datasets are available from 1955 onwards but a number of stations do not have complete data for the entire period therefore data from 2005 to 2015 are considered for obtaining the mean values of the covariates all the covariates are standardised to make them dimensionless 4 2 results fitting of max stable processes to the data is a crucial first step in modelling the dependence structure different choices of the process xi s in the spectral representation lead to different classes of max stable processes for bounding boxes b2 and b3 70 of the stations are considered for model fitting and the remaining are used for checking the validity of the model effort was not made to leave out some stations for the city and the bounding box b1 as the number of stations available for building the model is low a quick investigation on the plots of pairwise and binned estimates of extremal coefficients revealed that the schlather s model and the extremal t model both with whittle matern correlation function are better suitable for modelling the data the estimates of gev and dependence parameters are attained using the spatialextremes package in r the estimates of parameters are obtained for all the 28 models and at each of the bounding box the model selection is based on minimizing the clic which has analogous properties to takeuchi s information criterion tic given by ribatet 2013 8 t i c 2 l p ψ 2 t r j 1 ψ h ψ tic is calculated for each of the model and the model with minimum tic is considered as the best fig 7 shows the five best models based on the tic for all the bounding boxes and accumulated durations and table 2 gives the best model with tic values and the corresponding covariates for obtaining the marginal gev parameters the first two columns of fig 8 show the estimates of extremal coefficients between pairs of stations and the extremal coefficient functions obtained with the fitted schlather s top row and extremal t bottom row model for the city at 1 h first column and 24 h second column durations it is evident from the figure that the schlather s model fits both the durations appropriately specifically for 24 h duration the model estimated accurately the extremal dependence at small distances of less than 25 km however the extremal t model appears to underestimate extremal dependence for both the durations therefore for the city at all the durations schlather s model is considered the last two columns of fig 8 show the pairwise estimates of extremal coefficients and functions obtained with the fitted schlather s top row and extremal t bottom row model for the bounding box b3 at 1 h first column and 24 h second column durations it may be noted that both the models show similar fit for b3 at 24 h duration however for 1 h duration the schlather s model underestimates and extremal t model overestimates the binned estimates of extremal coefficients but provides a reasonably better fit to the pairwise estimates grey points similar results are obtained for the other two bounding boxes b1 and b2 also and therefore schlather s model is considered for all the bounding boxes the plots for other durations and the bounding boxes are not shown for brevity however it is to be noted that the choice of the covariates is not affected by the choice of either schlather s or the extremal t model except for a few cases from the table 2 it may be noted that within the city and for bounding box b1 the geographical covariates prevail and for the bounding boxes b2 and b3 climatological covariates are dominant extreme precipitation within the city is affected by the geography and as one move away from the city the climatological features affect the extreme precipitation more significantly for checking the accuracy of the model in b3 out of 37 stations 26 stations are randomly chosen to fit the model and the remaining 11 are used to validate the model for the bounding box b2 out of 25 stations 18 stations are considered for fitting the model fig 9 shows the comparison between pairwise estimates of the annual maximum data observed and simulated from the model between stations separated by 6 km 54 km and 160 km distance for one hour and 24 h durations there is a good agreement between the modelled and observed annual maxima similar results were obtained for the other durations and the bounding box b2 however the results are not presented here for conciseness synthesizing the results from this section and from section 3 it can be concluded that the extreme precipitation exhibits lower dependence for shorter durations at small distances and the geographical covariates dominate within the city further as the surrounding rural areas are included this dependence at the shorter durations increases and climatological covariates dominate within the city the temperatures are marginally higher compared to the surrounding areas and therefore the chances of high intensity short duration precipitation events with less spatial extent are high due to localized convective storms leading to less dependent extreme precipitation while geography of the city has a major impact on the extreme precipitation climatology plays an important role when a region is considered which includes the city i e the effects of urban features diminish 5 concluding remarks in urban areas the need for accurate estimates of precipitation extremes specifically the spatial return levels has become important in design and planning the urban infrastructure to mitigate flooding spatial variation of extreme precipitation in urban areas is likely to be high and much different from the non urban areas yang et al 2013 2015 in this work the dependence structure of extreme precipitation at different accumulated durations within an urban area and its non urban surroundings is examined three measures of dependence kendall s rank correlation coefficient nonparametric tail dependence coefficient and extremal coefficient are used to examine the variation in dependence structure city of berlin germany and its non urban surroundings are considered as region of interest it is observed that the hourly precipitation extremes within the city exhibit weaker dependence while the 24 h duration extremes show dependence at short distances this may be due to marginally higher temperatures within urban areas which tend to intensify the convective storms leading to high intensity short duration and less spatial extent precipitation events vojinović and abbott 2012 the dependence structure of the daily precipitation in the city gets masked as more and more surrounding non urban areas are included in the analysis the variation in extreme precipitation is more evident when the extremal coefficient is used than when kendall s τk or the tail dependence coefficient is considered max stable processes are used to model the extreme precipitation at various durations within the city and its surroundings the location and scale parameters of gev are considered as linear functions of geographic and climatologic covariates the dependence structure and the gev parameters are modelled at different durations using the schlather s model with whittle matern correlation structure the accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the modelled and observed extreme precipitation at different validation sites further it is observed that the geographic covariates are predominant within the city and the climatological covariates prevail when the surrounding non urban areas are included in the analysis although the spatial analysis attempts to improve the models through pooling information across sites fawcett and walshaw 2013 the available data for the study region is of a rather short length which may lead to high uncertainties in the estimates of parameters davison et al 2012 reported that dependence often decreases for increasingly rare events which points the inadequacies in the formulation as used in this paper wadsworth and tawn 2012 developed models for near independence spatial extremes data to account for sampling uncertainty bayesian inference can be incorporated to the max stable models stephenson et al 2016 reich and shaby 2012 leading to the posterior distributions of parameters also the annual maximum precipitation is considered in this work which may result in loss of some information of extreme events specifically at shorter durations this issue can be addressed by considering threshold maxima kiriliouk 2016 thibaud et al 2016 the non stationarity in the precipitation time series at different durations is not considered in this work while it is relatively straightforward to incorporate non stationarity by considering the underlying marginal parameters depend on the covariates it is more complicated to model non stationarity in the dependence structure huser and genton 2016 furthermore carrying likelihood inference may lead to unreliable estimates if the dataset is not rich spatially even by including meaningful covariates in the dependence structure and the marginal parameters there have been very few attempts to address this problem so far in the literature huser and genton 2016 westra and sisson 2011 stephenson et al 2016 attempted to simultaneously model precipitation over space and accumulated durations within a max stable process framework which could only consider non stationarity in the marginal parameters of the gev they reported that including dependence structure as a function of accumulated durations could lead to impractical computation times other than for small number of sites jiang et al 2015 used a time varying copula to investigate the variations in the dependence structure between river flows at different locations due to reservoirs they have considered a time varying copula model which takes the nonstationarity in the marginal distribution and the dependence structure between different hydrological series as well the copula with the dependence parameter expressed as a function of either time or reservoir index is applied to model the variable dependence between the two low flow series however their study considers only two sites enabling the use of bivariate models in addition to the max stable models copulas and bayesian hierarchical models are also used to model the temporal non stationarity bracken et al 2018 proposed a bayesian hierarchical framework to conduct non stationary frequency analysis considering gaussian elliptical copula to model the joint distribution of variables peak snow water equivalent peak inflow and peak reservoir elevation they concluded that the overall uncertainty is reduced by incorporating multivariate dependence between the variables since most of the studies concentrate on incorporating non stationarity in the marginal gev parameters an interesting extension would be to incorporate non stationarity in the dependence structure as well and model the parameters simultaneously at all the durations also the variation in the dependence and marginal parameters using different models such as copulas bayesian hierarchical methods time varying gevs glms

three dimensional 3 d equations e g chen govindaraju kavvas 1994a 1994b troch mancini paniconi wood 1993 however due to the assumptions of 1 d flow domain hillslope of unit width with homogeneous soil free surface boundary overlying the saturated strata and simple end point boundary conditions many of these theories cannot be considered realistic paniconi troch emiel van loon hilberts 2003 similarly field application of 3 d richards equation is not always feasible in ungauged or scantily gauged catchments due to the difficulty in model parameterization unavailability of information on soil hydraulic properties at the required spatial scale inaccuracy and numerical instability problems associated with coarser spatiotemporal model discretization and high computational time list radu 2016 paniconi et al 2003 consequently in the hydrologic literature for modeling the subsurface flow dynamics an emphasis has been given formulating simple low dimensional and physically based models accounting for the spatiotemporal variability in atmospheric geomorphologic and pedo hydrologic features of the catchment duffy 1996 grayson blöschl 2000 woods sivapalan 1999 fan and bras 1998 laid

serve as a potential tool for ungauged catchment modeling troch et al 2004 as it is of reduced dimensionality with parsimonious model parameters and is simpler than the recent 3 d hillslope based models e g hazenberg et al 2015 however in spite of the improvements in the theoretical framework and modelling domain of the hsb model and its variants it is evident from the very few real world

instrumented and experimental data sufficient hillslopes e g carrillo et al 2011 liu han chen lin wang 2016 matonse kroll 2009 matonse kroll 2013 while simulating low streamflows by the hsb model matonse and kroll 2009 considered recharge input into the hsb model by subtracting evapotranspiration and interception losses from precipitation however neglecting infiltration dynamics this approach henceforth termed as the direct rainfall recharge drr approach ignores the hortonian runoff mechanism and overestimates the recharge that can invite substantial error in predicting low streamflows constraining the model s applicability to handle only the saturation excess runoff for baseflow simulation matonse and kroll 2013 improved the approach of matonse and kroll 2009 by coupling the hsb model with the lumped sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma rainfall runoff model requiring a number of a priori parameters to incorporate the components of evapotranspiration land cover interflow baseflow overland flow and lateral flow due to the underlying complexity this approach may not be suitable for scantily gauged catchments the problem is further aggravated in case of the monsoon type tropical catchments in which the topsoil layer is subjected to precipitation irrigation and evapotranspiration the water percolated from the topsoil first passes through the transmission zone based on its soil moisture dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and finally reaches the water table as recharge this phenomenon is observed during the non monsoon dry period see fig 1 b conversely in many tropical monsoon type catchments paddy crop is the dominant land use during the monsoon season wherein to deal with the dry spells through adequate water storage the croplands are bounded with dikes earthen embankments of about 10 40 cm in height these local controls store precipitation and surface runoff resulting in ponding and surface saturation and form seasonal artificial wetlands chen liu 2002 note that infiltration during ponding condition is always higher than that during no ponding condition due to the additional head of ponded water chen liu huang 2002 he wang takase mouri razafindrabe 2009 jha sahoo panda 2017 when the percolation rate from the topsoil is higher than the hydraulic conductivity at any soil layer in the transmission zone the upper layer of this zone gets saturated due to the addition of water during this situation an unsaturated zone is sandwiched between two saturated zones fig 1c the lower one is the saturated boussinesq aquifer where the flow is lateral according to dupuit s assumption conversely in the top saturated zone flow is vertical due to gravity and soil suction is developed due to the negative soil matric potential ψ m of the underlying vadose zone the flow continues to be vertically downward as long as the negative soil matric potential is present with continuous addition of moisture or water the unsaturated moisture content θ changes to saturated moisture content θ s and with the further addition of moisture positive pressure ψ p builds up hence the above dynamics creates a saturated zone with a moving variable lower boundary above the transmission zone in this case the root zone water balance approach e g carrillo et al 2011 may not yield accurate results furthermore the bedrock leakage bl flux is a

simulation of pore water pressure distribution ebel loague montgomery dietrich 2008 and is essential for simulating the subsurface flow response at the hillslope or catchment scale meerveld weiler 2008 therefore the specific research gaps in the previous hsb based studies are identified as i non consideration of the fluxes to and from the aquifer ii assumption of impermeable bedrock iii lack of hsb parameterization method for its application in ungauged catchments and iv assumption of spatially uniform aquifer hydraulic properties these limitations constrain the applicability of the model in scantily gauged catchments and necessitate for the development of a generalized approach accounting for all the hydrologic fluxes to the hillslope aquifer in light of the above viewpoints this paper tries to answer the research questions 1 how including more hydrological processes to estimate recharge could improve the classical drr approach in the hsb based model and 2 how to parameterize a low dimensional model in an ungauged catchment to address these issues this study tries to advocate a novel recharge flux estimation method embedded in the hsb model framework by considering all the physical hydrological processes in the vadose zone overlying the water table as recharge varies with precipitation topography and land use and land cover lulc characteristic of the basin these dynamics are accounted for in the enhanced hsb model framework incorporating the water balance modeling of topsoil along with the inclusion of unsaturated zone processes during non monsoon dry period similarly during monsoon wet period recharge due to surface ponding sp in croplands with rainwater is estimated by considering the saturated phase modeling validating the low dimensional hsb based model in a data scarce catchment would open avenues for understanding the subsurface dynamics in ungauged catchments since in the hydrologic literature an emphasis has been given for prediction in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 hence the present approach augments the hsb model to make it a wholesome package for real catchment modeling the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 briefs the hsb model and the earlier efforts to advance the theoretical and model framework and section 3 details the model enhancements brought out in this study study area and application of the enhanced model variants in the study area are described in sections 4 and 5 respectively section 6 discusses the results and section 7 concludes the study 2 the hsb model a brief description 2 1 a brief description estimation of subsurface storage discharge along a hillslope unconfined aquifer of unit width resting on sloping bedrock was given by boussinesq childs 1971 combining it with the continuity equation the modified form of the boussinesq equation accounting for 1 d flow domain is expressed as 1 h x t t k s f cos x h x t h x t x sin h x t x n t f where h groundwater elevation perpendicular to the bedrock l t time t ks saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 f drainable porosity α bedrock slope angle of underlying impermeable layer x flow distance from the catchment outlet l and n rainfall recharge rate lt 1 fan and bras 1998 introduced the hillslope width function hwf l to represent the 3 d soil mantle into 1 d form by a soil moisture storage capacity function sc x fw x d where w x is the hwf and d x is the average soil depth at a flow distance x from the outlet incorporating hwf in the continuity form of eq 1 and combining with darcy s equation troch et al 2003 presented the 1 d hsb model to study the subsurface storage dynamics expressed as 2 f s x t t k s cos α f x s x t w x s x t x s x t w x w x x k s sin α s x t x f n t w x eq 2 is applicable in hillslopes with shallow soils on a relatively impermeable bedrock or lower permeable subsoil where the d f assumptions are valid it computes groundwater stage hydrograph h x t at any

w x f w x h x t d x in eq 3 the first and second terms represent the input flux and aquifer saturated storage respectively 2 2 assumptions in this study the following assumptions undertaken for developing the hillslope scale hsb model are also valid i the d f assumptions for groundwater flow hold ii the hillslope storage varies along the longitudinal distance x from the outlet however this variability is ignored in the transverse direction of x i e in the y direction 2 3 model history since its inception the hsb model has undergone several improvements by inclusion of complex hillslope

surface flow models furthermore broda et al 2012 developed the hsb analytic element model hsb ae to improve the hsb model dealing with shallow subsurface water by coupling it with the analytical element ae approach haitjema 1995 3 enhancement of the hsb model 3 1 the model domain to incorporate the dominant catchment processes in the enhanced hsb model framework the hillslopes can be considered as the basic unit of study in which the entire soil column resting above the bedrock forms the hillslope unconfined aquifer fig 1a the aquifer can be assumed as a three layered system fig 1b and c in which the depth of the first layer was selected as 45 cm herein which is based on the average root zone depth of the dominant vegetation in the study area the second soil layer is the transmission vadose zone that extends up to the zone of saturation or unconfined aquifer water table representing the third layer these three layers from the top surface exchange the fluxes of infiltration and evapotranspiration surface and subsurface runoffs and bedrock leakage with the boundaries of atmosphere stream network and underlying confined aquifer respectively 3 2 hydrological process components since the existing hsb model variants do not explicitly account for all the hydrological process components as mentioned earlier this model was enhanced by i considering the surface and unsaturated zone water balances for recharge estimation during the non monsoon dry period ii accounting for the surface ponding and vadose zone processes during the monsoon wet period and iii revising the original assumption of impermeable bedrock by a leaky bedrock which is more realistic recharge to the hillslope unconfined aquifer water table depends on the unsaturated zone soil

approach the hillslope unconfined aquifer interacts with the overlying root zone and the intermediate transmission zone hence the net recharge flux to the hillslope aquifer depends upon the flux

t 1 although many other infiltration models viz the two parameter philip s kostiakov and green ampt models are available in the literature estimation of the horton s model parameters in the field condition is easier due to simplicity and also there are accuracy issues with the kostiakov model at large time scales kale sahoo 2011 parlange haverkamp 1989 philip 1957 rearranging eq 8 one obtains the percolation rate into the transmission zone using the water balance wb approach as 15 r w b x t i x t e t a x t d t s d d t θ r z x t to estimate rwb eq 15 is solved numerically first for the current value of θrz and then for the updated values of θrz at subsequent time steps as illustrated in fig 2 now the transmission zone water balance can be solved to obtain the recharge from the ith

t z z t θ r i d z note that the depth of the transmission zone is dynamic due to the changing water table under such a scenario the recharge can be higher than the downward flux of water as the rising water table takes up water from the transmission zone hilberts et al 2007 now the enhanced hsb model accounting for the wb approach of effective recharge estimation during dry period can be given by

surface ponding during monsoon wet period wb sp approach combining the continuity and darcy s equations the recharge during ponding saturated phase can be estimated by the laplace equation as agrawal panda panigrahi 2004 19 k v 2 ψ p z 2 k v z ψ p z 0 where ψ p hydraulic head l expressed as ψ p pz z and pz piezometric head l eq 19 was solved numerically using the central difference scheme by dividing the root zone depth into different sub layers each of 10 cm thickness applying the finite difference form of eq 19 at all the grid points yields ng 1 number of simultaneous equations ng number of grids the solution of eq 19 involves the dynamic saturated zone as the lower boundary and the hydraulic head at the land surface as the upper boundary with the root zone node nrz 0 expressed

method in matrix form to obtain ψp at each grid point substituting ψp in darcy s equation the percolation flux from the root zone with surface ponding sp can be obtained as 23 r s p k v ψ p n r z 1 ψ p n r z δ z where δz vertical grid spacing l of the problem space 10 cm and ψp nrz hydraulic head at the discretization node in the root zone hence recharge under surface ponding condition for the ith lulc class can be expressed as 24 n s p i x t r s p i c i t 0 d h t 1 c o s θ t z z t θ r i d z now the enhanced hsb model for the wet period considering the wb sp approach can be expressed as 25 f x

studies the oversimplification of impermeable bedrock could add error in the hsb model solutions specifically when applied to a real world catchment the bedrock leakage flux can be estimated using darcy s equation as broda et al 2011 26 n l k b h t h b d b where nl bedrock leakage flux lt 1 kb bedrock vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 db bedrock thickness measured perpendicular to the bedrock slope l and ht and hb are the hydraulic heads l at the top and bottom of the bedrock respectively in this study ht and hb are the water table elevations obtained from the two piezometers drilled up to the top and bottom of the bedrock respectively 3 2 4 generalized versions of the enhanced hsb model for alternate wetting and drying phases and land uses during the non monsoon dry period the enhanced wb bl approach based hsb model considering the water balance and bedrock leakage flux can be expressed for any land use class other than agriculture as 27 f s x t t k s x cos α f x s x t w x s x t x s x t w x w x x k s x sin α s x t x fw x n wb x t n l t similarly for the agricultural land use where substantial ponding can be expected during the monsoon wet season the enhanced wb sp bl based hsb model can be expressed as 28 f x s x t t k s x cos α f x x s x t w x s x t x s x t w x w x x k s x sin α s x t x f x w x n wb x t n sp x t n l t note that nwb and nsp are mutually exclusive in the sense that only one of these can be greater than zero the presence of these two terms in eq 28 makes the expression more generic for addressing the problem of alternate wetting and drying awd as there could be a period of non ponding phase in between two ponding phases 3 2 5 model discretization and boundary conditions eqs 18 27 and 28 were discretized by the finite difference scheme in space and a multistep ordinary differential equation ode45 solver in time with x 30 m and t 1 h with the output print time of t 1 day similarly although the depth of the transmission zone is varying the spatialization of the recharge sub models nwb eq 17 and nsp eq 24 was fixed as z 0 1 m and x 30 m along the vertical and lateral coordinates for solving the hsb model in a real hillslope the following boundary conditions were used i no flux boundary at the catchment divide x l qgw 0 ii dirichlet boundary condition at the downstream channel outlet x 0 h 0 and a recharge boundary nwb bl x t or nwb sp bl x t at the top surface depending on the hsb model variant to be used the recharge forcings were computed as separate functions in the matlab environment as detailed in fig 2 the assumptions of x 0 h 0 is unrealistic for estimating the baseflow in a hillslope where a seepage face is usually expected and this creates a problem for calculating discharge at the lower boundary using darcy s law however this assumption is used by several researchers e g beven 1981 matonse kroll 2009 to decouple it from the effect of a stream as incorporating the stream aquifer interaction is beyond the scope of the present study furthermore since a numerical technique was used to estimate the discharge ensuring mass balance the simulated flow rate could be marginally affected by such an assumption as studied by beven 1981 and matonse and kroll 2009 the steps illustrated in fig 2 were executed in the matlab environment as follows i the estimated aquifer hydraulic parameters ks kb f θs θr and the parameters of the brooks corey and richards equations were directly read from the look up table ii the meteorological and piezometer datasets were read at each simulation time step to estimate the actual evapotranspiration and capillary rise respectively iii the initial values of ponding depth if any were read iv based on the ponding or non ponding situation percolation through the transmission zone was estimated by transmission zone water balance using root zone percolation capillary rise and bedrock leakage processes v the hillslope saturated storage and discharge were estimated vi the ponding and the transmission zone depths were re estimated to repeat the steps iii v 4 study area and pedo hydrogeologic database the study area considered herein is the ungauged kanjhari reservoir catchment which is a tributary of the baitarani river in odisha state in eastern india having a monsoon type tropical climate this study area lies in between 21 33 21 41 n latitudes and 85 38 85 48 e longitudes with an area of 125 04 km2 the elevation map of the study area the locations of the experimental wells their well logs and the double ring infiltration tests are illustrated in fig 3 this area receives an average annual rainfall of about 1332 mm with an average 75 numbers of rainy days per year and a range of maximum daily rainfall intensity of 65 8 234 0 mm more than 80 of the annual rainfall is generally received during june to september from the south west monsoon depicting the wet period which is the primary forcing for groundwater recharge similarly the daily temperature varies in the range of 8 44 c during the winter and summer seasons the hard rock terrain of the kanjhari reservoir catchment is made up of typical geomorphic landforms of isolated residual hillocks inselbergs structural and denuded hills pediment and buried pediment valleys and linear ridges das behera kar narendra guha 1997 the subsurface soil of the catchment contains the secondary porosity that facilitates for the subsurface storage and groundwater movement in different weathered formations this catchment is geo hydraulically interconnected in which the near surface weathered zone forms the unconfined aquifers the source for flow of subsurface and groundwater in the deeper soil zones the predominant type of surface soil distributed in the study area can be sub grouped into coarse loamy fine loamy and loamy fig 4 the daily scale meteorological data of precipitation relative humidity and maximum and minimum temperatures for the study period at the nearest meteorology station located at 21 37 n latitude and 85 35 e longitude were collected from the meteorology centre india meteorological department bhubaneswar for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration the solar radiation and wind speed data available with the national aeronautics and space administration usa nasa 2015 were used similarly the daily soil moisture data of two grid cells covering the study area at a spatial scale of 0 25 0 25 was obtained from the satellite based reanalysis data products of smos bec 2012 2017 fig 5 illustrates the timeseries of daily rainfall soil moisture and estimated actual evapotranspiration that were used for the daily scale recharge estimation using the approach as shown in fig 2 the soil moisture contents in the root zone and the transmission zone were measured by installing the time domain refractometry tdr soil moisture probes up to three depths of 0 3 m 1 m 2 m and 3 m near all the well locations for calibration and validation of the hsb model against the water table height above the impermeable layer the daily scale water table data were collected from two experimental open wells w1 w2 along with the 15 daily data from other four observation wells w3 w6 note that the catchment was considered ungauged regarding baseflow measurement however at least limited timeseries data of groundwater table is available for model setup further the range of values of aquifer hydraulic properties viz saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were obtained from the pumping test results as published by dhiman 2012 the soil samples were collected from the well locations and grain size analysis was performed to determine the aquifer formation material from the dominant type of formation material the aquifer hydraulic properties were estimated following the chart by heath 1983 the lulc and soil type maps were obtained from the odisha space application centre orsac bhubaneswar to study the infiltration characteristics of the surface soil double ring infiltrometer test was carried out at four locations fig 3 in the catchment representing the different soil types fig 4 5 application of enhanced hsb model variants to a real world catchment 5 1 derivation of the hillslope width function hwf the hsb model operates on hillslopes as elements building the catchment in this study the entire catchment was considered as a single hillslope for applying the hsb model e g troch smith wood de troch 1994 the hillslope geomorphology as regards of the hwf was derived as the probability density of flow distances from the channel network bogaart troch 2006 hence to obtain the hwf the streamlines were first delineated from the available dem as illustrated in fig 2 e g sahoo sahoo 2018 the methodology of streamline delineation is illustrated in fig 2 for the computation of flow direction contributing area and land slope the dem pre processing was performed using the terrain analysis using digital elevation model taudem version 5 1 2 tarboton 2014 channel network extraction involves the determination of the threshold contributing area ac where the channel networks were identified as those pixels having the contributing area larger than ac in this study the value of ac was determined by trial and error until the extracted channel network for a given estimate of ac resembled the natural drainage network then the flow distance was estimated by the d8 pour point algorithm o callaghan mark 1984 and subsequently from the probability density function pdf of flow distance the hwf was estimated fig 6 a illustrates the flow distance of different locations in the catchment from the channel network the probability density of flow distances is illustrated in fig 6b in general the hillslope width gets decreased from the streamlines towards the catchment divide fig 6b representing the divergent planform of the study area 5 2 real catchment application considering it both as gauged and ungauged regarding of water table elevation wte 5 2 1 evaluation of model parameters the bedrock slope angle α of the catchment was determined from the well logs at different places along the transect from the catchment boundary to the channel the model parameters common to both the gauged and ungauged scenarios as evaluated for the study area are given in table 1 the subsequent sections describe the parameterization of aquifer hydraulic property for the gauged and ungauged scenarios 5 2 2 gauged and ungauged catchment description as defined by sivapalan et al 2003 an ungauged catchment is one where sufficient record of hydrological observation both regarding data quality and quantity is not available to aid in modeling the desired hydrological variable thus a catchment may be gauged at one period and ungauged at other periods the desired variable can be precipitation streamflow and sediment yield for surface water modeling and water table data and baseflow rate in case of groundwater modeling the developed enhanced versions of the hsb model were applied to the study area considering it both as gauged and ungauged catchments in the present study the catchment was considered as gauged for the period of modeling and ungauged otherwise because information on wte is available only during the periods of model calibration and validation in a more generalized way it was evaluated how would have the developed model performed had the study area been an ungauged one 5 2 3 gauged catchment case the direct rainfall recharge drr water balance wb water balance surface ponding wb sp and water balance surface ponding bedrock leakage wb sp bl based enhanced hsb model variants were calibrated at daily scale using the wte of wells w1 and w2 measured during the water year of 1st june 2012 to 31st may 2013 out of these four variants the best performing wb sp bl based model was calibrated at 15 daily scale using the wte of the wells w3 w4 and w5 note that as the period from 1st june to 31st may of the next year is considered as one water year in india the data periods for calibration and validation purposes were selected accordingly it was considered that the hillslope unconfined aquifer is made up of drainable pore space s f w h first to deal with equifinality problem the possible range of the soil class specific aquifer parameters ks and f were obtained using the well log information at each well location based on the works of heath 1983 and dhiman 2012 subsequently manual calibration was carried out by varying the ks and f values within the pre estimated range the spatial variation of the parameters was obtained using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique to estimate the unknown information on soil parameters at any location x y from the known information available at the surrounding locations the idw interpolation method assumes that the surrounding locations close enough to x y are more alike than the distant surrounding locations as lu wong 2008 29 k s x y i 1 n g k s i d i 2 i 1 n g 1 d i 2 30 f x y i 1 n g f i d i 2 i 1 n g 1 d i 2 where di euclidian distance of the centroid x y of the grid of interest from the centroid of the ith grid with the known parameters and ng number of grid points with the known information on soil parameters as the 1 d hsb model uses the grid averaged parameters ks x and f x in the x direction only the effective parameter values at a distance x from the stream network was estimated as the geometric mean of all the ks x y and f x y grid values located on the isoline at a flow distance x as 31a k s x 1 n x k s x y 1 n x 31b f x 1 n x f x y 1 n x where nx number of grid points at a flow distance x with the spatially varied values of ks x and f x the model simulations were performed until the hsb solutions were closer to the observed wte resulting in the maximum nse estimates subsequently with the spatially varied calibrated values of ks x and f x the model was validated against the daily scale wte observations at w1 and w2 and against 15 daily wte at w1 w6 locations 5 2 4 ungauged catchment case in case of ungauged case of groundwater modeling the available data is only well logs from which the hydraulic parameters can be estimated due to lack of observed water table data the modelers are left with two options i use the model parameter values from similar modeling studies on identical catchments by regionalization of parameters or ii use the values obtained from aquifer formations through geophysical investigation however the second case might be more logical in real world scenarios since the possibility of finding a gauged catchment nearby the ungauged catchment is very remote hence the aquifer hydraulic properties were used directly for modeling and assessing the model performance as the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is a function of grain size and grain distribution characteristics the well logs were analyzed to determine the principal aquifer forming material stratigraphic formation by sieving subsequently for the principal material of the stratigraphic layer viz coarse sand medium sand fine sand silt and clay the range of the ks and f were obtained from the literature heath 1983 and the representative material specific values for that soil layer was estimated using the geometric mean of the respective lower and upper limiting values as obtained from the literature the equivalent location specific ks and f values for the entire soil column were computed as 32a k s x y m 1 n s l k s m t h m m 1 n s l t h m 32b f x y m 1 n s l f m t h m m 1 n s l t h m where ks m equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material forming the m th layer lt 1 fm equivalent porosity of the aquifer material forming the m th layer lt 1 thm thickness of the m th soil layer l and nsl total number of soil layers 5 2 5 model spin up in most of the data scarce catchments where information on spatial distribution of groundwater elevation and soil moisture are unavailable specifying the initial conditions is challenging ajami evans mccabe stisen 2014a in such a case model spin up is generally performed by running the model with a single year of precipitation forcing till equilibrium in modeling results is achieved herein for both the calibration and validation a 14 year spin up period was used to achieve the equilibrium in the simulated wte and also in the subsurface discharges with the same recharge input so that the differences between the simulated wte and also between the subsurface discharges during the nth and the n 1 th years were 1 e g ajami mccabe evans stisen 2014b 5 2 6 model performance evaluation measures the criteria of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 percentage bias pbias and root mean square error rmse were used for verifying the efficacy of the enhanced hsb model variants in simulating the corresponding observed hillslope saturated storage in terms of water table elevation for both the ungauged and gauged catchment setups to consider the performance of a model satisfactory the acceptable value of nse r2 and pbias are 50 0 5 and 25 respectively moriasi et al 2007 6 results and discussion 6 1 performance of the hsb model considering the study area as gauged regarding water table elevation fig 7 shows the hsb model predicted wte by different approaches during calibration at well w1 fig 7a and well w2 fig 7c respectively along with the corresponding box and whisker plots of wte fig 7b and d from the estimates of different performance evaluation measures of nse pbias r2 and rmse presented therein in general it is envisaged that the accuracy of the water tables simulated by the enhanced hsb model variants varies in the order drr wb wb sp wb sp bl the calibrated values of ks and f for different enhanced hsb variants are mentioned in table 2 it can be envisaged from fig 7 that forcing the model with the recharge as a function of p eta and tf only as in the case of the drr approach resulted in over estimation of the wte this may be attributed to the over estimation of recharge flux due to non consideration of the dynamism of interception evapotranspiration infiltration saturation and infiltration excess surface runoffs and vadose zone saturated and unsaturated flows as inquired by the first research question the drr based hsb approach might be useful in the preliminary stage of model development or testing the model at the hillslope scale during calibration the drr approach overpredicted the observed wte considerably throughout the year characterized by outliers in the box and whisker plot fig 7b hence the drr based hsb model is not practically applicable as such to the real ungauged catchment considered in this study as confirmed by the nse pbias r2 and rmse estimates of 407 22 0 60 and 1 38 m respectively for both the wells w1 and w2 during the calibration similarly the wb approach based enhanced hsb model underestimated the observed water table considerably during the calibration period resulting in poor nse pbias r2 and rmse estimates of 38 5 0 87 and 0 37 m for both the wells respectively this could be due to the non consideration of ponding in paddy fields that in turn underestimated the monsoon recharge note that the infiltration rate under ponded phase is higher than that under non ponded phase which is not accounted for by the wb approach this under estimation of recharge rate resulted in the underestimation of the water table although similar underestimation is noticed during model validation at well w1 the simulated water table overestimated the observed value at well w2 after cessation of monsoon rainfall during the validation period precipitation was temporally distributed almost evenly with lesser intensity hanging bars in fig 8 a which might have allowed the water to infiltrate leading to reduced number of days with surface saturation and ponding under such a situation the wb based model could have accounted for the recharge flux more accurately however during the calibration period precipitation occurred in spells hanging bars in fig 7a with single high precipitation events leading to surface saturation and ponding that cannot be accounted for by the wb approach hence underestimated the recharge the effect of recharge was reflected in the temporal behaviour of the water table as well w2 is surrounded by agricultural fields this effect is more prominent there resulting in an overestimation of the wte this further justifies the need for improvement in the wb approach based hsb model variant by incorporating the saturation process modeling the limitation in the wb approach based hsb model was addressed by incorporating the saturated phase processes in the wb sp approach that performed better than the wb approach during the calibration period fig 7 although there was still overestimation by the wb sp approach based hsb model furthermore during the validation period the negative nse estimates of 69 at both the w1 and w2 wells confirmed this overestimation fig 8a and c the overestimation of the simulated wte by the wb sp based hsb model variant could be due to the inherent assumption of impermeable bedrock undertaken in the development of the hsb model which restricts any exchange flux with the underlying confined aquifer however in reality the bedrock does not behave as an aquifuge and allows exchange flux between the unconfined and underlying confined aquifers although at much a smaller rate due to the lesser vertical hydraulic conductivity of the relatively compact bedrock note that a large amount of data illustrated as outliers in the whiskers of fig 8b and d also indicate the inefficacy of the wb sp based hsb model in reproducing the observed wte during validation the incorporation of bedrock leakage flux for recharge estimation in the wb sp bl approach based hsb model variant enhanced the model performance significantly as evident from the estimates of nse 70 pbias of 2 r2 0 74 and rmse 0 36 m during both the calibration and validation phases figs 7 and 8 hence it is surmised that incorporating the bedrock leakage flux into the underlying confined aquifer along with the fluxes estimated by the water balance approach and surface ponding wb sp bl approach from the paddy fields resulted in the best model efficiency which answers the first research question fully the wb sp bl based hsb model was also calibrated and validated at 15 daily scale at three well locations of w3 w4 and w5 figs 9 and 10 due to the heterogeneity of aquifer parameters and further validated at other two well locations of w1 and w6 using the observed 15 daily water table data fig 10 as seen in fig 10 this wb sp bl based hsb approach performed satisfactorily in reproducing the observed wte with the estimates of nse 69 and r2 0 70 for all the wells hence it is surmised that the revised hsb model framework makes it suitable for studying the subsurface dynamics in scantily gauged catchments at 15 daily time scale as in case of many real world scenarios the wte data is generally measured at larger time scales 6 2 performance of the hsb model considering the study area as ungauged regarding water table elevation considering the catchment as ungauged similar to the gauged case the simulated water table in well w1 was overestimated in the ungauged case by the drr approach fig 11 the wb wb sp and wb sp bl approach based hsb model variants also performed similarly as the gauged catchment case in this ungauged scenario the observed wte were best reproduced by the wb sp bl approach with nse 69 pbias 2 5 r2 0 75 and rmse 0 22 m fig 11a and c at both the wells w1 and w2 hence it is advocated that all the fluxes to the aquifer need to be accounted for while applying the hsb model to natural catchments furthermore this reveals that the hsb model performed satisfactorily for both the ungauged and gauged catchment conditions a comparative study between figs 8a gauged case and 11a ungauged case revealed that in reproducing the wte at well w1 the nse estimates by the drr approach based hsb model for gauged and ungauged cases were 1967 47 and 2210 29 unacceptable respectively whereas the corresponding estimates were 22 45 and 21 83 unacceptable 69 60 and 114 29 unacceptable and 70 84 and 67 70 acceptable for the wb based hsb wb sp based hsb and wb sp bl based hsb variants respectively similar results were obtained in case of well w2 where the performance of the gauged case was better than that of the ungauged case this could be due to the difference in model parameterization method which also confirms that the present approach could be instrumental for estimating the soil hydraulic parameters in the ungauged catchments 6 3 uncertainty in the prediction of both the gauged and ungauged approaches the quantile regression approach weerts winsemius verkade 2011 was used for assessing the uncertainties of the wb sp bl based hsb model using the calibrated and validated results for the gauged catchment scenario and only the validated results for the ungauged scenario fig 12 the results in fig 12 reveal that in most of the cases the simulated values are well within the range of 50 confidence interval ci the peak of the wte hydrograph at well w1 for the ungauged scenario was beyond 50 ci and within 90 ci this indicates that the uncertainty associated with the simulated values of wte is more in case of the ungauged catchment scenario than that in the gauged scenario 7 conclusions the key findings from this study are as follows 1 soil atmosphere interface and unsaturated zone processes are the integral parts of hillslope based aquifer dynamics study for partitioning rainfall into the runoff evapotranspiration soil moisture unsaturated zone storage and aquifer recharge flux ignoring or over simplifying any of these processes in the hsb model framework may invite substantial modeling uncertainty 2 bedrock leakage flux has to be accounted for in the hsb model framework while applying the model to a real world catchment since no bedrock ideally behaves as an aquifuge while performing the catchment scale groundwater study both in the unconfined and confined aquifers quantification of this flux is essential and it would provide insight into the shallow deep aquifer interaction mechanism 3 simulations considering all the water flux estimation approaches revealed that the wb sp bl based enhanced hsb model could predict the temporal variation of the subsurface water table in the experimental wells very well both at daily and 15 daily scales

matonse and kroll 2009 considered recharge input into the hsb model by subtracting evapotranspiration and interception losses from precipitation however neglecting infiltration dynamics this approach henceforth termed as the direct rainfall recharge drr approach ignores the hortonian runoff mechanism and overestimates the recharge that can invite substantial error in predicting low streamflows

model with the lumped sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma rainfall runoff model requiring a number of a priori parameters to incorporate the components of evapotranspiration land cover interflow baseflow overland flow and lateral flow due to the underlying complexity this approach may not be suitable for scantily gauged catchments the problem is further aggravated in case of the monsoon type tropical catchments in which the topsoil layer is subjected to precipitation irrigation and evapotranspiration the water percolated from the topsoil first passes through the transmission zone based on its soil moisture dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and finally reaches the water table as recharge this phenomenon is observed during the non monsoon dry period see fig 1 b conversely in many tropical monsoon type catchments paddy crop is the dominant land use during the monsoon season wherein to deal with the dry spells through adequate water storage the croplands are bounded with dikes earthen embankments of about 10 40 cm in height these local controls store precipitation and surface runoff resulting in ponding and surface saturation and form seasonal artificial wetlands chen liu 2002 note that infiltration during ponding condition is always higher than that during no ponding condition due to the additional head of ponded water chen liu huang 2002 he wang takase mouri razafindrabe 2009 jha sahoo panda 2017 when the percolation rate from the topsoil is higher than the hydraulic conductivity at any soil layer in the transmission zone the upper layer of this zone gets saturated due to the addition of water during this situation an unsaturated zone is sandwiched between two saturated zones fig 1c the lower one is the saturated boussinesq aquifer where the flow is lateral according to dupuit s assumption conversely in the top saturated zone flow is vertical due to gravity and soil suction is developed due to the negative soil matric potential ψ m of the underlying vadose zone the flow continues to be vertically downward as long as the negative soil matric potential is present with continuous addition of moisture or water the unsaturated moisture content θ changes to saturated moisture content θ s and with the further addition of moisture positive pressure ψ p builds up hence the above dynamics creates a saturated zone with a moving variable lower boundary above the transmission zone in this case the root zone water balance approach e g carrillo et al 2011 may not yield accurate results furthermore the bedrock leakage bl flux is a

simulation of pore water pressure distribution ebel loague montgomery dietrich 2008 and is essential for simulating the subsurface flow response at the hillslope or catchment scale meerveld weiler 2008 therefore the specific research gaps in the previous hsb based studies are identified as i non consideration of the fluxes to and from the aquifer ii assumption of impermeable bedrock iii lack of hsb parameterization method for its application in ungauged catchments and iv assumption of spatially uniform aquifer hydraulic properties these limitations constrain the applicability of the model in scantily gauged catchments and necessitate for the development of a generalized approach accounting for all the hydrologic fluxes to the hillslope aquifer in light of the above viewpoints this paper tries to answer the research questions 1 how including more hydrological processes to estimate recharge could improve the classical drr approach in the hsb based model and 2 how to parameterize a low dimensional model in an ungauged catchment to address these issues this study tries to advocate a novel recharge flux estimation method embedded in the hsb model framework by considering all the physical hydrological processes in the vadose zone overlying the water table as recharge varies with precipitation topography and land use and land cover lulc characteristic of the basin these dynamics are accounted for in the enhanced hsb model framework incorporating the water balance modeling of topsoil along with the inclusion of unsaturated zone processes during non monsoon dry period similarly during monsoon wet period recharge due to surface ponding sp in croplands with rainwater is estimated by considering the saturated phase modeling validating the low dimensional hsb based model in a data scarce catchment would open avenues for understanding the subsurface dynamics in ungauged catchments since in the hydrologic literature an emphasis has been given for prediction in

combining it with the continuity equation the modified form of the boussinesq equation accounting for 1 d flow domain is expressed as 1 h x t t k s f cos x h x t h x t x sin h x t x n t f where h

considered as the basic unit of study in which the entire soil column resting above the bedrock forms the hillslope unconfined aquifer fig 1a the aquifer can be assumed as a three layered system fig 1b and c in which the depth of the first layer was selected as 45 cm herein which is based on the average root zone depth of the dominant vegetation in the study area the second soil layer is the transmission vadose zone that extends up to the zone of saturation or unconfined aquifer water table representing the third layer these three layers from the top surface exchange the fluxes of infiltration and evapotranspiration surface and subsurface runoffs and bedrock leakage with the boundaries of atmosphere stream network and underlying confined aquifer respectively 3 2 hydrological process components since the existing hsb model variants do not explicitly account for all the hydrological process components as mentioned earlier this model was enhanced by i considering the surface and unsaturated zone water balances for recharge estimation during the non monsoon dry period ii accounting for the surface ponding and vadose zone processes during the monsoon wet period and iii revising the original assumption of impermeable bedrock by a leaky bedrock which is more realistic recharge to the hillslope unconfined aquifer water table depends on the unsaturated zone soil

studies the oversimplification of impermeable bedrock could add error in the hsb model solutions specifically when applied to a real world catchment the bedrock leakage flux can be estimated using

the bedrock slope l and ht and hb are the hydraulic heads l at the top and bottom of the bedrock respectively in this study ht and hb are the water table elevations obtained from the two piezometers drilled up to the top and bottom of the bedrock respectively 3 2 4 generalized versions of the enhanced hsb model for alternate wetting and drying phases and land uses during the non monsoon dry period the enhanced wb bl approach based hsb model considering the water balance and bedrock leakage flux can be expressed for any land use class other than agriculture as 27 f s x t t k s x cos α f x s x t w x s x t x s x t w x w x x k s x sin α s x t x fw x n wb x t n l t similarly for the agricultural land use where substantial ponding can be expected during the monsoon wet season the enhanced

exclusive in the sense that only one of these can be greater than zero the presence of these two terms in eq 28 makes the expression more generic for addressing the problem of alternate wetting and drying awd as there could be a period of non ponding phase in between two ponding phases 3 2 5 model discretization and boundary conditions eqs 18 27 and 28 were discretized by the finite difference scheme in space and a multistep ordinary differential equation ode45 solver in time with x 30 m and t 1 h with the output print time of t 1 day similarly although the depth of the transmission zone is varying the spatialization of the recharge sub models nwb eq 17 and nsp eq 24 was fixed as z 0 1 m and x 30 m along the vertical and lateral coordinates for solving the hsb model in a real hillslope the following boundary conditions were used i no flux boundary at the catchment divide x l qgw 0 ii dirichlet boundary condition at the downstream channel outlet x 0 h 0 and a recharge boundary nwb bl x t or nwb sp bl x t at the top surface depending on the hsb model variant to be used the recharge forcings were computed as separate functions in the matlab environment as detailed in fig 2 the assumptions of x 0 h 0 is unrealistic for estimating the baseflow in a hillslope where a seepage face is usually expected and this creates a problem for calculating discharge at the lower boundary using darcy s law however this assumption is used by several researchers e g beven 1981 matonse kroll 2009 to decouple it from the effect of a stream as incorporating the stream aquifer interaction is beyond the scope of the present study furthermore since a numerical technique was used to estimate the discharge ensuring mass balance the simulated flow rate could be marginally affected by such an assumption as studied by beven 1981 and matonse and kroll 2009 the steps illustrated in fig 2 were executed in the matlab environment as follows i the estimated aquifer hydraulic parameters ks kb f θs θr and the parameters of the brooks corey and richards equations were directly read from the look up table ii the meteorological and piezometer datasets were read at each simulation time step to estimate the actual evapotranspiration and capillary rise respectively iii the initial values of ponding depth if any were read iv based on the ponding or non ponding situation percolation through the transmission zone was estimated by transmission zone water balance using root zone percolation capillary rise and bedrock leakage processes v the hillslope saturated storage and discharge were estimated vi the ponding and the transmission zone depths were re estimated to repeat the steps iii v 4 study area and pedo hydrogeologic database the study area considered herein is the ungauged kanjhari reservoir catchment which is a tributary of the baitarani river in odisha state in eastern india having a monsoon type tropical climate this study area lies in between 21 33 21 41 n latitudes and 85 38 85 48 e longitudes with an area of 125 04 km2 the elevation map of the study area the locations of the experimental wells their well logs and the double ring infiltration tests are illustrated in fig 3 this area receives an average annual rainfall of about 1332 mm with an average 75 numbers of rainy days per year and a range of maximum daily rainfall intensity of 65 8 234 0 mm more than 80 of the annual rainfall is generally received during june to september from the south west monsoon depicting the wet period which is the primary forcing for groundwater recharge similarly the daily temperature varies in the range of 8 44 c during the winter and summer seasons the hard rock terrain of the kanjhari reservoir catchment is made up of typical geomorphic landforms of isolated residual hillocks inselbergs structural and denuded hills pediment and buried pediment valleys and linear ridges das behera kar narendra guha 1997 the subsurface soil of the catchment contains the secondary porosity that facilitates for the subsurface storage and groundwater movement in different weathered formations this catchment is geo hydraulically interconnected in which the near surface weathered zone forms the unconfined aquifers the source for flow of subsurface and groundwater in the deeper soil zones the predominant type of surface soil distributed in the study area can be sub grouped into coarse loamy fine loamy and loamy fig 4 the daily scale meteorological data of precipitation relative humidity and maximum and minimum temperatures for the study period at the nearest meteorology station located at 21 37 n latitude and 85 35 e longitude were collected from the meteorology centre india meteorological department bhubaneswar for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration the solar radiation and wind speed data available with the national aeronautics and space administration usa nasa 2015 were used similarly the daily soil moisture data of two grid cells covering the study area at a spatial scale of 0 25 0 25 was obtained from the satellite based reanalysis data products of smos bec 2012 2017 fig 5 illustrates the timeseries of daily rainfall soil moisture and estimated actual evapotranspiration that were used for the daily scale recharge estimation using the approach as shown in fig 2 the soil moisture contents in the root zone and the transmission zone were measured by installing the time domain refractometry tdr soil moisture probes up to three depths of 0 3 m 1 m 2 m and 3 m near all the well locations for calibration and validation of the hsb model against the water table height above the impermeable layer the daily scale water table data were collected from two experimental open wells w1 w2 along with the 15 daily data from other four observation wells w3 w6 note that the catchment was considered ungauged regarding baseflow measurement however at least limited timeseries data of groundwater table is available for model setup further the range of values of aquifer hydraulic properties viz saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were obtained from the pumping test results as published by dhiman 2012 the soil samples were collected from the well locations and grain size analysis was performed to determine the aquifer formation material from the dominant type of formation material the aquifer hydraulic properties were estimated following the chart by heath 1983 the lulc and soil type maps were obtained from the odisha space application centre orsac bhubaneswar to study the infiltration characteristics of the surface soil double ring infiltrometer test was carried out at four locations fig 3 in the catchment representing the different soil types fig 4 5 application of enhanced hsb model variants to a real world catchment 5 1 derivation of the hillslope width function hwf the hsb model operates on hillslopes as elements building the catchment in this study the entire catchment was considered as a single hillslope for applying the hsb model e g troch smith wood de troch 1994 the hillslope geomorphology as regards of the hwf was derived as the probability density of flow distances from the channel network bogaart troch 2006 hence to obtain the hwf the streamlines were first delineated from the available dem as illustrated in fig 2 e g sahoo sahoo 2018 the methodology of streamline delineation is illustrated in fig 2 for the computation of flow direction contributing area and land slope the dem pre processing was performed using the terrain analysis using digital elevation model taudem version 5 1 2 tarboton 2014 channel network extraction involves the determination of the threshold contributing area ac where the channel networks were identified as those pixels having the contributing area larger than ac in this study the value of ac was determined by trial and error until the extracted channel network for a given estimate of ac resembled the natural drainage network then the flow distance was estimated by the d8 pour point algorithm o callaghan mark 1984 and subsequently from the probability density function pdf of flow distance the hwf was estimated fig 6 a illustrates the flow distance of different locations in the catchment from the channel network the probability density of flow distances is illustrated in fig 6b in general the hillslope width gets decreased from the streamlines towards the catchment divide fig 6b representing the divergent planform of the study area 5 2 real catchment application considering it both as gauged and ungauged regarding of water table elevation wte 5 2 1 evaluation of model parameters the bedrock slope angle α of the catchment was determined from the well logs at different places along the transect from the catchment boundary to the channel the model parameters common to both the gauged and ungauged scenarios as evaluated for the study area are given in table 1 the subsequent sections describe the parameterization of aquifer hydraulic property for the gauged and ungauged scenarios 5 2 2 gauged and ungauged catchment description as defined by sivapalan et al 2003 an ungauged catchment is one where sufficient record of hydrological observation both regarding data quality and quantity is not available to aid in modeling the desired hydrological variable thus a catchment may be gauged at one period and ungauged at other periods the desired variable can be precipitation streamflow and sediment yield for surface water modeling and water table data and baseflow rate in case of groundwater modeling the developed enhanced versions of the hsb model were applied to the study area considering it both as gauged and ungauged catchments in the present study the catchment was considered as gauged for the period of modeling and ungauged otherwise because information on wte is available only during the periods of model calibration and validation in a more generalized way it was evaluated how would have the developed model performed had the study area been an ungauged one 5 2 3 gauged catchment case the direct rainfall recharge drr water balance wb water balance surface ponding wb sp and water balance surface ponding bedrock leakage wb sp bl based enhanced hsb model variants were calibrated at daily scale using the wte of wells w1 and w2 measured during the water year of 1st june 2012 to 31st may 2013 out of these four variants the best performing wb sp bl based model was calibrated at 15 daily scale using the wte of the wells w3 w4 and w5 note that as the period from 1st june to 31st may of the next year is considered as one water year in india the data periods for calibration and validation purposes were selected accordingly it was considered that the hillslope unconfined aquifer is made up of drainable pore space s f w h first to deal with equifinality problem the possible range of the soil class specific aquifer parameters ks and f were obtained using the well log information at each well location based on the works of heath 1983 and dhiman 2012 subsequently manual calibration was carried out by varying the ks and f values within the pre estimated range the spatial variation of the parameters was obtained using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique to estimate the unknown information on soil parameters at any location x y from the known information available at the surrounding locations the idw interpolation method assumes that the surrounding locations close enough to x y are more alike than the distant surrounding locations as lu wong 2008 29 k s x y i 1 n g k s i d i 2 i 1 n g 1 d i 2 30 f x y i 1 n g f i d i 2 i 1 n g 1 d i 2 where di euclidian distance of the centroid x y of the grid of interest from the centroid of the ith grid with the known parameters and ng number of grid points with the known information on soil parameters as the 1 d hsb model uses the grid averaged parameters ks x and f x in the x direction only the effective parameter values at a distance x from the stream network was estimated as the geometric mean of all the ks x y and f x y grid values located on the isoline at a flow distance x as 31a k s x 1 n x k s x y 1 n x 31b f x 1 n x f x y 1 n x where nx number of grid points at a flow distance x with the spatially varied values of ks x and f x the model simulations were performed until the hsb solutions were closer to the observed wte resulting in the maximum nse estimates subsequently with the spatially varied calibrated values of ks x and f x the model was validated against the daily scale wte observations at w1 and w2 and against 15 daily wte at w1 w6 locations 5 2 4 ungauged catchment case in case of ungauged case of groundwater modeling the available data is only well logs from which the hydraulic parameters can be estimated due to lack of observed water table data the modelers are left with two options i use the model parameter values from similar modeling studies on identical catchments by regionalization of parameters or ii use the values obtained from aquifer formations through geophysical investigation however the second case might be more logical in real world scenarios since the possibility of finding a gauged catchment nearby the ungauged catchment is very remote hence the aquifer hydraulic properties were used directly for modeling and assessing the model performance as the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is a function of grain size and grain distribution characteristics the well logs were analyzed to determine the principal aquifer forming material stratigraphic formation by sieving subsequently for the principal material of the stratigraphic layer viz coarse sand medium sand fine sand silt and clay the range of the ks and f were obtained from the literature heath 1983 and the representative material specific values for that soil layer was estimated using the geometric mean of the respective lower and upper limiting values as obtained from the literature the equivalent location specific ks and f values for the entire soil column were computed as 32a k s x y m 1 n s l k s m t h m m 1 n s l t h m 32b f x y m 1 n s l f m t h m m 1 n s l t h m where ks m equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material forming the m th layer lt 1 fm equivalent porosity of the aquifer material forming the m th layer lt 1 thm thickness of the m th soil layer l and nsl total number of soil layers 5 2 5 model spin up in most of the data scarce catchments where information on spatial distribution of groundwater elevation and soil moisture are unavailable specifying the initial conditions is challenging ajami evans mccabe stisen 2014a in such a case model spin up is generally performed by running the model with a single year of precipitation forcing till equilibrium in modeling results is achieved herein for both the calibration and validation a 14 year spin up period was used to achieve the equilibrium in the simulated wte and also in the subsurface discharges with the same recharge input so that the differences between the simulated wte and also between the subsurface discharges during the nth and the n 1 th years were 1 e g ajami mccabe evans stisen 2014b 5 2 6 model performance evaluation measures the criteria of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 percentage bias pbias and root mean square error rmse were used for verifying the efficacy of the enhanced hsb model variants in simulating the corresponding observed hillslope saturated storage in terms of water table elevation for both the ungauged and gauged catchment setups to consider the performance of a model satisfactory the acceptable value of nse r2 and pbias are 50 0 5 and 25 respectively moriasi et al 2007 6 results and discussion 6 1 performance of the hsb model considering the study area as gauged regarding water table elevation fig 7 shows the hsb model predicted wte by different approaches during calibration at well w1 fig 7a and well w2 fig 7c respectively along with the corresponding box and whisker plots of wte fig 7b and d from the estimates of different performance evaluation measures of nse pbias r2 and rmse presented therein in general it is envisaged that the accuracy of the water tables simulated by the enhanced hsb model variants varies in the order drr wb wb sp wb sp bl the calibrated values of ks and f for different enhanced hsb variants are mentioned in table 2 it can be envisaged from fig 7 that forcing the model with the recharge as a function of p eta and tf only as in the case of the drr approach resulted in over estimation of the wte this may be attributed to the over estimation of recharge flux due to non consideration of the dynamism of interception evapotranspiration infiltration saturation and infiltration excess surface runoffs and vadose zone saturated and unsaturated flows as inquired by the first research question the drr based hsb approach might be useful in the preliminary stage of model development or testing the model at the hillslope scale during calibration the drr approach overpredicted the observed wte considerably throughout the year characterized by outliers in the box and whisker plot fig 7b hence the drr based hsb model is not practically applicable as such to the real ungauged catchment considered in this study as confirmed by the nse pbias r2 and rmse estimates of 407 22 0 60 and 1 38 m respectively for both the wells w1 and w2 during the calibration similarly the wb approach based enhanced hsb model underestimated the observed water table considerably during the calibration period resulting in poor nse pbias r2 and rmse estimates of 38 5 0 87 and 0 37 m for both the wells respectively this could be due to the non consideration of ponding in paddy fields that in turn underestimated the monsoon recharge note that the infiltration rate under ponded phase is higher than that under non ponded phase which is not accounted for by the wb approach this under estimation of recharge rate resulted in the underestimation of the water table although similar underestimation is noticed during model validation at well w1 the simulated water table overestimated the observed value at well w2 after cessation of monsoon rainfall during the validation period precipitation was temporally distributed almost evenly with lesser intensity hanging bars in fig 8 a which might have allowed the water to infiltrate leading to reduced number of days with surface saturation and ponding under such a situation the wb based model could have accounted for the recharge flux more accurately however during the calibration period precipitation occurred in spells hanging bars in fig 7a with single high precipitation events leading to surface saturation and ponding that cannot be accounted for by the wb approach hence underestimated the recharge the effect of recharge was reflected in the temporal behaviour of the water table as well w2 is surrounded by agricultural fields this effect is more prominent there resulting in an overestimation of the wte this further justifies the need for improvement in the wb approach based hsb model variant by incorporating the saturation process modeling the limitation in the wb approach based hsb model was addressed by incorporating the saturated phase processes in the wb sp approach that performed better than the wb approach during the calibration period fig 7 although there was still overestimation by the wb sp approach based hsb model furthermore during the validation period the negative nse estimates of 69 at both the w1 and w2 wells confirmed this overestimation fig 8a and c the overestimation of the simulated wte by the wb sp based hsb model variant could be due to the inherent assumption of impermeable bedrock undertaken in the development of the hsb model which restricts any exchange flux with the underlying confined aquifer however in reality the bedrock does not behave as an aquifuge and allows exchange flux between the unconfined and underlying confined aquifers although at much a smaller rate due to the lesser vertical hydraulic conductivity of the relatively compact bedrock note that a large amount of data illustrated as outliers in the whiskers of fig 8b and d also indicate the inefficacy of the wb sp based hsb model in reproducing the observed wte during validation the incorporation of bedrock leakage flux for recharge estimation in the wb sp bl approach based hsb model variant enhanced the model performance significantly as evident from the estimates of nse 70 pbias of 2 r2 0 74 and rmse 0 36 m during both the calibration and validation phases figs 7 and 8 hence it is surmised that incorporating the bedrock leakage flux into the underlying confined aquifer along with the fluxes estimated by the water balance approach and surface ponding wb sp bl approach from the paddy fields resulted in the best model efficiency which answers the first research question fully the wb sp bl based hsb model was also calibrated and validated at 15 daily scale at three well locations of w3 w4 and w5 figs 9 and 10 due to the heterogeneity of aquifer parameters and further validated at other two well locations of w1 and w6 using the observed 15 daily water table data fig 10 as seen in fig 10 this wb sp bl based hsb approach performed satisfactorily in reproducing the observed wte with the estimates of nse 69 and r2 0 70 for all the wells hence it is surmised that the revised hsb model framework makes it suitable for studying the subsurface dynamics in scantily gauged catchments at 15 daily time scale as in case of many real world scenarios the wte data is generally measured at larger time scales 6 2 performance of the hsb model considering the study area as ungauged regarding water table elevation considering the catchment as ungauged similar to the gauged case the simulated water table in well w1 was overestimated in the ungauged case by the drr approach fig 11 the wb wb sp and wb sp bl approach based hsb model variants also performed similarly as the gauged catchment case in this ungauged scenario the observed wte were best reproduced by the wb sp bl approach with nse 69 pbias 2 5 r2 0 75 and rmse 0 22 m fig 11a and c at both the wells w1 and w2 hence it is advocated that all the fluxes to the aquifer need to be accounted for while applying the hsb model to natural catchments furthermore this reveals that the hsb model performed satisfactorily for both the ungauged and gauged catchment conditions a comparative study between figs 8a gauged case and 11a ungauged case revealed that in reproducing the wte at well w1 the nse estimates by the drr approach based hsb model for gauged and ungauged cases were 1967 47 and 2210 29 unacceptable respectively whereas the corresponding estimates were 22 45 and 21 83 unacceptable 69 60 and 114 29 unacceptable and 70 84 and 67 70 acceptable for the wb based hsb wb sp based hsb and wb sp bl based hsb variants respectively similar results were obtained in case of well w2 where the performance of the gauged case was better than that of the ungauged case this could be due to the difference in model parameterization method which also confirms that the present approach could be instrumental for estimating the soil hydraulic parameters in the ungauged catchments 6 3 uncertainty in the prediction of both the gauged and ungauged approaches the quantile regression approach weerts winsemius verkade 2011 was used for assessing the uncertainties of the wb sp bl based hsb model using the calibrated and validated results for the gauged catchment scenario and only the validated results for the ungauged scenario fig 12 the results in fig 12 reveal that in most of the cases the simulated values are well within the range of 50 confidence interval ci the peak of the wte hydrograph at well w1 for the ungauged scenario was beyond 50 ci and within 90 ci this indicates that the uncertainty associated with the simulated values of wte is more in case of the ungauged catchment scenario than that in the gauged scenario 7 conclusions the key findings from this study are as follows 1 soil atmosphere interface and unsaturated zone processes are the integral parts of hillslope based aquifer dynamics study for partitioning rainfall into the runoff evapotranspiration soil moisture unsaturated zone storage and aquifer recharge flux ignoring or over simplifying any of these processes in the hsb model framework may invite substantial modeling uncertainty 2 bedrock leakage flux has to be accounted for in the hsb model framework while applying the model to a real world catchment since no bedrock ideally behaves as an aquifuge while performing the catchment scale groundwater study both in the unconfined and confined aquifers quantification of this flux is essential and it would provide insight into the shallow deep aquifer interaction mechanism 3 simulations considering all the water flux estimation approaches revealed that the wb sp bl based enhanced hsb model could predict the temporal variation of the subsurface water table in the experimental wells very well both at daily and 15 daily scales
