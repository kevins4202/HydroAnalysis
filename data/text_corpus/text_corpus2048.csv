10240,soil water deficit is one of the important factors affecting the source sink balance of sweetpotato at mid season growth storage root initiation period however water regulation at mid season sweetpotato growth is often ignored in this study field trials were conducted to diagnose leaves in the middle of sweetpotato growth and then three mid season irrigation levels ck 0 m3 hm2 w1 150 m3 hm2 w2 300 m3 hm2 were established the effects of different irrigation levels on photosynthetic physiological indexes 13c transfer allocation and yield of sweetpotato were studied the results revealed that mid season irrigation significantly increased the relative moisture content of sweetpotato leaves maximum photochemical efficiency f v f m and net photosynthetic rate p n p 0 05 which effectively alleviated the effects of soil water deficit the p n values with irrigation treatments w1 and w2 were significantly higher than those with control ck treatment in all three study periods among these the w2 treatment had the highest p n at 70 d a n increase of 113 4 compared with ck in 2019 test and w1 had the highest p n at 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 the trend of stomatal conductance g s was basically consistent with p n the transpiration rate t r of w2 was the highest at 70 d an increase of 59 8 69 7 compared with ck but the t r of w1 was the highest at 110 d and 150 d the 13c total accumulation in the w1 treatment was the highest at 70 d 110 d and 150 d when it was 21 9 20 4 and 33 1 higher than that of the w2 treatment in 2019 test p 0 05 respectively the 13c allocation rate of storage roots treated with w1 was the highest in all periods reaching as high as 73 1 76 1 at 150 d p 0 05 at 70 d the 13c allocation rate of fiber roots and stems was highest in the ck treatment whereas the 13c allocation rate of leaves was highest in w2 p 0 05 at 110 d and 150 d the 13c allocation rate of stems and leaves in ck was the highest p 0 05 the biomass of w2 was the highest at 70 d but the root to shoot ratio and the dry weight of root became gradually lower than those of the ck and w1 treatments at the late season when they were reduced by 28 4 and 32 2 compared to w1 at 150 d in 2019 test p 0 05 the yield of w1 was increased significantly by 33 3 34 9 compared with ck p 0 05 but w2 only had an increased production of 14 5 20 7 p 0 05 compared to ck p 0 05 the irrigation water utilization efficiency of w2 was 59 4 61 8 and 39 1 43 5 lower than those of the ck and w1 treatments p 0 05 respectively together these results validate the field sweetpotato mid season water management model which is of great significance for guiding actual production of sweetpotato and increasing the potential of sweetpotato keywords 13c allocation mid season irrigation sweetpotato yield 1 introduction sweetpotato ipomoea batatas l is a food crop with strong stress resistance and is highly adaptable to the environment although it is relatively drought tolerant water remains the main limiting factor van heerden and laurie 2008 in most areas sweetpotato is widely cultivated as a rain fed crop so natural precipitation is an important source of water however the seasonal allocation of rainfall cannot fully meet water demand during the growth period so sweetpotato is susceptible to seasonal drought during their growth process mulovhedzi et al 2020 in the main sweetpotato production areas of china due to insufficient rainfall or an uneven allocation of rainfall the crop yield is stable but not very high kou et al 2013 the critical period of water for growth is the early season which is decisive for the establishment of the source sink relationship ku et al 2008 in recent years due to the mulching of plastic film and sufficient watering for planting water water supply for the sweetpotato rooting and branching period has been basically guaranteed however in agricultural production the importance of water regulation during the mid season of sweetpotato is often neglected water management is no longer carried out and there is a reliance on natural precipitation to maintain the growth rankine et al 2015 kwak 2019 in sweetpotato the source sink relationship develops during the mid season which is the period of the most water consumption li and kao 1990 the vine leaves grow rapidly and transpiration is vigorous when water supply in the root area is restricted or leaf transpiration exceeds the absorption of the root the plant has a water demand gap reddy et al 2004 all roots and tubers crops experienced greater yield reduction when drought strikes during the tuberization period compared to during their vegetative phase daryanto et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 found that drought stress during the storage root initiation period caused the net photosynthetic rate p n of sweetpotato to decrease significantly and the amount of assimilation products transferred to the storage roots to also decrease resulting in serious yield reduction kivuva et al 2015 found that drought stress caused the fresh storage root weight and total fresh biomass of sweetpotato to decrease by 59 3 and 72 1 respectively therefore drought in growth season of crops seriously affects growth development and yield formation if drought stress occurs in the mid season of crop timely irrigation at this time would further increase crop yield potential mid season irrigation after drought has been studied on crops such as corn li and sun 2016 wheat zeleke and nendel 2016 and peanuts lauriano et al 2004 but it has rarely been reported for sweetpotatoes only gajanayake and reddy 2016 conducted water management and modeling research on sweetpotato in the middle growth period so mid season irrigation of sweetpotato requires further study producers can combine natural rainfall conditions with agricultural technical measures to replenish soil moisture properly according to actual conditions and thus minimize the loss caused by water deficit ngigi et al 2005 producers can use drip irrigation facilities to achieve multiple irrigation which could effectively alleviate seasonal drought and also improve the utilization efficiency of water however the appropriate irrigation amount for sweetpotato at mid season remains unclear excessive irrigation causes sweetpotato overgrowth above ground which hinders the transportation of assimilation products from above ground to below ground resulting in an imbalance of the source sink relationship and reducing the yield and quality of the sweetpotato rao and li 2003 and siqinbatu et al 2013 thomson et al 1992 found that the optimal irrigation amount at the mid season and late season of sweetpotato is 72 of plant evapotranspiration et and that any irrigation above or below this level results in reduced production which has important guiding significance for the irrigation amount of sweetpotato at mid season irrigation previous studies on water regulation of sweetpotato were conducted mostly in rain proof facilities such as greenhouses however our study was a field experiment under natural conditions which is closer to the actual condition of agricultural production so our findings are of great significance in terms of correcting the moisture model and guiding production using drought diagnosis to guide mid season irrigation is an effective method to mitigate seasonal drought in crop production hu et al 2002 physiological indicators such as leaf relative water content maximum photochemical efficiency f v f m and net photosynthetic rate p n are significantly correlated with drought stress and can be used to diagnose whether sweetpotato is under drought at mid season li et al 2020 we aimed to develop guidelines for mid season irrigation of sweetpotato to prevent drought stress we used the 13c leaf labelling technique to quantitatively study the transfer and allocation of photosynthetic products the data were used to determine the optimal irrigation level and time during the mid season growth period of sweetpotato our work could inform irrigation protocols for sweetpotato during the mid season growth period 2 materials and methods 2 1 test materials and test sites the

of sweetpotato 65 d after transplanting so the drought diagnosis of sweetpotato was carried out at this time based on our previous research f v f m p n and leaf relative water content were used as the basis for diagnosing whether the sweetpotato was in drought li et al 2020b after confirming that the sweetpotato was under drought stress three water treatments were set up ck control no water

sweetpotato drought diagnosis and changes of diagnostic indicators after mid season irrigation the difference in soil moisture between treatments was significant at 48 h after irrigation and the diagnostic indicators of w1 and w2 were significantly higher than before irrigation in 2018 and 2019 the relative water content of w2 treatment increased by 12 5 and 18 0 respectively and the net photosynthetic rate increased by 72 4 and 76 7 respectively which indicates that mid season irrigation effectively alleviated the drought stress table 2 3 2 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on soil water content and leaf relative water content in different periods the soil water content of w1 and w2 was significantly higher than that of ck at 70 d and 110 d p 0 05 in 2018 the vwc values of w1 and w2 increased by 67 5 and 99 4 compared with ck at 70 d in 2019 the vwc values of w1 and w2 were increased significantly by 66 3 and 106 1 compared with ck at 70 d and were increased significantly by 23 2 and 46 5 compared with ck at 110 d respectively as the sweetpotato grew the vwc continued to decrease and the differences between the treatments also decreased at the same time no significant differences were observed between treatments at 150 d p 0 05 fig 2 at 70 d and 110 d the relative water content of w1 and w2 was significantly higher than that of ck p 0 05 in 2018 the leaf relative water content of w1 and w2 treatments increased by 10 1 and 11 5 compared with ck at 70 d and significantly increased by 10 4 and 11 6 at 110 d in 2019 the leaf relative water contents of w1 and w2 were increased by 11 9 and 14 9 compared with ck at 70 d and w1 and w2 were increased by 11 8 and 14 1 compared with ck at 110 d p 0 05 respectively however at 150 d the leaf water content had decreased and no significant differences were observed between treatments p 0 05 table 3 3 3 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on photosynthetic parameters in different periods the net photosynthetic rate p n values of irrigation treatments w1 and w2 were significantly higher than that in ck in 70 d and 110 d p 0 05 in 2019 the p n of w1 and w2 had increased by 88 9 and 113 4 compared with ck at 70 d the p n of w1 was the highest at 110 d and 150 d 62 8 and 21 3 higher than that of ck respectively the transpiration rate t r differed significantly between treatments at 70 d the t r of w2 was the highest increased by 59 8 compared with ck however at 110 d and 150 d the t r of w1 was the highest in 2018 and 2019 it increased by 69 7 and 59 8 respectively compared with ck the trend of sweetpotato stomatal conductance g s was basically consistent with p n at 70 d and 110 d the intercellular co2 concentration c i of ck was significantly higher p 0 05 fig 3 3 4 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on agronomic traits in different periods the leaf area index and vine length of w2 were the highest in each of the three periods indicating that treatment with more water could effectively promote the growth of sweetpotato shoot in 2019 the biomass of shoot and root of w2 were the highest at 70 d 12 5 and 35 0 higher than that of w1 p 0 05 respectively however no significant differences were observed in root to shoot ratio between the treatments at 70 d p 0 05 with growth of the sweetpotato the root to shoot ratio of each treatment increased continuously the root to shoot ratio and the root biomass of w2 were significantly lower than those of ck and w1 at 110 d and 150 d because the growth rate of w2 root was slower than that of its shoot in 2019 the root to shoot ratio and the root biomass of w2 were reduced by 28 4 and 32 2 compared with w1 at 150 d p 0 05 respectively table 4 3 5 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on the activities of ss and sps in leaf and adpgase in storage roots the activities of sucrose synthase ss and sucrose phosphate synthase sps were higher in w1 and w2 than in ck in all three periods p 0 05 the enzyme activity of w2 was highest and that of ck was lowest at 70 d and 110 d in 2019 the ss and sps activities in w2 were increased by 34 0 and 31 0 compared with ck at 70 d indicating that irrigation can significantly increase the activities of enzymes related to sucrose synthesis in sweetpotato leaves the activity of adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase adpgase in the storage roots of w1 was the highest in all the three periods and the activity in ck was the lowest in 2019 the adpgase of w1 was increased by 35 5 31 6 and 35 0 compared with ck at 70 d 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 respectively with growth of the sweetpotato the activity of enzymes related to starch synthesis increased gradually the storage roots developed and expanded continuously and the activity of enzymes in each treatment increased to the highest level at 150 d table 5 3 6 effects of mid season irrigation on 13c accumulation and allocation rate of each organ in sweetpotato the total 13c accumulation of w1 was the highest in each of the three periods in 2018 it was 17 5 15 9 and 20 1 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d respectively p 0 05 in 2019 it was 21 9 20 4 and 33 1 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d respectively p 0 05 with growth of the sweetpotato the storage root 13c accumulation continued to increase and the 13c accumulation in stems leaves and fiber roots continued to decrease the storage root 13c accumulation of w1 was the highest in each period in 2018 it was 72 0 21 3 and 30 5 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d respectively p 0 05 in 2019 it was 46 1 33 9 and 37 1 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 respectively the storage roots of w1 had the highest 13c allocation rate at 70 d the fiber roots and shoot of ck had the highest 13c allocation rate and the leaves of w2 had the highest 13c allocation rate p 0 05 with growth of the sweetpotato the 13c storage root allocation rate continued to increase while the 13c allocation rate of stems and leaves continued to decrease the storage root allocation rate of w1 was as high as 76 1 in 2018 and 73 1 in 2019 at 150 d p 0 05 the 13c allocation rate of ck stems and leaves was the highest at 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 table 6 in summary the 13c accumulation storage root allocation rate and root shoot accumulation ratio of w1 were the highest at the mid season and late season indicating that their carbon accumulation and carbon transport capacity were higher and that the source sink relationship was better however w2 had a high 13c allocation rate in leaves and stems but a lower 13c allocation rate in roots indicating that excessive irrigation hindered the transfer of assimilate from the upper part to the lower part of the plant which is not conducive to the expansion and development of storage roots 3 7 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on yield and irrigation utilization efficiency in 2018 w1 and w2 increased by 33 3 and 20 7 respectively compared with ck and in 2019 w1 and w2 increased by 34 9 and 14 5 respectively p 0 05 compared with ck w2 only increased yield by 14 5 p 0 05 this indicates that moderate irrigation can significantly increase the yield of sweetpotato at mid season but excessive irrigation can only increase the yield to a smaller extent in terms of yield composition the number of storage roots and the root weight per plant in w1 were significantly higher than those in ck and w2 indicating that water increased the root weight per plant by regulating the number of storage roots and finally achieved increased yield the mid season irrigation utilization efficiency of w2 was 38 7 and 79 3 lower than that of w1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively p 0 05 which severely wasted agricultural water compared with ck and w1 the total irrigation utilization efficiency of w2 was lower by 59 4 and 39 1 in 2018 and by 61 8 and 43 5 in 2019 respectively p 0 05 because ck did not include irrigation at mid season it depended only on natural precipitation to maintain its growth so its utilization efficiency was highest however the w1 treatment achieved high yield and efficiency through moderate irrigation at mid season making this technique worthy of widespread application in agricultural production table 7 3 8 correlation analysis between growth and physiological indexes of sweetpotato and 13c accumulation under mid season irrigation we investigated the correlations among various growth and physiological indexes biomass and 13c accumulation of sweetpotato and treatments under mid season irrigation conditions using redundancy analysis rda when the sweetpotato was transplanted for 70 d 110 d and 150 d root related indicators including storage root 13c accumulation and adpgase were significantly correlated with the w1 treatment indicating that w1 was highly correlated with root indexes however the w2 treatment was highly correlated with most of the shoot physiological indicators indicating that w1 is more conducive to the transfer and allocation of photosynthesis products to root fig 4 to clarify the contributions of various physiological indexes of sweetpotato to storage root 13c allocation under mid season irrigation in 2018 and 2019 sweetpotato transplanting for 70 d 110 d 150 d the leaf relative water content x 1 net photosynthetic rate p n x 2 transpiration rate t r x 3 leaf area index x 4 ss x 5 sps x 6 and adpgase x 7 were selected as independent variables storage root 13c accumulation was used as the dependent variable y for path analysis the results revealed that the direct effect of p n on 13c accumulation was the highest at 70 d and 110 d p 2 61 and p 1 35 while adpgase had the highest direct effect at 150 d p 0 86 table 8 4 discussion 4 1 diagnosis of drought in the mid season of sweetpotato and effects of mid season irrigation on soil and leaf moisture status indicators for diagnosing crop drought can be categorised as soil meteorological and plant indicators stress diagnosis is difficult because of the complexity and diversity of soil types and soil layer structure and the variety of weather conditions physiological indicators are most useful for determining whether plants are under drought stress among physiological parameters the quantum yield fv fm net photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs are all appropriate indicators haimeirong and kubota 2003 a previous study on the diagnosis of sweetpotato drought found that when the leaf relative water content is less than 71 9 f v f m is less than 0 79 or p n is less than 19 6 μmol m 2 s 1 sweetpotato is affected by drought and requires irrigation as soon as possible to alleviate the water deficit li et al 2020 at 48 h after irrigation 67 d the f v f m of w1 and w2 were 0 81 0 83 and the p n was 20 42 28 31 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively thus by using drought diagnosis to guide mid season irrigation all of the physiological indicators were outside of the drought range mid season irrigation effectively alleviated the soil water deficit measurements of stomatal conductance using a stomatal meter and leaf temperature using an infrared thermometer have been used in the past to diagnose crop drought but environmental factors influence the accuracy of these measurements further investigations are required to combine plant physiological indices and measurements made by soil moisture sensors for diagnosing sweetpotato drought such a combined approach would constitute a standardised practical tool for crop and irrigation management 4 2 effects of mid season irrigation on photosynthetic parameters and carbon metabolism enzymes of sweetpotato photosynthesis is an important process for synthesizing assimilation products but it is extremely sensitive to the water condition of plants the photosynthesis rate decreases significantly after a plant is subjected to drought stress pinheiro and chaves 2011 bunce 1982 previous studies have shown that the reduction of stomatal conductance g s under drought stress is the main reason for the reduction of intercellular co2 supply and thus the inhibition of plant photosynthetic capacity lawlor and cornic 2002 in the present study the change trend of g s was basically the same as that of p n suggesting that the change of photosynthesis of sweetpotato affected by drought stress is probably caused by stomatal factors plants had the highest transpiration rate t r at 70 d because of proximity to irrigation time and the t r of w1 was the highest value at 110 d and 150 d the reason for these results is that the sweetpotato increases its transpiration rate through stomatal adjustment and increases root water absorption through transpiration pull when the soil water content increases thereby alleviating drought stress pinheiro et al 2011 therefore mid season irrigation significantly improved the sweetpotato s photosynthetic capacity and transpiration pull which is of great significance for promoting the assimilation of photosynthetic products and increasing the water absorption capacity of roots gajanayake et al 2014 changes in carbon metabolic enzyme activity reflect the regulation of photosynthetic product accumulation and allocation by mid season irrigation the monosaccharides assimilated by photosynthesis are catalyzed by ss and sps in the leaves to form sucrose photosynthetic products are transported and accumulated in the plant in the form of sucrose and then synthesized into starch in the storage root under the action of adpgase pinheiro et al 2011 therefore when the activity of carbon metabolizing enzymes in the leaves is increased the rate of photosynthetic product synthesis is faster and when the enzyme activity in the roots is increased the rate of photosynthetic product transport is faster the results of this study revealed that the ss and sps activities with the irrigation treatments were significantly increased compared with that of the ck treatment in all three periods indicating that irrigation can significantly increase the activity of carbon metabolic enzymes in sweetpotato leaves and also increase the rate of sucrose synthesis carbon metabolizing enzymes can also regulate the turgor pressure gradient of the source sink organs in the plant by regulating the synthesis rates of sucrose and starch yatomi et al 1996 the storage root adpgase activity of w1 was the highest in all three periods indicating that appropriate irrigation is conducive to promoting the synthesis of starch in storage roots increasing the turgor pressure gradient of assimilation transport between leaves and storage roots accelerating the transport of assimilation products and promoting the expansion of storage roots 4 3 effects of mid season irrigation on the relationships among biomass 13c allocation and source sink of sweetpotato sweetpotato is a crop with a typical source sink relationship and harmonizing the source sink relationship guarantees high yield however drought stress hinders the growth of sweetpotato stems and leaves and the leaf area index decreases resulting in a reduction in source capacity makunde et al 2017 gomes et al 2005 found that the leaf area index of sweetpotato can increase with increase of soil water content thereby increasing the source capacity similarly we found that the leaf area index and maximum vine length of the irrigation treatments were significantly increased compared with those of the control treatment in each period and the leaf area index and maximum vine length of the higher water treatment were the highest this indicates that mid season irrigation can effectively promote aboveground growth and increase source capacity in the mid season and late season the aboveground photosynthetic products began to transfer to storage roots which became a new metabolic center wang et al 2018 the root to shoot ratio with each treatment increased continuously with growth of the sweetpotato and the root to shoot ratio of w1 was the highest and that of w2 was the lowest at 110 d and 150 d this result shows that excessive irrigation promotes stem and leaf growth and that nutrient transfer is not timely leading to an imbalance between source and sink moderate irrigation can increase the leaf area index of sweetpotato thus increasing source capacity and also promote the transportation of assimilation products to storage roots achieving the desired effect of increasing source and promoting flow previous studies have shown that efficient allocation of photosynthetic products to storage roots underlies high sweetpotato yields tekalign and hammes 2005 furthermore increasing the quantity of photosynthetic products transported to the roots improves storage root development ravi et al 2009 our results revealed that moderate irrigation in the medium term significantly increased the total accumulation of 13c in sweetpotato and also significantly increased the 13c allocation rate of storage roots in each period among the results the storage root 13c allocation rate of w1 was as high as 73 1 76 1 at 150 d indicating that moderate irrigation can improve the carbon accumulation and carbon transport capacity of sweetpotato which is conducive to improving the source sink relationship of sweetpotato the shoot 13c allocation rate under the excessive irrigation of the w2 treatment was significantly higher than that in w1 the shoot 13c allocation rate under w2 was 62 8 65 0 at 70 d but the storage root 13c allocation rate in each period was significantly lower than in the w1 treatment this result shows that excessive irrigation can only achieve increased source and cannot promote flow or expand sink which suppressed the expansion of sweetpotato storage roots in the middle and late stages earlier investigations showed that the translocation and distribution of photosynthetic products from leaves to root tubers are closely related to genotype characteristics and soil moisture status the responses of different sweetpotato varieties to soil water content vary excessive irrigation can significantly reduce the yields of stems and long vine leaves in drought tolerant varieties yooyongwech et al 2013 roro and tesfaye 2019 as seen in this study in water loving varieties excessive irrigation delayed the distribution of photosynthetic products to the root tubers with consequent reductions in yield liu et al 2015 4 4 effects of mid season irrigation on sweetpotato yield and irrigation utilization efficiency sweetpotato water requirements are affected by water supply conditions when the water supply is insufficient the sweetpotato has reduced yield due to drought stress and when the water supply exceeds the water demand this involves wasteful water consumption zhang et al 2018 our results revealed that the moderate irrigation treatment had the highest yield 41 73 43 52 t hm 2 which was a significant increase of 33 3 34 9 compared with ck however the yield of higher irrigation treatment was only 37 31 36 92 t hm 2 this indicates that moderate irrigation can significantly increase the yield of sweetpotato but higher irrigation cannot achieve an effective increase in yield our results agree with those of lewthwaite and triggs 2012 who reported that a soil moisture deficit during mid season affects canopy development thereby limiting photosynthetic activity which ultimately affects storage root development and yield a soil moisture surplus during the crop maturation period also negatively affects final yield and quality rao and li 2003 siqinbatu et al 2013 they reported that excessive irrigation led to rapid reductions in storage root yield as we showed in our study from the perspective of irrigation utilization efficiency the mid season irrigation utilization efficiency of w2 was 38 7 79 3 lower than that of w1 and the total irrigation utilization efficiency was 59 4 61 8 and 39 1 43 5 lower than those of ck and w1 respectively these results indicate that excessive irrigation in mid season cannot effectively increase production and involves wasteful consumption of agricultural water thomson 1992 reported a sweetpotato irrigation utilisation efficiency value that was similar to our estimate he observed a reduction in storage root growth and more wasteful water consumption under excessive irrigation moderate irrigation during mid season improves irrigation utilization efficiency while also achieving high yield and is worthy of widespread application in agricultural production in summary we believe this study to be the first research report on sweetpotato mid season irrigation we used drought diagnosis to guide mid season irrigation and used the 13c labeling technique on leaves to study the transfer and allocation of photosynthetic products quantitatively and our findings are of great significance for guiding irrigation during sweetpotato production however because our study completely simulated the natural growth of sweetpotato under film covered conditions in the field it did not eliminate the effects of natural precipitation at mid season and late season mid season irrigation can effectively alleviate drought stress but the differences between our treatments disappeared as growth and development of the sweetpotatoes proceeded and due to the effects of natural precipitation although mulching can reduce the impact of natural precipitation as the frequency of rain increased the differences between treatments gradually decreased and eventually disappeared however mid season irrigation improved soil water content and leaf water retention capacity for a protracted period of time and maintained the normal physiological activities and growth of sweetpotato gajanayake and reddy 2016 therefore when applying the research results to actual production local production conditions and natural climate including planting patterns information on other sweetpotato varieties and environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation must be considered mulovhedzi et al 2020 5 conclusion directing irrigation through drought diagnosis can effectively alleviate drought stress and restore the physiological functions of sweetpotato mid season irrigation significantly improved the leaf area index and leaf water retention capacity of sweetpotato and also enhanced photosynthetic capacity and transpiration rate moderate irrigation can effectively enhance the carbon accumulation and carbon transport capacity of sweetpotato which is conducive to improving the relationship between source and sink of sweetpotato and realizes the desired condition of increasing source and expanding sink thereby significantly increasing yield excessive irrigation can only achieve increased source it cannot achieve promotion of flow or expansion of sink it hinders the transfer of assimilation products which is not conducive to improving the source sink relationship of sweetpotatoes it lowers the irrigation utilization efficiency making it impossible to increase production effectively declaration of competing interest the

10240,soil water deficit is one of the important factors affecting the source sink balance of sweetpotato at mid season growth storage root initiation period however water regulation at mid season sweetpotato growth is often ignored in this study field trials were conducted to diagnose leaves in the middle of sweetpotato growth and then three mid season irrigation levels ck 0 m3 hm2 w1 150 m3 hm2 w2 300 m3 hm2 were established the effects of different irrigation levels on photosynthetic physiological indexes 13c transfer allocation and yield of sweetpotato were studied the results revealed that mid season irrigation significantly increased the relative moisture content of sweetpotato leaves maximum photochemical efficiency f v f m and net photosynthetic rate p n p 0 05 which effectively alleviated the effects of soil water deficit the p n values with irrigation treatments w1 and w2 were significantly higher than those with control ck treatment in all three study periods among these the w2 treatment had the highest p n at 70 d a n increase of 113 4 compared with ck in 2019 test and w1 had the highest p n at 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 the trend of stomatal conductance g s was basically consistent with p n the transpiration rate t r of w2 was the highest at 70 d an increase of 59 8 69 7 compared with ck but the t r of w1 was the highest at 110 d and 150 d the 13c total accumulation in the w1 treatment was the highest at 70 d 110 d and 150 d when it was 21 9 20 4 and 33 1 higher than that of the w2 treatment in 2019 test p 0 05 respectively the 13c allocation rate of storage roots treated with w1 was the highest in all periods reaching as high as 73 1 76 1 at 150 d p 0 05 at 70 d the 13c allocation rate of fiber roots and stems was highest in the ck treatment whereas the 13c allocation rate of leaves was highest in w2 p 0 05 at 110 d and 150 d the 13c allocation rate of stems and leaves in ck was the highest p 0 05 the biomass of w2 was the highest at 70 d but the root to shoot ratio and the dry weight of root became gradually lower than those of the ck and w1 treatments at the late season when they were reduced by 28 4 and 32 2 compared to w1 at 150 d in 2019 test p 0 05 the yield of w1 was increased significantly by 33 3 34 9 compared with ck p 0 05 but w2 only had an increased production of 14 5 20 7 p 0 05 compared to ck p 0 05 the irrigation water utilization efficiency of w2 was 59 4 61 8 and 39 1 43 5 lower than those of the ck and w1 treatments p 0 05 respectively together these results validate the field sweetpotato mid season water management model which is of great significance for guiding actual production of sweetpotato and increasing the potential of sweetpotato keywords 13c allocation mid season irrigation sweetpotato yield 1 introduction sweetpotato ipomoea batatas l is a food crop with strong stress resistance and is highly adaptable to the environment although it is relatively drought tolerant water remains the main limiting factor van heerden and laurie 2008 in most areas sweetpotato is widely cultivated as a rain fed crop so natural precipitation is an important source of water however the seasonal allocation of rainfall cannot fully meet water demand during the growth period so sweetpotato is susceptible to seasonal drought during their growth process mulovhedzi et al 2020 in the main sweetpotato production areas of china due to insufficient rainfall or an uneven allocation of rainfall the crop yield is stable but not very high kou et al 2013 the critical period of water for growth is the early season which is decisive for the establishment of the source sink relationship ku et al 2008 in recent years due to the mulching of plastic film and sufficient watering for planting water water supply for the sweetpotato rooting and branching period has been basically guaranteed however in agricultural production the importance of water regulation during the mid season of sweetpotato is often neglected water management is no longer carried out and there is a reliance on natural precipitation to maintain the growth rankine et al 2015 kwak 2019 in sweetpotato the source sink relationship develops during the mid season which is the period of the most water consumption li and kao 1990 the vine leaves grow rapidly and transpiration is vigorous when water supply in the root area is restricted or leaf transpiration exceeds the absorption of the root the plant has a water demand gap reddy et al 2004 all roots and tubers crops experienced greater yield reduction when drought strikes during the tuberization period compared to during their vegetative phase daryanto et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 found that drought stress during the storage root initiation period caused the net photosynthetic rate p n of sweetpotato to decrease significantly and the amount of assimilation products transferred to the storage roots to also decrease resulting in serious yield reduction kivuva et al 2015 found that drought stress caused the fresh storage root weight and total fresh biomass of sweetpotato to decrease by 59 3 and 72 1 respectively therefore drought in growth season of crops seriously affects growth development and yield formation if drought stress occurs in the mid season of crop timely irrigation at this time would further increase crop yield potential mid season irrigation after drought has been studied on crops such as corn li and sun 2016 wheat zeleke and nendel 2016 and peanuts lauriano et al 2004 but it has rarely been reported for sweetpotatoes only gajanayake and reddy 2016 conducted water management and modeling research on sweetpotato in the middle growth period so mid season irrigation of sweetpotato requires further study producers can combine natural rainfall conditions with agricultural technical measures to replenish soil moisture properly according to actual conditions and thus minimize the loss caused by water deficit ngigi et al 2005 producers can use drip irrigation facilities to achieve multiple irrigation which could effectively alleviate seasonal drought and also improve the utilization efficiency of water however the appropriate irrigation amount for sweetpotato at mid season remains unclear excessive irrigation causes sweetpotato overgrowth above ground which hinders the transportation of assimilation products from above ground to below ground resulting in an imbalance of the source sink relationship and reducing the yield and quality of the sweetpotato rao and li 2003 and siqinbatu et al 2013 thomson et al 1992 found that the optimal irrigation amount at the mid season and late season of sweetpotato is 72 of plant evapotranspiration et and that any irrigation above or below this level results in reduced production which has important guiding significance for the irrigation amount of sweetpotato at mid season irrigation previous studies on water regulation of sweetpotato were conducted mostly in rain proof facilities such as greenhouses however our study was a field experiment under natural conditions which is closer to the actual condition of agricultural production so our findings are of great significance in terms of correcting the moisture model and guiding production using drought diagnosis to guide mid season irrigation is an effective method to mitigate seasonal drought in crop production hu et al 2002 physiological indicators such as leaf relative water content maximum photochemical efficiency f v f m and net photosynthetic rate p n are significantly correlated with drought stress and can be used to diagnose whether sweetpotato is under drought at mid season li et al 2020 we aimed to develop guidelines for mid season irrigation of sweetpotato to prevent drought stress we used the 13c leaf labelling technique to quantitatively study the transfer and allocation of photosynthetic products the data were used to determine the optimal irrigation level and time during the mid season growth period of sweetpotato our work could inform irrigation protocols for sweetpotato during the mid season growth period 2 materials and methods 2 1 test materials and test sites the

irrigated according to the local conventional irrigation amount in the field watering 150 m3 hm2 by drip irrigation under film at the seedling stage and using unified management according to conventional field management measures we applied nitrogen fertiliser urea at a rate of 120 kg hm 2 during the growing season prior to planting we used broadcast application followed by incorporation to provide 75 kg hm 2 p as single superphosphate and 150 kg hm 2 k as k2so4 li et al 2020a during our study period there was no effective rainfall for nearly 20 days in the middle of the growth period of sweetpotato 65 d after transplanting so the drought diagnosis of sweetpotato was carried out at this time based on our previous research f v f m p n and leaf relative water content were used as the basis for diagnosing whether the sweetpotato was in drought li et al 2020b after confirming that the sweetpotato was under drought stress three water treatments were set up ck control no water replenishment w1 irrigation amount of 150 m3 hm2 an effective precipitation of approximately 15 mm and w2 irrigation amount of 300 m3 hm2 effective precipitation of approximately 30 mm after mid season irrigation the growth and physiological indexes of sweetpotato were measured at 70 d 110 d and 150 d after transplanting the experiment involved implementing the cultivation mode of ridge

labeling method of sweetpotato leaves and determination of 13c accumulation and allocation ratio 2 days after the mid season irrigation of sweetpotatoes 67 d 13co2 was generated by ba13co3 13c 99 and phosphoric acid in the reactor and collected by air bag at the beginning three plants with uniform growth were selected from each plot and 13co2 was marked on the fourth and fifth leaves of the longest stem the leaves to be marked were sealed with pvc transparent plastic film bags and then 30 ml of gas 128 with a concentration of about 5 of 13co2 was injected with a medical syringe the

sweetpotato drought diagnosis and changes of diagnostic indicators after mid season irrigation the difference in soil moisture between treatments was significant at 48 h after irrigation and the diagnostic indicators of w1 and w2 were significantly higher than before irrigation in 2018 and 2019 the relative water content of w2 treatment increased by 12 5 and 18 0 respectively and the net photosynthetic rate increased by 72 4 and 76 7 respectively which indicates that mid season irrigation effectively alleviated the drought stress table 2 3 2 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on soil water content and leaf relative water content in different periods the soil water content of w1 and w2 was significantly higher than that of ck at 70 d and 110 d p 0 05 in 2018 the vwc values of w1 and w2 increased by 67 5 and 99 4 compared with ck at 70 d in 2019 the vwc values of w1 and w2 were increased significantly by 66 3 and 106 1 compared with ck at 70 d and were increased significantly by 23 2 and 46 5 compared with ck at 110 d respectively as the sweetpotato grew the vwc continued to decrease and the differences between the treatments also decreased at the same time no significant differences were observed between treatments at 150 d p 0 05 fig 2 at 70 d and 110 d the relative water content of w1 and w2 was significantly higher than that of ck p 0 05 in 2018 the leaf relative water content of w1 and w2 treatments increased by 10 1 and 11 5 compared with ck at 70 d and significantly increased by 10 4 and 11 6 at 110 d in 2019 the leaf relative water contents of w1 and w2 were increased by 11 9 and 14 9 compared with ck at 70 d and w1 and w2 were increased by 11 8 and 14 1 compared with ck at 110 d p 0 05 respectively however at 150 d the leaf water content had decreased and no significant differences were observed between treatments p 0 05 table 3 3 3 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on photosynthetic parameters in different periods the net photosynthetic rate p n values of irrigation treatments w1 and w2 were significantly higher than that in ck in 70 d and 110 d p 0 05 in 2019 the p n of w1 and w2 had increased by 88 9 and 113 4 compared with ck at 70 d the p n of w1 was the highest at 110 d and 150 d 62 8 and 21 3 higher than that of ck respectively the transpiration rate t r differed significantly between treatments at 70 d the t r of w2 was the highest increased by 59 8 compared with ck however at 110 d and 150 d the t r of w1 was the highest in 2018 and 2019 it increased by 69 7 and 59 8 respectively compared with ck the trend of sweetpotato stomatal conductance g s was basically consistent with p n at 70 d and 110 d the intercellular co2 concentration c i of ck was significantly higher p 0 05 fig 3 3 4 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on agronomic traits in different periods the leaf area index and vine length of w2 were the highest in each of the three periods indicating that treatment with more water could effectively promote the growth of sweetpotato shoot in 2019 the biomass of shoot and root of w2 were the highest at 70 d 12 5 and 35 0 higher than that of w1 p 0 05 respectively however no significant differences were observed in root to shoot ratio between the treatments at 70 d p 0 05 with growth of the sweetpotato the root to shoot ratio of each treatment increased continuously the root to shoot ratio and the root biomass of w2 were significantly lower than those of ck and w1 at 110 d and 150 d because the growth rate of w2 root was slower than that of its shoot in 2019 the root to shoot ratio and the root biomass of w2 were reduced by 28 4 and 32 2 compared with w1 at 150 d p 0 05 respectively table 4 3 5 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on the activities of ss and sps in leaf and adpgase in storage roots the activities of sucrose synthase ss and sucrose phosphate synthase sps were higher in w1 and w2 than in ck in all three periods p 0 05 the enzyme activity of w2 was highest and that of ck was lowest at 70 d and 110 d in 2019 the ss and sps activities in w2 were increased by 34 0 and 31 0 compared with ck at 70 d indicating that irrigation can significantly increase the activities of enzymes related to sucrose synthesis in sweetpotato leaves the activity of adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase adpgase in the storage roots of w1 was the highest in all the three periods and the activity in ck was the lowest in 2019 the adpgase of w1 was increased by 35 5 31 6 and 35 0 compared with ck at 70 d 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 respectively with growth of the sweetpotato the activity of enzymes related to starch synthesis increased gradually the storage roots developed and expanded continuously and the activity of enzymes in each treatment increased to the highest level at 150 d table 5 3 6 effects of mid season irrigation on 13c accumulation and allocation rate of each organ in sweetpotato the total 13c accumulation of w1 was the highest in each of the three periods in 2018 it was 17 5 15 9 and 20 1 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d respectively p 0 05 in 2019 it was 21 9 20 4 and 33 1 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d respectively p 0 05 with growth of the sweetpotato the storage root 13c accumulation continued to increase and the 13c accumulation in stems leaves and fiber roots continued to decrease the storage root 13c accumulation of w1 was the highest in each period in 2018 it was 72 0 21 3 and 30 5 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d respectively p 0 05 in 2019 it was 46 1 33 9 and 37 1 higher than that of w2 at 70 d 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 respectively the storage roots of w1 had the highest 13c allocation rate at 70 d the fiber roots and shoot of ck had the highest 13c allocation rate and the leaves of w2 had the highest 13c allocation rate p 0 05 with growth of the sweetpotato the 13c storage root allocation rate continued to increase while the 13c allocation rate of stems and leaves continued to decrease the storage root allocation rate of w1 was as high as 76 1 in 2018 and 73 1 in 2019 at 150 d p 0 05 the 13c allocation rate of ck stems and leaves was the highest at 110 d and 150 d p 0 05 table 6 in summary the 13c accumulation storage root allocation rate and root shoot accumulation ratio of w1 were the highest at the mid season and late season indicating that their carbon accumulation and carbon transport capacity were higher and that the source sink relationship was better however w2 had a high 13c allocation rate in leaves and stems but a lower 13c allocation rate in roots indicating that excessive irrigation hindered the transfer of assimilate from the upper part to the lower part of the plant which is not conducive to the expansion and development of storage roots 3 7 effects of sweetpotato mid season irrigation on yield and irrigation utilization efficiency in 2018 w1 and w2 increased by 33 3 and 20 7 respectively compared with ck and in 2019 w1 and w2 increased by 34 9 and 14 5 respectively p 0 05 compared with ck w2 only increased yield by 14 5 p 0 05 this indicates that moderate irrigation can significantly increase the yield of sweetpotato at mid season but excessive irrigation can only increase the yield to a smaller extent in terms of yield composition the number of storage roots and the root weight per plant in w1 were significantly higher than those in ck and w2 indicating that water increased the root weight per plant by regulating the number of storage roots and finally achieved increased yield the mid season irrigation utilization efficiency of w2 was 38 7 and 79 3 lower than that of w1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively p 0 05 which severely wasted agricultural water compared with ck and w1 the total irrigation utilization efficiency of w2 was lower by 59 4 and 39 1 in 2018 and by 61 8 and 43 5 in 2019 respectively p 0 05 because ck did not include irrigation at mid season it depended only on natural precipitation to maintain its growth so its utilization efficiency was highest however the w1 treatment achieved high yield and efficiency through moderate irrigation at mid season making this technique worthy of widespread application in agricultural production table 7 3 8 correlation analysis between growth and physiological indexes of sweetpotato and 13c accumulation under mid season irrigation we investigated the correlations among various growth and physiological indexes biomass and 13c accumulation of sweetpotato and treatments under mid season irrigation conditions using redundancy analysis rda when the sweetpotato was transplanted for 70 d 110 d and 150 d root related indicators including storage root 13c accumulation and adpgase were significantly correlated with the w1 treatment indicating that w1 was highly correlated with root indexes however the w2 treatment was highly correlated with most of the shoot physiological indicators indicating that w1 is more conducive to the transfer and allocation of photosynthesis products to root fig 4 to clarify the contributions of various physiological indexes of sweetpotato to storage root 13c allocation under mid season irrigation in 2018 and 2019 sweetpotato transplanting for 70 d 110 d 150 d the leaf relative water content x 1 net photosynthetic rate p n x

analysis the results revealed that the direct effect of p n on 13c accumulation was the highest at 70 d and 110 d p 2 61 and p 1 35 while adpgase had the highest direct effect at 150 d p 0 86 table 8 4 discussion 4 1 diagnosis of drought in the mid season of sweetpotato and effects of mid season irrigation on soil and leaf moisture status indicators for diagnosing crop drought can be categorised as soil meteorological and plant indicators stress diagnosis is difficult because of the complexity and diversity of soil types and soil layer structure and the variety of weather conditions physiological indicators are most useful for determining whether plants are under drought stress among physiological parameters the quantum yield fv fm net photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs are all appropriate indicators haimeirong and kubota 2003 a previous study on the diagnosis of sweetpotato drought found that when the leaf relative water content is less than 71 9 f v f m is less than 0 79 or p n is less than 19 6 μmol m 2 s 1 sweetpotato is affected by drought and requires irrigation as soon as possible to alleviate the water deficit li et al 2020 at 48 h after irrigation 67 d the f v f m of w1 and w2 were 0 81 0 83 and the p n was 20 42 28 31 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively thus by using drought diagnosis to guide mid season irrigation all of the physiological indicators were outside of the drought range mid season irrigation effectively alleviated the soil water deficit measurements of stomatal conductance using a stomatal meter and leaf temperature using an infrared thermometer have been used in the past to diagnose crop drought but environmental factors influence the accuracy of these measurements further investigations are required to combine plant physiological indices and measurements made by soil moisture sensors for diagnosing sweetpotato drought such a combined approach would constitute a standardised practical tool for crop and irrigation management 4 2 effects of mid season irrigation on photosynthetic parameters and carbon metabolism enzymes of sweetpotato photosynthesis is an important process for synthesizing assimilation products but it is extremely sensitive to the water condition of plants the photosynthesis rate decreases significantly after a plant is subjected to drought stress pinheiro and chaves 2011 bunce 1982 previous studies have shown that the reduction of stomatal conductance g s under drought stress is the main reason for the reduction of intercellular co2 supply and thus the inhibition of plant photosynthetic capacity lawlor and cornic 2002 in the present study the change trend of g s was basically the same as that of p n suggesting that the change of photosynthesis of sweetpotato affected by drought stress is probably caused by stomatal factors plants had the highest transpiration rate t r at 70 d because of proximity to irrigation time and the t r of w1 was the highest value at 110 d and 150 d the reason for these results is that the sweetpotato increases its transpiration rate through stomatal adjustment and increases root water absorption through transpiration pull when the soil water content increases thereby alleviating drought stress pinheiro et al 2011 therefore mid season irrigation significantly improved the sweetpotato s photosynthetic capacity and transpiration pull which is of great significance for promoting the assimilation of photosynthetic products and increasing the water absorption capacity of roots gajanayake et al 2014 changes in carbon metabolic enzyme activity reflect the regulation of photosynthetic product accumulation and allocation by mid season irrigation the monosaccharides assimilated by photosynthesis are catalyzed by ss and sps in the leaves to form sucrose photosynthetic products are transported and accumulated in the plant in the form of sucrose and then synthesized into starch in the storage root under the action of adpgase pinheiro et al 2011 therefore when the activity of carbon metabolizing enzymes in the leaves is increased the rate of photosynthetic product synthesis is faster and when the enzyme activity in the roots is increased the rate of photosynthetic product transport is faster the results of this study revealed that the ss and sps activities with the irrigation treatments were significantly increased compared with that of the ck treatment in all three periods indicating that irrigation can significantly increase the activity of carbon metabolic enzymes in sweetpotato leaves and also increase the rate of sucrose synthesis carbon metabolizing enzymes can also regulate the turgor pressure gradient of the source sink organs in the plant by regulating the synthesis rates of sucrose and starch yatomi et al 1996 the storage root adpgase activity of w1 was the highest in all three periods indicating that appropriate irrigation is conducive to promoting the synthesis of starch in storage roots increasing the turgor pressure gradient of assimilation transport between leaves and storage roots accelerating the transport of assimilation products and promoting the expansion of storage roots 4 3 effects of mid season irrigation on the relationships among biomass 13c allocation and source sink of sweetpotato sweetpotato is a crop with a typical source sink relationship and harmonizing the source sink relationship guarantees high yield however drought stress hinders the growth of sweetpotato stems and leaves and the leaf area index decreases resulting in a reduction in source capacity makunde et al 2017 gomes et al 2005 found that the leaf area index of sweetpotato can increase with increase of soil water content thereby increasing the source capacity similarly we found that the leaf area index and maximum vine length of the irrigation treatments were significantly increased compared with those of the control treatment in each period and the leaf area index and maximum vine length of the higher water treatment were the highest this indicates that mid season irrigation can effectively promote aboveground growth and increase source capacity in the mid season and late season the aboveground photosynthetic products began to transfer to storage roots which became a new metabolic center wang et al 2018 the root to shoot ratio with each treatment increased continuously with growth of the sweetpotato and the root to shoot ratio of w1 was the highest and that of w2 was the lowest at 110 d and 150 d this result shows that excessive irrigation promotes stem and leaf growth and that nutrient transfer is not timely leading to an imbalance between source and sink moderate irrigation can increase the leaf area index of sweetpotato thus increasing source capacity and also promote the transportation of assimilation products to storage roots achieving the desired effect of increasing source and promoting flow previous studies have shown that efficient allocation of photosynthetic products to storage roots underlies high sweetpotato yields tekalign and hammes 2005 furthermore increasing the quantity of photosynthetic products transported to the roots improves storage root development ravi et al 2009 our results revealed that moderate irrigation in the medium term significantly increased the total accumulation of 13c in sweetpotato and also significantly increased the 13c allocation rate of storage roots in each period among the results the storage root 13c allocation rate of w1 was as high as 73 1 76 1 at 150 d indicating that moderate irrigation can improve the carbon accumulation and carbon transport capacity of sweetpotato which is conducive to improving the source sink relationship of sweetpotato the shoot 13c allocation rate under the excessive irrigation of the w2 treatment was significantly higher than that in w1 the shoot 13c allocation rate under w2 was 62 8 65 0 at 70 d but the storage root 13c allocation rate in each period was significantly lower than in the w1 treatment this result shows that excessive irrigation can only achieve increased source and cannot promote flow or expand sink which suppressed the expansion of sweetpotato storage roots in the middle and late stages earlier investigations showed that the translocation and distribution of photosynthetic products from leaves to root tubers are closely related to genotype characteristics and soil moisture status the responses of different sweetpotato varieties to soil water content vary excessive irrigation can significantly reduce the yields of stems and long vine leaves in drought tolerant varieties yooyongwech et al 2013 roro and tesfaye 2019 as seen in this study in water loving varieties excessive irrigation delayed the distribution of photosynthetic products to the root tubers with consequent reductions in yield liu et al 2015 4 4 effects of mid season irrigation on sweetpotato yield and irrigation utilization efficiency sweetpotato water requirements are affected by water supply conditions when the water supply is insufficient the sweetpotato has reduced yield due to drought stress and when the water supply exceeds the water demand this involves wasteful water consumption zhang et al 2018 our results revealed that the moderate irrigation treatment had the highest yield 41 73 43 52 t hm 2 which was a significant increase of 33 3 34 9 compared with ck however the yield of higher irrigation treatment was only 37 31 36 92 t hm 2 this indicates that moderate irrigation can significantly increase the yield of sweetpotato but higher irrigation cannot achieve an effective increase in yield our results agree with those of lewthwaite and triggs 2012 who reported that a soil moisture deficit during mid season affects canopy development thereby limiting photosynthetic activity which ultimately affects storage root development and yield a soil moisture surplus during the crop maturation period also negatively affects final yield and quality rao and li 2003 siqinbatu et al 2013 they reported that excessive irrigation led to rapid reductions in storage root yield as we showed in our study from the perspective of irrigation utilization efficiency the mid season irrigation utilization efficiency of w2 was 38 7 79 3 lower than that of w1 and the total irrigation utilization efficiency was 59 4 61 8 and 39 1 43 5 lower than those of ck and w1 respectively these results indicate that excessive irrigation in mid season cannot effectively increase production and involves wasteful consumption of agricultural water thomson 1992 reported a sweetpotato irrigation utilisation efficiency value that was similar to our estimate he observed a reduction in storage root growth and more wasteful water consumption under excessive irrigation moderate irrigation during mid season improves irrigation utilization efficiency while also achieving high yield and is worthy of widespread application in agricultural production in summary we believe this study to be the first research report on sweetpotato mid season irrigation we used drought diagnosis to guide mid season irrigation and used the 13c labeling technique on leaves to study the transfer and allocation of photosynthetic products quantitatively and our findings are of great significance for guiding irrigation during sweetpotato production however because our study completely simulated the natural growth of sweetpotato under film covered conditions in the field it did not eliminate the effects of natural precipitation at mid season and late season mid season irrigation can effectively alleviate drought stress but the differences between our treatments disappeared as growth and development of the sweetpotatoes proceeded and due to the effects of natural precipitation although mulching can reduce the impact of natural precipitation as the frequency of rain increased the differences between treatments gradually decreased and eventually disappeared however mid season irrigation improved soil water content and leaf water retention capacity for a protracted period of time and maintained the normal physiological activities and growth of sweetpotato gajanayake and reddy 2016 therefore when applying the research results to actual production local production conditions and natural climate including planting patterns information on other sweetpotato varieties and environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation must be considered mulovhedzi et al 2020 5 conclusion directing irrigation through drought diagnosis can effectively alleviate drought stress and restore the physiological functions of sweetpotato mid season irrigation significantly improved the leaf area index and leaf water retention capacity of sweetpotato and also enhanced photosynthetic capacity and transpiration rate moderate irrigation can effectively enhance the carbon accumulation and carbon transport capacity of sweetpotato which is conducive to improving the relationship between source and sink of sweetpotato and realizes the desired condition of increasing source and expanding sink thereby significantly increasing yield excessive irrigation can only achieve increased source it cannot achieve promotion of flow or expansion of sink it hinders the transfer of assimilation products which is not conducive to improving the source sink relationship of sweetpotatoes it lowers the irrigation utilization efficiency making it impossible to increase production effectively declaration of competing interest the

10241,coal mine spoils are typically drought prone and deficient in essential nutrients thus creating conditions which significantly limit plant growth and development here we searched for suitable combinations of key resources water w and fertilizers nitrogen n and phosphorus p to improve physiological and biochemical adaptations of caragana korshinskii to coal mined spoils we observed that under low w and n p resource availability c korshinskii displayed poor growth performance in coal degraded spoils negative growth of c korshinskii was associated with reduced photosynthetic rate decreased water status and increased contents of reactive oxygen species ros and malondialdehyde low resource availability to c korshinskii resulted in enhanced levels of compatible solutes including proline and soluble sugars that contributed to osmotic adjustment and also increased activities of superoxide dismutase peroxidase catalase and ascorbate peroxidase which ultimately conferred enhanced oxidative stress protection moderate to high w and n p doses greatly enhanced c korshinskii performance in coal spoils by improving photosynthesis traits water status and growth related attributes increasing supply of w and n p also helped c korshinskii to reduce oxidative stress as evidenced by low accumulation of ros and malondialdehyde and lower induction of antioxidant enzyme activities the addition of n and p also improved drought resistance of c korshinskii overall we found that optimum growth of c korshinskii in coal mined spoils was achieved under w additions corresponding to 68 of field capacity 1 85 mmd1 n and p at 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively these findings suggest that under appropriate w n and p doses c korshinskii has greater potential to grow and persist in coal mined spoils and could thus be used for revegetation interventions in drought prone areas in north western china and perhaps across other coal degraded areas worldwide graphical abstract ga1 keywords

environmental problems in the world feng et al 2019 the rate of surface mining for mineral resources is increasing day by day because of rapid urbanization and technological advancements and largely contributes to disturbance of ecological integrity to fulfill the increasing demand of numerous industrial sectors mining activities are currently practiced at different extents all over the world which is one of the vital reasons of accelerated degradation of ecological system li 2018 zhang et al 2019 coal remains among the most important surface mined minerals worldwide and is a fundamental source of fossil fuels across many countries including china zhang et al 2018a increasing demand of coal extraction has led to adverse impacts on the natural environment especially in north western china li et al 2020 which is already described as an ecologically fragile zone where plant species often face water and nutrient deficiencies during their entire life period lv et al 2019 coal extraction is often associated with landscape degradation vegetation destruction and ecosystem obliteration zhang et al 2019 artiﬁcial revegetation has been recognized as an effective and useful management strategy to improve ecological restoration of degraded areas mukhopadhyay et al 2017 however revegetation interventions rely on the appropriate use of suitable plant species to enhance the long term sustainability of coal mine degraded arid environments of northwestern china ma et al 2018 in arid and semi arid regions some plants species such as melilotus officinalis astragalus adsurgens althaea rosea caragana korshinskii ammopiptanthus mongolicus amorpha fruticosa tamarix chinensis ulmus pumila elaeagnus angustifolia etc are generally more dominant because of their greater adaptability under water shortage and nutrient poor conditions they have the capability to adjust numerous morpho physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in photosynthesis regulation osmotic adjustments and oxidative stress protection to cope with water scarcity and nutrients unavailability toscano et al 2016 among them c korshinskii has been recognized as an important species to survive under water scarcity conditions dulamsuren et al 2009 c korshinskii is a predominant leguminous shrub found in semi arid and arid areas of northwest china and play a vital role in vegetation restoration and ecological rehabilitation programs zeng et al 2017 c korshinskii is also known for its contribution to conserve soil and water resources the production of fuel and fodder ma et al 2008 and its ecological and economic benefits to local communities ma et al 2016 the initial establishment of plant species requires availability of key resources such as water w and nutrients ahirwal et al 2017 for example availability of nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers can increase seedling establishment by minimizing the adverse effects of drought in arid regions villar salvador et al 2013 however optimum levels of w n and p for seedling establishment and growth of c korshinskii are currently unknown and more research is needed to assess how suitable w and n p combinations could enhance plant growth on coal mined spoils response surface methodology rsm has been recognized as an effective method to evaluate the optimization of w and n p resources by plants under adverse environmental conditions bezerra et al 2008 several researchers previously employed rsm to investigate the coupling effects of w and n p resources on growth performance of numerous plants species such as brussica napus oryza sativa and elaeagnus angustifolia koocheki et al 2014 liu et al 2019 roy et al 2020b however no such studies have been conducted to optimize levels of w and n p resources for adaptation of c korshinskii to arid and semi arid conditions in coal mining areas moreover c korshinskii response to changes in the availability of w and n p resources has rarely been investigated at the physiological and biochemical levels thus the current study aimed at investigating optimum growth responses of c korshinskii under different regimes of w and n p applications we optimized doses of w and n p fertilizers using central composite rotatable rsm and investigated resource availability effects on morphological physiological and biochemical responses of c korshinskii grown in coal contaminated soils 2 materials and methods the study was conducted in an artificial plastic shed at the northwest a f university china to estimate the growth of c korshinskii on coal mine spoils under various regime of w and n p doses mine spoils were collected from yangchangwan lingwu china and sampled following a specific protocol see details roy et al 2020b physical and chemical parameters of

avoid nocturnal plant water loss and low vpd values eamus et al 1999 several findings suggested that plant species are able to recover leaf water status during the night even in the dry season and

production lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities the o2 h2o2 and mda contents drastically reduced with the supplement of high w and n doses in comparison with control fig 3a c plants treated with w72n96p144 w72n96p36 w72n24p144 w72n24p36 w80n60p90 and w60n120p90 presented a notable decreased in the contents of o2 by 65 1 62 8 29 1 31 4 66 3 and 54 7 h2o2 by 61 5 60 7 57 9 59 9 61

decreased o2 h2o2 and mda contents by 16 3 11 1 and 8 4 respectively compared with control plants fig 3a c activities of sod pod cat and apx radically declined over control when the plants were exposed to moderate high and highest w regimes regardless of n p fertilizers fig 3d g however plants treated with w40n60p90 and w48n96p144 caused positive but non significant increases in sod activity by 5 35 and 1 85 pod activity by 0 93 and 2 96 and apx activity by 4 69 and 9 58 respectively compared with control fig 3d e and g cat activity across the various treatments significantly decreased by 6 67 31 98 compared with control fig 3f 3 5 growth assessment of c korshinskii in responses to mutual application of w and n p doses by heatmap and pca methods heatmap analysis fig 4a demonstrated that c korshinskii exposed to control w40n60p90 w48n96p36 w48n96p144 w48n24p36 w48n24p144 and w60n0p90 treatments assembled on the left due to their higher contents of osmolytes pro and ss ros h2o2 and o2 and mda and increased activities of sod pod cat and apx this indicated that scarcity of w and n considerably boosted production of ros and membrane damage and c korshinskii enhanced the production of osmolytes and increased antioxidant enzymes activities to overcome the adverse effects in contrast treatments containing w regime w48 regardless of n p such as w60n60p0 w72n24p36 w60n60p180 w80n60p90 w72n96p144 w72n96p36 w60n120p90 and w72n24p144 grouped on the right due to their high levels of morphological growth parameters like ph sd dw rl gas exchange parameters pn tr gs and wue and chls and cars contents fig 4a however c korshinskii exposed to w60n60p90 clustered in the middle fig 4a in our study the first two principal components explained 64 94 pc1 51 64 and pc2 13 30 of total variation fig 4b similar to heatmap analysis pca results also showed that treatments with w regime w48 such as w72n96p144 t1 w60n120p90 t11 w60n60p180 t13 w72n24p36 t4 w60n60p0 t14 w72n96p36 t2 w72n24p144 t3 and w80n60p90 t9 were located in the positive direction of pc1 were positively associated with growth associated parameters photosynthetic traits and pigment contents fig 4b in addition treatments with w regime w48 like ck t21 w40n60p90 t10 w48n96p36 t6 w48n96p144 t5 w48n24p36 t8 and w48n24p144 t7 were located in the opposite direction of pc1 showed high accumulation of osmolytes ros and mda and increased activities of antioxidant enzymes fig 4b on the contrary the distribution on pc2 was related to the effective use of n where w60n120p90 t11 w72n96p144 t1 and w48n96p144 t5 were isolated on the positive direction of pc2 whereas w60n0p90 t12 w48n24p144 t7 and w48n24p36 t8 were located on the negative side of pc2 on the lower left quadrant of the pca score plot fig 4b 3 6 interactive effects of w n and p on igp of c korshinskii c korshinskii plants exposed to w72n96p144 exhibited highest igp of 0 71 table s4 3 d response surface plot was created by considering interaction of 2 factors by keeping 3rd factor at moderate or central level with igp of c korshinskii and presented in fig 5a c fig 5a and b showed that at very low to moderate w regime the addition of n and p had no clear positive effects on the growth performance of c korshinskii however at highest w supply igp of c korshinskii markedly improved with the increase of n p levels fig 5a and b anova further confirmed that the mutual interaction between w n and w p determined a significant synergistic effect p 0 001 on the igp of c korshinskii table s5 the interaction of n p suggested that when w addition was equal to 60 fc igp of c korshinskii remarkably decreased with moderate n 60 0 mg kg1 and p 90 0 mg kg1 doses but slightly increased with highest n p levels anova results showed that the interactive effects of n p had a significant synergistic effect p 0 05 on the igp of c korshinskii table s5 overall the extent of w n and p effects on growth performance of c korshinskii followed w n p trend 3 7 fitting the rsm and identification of optimum w n and p combination anova results showed that the quadratic model was the best for the analysis of numerous growth parameters among several models all probability values p values and lack of fit f values revealed that the suggested models were statistically acceptable table s6 to find the optimum w and n p application rates we maintained growth associated parameters gas exchange traits photosynthetic pigments leaf water contents and antioxidant enzyme activities at their maximum levels alternatively mda pro h2o2 and o2 contents were kept at their minimum levels fig 5d based on the above conditions twenty nine 29 solutions were produced by the software and among them solution no 1 with maximum desirability of 0 546 was selected fig 5d finally we found that the combination of w 68 fc n and p doses 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively was associated with the optimum growth performance of c korshinskii fig 5d it was found that under 68 fc water consumption of c korshinskii was 1 85 mmd1 4 discussion the ecological rehabilitation of coal mining areas using appropriate vegetation restoration techniques is fundamental for the sustainable management of degraded lands because of poor nutrients availability and the adverse effects of a combination of environmental stresses the choice of appropriate plant species and nutrient and water amendments is particularly important for the effective restoration of coal degraded areas plants that are capable to rapidly grow in the presence of scarce resources and the ability to resist to key environmental constraints could represent a suitable investment for restoration interventions in our study we found that growth associated attributes like ph sd rl and dw of c korshinskii significantly increased when w levels increased from 40 fc to 80 fc regardless of changes in n p dose applications table 1 however application of high n p doses n96p144 in both high w72 and low w48 w regimes showed their potential effects to increase ph and dw under w shortage condition 48 fc most plant growth parameters significantly declined and the supplement of low or moderate n p doses had minimal positive effects table 1 the decline of growth parameters with decreasing water content is the result of reduced nutrient uptake because of water scarcity it is plausible that shortage of soil water levels reduced the absorption of w as well as nutrients by plant roots resulting in nutritional imbalances ultimately responsible for the reduction of plant growth development and survival devnarain et al 2016 tardieu 2013 c korshinskii plants growing under inadequate w and nutrient supply showed adaptive mechanism to overcome multiple stresses and reduced their biomass to maintain their life span gao et al 2006 on the other hand at high w regime 72 fc application of n p fertilizers substantially enhanced all plant growth associated parameters similar results have been reported in previous studies suggesting that water shortage negatively affects growth associated parameters whereas the application of n p fertilizers under high w regime significantly improve growth performance of different plants species andivia et al 2011 maswada et al 2020 roy et al 2020a furthermore the large r s ratio observed under low w regime indicates that c korshinskii produced larger root systems to increase absorptive root surfaces and uptake more effectively water and nutrients that are less available in coal spoils howard skinner and comas 2010 the photosynthetic performance of plants is invariably associated with the levels of photosynthetic pigments under diverse environmental conditions li et al 2017 we found that combinations containing both high w and n doses such as w72n96p144 and w72n96p36 dramatically enhanced pn gs tr and cars levels however treatments such as w40n60p90 w48n96p144 and w60n60p90 considerably reduced above mentioned traits fig 1a h as also observed in previous studies liu et al 2013 roy et al 2020b because plants develop adaptive responses against water shortage conditions mainly by closing leaf stomata to reduce water loss this adaptive mechanism ultimately contributes to the reduction of pn and gs anjum et al 2011 munjonji et al 2017 as also observed in this study another possible reason for declined levels of gas exchange parameters at low w regime could be the reduced synthesis of photosynthetic pigments under water shortage conditions which resulted in a significant decline in biomass production of our plant species khorasaninejad et al 2018 as shown by anova outputs table s5 heatmap and pca analyses fig 4a and b several studies reported that the application of nutrients can scarcely offset the negative impacts of water stress due to abnormal temperature increases and the frequency of severe drought events under field conditions lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 however increased wue at w48n96p144 suggests that c korshinskii seedlings increase their wue via increasing water uptake and decreasing water losses by reducing tr at low w regime supplied with high n p doses musembi et al 2015 rwc is considered the most important index to evaluate overall water status because greatly influences the regulation of stomatal conductance as well as pn of plants teulat et al 2003 rwc is also linked to membrane stability as damage of plasma membranes under stress conditions may lead to loss of cellular water exposing plants to cellular dehydration pérez pérez et al 2009 in our study high doses of w n p w72n96p144 were associated with maximum increases in rwc and msi and maximum decreases in pro and ss contents however application of n p fertilizers also showed their potential to increase rwc and msi and decrease pro and ss contents under low w 48 fc regime fig 2a d it is possible that application of n p fertilizers under low w content improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil which then contributed to increase water absorption by plant roots thus benefitting the maintenance of rwc khorasaninejad et al 2018 under water limited conditions plants accumulate a number of compatible solutes like pro and ss for improvement of water status at the cellular level devnarain et al 2016 as also observed in this study enhancement of pro and ss contents in the leaves indicates that c korshinskii developed a potential physiological adaptation to improve water status under water shortage conditions that ultimately contributed to the stress tolerance mechanisms zhang et al 2018b similar to our findings the contents of pro and ss in the leaves of elaeagnus angustifolia and brassica napus remarkably increased under water and nutrient shortage conditions mamnabi et al 2020 roy et al 2020b several studies also indicated that heightened levels of pro and ss played significant roles in osmoregulation ros detoxification and maintenance of membrane integrity which together help plants overcome adverse effects induced by environmental stresses jahan et al 2020 keunen et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2018 under stressful environments plants generally accumulate significant amount of ros which can lead to oxidative stress by damaging cellular constituents including chloroplasts plasma membrane and mitochondria waszczak et al 2018 in our study control plants produced the largest amount of ros h2o2 and o2 and mda whereas supplement of w 60 fc significantly decreased their production in the leaves of c korshinskii to protect cells from oxidative damage plants maintain effective defense mechanisms including the enhancement of the activity of sod pod cat and apx bandeppa et al 2019 chiappero et al 2019 our results showed that sod pod cat and apx activities were noticeably lower at moderate or high levels of w and n p but substantially higher under low w and high n p doses fig 3d g these results suggest that c korshinskii plants protected themselves from w scarcity induced oxidative damage by boosting the activities of an array of key antioxidant enzymes as was also observed in other plant species including haloxylon ammodendron amorpha fruticosa and elaeagnus angustifolia under water shortage conditions lü et al 2019 roy et al 2020a 2020b moreover increasing supply of n p under low w regime also helped c korshinskii to increase antioxidant enzyme activities for minimizing oxidative stress as evidenced by low accumulation of ros results of heatmap and pca further showed that plants exposed to w regime w48 and no n doses clustered together and displayed stronger positive relationships with osmolytes pro and ss and the production of oxidative stress parameters h2o2 o2 and mda and antioxidant enzyme activities our research study also aimed to identify what combination of w and n p doses would lead to an optimum growth performance of c korshinskii it is difficult to optimize growth responses to multiple resources because plant growth related attributes photosynthetic traits and water status tend to decrease when ros and membrane damage are increased or vice versa mohasseli et al 2020 hence a numerical optimization menu was developed by rsm based on input data to achieve a compromise among different growth responses rsm approach was also used by several previous studies to obtain maximum growth performance of various plant species by detecting optimal conditions of w and n p doses koocheki et al 2014 lin and bin 2015 sepaskhah et al 2006 in desert areas it is very difficult and expensive to supply enough w for plant growth therefore the application of w doses would be better to be kept at minimum level although this factor is crucial to support plant growth table 1 fig 1a h moreover the application of n p fertilizers should also be concentrated to such an amount that the cost of production and environmental damage due to overuse of fertilizers could be minimized cui et al 2014 therefore we maintained w n and p dose at their minimum level to achieve optimum growth performance of c korshinskii fig 5d finally maximum desirability along with optimum growth performance was obtained under condition of w at 68 fc 1 85 mmd1 n and p doses at 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively as provided by rsm fig 5d these results indicate that regression models for all of the growth responses were statistically significant p value ranged from 0 0001 0 0002 and predicted models were also adequate as indicated by the error analysis showing a non significant lack of fit f value 0 05 table s6 finally the high correlation between these observed and predicted values table s6 suggest the reliability of desirable function method in rsm and thus this method could be used to optimize growth performance of c korshinskii planted in coal mine spoils overall c korshinskii shows its ability to successfully grow in coal mine spoils amended with optimal w n and p concentrations this represents a crucial first step in the restoration of coal mine degraded area with native vegetation in addition the revegetation of c korshinskii with appropriate levels of w and n p resources can ameliorate the fertility of the coal mine spoils which in turn may create a favorable environment for the survival of herbaceous plants and microorganism enhancing the natural ecological succession chu et al 2012 c korshinskii deserves more attention in restoration studies because this species is able to evolve several morpho physiological and biochemical adaptations in response to growth on coal mine spoils under different regimes of w and n p applications previous studies have also suggested the utilization of c korshinskii as a potential candidate for the restoration of degraded areas in arid or semi arid conditions ma et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 5 conclusions our results show how the supplement of different w and n p doses modulated several growth parameters of c korshinskii in order to survive in coal degraded spoils under high w and n p regime growth related attributes such as ph sd rl and dw significantly improved leading to better performance of c korshinskii when cultivated in coal mined spoils the application of n p fertilizers hardly improved c korshinskii growth in the presence of low w regime suggesting that without sufficient w key nutrients alone did not improve growth conditions under low w and n inputs c korshinskii accumulated compatible solutes like pro and ss for osmotic adjustments and increased the activities of several key antioxidant enzymes for ros detoxifications in contrast higher w and n p applications avoided that leaves produced much h2o2 o2 and mda and thus preserved c korshinskii from ros induced oxidative damage although the growth performance of c korshinskii remarkably improved with w72n96p36 an optimum combination of w 68 fc equivalent to 1 85 mmd1 n and p 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively doses as suggested by rsm analyses was associated with suitable growth performance of c korshinskii grown in coal mine spoils this specific combination of w and n p doses should be considered for the successful cultivation of c korshinskii in coal degraded areas our study demonstrates that fine tuning of key resources could greatly contribute to support the ecological restoration of arid coal

10241,coal mine spoils are typically drought prone and deficient in essential nutrients thus creating conditions which significantly limit plant growth and development here we searched for suitable combinations of key resources water w and fertilizers nitrogen n and phosphorus p to improve physiological and biochemical adaptations of caragana korshinskii to coal mined spoils we observed that under low w and n p resource availability c korshinskii displayed poor growth performance in coal degraded spoils negative growth of c korshinskii was associated with reduced photosynthetic rate decreased water status and increased contents of reactive oxygen species ros and malondialdehyde low resource availability to c korshinskii resulted in enhanced levels of compatible solutes including proline and soluble sugars that contributed to osmotic adjustment and also increased activities of superoxide dismutase peroxidase catalase and ascorbate peroxidase which ultimately conferred enhanced oxidative stress protection moderate to high w and n p doses greatly enhanced c korshinskii performance in coal spoils by improving photosynthesis traits water status and growth related attributes increasing supply of w and n p also helped c korshinskii to reduce oxidative stress as evidenced by low accumulation of ros and malondialdehyde and lower induction of antioxidant enzyme activities the addition of n and p also improved drought resistance of c korshinskii overall we found that optimum growth of c korshinskii in coal mined spoils was achieved under w additions corresponding to 68 of field capacity 1 85 mmd1 n and p at 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively these findings suggest that under appropriate w n and p doses c korshinskii has greater potential to grow and persist in coal mined spoils and could thus be used for revegetation interventions in drought prone areas in north western china and perhaps across other coal degraded areas worldwide graphical abstract ga1 keywords coal mine spoils chemical fertilizers caragana korshinskii vegetation restoration water shortage 1 introduction the ecosystem degradation through mining activities is one of the most pressing environmental problems in the world feng et al 2019 the rate of surface mining for mineral resources is increasing day by day because of rapid urbanization and technological advancements and largely contributes to disturbance of ecological integrity to fulfill the increasing demand of numerous industrial sectors mining activities are currently practiced at different extents all over the world which is one of the vital reasons of accelerated degradation of ecological system li 2018 zhang et al 2019 coal remains among the most important surface mined minerals worldwide and is a fundamental source of fossil fuels across many countries including china zhang et al 2018a increasing demand of coal extraction has led to adverse impacts on the natural environment especially in north western china li et al 2020 which is already described as an ecologically fragile zone where plant species often face water and nutrient deficiencies during their entire life period lv et al 2019 coal extraction is often associated with landscape degradation vegetation destruction and ecosystem obliteration zhang et al 2019 artiﬁcial revegetation has been recognized as an effective and useful management strategy to improve ecological restoration of degraded areas mukhopadhyay et al 2017 however revegetation interventions rely on the appropriate use of suitable plant species to enhance the long term sustainability of coal mine degraded arid environments of northwestern china ma et al 2018 in arid and semi arid regions some plants species such as melilotus officinalis astragalus adsurgens althaea rosea caragana korshinskii ammopiptanthus mongolicus amorpha fruticosa tamarix chinensis ulmus pumila elaeagnus angustifolia etc are generally more dominant because of their greater adaptability under water shortage and nutrient poor conditions they have the capability to adjust numerous morpho physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in photosynthesis regulation osmotic adjustments and oxidative stress protection to cope with water scarcity and nutrients unavailability toscano et al 2016 among them c korshinskii has been recognized as an important species to survive under water scarcity conditions dulamsuren et al 2009 c korshinskii is a predominant leguminous shrub found in semi arid and arid areas of northwest china and play a vital role in vegetation restoration and ecological rehabilitation programs zeng et al 2017 c korshinskii is also known for its contribution to conserve soil and water resources the production of fuel and fodder ma et al 2008 and its ecological and economic benefits to local communities ma et al 2016 the initial establishment of plant species requires availability of key resources such as water w and nutrients ahirwal et al 2017 for example availability of nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers can increase seedling establishment by minimizing the adverse effects of drought in arid regions villar salvador et al 2013 however optimum levels of w n and p for seedling establishment and growth of c korshinskii are currently unknown and more research is needed to assess how suitable w and n p combinations could enhance plant growth on coal mined spoils response surface methodology rsm has been recognized as an effective method to evaluate the optimization of w and n p resources by plants under adverse environmental conditions bezerra et al 2008 several researchers previously employed rsm to investigate the coupling effects of w and n p resources on growth performance of numerous plants species such as brussica napus oryza sativa and elaeagnus angustifolia koocheki et al 2014 liu et al 2019 roy et al 2020b however no such studies have been conducted to optimize levels of w and n p resources for adaptation of c korshinskii to arid and semi arid conditions in coal mining areas moreover c korshinskii response to changes in the availability of w and n p resources has rarely been investigated at the physiological and biochemical levels thus the current study aimed at investigating optimum growth responses of c korshinskii under different regimes of w and n p applications we optimized doses of w and n p fertilizers using central composite rotatable rsm and investigated resource availability effects on morphological physiological and biochemical responses of c korshinskii grown in coal contaminated soils 2 materials and methods the study was conducted in an artificial plastic shed at the northwest a f university china to estimate the growth of c korshinskii on coal mine spoils under various regime of w and n p doses mine spoils were collected from yangchangwan lingwu china and sampled following a specific protocol see details roy et al 2020b physical and chemical parameters of coal mine spoils were measured before starting the pot experiment table s1 these parameters included fc 11 2 soil bulk density 1 48 g cm3 coarse fine sand 0 1 mm 93 11 very fine sand 0 05 0 1 mm 3 94

1 98 mg kg1 and available k 66 9 mg kg1 table s1 these values suggest that mine spoils are deficient in essential nutrient and are characterized by lower water holding capacity we also measured soil erodibility i e k factor which is often used to assess soil degradation in an erodible environment liu and han 2020 the k factor can be estimated based on soil particle distribution soil structure and organic matter content wang et al 2016 using the erosion productivity impact calculator epic model we calculated the k factor following the formula reported in sharpley and williams 1990 as indicated

2008 we have reported multiple physical and chemical properties of experimental spoils associated with the cultivation of c korshinskii under different w n and p doses in table s3 one year old identical c korshinskii plants were planted in plastic pots 320 mm diameter and 300 mm height which were previously filled with 14 0 kg of experimental spoils plants were watered daily and allowed to grow for one month to properly establish under pot conditions in this period pots containing seedling were given an average of 210 ml of w per day d which is equivalent to 2 61 mm wd1 one month later watering was stopped and when the water content was found close to the lowest levels of field capacity fc 40 fc the different experimental treatments were applied and continued until october 2018 the experiment was arranged using a standard rsm namely central composite design ccd for the optimization of the selected independent variables within this design a total of five water doses were used 40

amount of water was added to attain the expected fc previous studies suggest that frequent replacement of evapotranspiration losses could maintain a wide range of consistent soil water contents under greenhouse conditions earl 2003 lu et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 during the experimental treatment period from april 6 to october 6 2018 the volume of w required to achieve pot fc under each of different

treatments using various regimes of w and n p doses were selected for this study and presented in table s2 here lowest w level w40 without n p fertilizers w40n0p0 was treated as control each treatment had 3 replications 3 21 63 and pots were randomly ordered inside the plastic shed effects of different treatments on different growth responses of c korshinskii were analyzed with the second order

calculate igp of c korshinskii we used eq 4 for those growth indices that were positively correlated with w n and p application however eq 5 was used for those growth indices that were negatively correlated with w n and p application as recommended by previous studies ihtisham et al 2018 li et al 2019 2 1 measurement of morphological attributes after 210 days of planting 1 year 7 month old

avoid nocturnal plant water loss and low vpd values eamus et al 1999 several findings suggested that plant species are able to recover leaf water status during the night even in the dry season and

ratio of c korshinskii over that of control table 1 the regression coefficient value absolute was taken into consideration for finding the significant degree of w and n p on several growth responses of c korshinskii table s5 positive values of the coefficient denote a synergistic impact while negative values denote antagonistic impact of w n and p on several growth traits of c korshinskii table s5 showed that the synergistic effect was generated by w b1 n b2 and p b3 on ph sd and dw 3 2 gas exchange traits and photosynthetic pigment contents application of high w n doses produced remarkable increases in pn and gs over that of control fig 1a and b plants treated with w72n96p144 and w72n96p36 showed significant improvements in pn by 111 9 and 119 7 and gs by 115 4 and 120 1 respectively compared with control plants fig 1a and b treatment w48n96p144 decreased tr by 17 4 whereas tr across the various treatments significantly increased by 4 4 93 6 when compared with control fig 1c in

was generated by w and p on pn and tr whereas an antagonistic effect was generated by p on gs table s5 interestingly wue improved following additions of w n and p table s5 chls contents of c korshinskii were also negatively affected by w scarcity and hence treatments w48n96p144 w48n96p36 and w40n60p90 only slightly increased chl a by 19 0 31 7 and 20 6 respectively chl b by 21 9 46 9 and

except w72n96p36 w48n96p36 and w48n24p144 and the maximum reduction in ss content was detected in treatment w72n96p144 by 40 2 when compared with control fig 2d 3 4 reactive oxygen species ros production lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities the o2 h2o2 and mda contents drastically reduced with the supplement of high w and n doses in comparison with control fig 3a c plants treated with w72n96p144 w72n96p36 w72n24p144 w72n24p36 w80n60p90 and w60n120p90 presented a notable decreased in the contents of o2 by 65 1 62 8 29 1 31 4 66 3 and 54 7 h2o2 by 61 5 60 7 57 9 59 9 61 0 and 56 8 and mda by 38 1 30 7 37 0 30 2 39 5 and 25 6 respectively relative to that of control fig 3a c however application of moderate n p doses at very low w regime w40n60p90 only slightly decreased o2 h2o2 and mda contents by 16 3 11 1 and 8 4 respectively compared with control plants fig 3a c activities of sod pod cat and apx radically declined over control when the plants were exposed to moderate high and highest w regimes regardless of n p fertilizers fig 3d g however plants treated with w40n60p90 and w48n96p144 caused positive but non significant increases in sod activity by 5 35 and 1 85 pod activity by 0 93 and 2 96 and apx activity by 4 69 and 9 58 respectively compared with control fig 3d e and g cat activity across the various treatments significantly decreased by 6 67 31 98 compared with control fig 3f 3 5 growth assessment of c korshinskii in responses to mutual application of w and n p doses by heatmap and pca methods heatmap analysis fig 4a demonstrated that c korshinskii exposed to control w40n60p90 w48n96p36 w48n96p144 w48n24p36 w48n24p144 and w60n0p90 treatments assembled on the left due to their higher contents of osmolytes pro and ss ros h2o2 and o2 and mda and increased activities of sod pod cat and apx this indicated that scarcity of w and n considerably boosted production of ros and membrane damage and c korshinskii enhanced the production of osmolytes and increased antioxidant enzymes activities to overcome the adverse effects in contrast treatments containing w regime w48 regardless of n p such as w60n60p0 w72n24p36 w60n60p180 w80n60p90 w72n96p144 w72n96p36 w60n120p90 and w72n24p144 grouped on the right due to their high levels of morphological growth parameters like ph sd dw rl gas exchange parameters pn tr gs and wue and chls and cars contents fig 4a however c korshinskii exposed to w60n60p90 clustered in the middle fig 4a in our study the first two principal components explained 64 94 pc1 51 64 and pc2 13 30 of total variation fig 4b similar to heatmap analysis pca results also showed that treatments with w regime w48 such as w72n96p144 t1 w60n120p90 t11 w60n60p180 t13 w72n24p36 t4 w60n60p0 t14 w72n96p36 t2 w72n24p144 t3 and w80n60p90 t9 were located in the positive direction of pc1 were positively associated with growth associated parameters photosynthetic traits and pigment contents fig 4b in addition treatments with w regime w48 like ck t21 w40n60p90 t10 w48n96p36 t6 w48n96p144 t5 w48n24p36 t8 and w48n24p144 t7 were located in the opposite direction of pc1 showed high accumulation of osmolytes ros and mda and increased activities of antioxidant enzymes fig 4b on the contrary the distribution on pc2 was related to the effective use of n where w60n120p90 t11 w72n96p144 t1 and w48n96p144 t5 were isolated on the positive direction of pc2 whereas w60n0p90 t12 w48n24p144 t7 and w48n24p36 t8 were located on the negative side of pc2 on the lower left quadrant of the pca score plot fig 4b 3 6 interactive effects of w n and p on igp of c korshinskii c korshinskii plants exposed to w72n96p144 exhibited highest igp of 0 71 table s4 3 d response surface plot was created by considering interaction of 2 factors by keeping 3rd factor at moderate or central level with igp of c korshinskii and presented in fig 5a c fig 5a and b showed that at very low to moderate w regime the addition of n and p had no clear positive effects on the growth performance of c korshinskii however at highest w supply igp of c korshinskii markedly improved with the increase of n p levels fig 5a and b anova further confirmed that the mutual interaction between w n and w p determined a significant synergistic effect p 0 001 on the igp of c korshinskii table s5 the interaction of n p suggested that when w addition was equal to 60 fc igp of c korshinskii remarkably decreased with moderate n 60 0 mg kg1 and p 90 0 mg kg1 doses but slightly increased with highest n p levels anova results showed that the interactive effects of n p had a significant synergistic effect p 0 05 on the igp of c korshinskii table s5 overall the extent of w n and p effects on growth performance of c korshinskii followed w n p trend 3 7 fitting the rsm and identification of optimum w n and p combination anova results showed that the quadratic model was the best for the analysis of numerous growth parameters among several models all probability values p values and lack of fit f values revealed that the suggested models were statistically acceptable table s6 to find the optimum w and n p application rates we maintained growth associated parameters gas exchange traits photosynthetic pigments leaf water contents and antioxidant enzyme activities at their maximum levels alternatively mda pro h2o2 and o2 contents were kept at their minimum levels fig 5d based on the above conditions twenty nine 29 solutions were produced by the software and among them solution no 1 with maximum desirability of 0 546 was selected fig 5d finally we found that the combination of w 68 fc n and p doses 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively was associated with the optimum growth performance of c korshinskii fig 5d it was found that under 68 fc water consumption of c korshinskii was 1 85 mmd1 4 discussion the ecological rehabilitation of coal mining areas using appropriate vegetation restoration techniques is fundamental for the sustainable management of degraded lands because of poor nutrients availability and the adverse effects of a combination of environmental stresses the choice of appropriate plant species and nutrient and water amendments is particularly important for the effective restoration of coal degraded areas plants that are capable to rapidly grow in the presence of scarce resources and the ability to resist to key environmental constraints could represent a suitable investment for restoration interventions in our study we found that growth associated attributes like ph sd rl and dw of c korshinskii significantly increased when w levels increased from 40 fc to 80 fc regardless of changes in n p dose applications table 1 however application of high n p doses n96p144 in both high w72 and low w48 w regimes showed their potential effects to increase ph and dw under w shortage condition 48 fc most plant growth parameters significantly declined and the supplement of low or moderate n p doses had minimal positive effects table 1 the decline of growth parameters with decreasing water content is the result of reduced nutrient uptake because of water scarcity it is plausible that shortage of soil water levels reduced the absorption of w as well as nutrients by plant roots resulting in nutritional imbalances ultimately responsible for the reduction of plant growth development and survival devnarain et al 2016 tardieu 2013 c korshinskii plants growing under inadequate w and nutrient supply showed adaptive mechanism to overcome multiple stresses and reduced their biomass to maintain their life span gao et al 2006 on the other hand at high w regime 72 fc application of n p fertilizers substantially enhanced all plant growth associated parameters similar results have been reported in previous studies suggesting that water shortage negatively affects growth associated parameters whereas the application of n p fertilizers under high w regime significantly improve growth performance of different plants species andivia et al 2011 maswada et al 2020 roy et al 2020a furthermore the large r s ratio observed under low w regime indicates that c korshinskii produced larger root systems to increase absorptive root surfaces and uptake more effectively water and nutrients that are less available in coal spoils howard skinner and comas 2010 the photosynthetic performance of plants is invariably associated with the levels of photosynthetic pigments under diverse environmental conditions li et al 2017 we found that combinations containing both high w and n doses such as w72n96p144 and w72n96p36 dramatically enhanced pn gs tr and cars levels however treatments such as w40n60p90 w48n96p144 and w60n60p90 considerably reduced above mentioned traits fig 1a h as also observed in previous studies liu et al 2013 roy et al 2020b because plants develop adaptive responses against water shortage conditions mainly by closing leaf stomata to reduce water loss this adaptive mechanism ultimately contributes to the reduction of pn and gs anjum et al 2011 munjonji et al 2017 as also observed in this study another possible reason for declined levels of gas exchange parameters at low w regime could be the reduced synthesis of photosynthetic pigments under water shortage conditions which resulted in a significant decline in biomass production of our plant species khorasaninejad et al 2018 as shown by anova outputs table s5 heatmap and pca analyses fig 4a and b several studies reported that the application of nutrients can scarcely offset the negative impacts of water stress due to abnormal temperature increases and the frequency of severe drought events under field conditions lobell et al 2014 myers et al 2017 however increased wue at w48n96p144 suggests that c korshinskii seedlings increase their wue via increasing water uptake and decreasing water losses by reducing tr at low w regime supplied with high n p doses musembi et al 2015 rwc is considered the most important index to evaluate overall water status because greatly influences the regulation of stomatal conductance as well as pn of plants teulat et al 2003 rwc is also linked to membrane stability as damage of plasma membranes under stress conditions may lead to loss of cellular water exposing plants to cellular dehydration pérez pérez et al 2009 in our study high doses of w n p w72n96p144 were associated with maximum increases in rwc and msi and maximum decreases in pro and ss contents however application of n p fertilizers also showed their potential to increase rwc and msi and decrease pro and ss contents under low w 48 fc regime fig 2a d it is possible that application of n p fertilizers under low w content improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil which then contributed to increase water absorption by plant roots thus benefitting the maintenance of rwc khorasaninejad et al 2018 under water limited conditions plants accumulate a number of compatible solutes like pro and ss for improvement of water status at the cellular level devnarain et al 2016 as also observed in this study enhancement of pro and ss contents in the leaves indicates that c korshinskii developed a potential physiological adaptation to improve water status under water shortage conditions that ultimately contributed to the stress tolerance mechanisms zhang et al 2018b similar to our findings the contents of pro and ss in the leaves of elaeagnus angustifolia and brassica napus remarkably increased under water and nutrient shortage conditions mamnabi et al 2020 roy et al 2020b several studies also indicated that heightened levels of pro and ss played significant roles in osmoregulation ros detoxification and maintenance of membrane integrity which together help plants overcome adverse effects induced by environmental stresses jahan et al 2020 keunen et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2018 under stressful environments plants generally accumulate significant amount of ros which can lead to oxidative stress by damaging cellular constituents including chloroplasts plasma membrane and mitochondria waszczak et al 2018 in our study control plants produced the largest amount of ros h2o2 and o2 and mda whereas supplement of w 60 fc significantly decreased their production in the leaves of c korshinskii to protect cells from oxidative damage plants maintain effective defense mechanisms including the enhancement of the activity of sod pod cat and apx bandeppa et al 2019 chiappero et al 2019 our results showed that sod pod cat and apx activities were noticeably lower at moderate or high levels of w and n p but substantially higher under low w and high n p doses fig 3d g these results suggest that c korshinskii plants protected themselves from w scarcity induced oxidative damage by boosting the activities of an array of key antioxidant enzymes as was also observed in other plant species including haloxylon ammodendron amorpha fruticosa and elaeagnus angustifolia under water shortage conditions lü et al 2019 roy et al 2020a 2020b moreover increasing supply of n p under low w regime also helped c korshinskii to increase antioxidant enzyme activities for minimizing oxidative stress as evidenced by low accumulation of ros results of heatmap and pca further showed that plants exposed to w regime w48 and no n doses clustered together and displayed stronger positive relationships with osmolytes pro and ss and the production of oxidative stress parameters h2o2 o2 and mda and antioxidant enzyme activities our research study also aimed to identify what combination of w and n p doses would lead to an optimum growth performance of c korshinskii it is difficult to optimize growth responses to multiple resources because plant growth related attributes photosynthetic traits and water status tend to decrease when ros and membrane damage are increased or vice versa mohasseli et al 2020 hence a numerical optimization menu was developed by rsm based on input data to achieve a compromise among different growth responses rsm approach was also used by several previous studies to obtain maximum growth performance of various plant species by detecting optimal conditions of w and n p doses koocheki et al 2014 lin and bin 2015 sepaskhah et al 2006 in desert areas it is very difficult and expensive to supply enough w for plant growth therefore the application of w doses would be better to be kept at minimum level although this factor is crucial to support plant growth table 1 fig 1a h moreover the application of n p fertilizers should also be concentrated to such an amount that the cost of production and environmental damage due to overuse of fertilizers could be minimized cui et al 2014 therefore we maintained w n and p dose at their minimum level to achieve optimum growth performance of c korshinskii fig 5d finally maximum desirability along with optimum growth performance was obtained under condition of w at 68 fc 1 85 mmd1 n and p doses at 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively as provided by rsm fig 5d these results indicate that regression models for all of the growth responses were statistically significant p value ranged from 0 0001 0 0002 and predicted models were also adequate as indicated by the error analysis showing a non significant lack of fit f value 0 05 table s6 finally the high correlation between these observed and predicted values table s6 suggest the reliability of desirable function method in rsm and thus this method could be used to optimize growth performance of c korshinskii planted in coal mine spoils overall c korshinskii shows its ability to successfully grow in coal mine spoils amended with optimal w n and p concentrations this represents a crucial first step in the restoration of coal mine degraded area with native vegetation in addition the revegetation of c korshinskii with appropriate levels of w and n p resources can ameliorate the fertility of the coal mine spoils which in turn may create a favorable environment for the survival of herbaceous plants and microorganism enhancing the natural ecological succession chu et al 2012 c korshinskii deserves more attention in restoration studies because this species is able to evolve several morpho physiological and biochemical adaptations in response to growth on coal mine spoils under different regimes of w and n p applications previous studies have also suggested the utilization of c korshinskii as a potential candidate for the restoration of degraded areas in arid or semi arid conditions ma et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 5 conclusions our results show how the supplement of different w and n p doses modulated several growth parameters of c korshinskii in order to survive in coal degraded spoils under high w and n p regime growth related attributes such as ph sd rl and dw significantly improved leading to better performance of c korshinskii when cultivated in coal mined spoils the application of n p fertilizers hardly improved c korshinskii growth in the presence of low w regime suggesting that without sufficient w key nutrients alone did not improve growth conditions under low w and n inputs c korshinskii accumulated compatible solutes like pro and ss for osmotic adjustments and increased the activities of several key antioxidant enzymes for ros detoxifications in contrast higher w and n p applications avoided that leaves produced much h2o2 o2 and mda and thus preserved c korshinskii from ros induced oxidative damage although the growth performance of c korshinskii remarkably improved with w72n96p36 an optimum combination of w 68 fc equivalent to 1 85 mmd1 n and p 52 0 and 37 0 mg kg1 soil respectively doses as suggested by rsm analyses was associated with suitable growth performance of c korshinskii grown in coal mine spoils this specific combination of w and n p doses should be considered for the successful cultivation of c korshinskii in coal degraded areas our study demonstrates that fine tuning of key resources could greatly contribute to support the ecological restoration of arid coal mined degraded environments around the world credit authorship contribution statement rana roy conceptualization data curation formal analysis methodology software investigation visualization writing

10242,most citrus nurseries in florida usa use overhead irrigation but subirrigation methods including ebb and flow and capillary mats have been shown to conserve water and accelerate plant growth relative to overhead irrigation for other nursery species and may be a viable alternative to overhead irrigation in citrus liner production the objectives of this study were to 1 automate an ebb and flow system for citrus liner production using capacitance sensors and 2 evaluate how subirrigation and overhead irrigation methods affect water use plant growth parameters and substrate chemical properties a study was conducted from 22 may to 23 september 2018 in which liners of six commercially important rootstock cultivars in cone shaped containers were subjected to one of the following irrigation methods ebb and flow triggered at substrate volumetric water contents θ of 0 24 0 36 or 0 48 m3 m 3 capillary mats and overhead irrigation capacitance sensors successfully monitored irrigation throughout the study ebb and flow benches used substantially less water 411 l than either capillary mats 13 098 l or overhead irrigation 3193 l by the end of the study rootstock cultivars propagated using subirrigation methods were approximately 22 taller with 7 more total biomass than plants subjected to overhead irrigation additionally plant growth at the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold used to trigger ebb and flow was as great or greater than growth at 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds during the final five weeks of the study substrate electrical conductivity was higher using subirrigation methods 0 84 1 3 ds m 1 than under overhead irrigation 0 55 0 8 ds m 1 but there were no symptoms of salt stress observed in plants at any time results from this study show that ebb and flow is a viable alternative to overhead irrigation and is superior to capillary mats for water conservation in automated ebb and flow systems in florida we recommend using the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold to produce the citrus rootstock cultivars used in this study with peat perlite substrate keywords citrus liners capacitance sensors rootstock cultivars subirrigation water conservation 1 introduction since the arrival of huanglongbing hlb or citrus greening in florida usa in 2005 citrus fruit yields have declined precipitously falling from 7 8 million metric tons in 2005 to 3 5 million metric tons in 2019 nass 2020 the pathogen associated with hlb candidatus liberibacter asiaticus clas is vectored by the asian citrus psyllid diaphorina citri which is present in all citrus growing regions of florida dewdney et al 2019 grower surveys have shown that 90 of the citrus production area in the state has been compromised by the disease singerman and useche 2016 depending on hlb severity and management practices both young and mature orchards can be rendered unproductive or killed within years bassanezi and bassanezi 2006 roistacher 1996 the prevalence of hlb in florida has forced growers to continuously replace unproductive or dead trees additionally new orchards are often planted at higher tree densities to optimize fruit yields during early years of production given the likelihood of hlb induced yield decline during later years spreen and zansler 2016 singerman et al 2018 these factors have led to a sharp increase in tree demand which has placed added pressure on nurseries to rapidly produce high quality rootstocks to graft new trees most citrus nurseries in florida use overhead irrigation methods characterized by low irrigation efficiency and excessive losses of fertilizer solution fs with potential to contaminate groundwater resources ferrarezi 2019 salvador et al 2016 an alternative to overhead irrigation is ebb and flow subirrigation which applies fs to the bottom of containers and as a closed system recirculates unused fs to a storage reservoir for later reuse ferrarezi et al 2015c the movement of fs through substrate by capillary action makes water and nutrients readily accessible to roots while subirrigation methods in florida citrus nurseries have not been previously investigated research from brazil has demonstrated that in addition to conserving water and nutrients relative to overhead irrigation subirrigation systems including ebb and flow can enhance plant growth rates in rangpur lime citrus limonia liners compared to overhead irrigation barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b although subirrigation can lead to salt accumulation in containers rouphael et al 2006 and potentially cause osmotic stress ferrarezi et al 2015c ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a showed that occasional substrate washing twice over 90 days in a brazilian citrus nursery that used an ebb and flow system was sufficient for producing rangpur lime liners superior in growth to liners grown under overhead irrigation there is a dire need to extend this subirrigation research from brazil to nursery conditions in florida testing a wider variety of citrus rootstock cultivars to accelerate the availability of high quality trees for transplanting under current hlb endemic conditions in the region ebb and flow systems can be automated with the use of capacitance sensors so that water is provided to plants based on demand rather than an arbitrary schedule when using capacitance sensors special consideration must be given to determining appropriate volumetric water content θ thresholds used to activate sensors previous greenhouse irrigation research using several different plant species including citrus and conducted in a wide variety of greenhouse environments around the world has shown that optimal θ threshold selection is species dependent and can have a major impact on plant growth net photosynthesis and total water and fertilizer use ferrarezi et al 2014 2015b ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b nam et al 2020 additionally low cost open source microcontrollers are available to automate ebb and flow systems across a range of θ thresholds in cases where capacitance sensors and accompanying software used to build and operate automated irrigation controllers are cost prohibitive ferrarezi et al 2015a coupling ebb and flow systems with capacitance sensor technology in florida citrus nurseries has the potential to accelerate production of high quality citrus rootstocks while drastically reducing nutrient and water losses compared to overhead irrigation while not widely used in citrus nurseries capillary mats have been used extensively to provide subirrigation in vegetable and ornamental nurseries capillary mats quickly absorb water and are placed under containers to provide plants with water via capillary action ferrarezi et al 2015b compared to overhead irrigation capillary mats can accelerate plant growth reduce fluctuations in substrate water content and enhance water and nutrient use efficiency for a wide variety of ornamental and vegetable species goodwin et al 2003 hoffman et al 1996 schuch et al 2008 direct comparisons of ebb and flow and capillary mats in ornamental nurseries have indicated that ebb and flow systems conserve more water produce less runoff and accumulate similar or greater amounts of biomass depending on species dole et al 1994 morvant et al 1997 1998 however recent advances in capillary mat technology have included the use of films lining the bottom of mats to reduce water losses caused by dripping ferrarezi et al 2015b capillary mats are also less expensive and easier to install than ebb and flow benches making their potential use in citrus nurseries worthy of investigation a wide variety of citrus rootstock cultivars are used by florida growers with cultivar selection depending on scion compatibility marketing soil physical and chemical properties tree size and spacing and disease and pest resistance albrecht et al 2019 castle et al 2019 while there are no rootstock cultivars currently available with true hlb tolerance trees planted on some rootstocks have been shown to produce economical fruit yields with favorable quality characteristics in hlb compromised orchards albrecht et al 2012 bowman et al 2016 however since subirrigation systems are not widely used in florida citrus nurseries there is a need to establish subirrigation guidelines for producing these and other widely used rootstock cultivars in the state building off earlier success implementing subirrigation methods in citrus liner production in brazil barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a 2017b the objectives of this study were to 1 automate an ebb and flow subirrigation system for citrus liner production using capacitance sensors and 2 evaluate how subirrigation and overhead irrigation methods affect water use plant growth parameters and substrate chemical properties we hypothesized that an automated ebb and flow system would conserve water and accelerate plant growth relative to capillary mats and overhead irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and experimental design a study was conducted from 22 may to 23 september 2018 at the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences uf ifas indian river research and education center in fort pierce florida 27 25 35 n 80 24 31 w 5 8 m elevation the study was performed inside a greenhouse without climate control environmental conditions were monitored using sensors to measure temperature and humidity hmp 60 vaisala helsinki finland vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from saturated and actual vapor pressure using air temperature and relative humidity data average air temperature relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd during the study were 26 9 c 83 4 and 0 74 kpa respectively however air temperature rh and vpd ranged from 20 1 to 38 4 c 33 8 99 8 and 0 006 4 5 kpa respectively a factorial experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design r 4 with a split plot restriction on randomization where five levels of irrigation method were assigned to main plot units and six levels of rootstock cultivar to subplot units irrigation methods consisted of ebb and flow benches triggered at three θ thresholds 0 24 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 capillary mats and overhead irrigation the θ thresholds chosen for this study were used because previous research in citrus liner production indicated the 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold optimized plant growth while 0 24 and 0 36 m3 m 3 thresholds produced levels of plant growth acceptable for transplanting in a reasonable time frame bataglia et al 2008 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b since we tested several rootstock cultivars in our study we wanted to determine if lower θ thresholds could be used successfully to achieve optimal plant growth for the different cultivars while saving water rootstock cultivars included kuharske c sinensis poncirus trifoliata ufr 2 c clementina c paradisi c reticulata c grandis c reticulata p trifoliata ufr 16 c grandis c reticulata us 802 c

plot and seeded in the cone shaped containers we used 1960 liners of each rootstock cultivar divided into four replications for a total of 11 760 plants during the study 2 2 substrate properties the peat perlite substrate used had the following range of chemical and physical properties ph of 5 5 6 5 electrical conductivity of 0 075 0 15 ds m 1 water holding capacity of 0 45 0 65 m3 m 3 bulk

automated using capacitance sensors 10hs decagon devices pullman wa usa connected to a multiplexer am16 32b and data logger cr1000x both manufactured by campbell scientific logan ut usa irrigation was supplied to ebb and flow benches based on sensor readings by relay drivers sdm cd16ac campbell scientific connected to submersible pumps nk 2 little giant bluffton in usa placed in 121 l fs tanks rubbermaid sarasota springs ny usa located under greenhouse tables one tank per replication tanks were replenished weekly and covered to protect fs from ultraviolet radiation one sensor was randomly assigned to a container in each bench sensors were inserted vertically into the middle portion of substrate in containers as described previously by ferrarezi et al 2017b sensors were not inserted in the outer row of plants to avoid edge effects substrate water readings were taken every 30 min and averaged hourly when θ dropped below set thresholds submersible pumps in each tank were activated for 6 min drainage from benches occurred through a single outlet installed in each bench using a 19 mm diameter hose with a 6 4 mm reducer at the end to reduce flow and increase irrigation time capillary mats and overhead irrigation were automated as described above and activated at 0 36 m3 m 3 for the first seven weeks of the study however automated irrigation resulted in excessive fs losses because neither capillary mats nor overhead irrigation are closed systems therefore after seven weeks automated irrigation was discontinued for both capillary mats and overhead irrigation and was replaced by a daily irrigation schedule however capacitance sensors were left in containers for the remainder of the study to monitor θ from week eight to the end of the study capillary mats were irrigated daily at 10 00 a m and 3 00 p m for 6 min overhead irrigation scheduling was based on standard florida nursery practices for citrus liner production and was supplied daily at 9 00 a m for 3 min during this period overhead irrigation was supplied at 0 09 l m 2 min 1 from a single line of emitters ein dor melow equipped with an anti drip device mead both manufactured by dripworks willits ca usa located 0

disease control in citrus rootstock liner production 2 5 data collection substrate θ was monitored by the capacitance sensors and sensor readings were transformed from voltage to θ using an equation provided by the sensor manufacturer for potting mix θ i 7 05 10 7 voltage i 2 1 23 10 4 voltage i 3 03 10 2 where i refers to an individual sensor and voltage is measured in mv the number of irrigation events were monitored and recorded in ebb and flow benches by a counter in the automated irrigation system while 19 mm water flow meters spwm 075 ekm metering inc santa cruz ca usa connected to the datalogger recorded the volume of fs used for capillary mats and overhead irrigation this parameter reflected water loss due to evapotranspiration fertilizer solution tanks were sampled at weeks 15 and 18 to determine nutrient concentrations since fertilizers tend to concentrate in ebb and flow systems after a few months we chose these sampling weeks because plants were at their largest size and likely accumulating larger amounts of nutrients compared to earlier in the study steam distillation was used to determine nh4 n and no3 n inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for p k ca mg s cu fe mn and zn and the hot water method for b plant growth parameters shoot root and total biomass stem diameter and plant height were measured at 0 4 10 14 and 18 weeks after initiating the study from 10 randomly selected plants per replication shoots and roots were rinsed to remove debris and dried in an oven at 65 c until constant weight stem diameter was measured with a digital caliper and plant height with a regular ruler substrate was sampled weekly beginning at week nine to measure ph and electrical conductivity ec using methods described by cavins et al 2000 and revised by ferrarezi et al 2007 briefly five plants per replication were randomly selected and placed on a rack to leach substrate substrate was saturated and then 50 ml of distilled water was placed on the substrate surface to leach out 50 ml of solution into a collection tray the resulting solution was left for 30 min to allow substrate settling after which ph and ec were measured using a portable meter hi5522 hanna ann arbor mi usa 2 6 statistical analyses analysis of variance anova of a linear mixed effects model was conducted using lsmeans and nlme packages of r statistical software version 3 6 1 r development core team 2019 to assess all response variables prior to anova data were fit to diagnostic plots generated by plot lm and summary commands of r 3 6 1 to determine if model assumptions were met tests indicated that model assumptions were met for all response variables in the model irrigation method rootstock cultivar and week were treated as fixed effects while replication and replication interactions with main effects were treated as random effects for response variables that included repeated measures fs nutrient concentrations plant growth parameters and substrate ph and ec auto regressive moving average and first order autoregressive structures were tested in the model with model selection based on lowest akaike information criterion values pairwise comparisons for means of all response variables were made using tukey s honest significant difference hsd α 0 05 because of the large number of possible pairwise comparisons for plant growth parameters we showed comparisons by week in figures rather than between weeks because they were most biologically relevant additionally showing all possible pairwise comparisons would have made figures difficult to interpret 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation systems performance and water use capacitance sensors were generally successful in triggering irrigation at chosen substrate θ thresholds in ebb and flow benches however during the first two weeks of the study sensors set to the 0 36 m3 m 3 threshold triggered irrigation at 0 22 m3 m 3 fig 1 occasional inaccuracies in triggering irrigation using capacitance sensors is not unusual and has been reported elsewhere ferrarezi et al 2017b as the study progressed there was a gradual decline in substrate θ under overhead irrigation which was likely caused by lower irrigation efficiency as liner canopies grew larger with leaves intercepting and redirecting larger amounts of water away from substrate salvador et al 2016 for containers irrigated on capillary mats substrate θ was relatively constant through week seven of the study before increasing and reaching a new constant phase when automated irrigation ended and was replaced by a timing based schedule minimal fluctuation in θ is a defining feature of capillary mat irrigation caron et al 2005 geneve et al 2004 hoffman et al 1996 van iersel and nemali 2004 ebb and flow methods only used a fraction of the amount of water used by capillary mats and overhead irrigation fig 2a in ebb and flow benches the different substrate θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation did not affect total water use which was approximately 411 l there was nearly an eightfold increase in water use moving from ebb and flow methods to overhead irrigation however capillary mats consumed the largest amount of water totaling 13 098 l which was approximately 32 times the amount used by ebb and flow methods in addition to using a relatively small amount of water ebb and flow benches also recirculated a total of 108 906 122 541 l of water during the study fig 2b due to the large number of irrigation events that resulted from ebb and flow automation 5423 6102 relative to overhead irrigation 1117 and capillary mats 2054 fig 2c which were irrigated based on a timed schedule for over half the study the large water savings associated with ebb and flow methods compared to capillary mats and overhead irrigation underscore the potential of ebb and flow as a subirrigation method in water limited important citrus growing regions like california texas the mediterranean and southwest asia espinosa tasón et al 2020 jamshidi et al 2020 nass 2020 the large amount of water used by capillary mats was an unexpected outcome of this study while capillary mats were anticipated to use more water than ebb and flow methods we did not foresee capillary mat water use exceeding that of overhead irrigation these results were likely due to a combination of management and environmental factors as mentioned previously our attempts to automate capillary mat irrigation during the first seven weeks of the study resulted in substantial water use which amounted to 12 033 l or 91 of total water use by capillary mats during the study data not shown after transitioning from automated irrigation to a timed schedule capillary mat water use 1134 l declined substantially for the remainder of the study but still exceeded water use by ebb and flow methods 353 l and overhead irrigation 810 l during that time previous studies that have shown higher water use by capillary mats compared to overhead irrigation attributed these findings to large evaporative losses from capillary mat surfaces heightened by high air temperatures and light intensity dole et al 1994 morvant et al 1997 1998 semananda et al 2018 although capillary mats in our study were equipped with evaporation block layers and containment barriers to inhibit runoff we noticed large amounts of water on capillary mat surfaces and water accumulation near mats due to runoff considering the relatively high temperatures 20 1 38 4 c throughout the study evaporation was likely a major pathway of water loss from capillary mats our results indicate that capillary mats are not a suitable replacement for overhead irrigation in greenhouses without climate control however under cooler greenhouse conditions whether due to climate control or geographic location capillary mats could conceivably use less water than in this study 3 2 fertilizer solution nutrient concentrations fertilizer solution supplied to ebb and flow benches was evaluated at week 15 and 18 of the study to determine how chosen substrate θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation affected fs nutrient concentrations our results showed there was a week irrigation threshold interaction that affected fs inorganic n no3 n nh4 n concentrations table 1 at week 15 inorganic n concentrations were lower at the 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold compared to the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold however there were no irrigation threshold effects detected at week 18 fig 3 the main effect of irrigation threshold also impacted p mg and s concentrations averaged over week concentrations of these nutrients peaked at 0 24 m3 m 3 data not shown the nutrient concentrations in fs provide important information about nutrient availability for plant growth while optimal fs nutrient concentrations for the rootstock cultivars used in this study have not been determined bataglia et al 2008 reported maximum nutrient concentrations allowable for optimal rangpur lime liner production applying those concentrations to our study showed that all nutrients except p s and b had concentrations below these concentration limits additionally there were no visual symptoms of nutrient toxicities or deficiencies during the study indicating all nutrient concentrations satisfactorily met plant nutritional needs additional research should be undertaken to determine the fs nutrient concentrations required to optimize citrus liner growth in ebb and flow systems 3 3 plant growth parameters florida citrus nursery surveys indicate that three to six months are needed to produce citrus liners that are ready to transplant into larger pots vashisth et al 2020 while nurseries in other citrus growing regions like brazil often use established growth criteria to guide liner transplanting decisions bataglia et al 2008 furlani et al 2009 such criteria have not been established by uf ifas cooperative extension for florida citrus nurseries there is a need to conduct surveys among florida citrus nurseries to determine the growth criteria currently in use to guide liner transplanting decisions without this growth criteria information results from our study cannot be used to compare the effects that irrigation methods and rootstock cultivars have on the length of liner growth cycles however we can show how these factors impact liner growth rates within the timeframe used for liner production in florida citrus nurseries all plant growth parameters were affected by week irrigation method and week rootstock cultivar interactions however there was no week irrigation method rootstock cultivar interaction detected for any plant growth parameters table 2 representative plants for each treatment combination at the end of the study are presented in fig 4 the week irrigation method interaction was most evident during later phases of the study and showed that plants generally grew slower under overhead irrigation compared to one or more subirrigation methods which agrees with earlier findings reported for rangpur lime barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi et al 2017b at week 14 shoot root and total biomass were greater at the ebb and flow 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold than under overhead irrigation when averaged over rootstock cultivar figs 5a c by week 18 root and total biomass were still lowest under overhead irrigation and were largest at one or more ebb and flow θ thresholds and on capillary mats plant height responded more consistently to irrigation method than other plant growth parameters at week 14 plants grown at ebb and flow 0 24 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds were taller than plants irrigated by capillary mats and overhead irrigation when averaged over rootstock cultivar fig 5d however by week 18 subirrigated plants regardless of method were approximately 22 taller than overhead irrigated plants our findings are especially important as plant height is often a primary growth parameter used by citrus nurseries when making liner transplanting decisions bataglia et al 2008 furlani et al 2009 stem diameter responded less consistently to irrigation method than plant height plants irrigated at the ebb and flow 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold had larger stem diameters than plants receiving overhead or capillary mat irrigation at week 10 and 14 respectively fig 5e however by week 18 all plants had similar stem diameter observations of faster plant growth rates under subirrigation methods relative to overhead irrigation were likely caused by higher substrate θ with subirrigation methods compared to overhead irrigation within ebb and flow methods we found that plant growth rates for all parameters under the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold were as great or greater than growth rates at 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds which runs counter to several previous studies that showed a positive relationship between substrate θ and plant growth for citrus as well as other species under nursery production ferrarezi et al 2015b 2017b nam et al 2020 van iersel et al 2010 these results point to the possibility that rootstock cultivars used in this study have relatively modest optimal water requirements during liner production this idea is generally supported by plant growth rates observed on capillary mats which in most cases were similar to growth rates under ebb and flow methods despite capillary mats having lower substrate θ throughout the study compared to values obtained when the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold was used the week rootstock cultivar effect on plant biomass parameters was most evident during the later stages of the study while plant height and stem diameter were affected during both early and later study stages averaged over irrigation method us 812 plants accumulated less shoot root and total biomass than at least one other cultivar at week 14 and were outperformed by at least four other cultivars by week 18 figs 6a c ufr 16 and us 802 plants were top performers in terms of shoot biomass accumulation and contained 20 41 more shoot biomass than other species by week 18 us 802 plants also accumulated 15 36 more root biomass than all other cultivars at this time fig 6c as with biomass accumulation us 802 was a top performer in terms of plant height with plants as tall or taller than those of other cultivars throughout the study when averaged over irrigation method fig 6d apart from its favorable growth characteristics us 802 has also been shown to produce a high percentage of true to type seedings bisi et al 2020 adding to its appeal as a cultivar for florida citrus nurseries this trend of us 802 as a top performer in terms of plant growth did not extend to stem diameter measures averaged over irrigation method kuharske plants had a larger stem diameter than at least three other cultivars for each sampling week fig 6e conversely us 812 and x 639 plants consistently had smaller stem diameters than three to five other cultivars depending on sampling week while the week rootstock cultivar interaction did not identify a single cultivar that was consistently superior to others for all growth parameters it did point to us 802 as having growth characteristics that were either superior or equal to other rootstock cultivars for most parameters us 802 plant height was greater than or equal to other cultivars throughout the study which is important because plant height is often used as criteria for transplanting liners into larger pots bataglia et al 2008 us 802 has also shown some tolerance to hlb in nursery and field studies albrecht and bowman 2012 albrecht et al 2012 contributing to its popularity with growers and making it a suitable selection for ebb and flow systems in florida citrus nurseries 3 4 substrate chemical properties substrate ph and ec were monitored because previous research has shown that use of subirrigation systems including ebb and flow and capillary mats can reduce substrate ph and increase ec relative to overhead irrigation dole et al 1994 klock moore and broschat 2001 morvant et al 1997 schuch et al 2008 lower ph and higher ec in substrate subjected to subirrigation compared to methods like overhead and drip irrigation has been attributed to the absence of or limited leaching events under subirrigation leading to salt accumulation and nh4 fertilizer induced substrate acidification richards and reed 2004 rouphael et al 2006 in this study we found that substrate ph and ec were driven by the week irrigation method interaction table 3 substrate ph was not consistently lower under all subirrigation methods relative to overhead irrigation during the sampling period averaged over rootstock cultivar substrate ph was only lower under one or two subirrigation methods relative to overhead irrigation for five of 10 sampling dates fig 7a subirrigation methods that caused substrate ph to decline on those five sampling dates varied by date and included ebb and flow 0 24 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds and capillary mats these results run counter to earlier findings by ferrarezi et al 2017a that showed a consistent inverse relationship between θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation and substrate ph in an automated ebb and flow system while irrigation method affected substrate ph on some sampling dates it is important to note that there were no visual symptoms of nutrient deficiency in plants during the study indicating the ph range 5 4 6 3 was conducive to nutrient availability under all irrigation methods substrate ec was affected by irrigation method on eight of 10 sampling dates but a consistent pattern of treatment effects was only detected from week 14 18 during this period substrate ec was generally highest with ebb and flow methods and lowest under overhead irrigation when averaged over rootstock cultivar fig 7b within ebb and flow methods substrate subjected to the 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold had ec values as high or higher than other θ thresholds from week 14 18 ferrarezi et al 2017a similarly reported a positive relationship between θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation and substrate ec in an automated sensor based ebb and flow system these results may have been caused by salt buildup with more frequent application of fs in the automated systems as substrate was occasionally washed in that study we did not wash substrate in our study so higher substrate ec in ebb and flow benches likely resulted from both frequent application of fs and the absence of leaching events in ebb and flow benches the relatively low substrate ec values observed under overhead irrigation during later stages of the study were likely due to low irrigation efficiency which reduced fs delivery to substrate while not measured in our study salvador et al 2016 found that overhead irrigation efficiency decreased from 81 during the first month of citrus liner growth to 36 during the final month as liner canopies intercepted and redirected large amounts of water away from substrate for eight of 10 sampling dates substrate ec on capillary mats was lower than one to all ebb and flow methods which was a reflection of modest substrate θ 0 30 0 35 m3 m 3 on capillary mats relative to that in ebb and flow benches 0 30 0 60 m3 m 3 throughout the sampling period despite differences in substrate ec under different irrigation methods there were no visual symptoms of osmotic stress in plants during the study indicating the range of ec values in the study did not hinder plant performance given the susceptibility of containerized substrate to salt accumulation when subirrigation is used in greenhouse settings consideration must be given to irrigation water quality when using ebb and flow systems to other citrus growing regions while ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a showed that infrequent substrate washing twice over 90 days was an effective strategy for limiting substrate salt accumulation in a brazilian citrus nursery regions with higher irrigation water salinity would likely require more frequent substrate washing which would increase production costs the large initial investment required to transition from overhead irrigation to an automated ebb and flow system is already cost prohibitive for some nurseries if frequent substrate rinsing is required to prevent salt accumulation these additional costs would further hinder adoption however the substantial water savings and enhanced plant growth provided by ebb and flow cannot be matched by overhead irrigation making this subirrigation system preferrable if water quality and financial resources are available 4 conclusions our hypothesis that automated ebb and flow subirrigation would conserve water and accelerate citrus liner growth relative to capillary mats and overhead irrigation was partially supported by results from this study all ebb and flow methods were successfully automated and used a fraction of the amount of water used by capillary mats and overhead irrigation capillary mats used larger amounts of water than overhead irrigation under both automated and time based irrigation methods under these experimental conditions plant growth was enhanced by one or more ebb and flow methods relative to other irrigation methods as early as 10 weeks after the study was initiated our results showed the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold used to trigger ebb and flow irrigation resulted in plant growth that was as great or greater than when 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds were used indicating the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold can be recommended for citrus liner production in automated ebb and flow systems while implementing automated ebb and flow subirrigation requires a large financial investment the water savings and potential to accelerate liner production with ebb and flow relative to overhead irrigation are important factors nurseries should consider when making management decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10242,most citrus nurseries in florida usa use overhead irrigation but subirrigation methods including ebb and flow and capillary mats have been shown to conserve water and accelerate plant growth relative to overhead irrigation for other nursery species and may be a viable alternative to overhead irrigation in citrus liner production the objectives of this study were to 1 automate an ebb and flow system for citrus liner production using capacitance sensors and 2 evaluate how subirrigation and overhead irrigation methods affect water use plant growth parameters and substrate chemical properties a study was conducted from 22 may to 23 september 2018 in which liners of six commercially important rootstock cultivars in cone shaped containers were subjected to one of the following irrigation methods ebb and flow triggered at substrate volumetric water contents θ of 0 24 0 36 or 0 48 m3 m 3 capillary mats and overhead irrigation capacitance sensors successfully monitored irrigation throughout the study ebb and flow benches used substantially less water 411 l than either capillary mats 13 098 l or overhead irrigation 3193 l by the end of the study rootstock cultivars propagated using subirrigation methods were approximately 22 taller with 7 more total biomass than plants subjected to overhead irrigation additionally plant growth at the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold used to trigger ebb and flow was as great or greater than growth at 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds during the final five weeks of the study substrate electrical conductivity was higher using subirrigation methods 0 84 1 3 ds m 1 than under overhead irrigation 0 55 0 8 ds m 1 but there were no symptoms of salt stress observed in plants at any time results from this study show that ebb and flow is a viable alternative to overhead irrigation and is superior to capillary mats for water conservation in automated ebb and flow systems in florida we recommend using the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold to produce the citrus rootstock cultivars used in this study with peat perlite substrate keywords citrus liners capacitance sensors rootstock cultivars subirrigation water conservation 1 introduction since the arrival of huanglongbing hlb or citrus greening in florida usa in 2005 citrus fruit yields have declined precipitously falling from 7 8 million metric tons in 2005 to 3 5 million metric tons in 2019 nass 2020 the pathogen associated with hlb candidatus liberibacter asiaticus clas is vectored by the asian citrus psyllid diaphorina citri which is present in all citrus growing regions of florida dewdney et al 2019 grower surveys have shown that 90 of the citrus production area in the state has been compromised by the disease singerman and useche 2016 depending on hlb severity and management practices both young and mature orchards can be rendered unproductive or killed within years bassanezi and bassanezi 2006 roistacher 1996 the prevalence of hlb in florida has forced growers to continuously replace unproductive or dead trees additionally new orchards are often planted at higher tree densities to optimize fruit yields during early years of production given the likelihood of hlb induced yield decline during later years spreen and zansler 2016 singerman et al 2018 these factors have led to a sharp increase in tree demand which has placed added pressure on nurseries to rapidly produce high quality rootstocks to graft new trees most citrus nurseries in florida use overhead irrigation methods characterized by low irrigation efficiency and excessive losses of fertilizer solution fs with potential to contaminate groundwater resources ferrarezi 2019 salvador et al 2016 an alternative to overhead irrigation is ebb and flow subirrigation which applies fs to the bottom of containers and as a closed system recirculates unused fs to a storage reservoir for later reuse ferrarezi et al 2015c the movement of fs through substrate by capillary action makes water and nutrients readily accessible to roots while subirrigation methods in florida citrus nurseries have not been previously investigated research from brazil has demonstrated that in addition to conserving water and nutrients relative to overhead irrigation subirrigation systems including ebb and flow can enhance plant growth rates in rangpur lime citrus limonia liners compared to overhead irrigation barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b although subirrigation can lead to salt accumulation in containers rouphael et al 2006 and potentially cause osmotic stress ferrarezi et al 2015c ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a showed that occasional substrate washing twice over 90 days in a brazilian citrus nursery that used an ebb and flow system was sufficient for producing rangpur lime liners superior in growth to liners grown under overhead irrigation there is a dire need to extend this subirrigation research from brazil to nursery conditions in florida testing a wider variety of citrus rootstock cultivars to accelerate the availability of high quality trees for transplanting under current hlb endemic conditions in the region ebb and flow systems can be automated with the use of capacitance sensors so that water is provided to plants based on demand rather than an arbitrary schedule when using capacitance sensors special consideration must be given to determining appropriate volumetric water content θ thresholds used to activate sensors previous greenhouse irrigation research using several different plant species including citrus and conducted in a wide variety of greenhouse environments around the world has shown that optimal θ threshold selection is species dependent and can have a major impact on plant growth net photosynthesis and total water and fertilizer use ferrarezi et al 2014 2015b ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b nam et al 2020 additionally low cost open source microcontrollers are available to automate ebb and flow systems across a range of θ thresholds in cases where capacitance sensors and accompanying software used to build and operate automated irrigation controllers are cost prohibitive ferrarezi et al 2015a coupling ebb and flow systems with capacitance sensor technology in florida citrus nurseries has the potential to accelerate production of high quality citrus rootstocks while drastically reducing nutrient and water losses compared to overhead irrigation while not widely used in citrus nurseries capillary mats have been used extensively to provide subirrigation in vegetable and ornamental nurseries capillary mats quickly absorb water and are placed under containers to provide plants with water via capillary action ferrarezi et al 2015b compared to overhead irrigation capillary mats can accelerate plant growth reduce fluctuations in substrate water content and enhance water and nutrient use efficiency for a wide variety of ornamental and vegetable species goodwin et al 2003 hoffman et al 1996 schuch et al 2008 direct comparisons of ebb and flow and capillary mats in ornamental nurseries have indicated that ebb and flow systems conserve more water produce less runoff and accumulate similar or greater amounts of biomass depending on species dole et al 1994 morvant et al 1997 1998 however recent advances in capillary mat technology have included the use of films lining the bottom of mats to reduce water losses caused by dripping ferrarezi et al 2015b capillary mats are also less expensive and easier to install than ebb and flow benches making their potential use in citrus nurseries worthy of investigation a wide variety of citrus rootstock cultivars are used by florida growers with cultivar selection depending on scion compatibility marketing soil physical and chemical properties tree size and spacing and disease and pest resistance albrecht et al 2019 castle et al 2019 while there are no rootstock cultivars currently available with true hlb tolerance trees planted on some rootstocks have been shown to produce economical fruit yields with favorable quality characteristics in hlb compromised orchards albrecht et al 2012 bowman et al 2016 however since subirrigation systems are not widely used in florida citrus nurseries there is a need to establish subirrigation guidelines for producing these and other widely used rootstock cultivars in the state building off earlier success implementing subirrigation methods in citrus liner production in brazil barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a 2017b the objectives of this study were to 1 automate an ebb and flow subirrigation system for citrus liner production using capacitance sensors and 2 evaluate how subirrigation and overhead irrigation methods affect water use plant growth parameters and substrate chemical properties we hypothesized that an automated ebb and flow system would conserve water and accelerate plant growth relative to capillary mats and overhead irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and experimental design a study was conducted from 22 may to 23 september 2018 at the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences uf ifas indian river

using sensors to measure temperature and humidity hmp 60 vaisala helsinki finland vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from saturated and actual vapor pressure using air temperature and relative humidity data average air temperature relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd during the study were 26 9 c 83 4 and 0 74 kpa respectively however air temperature rh and vpd ranged from 20 1 to 38 4 c 33 8 99 8 and 0 006 4 5 kpa respectively a factorial experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design r 4 with a split plot restriction on randomization where five levels of irrigation method were assigned to main plot units and six levels of rootstock cultivar to subplot units irrigation methods consisted of ebb and flow benches triggered at three θ thresholds 0 24 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 capillary mats and overhead irrigation the θ thresholds chosen for this study were used because previous research in citrus liner production indicated the 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold optimized plant growth while 0 24 and 0 36 m3 m 3 thresholds produced levels of plant growth acceptable for transplanting in a reasonable time frame bataglia et al 2008 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b since we tested several rootstock cultivars in our study we wanted to determine if lower θ thresholds could be used successfully to achieve optimal plant growth for the different cultivars while saving water rootstock cultivars included kuharske c sinensis poncirus trifoliata ufr 2 c clementina c paradisi c reticulata c grandis c reticulata p trifoliata ufr 16 c grandis c reticulata us 802 c

automated using capacitance sensors 10hs decagon devices pullman wa usa connected to a multiplexer am16 32b and data logger cr1000x both manufactured by campbell scientific logan ut usa irrigation was supplied to ebb and flow benches based on sensor readings by relay drivers sdm cd16ac campbell scientific connected to submersible pumps nk 2 little giant bluffton in usa placed in 121 l fs tanks rubbermaid sarasota springs ny usa located under greenhouse tables one tank per replication tanks were replenished weekly and covered to protect fs from ultraviolet radiation one sensor was randomly assigned to a container in each bench sensors were inserted vertically into the middle portion of substrate in containers as described previously by ferrarezi et al 2017b sensors were not inserted in the outer row of plants to avoid edge effects substrate water readings were taken every 30 min and averaged hourly when θ dropped below set thresholds submersible pumps in each tank were activated for 6 min drainage from benches occurred through a single outlet installed in each bench using a 19 mm diameter hose with a 6 4 mm reducer at the end to reduce flow and increase irrigation time capillary mats and overhead irrigation were automated as described above and activated at 0 36 m3 m 3 for the first seven weeks of the study however automated irrigation resulted in excessive fs losses because neither capillary mats nor overhead irrigation are closed systems therefore after seven weeks automated irrigation was discontinued for both capillary mats and overhead irrigation and was replaced by a daily irrigation schedule however capacitance sensors were left in containers for the remainder of the study to monitor θ from week eight to the end of the study capillary mats were irrigated daily at 10 00 a m and 3 00 p m for 6 min overhead irrigation scheduling was based on standard florida nursery practices for citrus liner production and was supplied daily at 9 00 a m for 3 min during this period overhead irrigation was supplied at 0 09 l m 2 min 1 from a single line of emitters ein dor melow equipped with an anti drip device mead both manufactured by dripworks willits ca usa located 0

disease control in citrus rootstock liner production 2 5 data collection substrate θ was monitored by the capacitance sensors and sensor readings were transformed from voltage to θ using an equation provided by the sensor manufacturer for potting mix θ i 7 05 10 7 voltage i 2 1 23 10 4 voltage i 3 03 10 2 where i refers to an individual sensor and voltage is measured in mv the number of irrigation events were monitored and recorded in ebb and flow benches by a counter in the automated irrigation system while 19 mm water flow meters spwm 075 ekm metering inc santa cruz ca usa connected to the datalogger recorded the volume of fs used for capillary mats and overhead irrigation this parameter reflected water loss due to evapotranspiration fertilizer solution tanks were sampled at weeks 15 and 18 to determine nutrient concentrations since fertilizers tend to concentrate in ebb and flow systems after a few months we chose these sampling weeks because plants were at their largest size and likely accumulating larger amounts of nutrients compared to earlier in the study steam distillation was used to determine nh4 n and no3 n inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for p k ca mg s cu fe mn and zn and the hot water method for b plant growth parameters shoot root and total biomass stem diameter and plant height were measured at 0 4 10 14 and 18 weeks after initiating the study from 10 randomly selected plants per replication shoots and roots were rinsed to remove debris and dried in an oven at 65 c until constant weight stem diameter was measured with a digital caliper and plant height with a regular ruler substrate was sampled weekly beginning at week nine to measure ph and electrical conductivity ec using methods described by cavins et al 2000 and revised by ferrarezi et al 2007 briefly five plants per replication were randomly selected and placed on a rack to leach substrate substrate was saturated and then 50 ml of distilled water was placed on the substrate surface to leach out 50 ml of solution into a collection tray the resulting solution was left for 30 min to allow substrate settling after which ph and ec were measured using a portable meter hi5522 hanna ann arbor mi usa 2 6 statistical analyses analysis of variance anova of a linear mixed effects model was conducted using lsmeans and nlme packages of r statistical software version 3 6 1 r development core team 2019 to assess all response variables prior to anova data were fit to diagnostic plots generated by plot lm and summary commands of r 3 6 1 to determine if model assumptions were met tests indicated that model assumptions were met for all response variables in the model irrigation method rootstock cultivar and week were treated as fixed effects while replication and replication interactions with main effects were treated as random effects for response variables that included repeated measures fs nutrient concentrations plant growth parameters and substrate ph and ec auto regressive moving average and first order autoregressive structures were tested in the model with model selection based on lowest akaike information criterion values pairwise comparisons for means of all response variables were made using tukey s honest significant difference hsd α 0 05 because of the large number of possible pairwise comparisons for plant growth parameters we showed comparisons by week in figures rather than between weeks because they were most biologically relevant additionally showing all possible pairwise comparisons would have made figures difficult to interpret 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation systems performance and water use capacitance sensors were generally successful in triggering irrigation at chosen substrate θ thresholds in ebb and flow benches however during the first two weeks of the study sensors set to the 0 36 m3 m 3 threshold triggered irrigation at 0 22 m3 m 3 fig 1 occasional inaccuracies in triggering irrigation using capacitance sensors is not unusual and has been reported elsewhere ferrarezi et al 2017b as the study progressed there was a gradual decline in substrate θ under overhead irrigation which was likely caused by lower irrigation efficiency as liner canopies grew larger with leaves intercepting and redirecting larger amounts of water away from substrate salvador et al 2016 for containers irrigated on capillary mats substrate θ was relatively constant through week seven of the study before increasing and reaching a new constant phase when automated irrigation ended and was replaced by a timing based schedule minimal fluctuation in θ is a defining feature of capillary mat irrigation caron et al 2005 geneve et al 2004 hoffman et al 1996 van iersel and nemali 2004 ebb and flow methods only used a fraction of the amount of water used by capillary mats and overhead irrigation fig 2a in ebb and flow benches the different substrate θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation did not affect total water use which was approximately 411 l there was nearly an eightfold increase in water use moving from ebb and flow methods to overhead irrigation however capillary mats consumed the largest amount of water totaling 13 098 l which was approximately 32 times the amount used by ebb and flow methods in addition to using a relatively small amount of water ebb and flow benches also recirculated a total of 108 906 122 541 l of water during the study fig 2b due to the large number of irrigation events that resulted from ebb and flow automation 5423 6102 relative to overhead irrigation 1117 and capillary mats 2054 fig 2c which were irrigated based on a timed schedule for over half the study the large water savings associated with ebb and flow methods compared to capillary mats and overhead irrigation underscore the potential of ebb and flow as a subirrigation method in water limited important citrus growing regions like california texas the mediterranean and southwest asia espinosa tasón et al 2020 jamshidi et al 2020 nass 2020 the large amount of water used by capillary mats was an unexpected outcome of this study while capillary mats were anticipated to use more water than ebb and flow methods we did not foresee capillary mat water use exceeding that of overhead irrigation these results were likely due to a combination of management and environmental factors as mentioned previously our attempts to automate capillary mat irrigation during the first seven weeks of the study resulted in substantial water use which amounted to 12 033 l or 91 of total water use by capillary mats during the study data not shown after transitioning from automated irrigation to a timed schedule capillary mat water use 1134 l declined substantially for the remainder of the study but still exceeded water use by ebb and flow methods 353 l and overhead irrigation 810 l during that time previous studies that have shown higher water use by capillary mats compared to overhead irrigation attributed these findings to large evaporative losses from capillary mat surfaces heightened by high air temperatures and light intensity dole et al 1994 morvant et al 1997 1998 semananda et al 2018 although capillary mats in our study were equipped with evaporation block layers and containment barriers to inhibit runoff we noticed large amounts of water on capillary mat surfaces and water accumulation near mats due to runoff considering the relatively high temperatures 20 1 38 4 c throughout the study evaporation was likely a major pathway of water loss from capillary mats our results indicate that capillary mats are not a suitable replacement for overhead irrigation in greenhouses without climate control however under cooler greenhouse conditions whether due to climate control or geographic location capillary mats could conceivably use less water than in this study 3 2 fertilizer solution nutrient concentrations fertilizer solution supplied to ebb and flow benches was evaluated at week 15 and 18 of the study to determine how chosen substrate θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation affected fs nutrient concentrations our results showed there was a week irrigation threshold interaction that affected fs inorganic n no3 n nh4 n concentrations table 1 at week 15 inorganic n concentrations were lower at the 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold compared to the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold however there were no irrigation threshold effects detected at week 18 fig 3 the main effect of irrigation threshold also impacted p mg and s concentrations averaged over week concentrations of these nutrients peaked at 0 24 m3 m 3 data not shown the nutrient concentrations in fs provide important information about nutrient availability for plant growth while optimal fs nutrient concentrations for the rootstock cultivars used in this study have not been determined bataglia et al 2008 reported maximum nutrient concentrations allowable for optimal rangpur lime liner production applying those concentrations to our study showed that all nutrients except p s and b had concentrations below these concentration limits additionally there were no visual symptoms of nutrient toxicities or deficiencies during the study indicating all nutrient concentrations satisfactorily met plant nutritional needs additional research should be undertaken to determine the fs nutrient concentrations required to optimize citrus liner growth in ebb and flow systems 3 3 plant growth parameters florida citrus nursery surveys indicate that three to six months are needed to produce citrus liners that are ready to transplant into larger pots vashisth et al 2020 while nurseries in other citrus growing regions like brazil often use established growth criteria to guide liner transplanting decisions bataglia et al 2008 furlani et al 2009 such criteria have not been established by uf ifas cooperative extension for florida citrus nurseries there is a need to conduct surveys among florida citrus nurseries to determine the growth criteria currently in use to guide liner transplanting decisions without this growth criteria information results from our study cannot be used to compare the effects that irrigation methods and rootstock cultivars have on the length of liner growth cycles however we can show how these factors impact liner growth rates within the timeframe used for liner production in florida citrus nurseries all plant growth parameters were affected by week irrigation method and week rootstock cultivar interactions however there was no week irrigation method rootstock cultivar interaction detected for any plant growth parameters table 2 representative plants for each treatment combination at the end of the study are presented in fig 4 the week irrigation method interaction was most evident during later phases of the study and showed that plants generally grew slower under overhead irrigation compared to one or more subirrigation methods which agrees with earlier findings reported for rangpur lime barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi et al 2017b at week 14 shoot root and total biomass were greater at the ebb and flow 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold than under overhead irrigation when averaged over rootstock cultivar figs 5a c by week 18 root and total biomass were still lowest under overhead irrigation and were largest at one or more ebb and flow θ thresholds and on capillary mats plant height responded more consistently to irrigation method than other plant growth parameters at week 14 plants grown at ebb and flow 0 24 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds were taller than plants irrigated by capillary mats and overhead irrigation when averaged over rootstock cultivar fig 5d however by week 18 subirrigated plants regardless of method were approximately 22 taller than overhead irrigated plants our findings are especially important as plant height is often a primary growth parameter used by citrus nurseries when making liner transplanting decisions bataglia et al 2008 furlani et al 2009 stem diameter responded less consistently to irrigation method than plant height plants irrigated at the ebb and flow 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold had larger stem diameters than plants receiving overhead or capillary mat irrigation at week 10 and 14 respectively fig 5e however by week 18 all plants had similar stem diameter observations of faster plant growth rates under subirrigation methods relative to overhead irrigation were likely caused by higher substrate θ with subirrigation methods compared to overhead irrigation within ebb and flow methods we found that plant growth rates for all parameters under the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold were as great or greater than growth rates at 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds which runs counter to several previous studies that showed a positive relationship between substrate θ and plant growth for citrus as well as other species under nursery production ferrarezi et al 2015b 2017b nam et al 2020 van iersel et al 2010 these results point to the possibility that rootstock cultivars used in this study have relatively modest optimal water requirements during liner production this idea is generally supported by plant growth rates observed on capillary mats which in most cases were similar to growth rates under ebb and flow methods despite capillary mats having lower substrate θ throughout the study compared to values obtained when the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold was used the week rootstock cultivar effect on plant biomass parameters was most evident during the later stages of the study while plant height and stem diameter were affected during both early and later study stages averaged over irrigation method us 812 plants accumulated less shoot root and total biomass than at least one other cultivar at week 14 and were outperformed by at least four other cultivars by week 18 figs 6a c ufr 16 and us 802 plants were top performers in terms of shoot biomass accumulation and contained 20 41 more shoot biomass than other species by week 18 us 802 plants also accumulated 15 36 more root biomass than all other cultivars at this time fig 6c as with biomass accumulation us 802 was a top performer in terms of plant height with plants as tall or taller than those of other cultivars throughout the study when averaged over irrigation method fig 6d apart from its favorable growth characteristics us 802 has also been shown to produce a high percentage of true to type seedings bisi et al 2020 adding to its appeal as a cultivar for florida citrus nurseries this trend of us 802 as a top performer in terms of plant growth did not extend to stem diameter measures averaged over irrigation method kuharske plants had a larger stem diameter than at least three other cultivars for each sampling week fig 6e conversely us 812 and x 639 plants consistently had smaller stem diameters than three to five other cultivars depending on sampling week while the week rootstock cultivar interaction did not identify a single cultivar that was consistently superior to others for all growth parameters it did point to us 802 as having growth characteristics that were either superior or equal to other rootstock cultivars for most parameters us 802 plant height was greater than or equal to other cultivars throughout the study which is important because plant height is often used as criteria for transplanting liners into larger pots bataglia et al 2008 us 802 has also shown some tolerance to hlb in nursery and field studies albrecht and bowman 2012 albrecht et al 2012 contributing to its popularity with growers and making it a suitable selection for ebb and flow systems in florida citrus nurseries 3 4 substrate chemical properties substrate ph and ec were monitored because previous research has shown that use of subirrigation systems including ebb and flow and capillary mats can reduce substrate ph and increase ec relative to overhead irrigation dole et al 1994 klock moore and broschat 2001 morvant et al 1997 schuch et al 2008 lower ph and higher ec in substrate subjected to subirrigation compared to methods like overhead and drip irrigation has been attributed to the absence of or limited leaching events under subirrigation leading to salt accumulation and nh4 fertilizer induced substrate acidification richards and reed 2004 rouphael et al 2006 in this study we found that substrate ph and ec were driven by the week irrigation method interaction table 3 substrate ph was not consistently lower under all subirrigation methods relative to overhead irrigation during the sampling period averaged over rootstock cultivar substrate ph was only lower under one or two subirrigation methods relative to overhead irrigation for five of 10 sampling dates fig 7a subirrigation methods that caused substrate ph to decline on those five sampling dates varied by date and included ebb and flow 0 24 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds and capillary mats these results run counter to earlier findings by ferrarezi et al 2017a that showed a consistent inverse relationship between θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation and substrate ph in an automated ebb and flow system while irrigation method affected substrate ph on some sampling dates it is important to note that there were no visual symptoms of nutrient deficiency in plants during the study indicating the ph range 5 4 6 3 was conducive to nutrient availability under all irrigation methods substrate ec was affected by irrigation method on eight of 10 sampling dates but a consistent pattern of treatment effects was only detected from week 14 18 during this period substrate ec was generally highest with ebb and flow methods and lowest under overhead irrigation when averaged over rootstock cultivar fig 7b within ebb and flow methods substrate subjected to the 0 48 m3 m 3 threshold had ec values as high or higher than other θ thresholds from week 14 18 ferrarezi et al 2017a similarly reported a positive relationship between θ thresholds used to trigger irrigation and substrate ec in an automated sensor based ebb and flow system these results may have been caused by salt buildup with more frequent application of fs in the automated systems as substrate was occasionally washed in that study we did not wash substrate in our study so higher substrate ec in ebb and flow benches likely resulted from both frequent application of fs and the absence of leaching events in ebb and flow benches the relatively low substrate ec values observed under overhead irrigation during later stages of the study were likely due to low irrigation efficiency which reduced fs delivery to substrate while not measured in our study salvador et al 2016 found that overhead irrigation efficiency decreased from 81 during the first month of citrus liner growth to 36 during the final month as liner canopies intercepted and redirected large amounts of water away from substrate for eight of 10 sampling dates substrate ec on capillary mats was lower than one to all ebb and flow methods which was a reflection of modest substrate θ 0 30 0 35 m3 m 3 on capillary mats relative to that in ebb and flow benches 0 30 0 60 m3 m 3 throughout the sampling period despite differences in substrate ec under different irrigation methods there were no visual symptoms of osmotic stress in plants during the study indicating the range of ec values in the study did not hinder plant performance given the susceptibility of containerized substrate to salt accumulation when subirrigation is used in greenhouse settings consideration must be given to irrigation water quality when using ebb and flow systems to other citrus growing regions while ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a showed that infrequent substrate washing twice over 90 days was an effective strategy for limiting substrate salt accumulation in a brazilian citrus nursery regions with higher irrigation water salinity would likely require more frequent substrate washing which would increase production costs the large initial investment required to transition from overhead irrigation to an automated ebb and flow system is already cost prohibitive for some nurseries if frequent substrate rinsing is required to prevent salt accumulation these additional costs would further hinder adoption however the substantial water savings and enhanced plant growth provided by ebb and flow cannot be matched by overhead irrigation making this subirrigation system preferrable if water quality and financial resources are available 4 conclusions our hypothesis that automated ebb and flow subirrigation would conserve water and accelerate citrus liner growth relative to capillary mats and overhead irrigation was partially supported by results from this study all ebb and flow methods were successfully automated and used a fraction of the amount of water used by capillary mats and overhead irrigation capillary mats used larger amounts of water than overhead irrigation under both automated and time based irrigation methods under these experimental conditions plant growth was enhanced by one or more ebb and flow methods relative to other irrigation methods as early as 10 weeks after the study was initiated our results showed the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold used to trigger ebb and flow irrigation resulted in plant growth that was as great or greater than when 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 thresholds were used indicating the 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold can be recommended for citrus liner production in automated ebb and flow systems while implementing automated ebb and flow subirrigation requires a large financial investment the water savings and potential to accelerate liner production with ebb and flow relative to overhead irrigation are important factors nurseries should consider when making management decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

fruit and product quality 2 nature of water deficits the effect of irrigation strategies on trees may differ depending on the timing and level of the water deficit applied the duration thereof the climatic conditions of the area and the drought tolerance of the crop via avoidance and tolerance mechanisms although the extent of the root system plays an important role in the drought tolerance of a crop inherent physiological traits of plants also determine their response to water deficits and productivity under limited water supply pinheiro et al 2005 deficit irrigation di is the application of irrigation below crop evapotranspiration etc requirements with the goal to optimise economic income with limited water fereres and soriano 2007 sustained deficit irrigation sdi entails the uniform application of a reduced proportion of the irrigation requirements throughout the season which results in the gradual development of water deficit as the season progresses fereres and soriano 2007 galindo et al 2018 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is an irrigation strategy based on a reduction of irrigation amounts only during drought tolerant plant phenological stages with full irrigation requirements being applied during drought sensitive phenological stages resulting in minimal no negative impacts on yield and crop income and having the potential to improve harvest quality galindo et al and references therein 2018 partial rootzone drying prd involves irrigating only one part of the root zone per irrigation event leaving the other part to dry to a specific soil water content before

deficit related stress indicators ayars et al 2017 buesa et al 2012 bugueño et al 2016 hepaksoy et al 2016 intrigliolo et al 2013 parvizi et al 2016 the use of eto or estimated etc as sole reference base to induce different di treatments contribute to the large variability and incompatibility of research results between different orchards since the magnitude of the deficit induced even for orchards of similar properties depend on the variation in eto also lack of actual soil water deficit information complicates comparison of stress levels induced in different studies galindo et al 2018 stressed amongst other key constraints for application of rdi the requirement for new and more precise criteria for defining water deficit for a range of different growing conditions species weather soil depth fruit load and rootstock 3 physiology apart from the research of rodrίguez et al 2012 and galindo et al 2014b on the cv mollar de elche there is a lack of information on leaf water relations of different pomegranate cultivars that mechanistically explain the leaf level response of trees to water deficits pomegranate trees are considered drought resistant and under water deficit conditions trees decrease stomatal conductance to control water loss via transpiration to avoid leaf turgor loss parvizi et al 2016 rodrίguez et al 2012 in addition in response to severe long term stress i e water withheld for up to four weeks active osmotic adjustment occurred in leaves of the cv mollar de elche enabling it to maintain turgor rodrίguez et al 2012 drought tolerance characteristics of leaves such as high apoplastic water content 42 to 58 may furthermore aid in retention of water at low leaf water potentials at turgor loss point mollar de elche leaves had osmotic potential of between 2 49 and 3 27 mpa and still a relatively high relative water content on average c 84 no elastic adjustment occurred in these leaves as a result of water stress fruit peel osmotic potential increased whereas that of arils was not affected by water deficits galindo et al 2014b fruit peel turgor loss occurred at a fruit water potential of 2 25 mpa estimated midday stem water potential ψs of 1 95 mpa and aril turgor loss at a fruit water potential of 2 69 mpa estimated midday ψs of 2 46 mpa fruit turgor loss for a period of more than six days during the end of fruit growth and ripening resulted in decreased marketable yield and fruit size despite compensative fruit growth that occurred after a rainfall event leaf water potential predawn and during the day as well as ψ s are frequently used in irrigation research to indicate the water status of fruit trees and vines crop and even cultivar specific thresholds for these indicators are linked to degrees of water constraints that impacts crop physiology and fruit quality to a lesser or more severe extent garcía tejero and zuazo 2018 myburgh 2018 since the minimum ψs midday incorporates the effects of the atmospheric demand as well as the soil water on the tree ebel et al 2001 it is frequently used commercially to schedule irrigation of woody crops itrigliolo et al 2011a though based on signal intensity considered mollar de elche photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to be more sensitive indicators of water deficits than midday ψs in addition to soil water content the ψs is also affected by irrigation water salinity climate variables and crop load stem water potential of the cv rabab decreased with increased evaporative demand as the season progressed as well as with increasing soil water deficit parvizi et al 2016 different slopes of linear regression relationships between midday ψs and soil water deficit were ascribed to the effects of higher crop load and differences in mean air temperature in contrast no significant relationship was found between cv mollar de elche ψs and soil water content in the root zone up to 0 5 m depth intrigliolo et al 2013 in this case the linear regression relationships between midday ψs and midday vapour pressure deficit in different seasons was affected by irrigation water salinity whereas increased crop load also decreased ψs the abovementioned factors most likely contributed to the variation apparent in seasonal minimum midday ψs ψsm and the associated stomatal conductance gs for several di research studies fig 1 for mollar de elche in spain in well watered control treatments gs associated with ψsm of between 0 9 and 1 6 mpa ranged between 400 and 220 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 1a galindo et al 2013 martínez nícolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 the gs was lower under iranian conditions for rabab and shavar the maximum being 41 and 105 mmol m 2 s 1 at a ψsm of 2 6 and 1 2 mpa respectively fig 1a parvizi et al 2016 selahvarzi et al 2017 parvizi et al 2016 attributed the low ψs values of rabab trees irrigated at 100 etc compared to values of about 1 1 mpa for mollar de elche irrigated at 105 eto galindo

parvizi et al 2016 whereas mollar de elche was irrigated daily galindo et al 2013 or during summer for six to seven days per week intrigliolo et al 2013 in california relatively low mean predawn and midday ψs of 0 8 and 2 4 mpa were also measured during fruit development in summer using shoots of four pomegranate cultivars irrigated three times per week chater et al 2018 in this case there was a time delay between pruning of the shoots placed in plastic bags and measurement of ψs mean maximum temperatures reported for california in august 35 6 c were comparable to the 35 9 c reported for the rabab growing season in iran parvizi et al 2016 mean stomatal conductance of the four cultivars over two seasons ranged between 100 and 180 mmol m 2 s 1 in the morning and decreased to between 40 and 70 mmol m 2 s 1 in the afternoon chater et al 2018 in general in fig 1a gs of mollar de elche trees which received no irrigation for different periods before harvest fig 1a me5 galindo et al 2014b was higher at lower ψsm between 2 9 and 3 64 mpa compared to that of studies on the same cultivar where rdi or sdi treatments were applied galindo et al 2013 martínez nícolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 although these differences may be partially attributed to site specific effects of climate crop load and irrigation water salinity it is possible that plant water deficits develop physiologically differently when water is withheld completely for a continuous period compared to where the crop is preconditioned for water deficits i e where less than the crop water demand is applied daily or periodically the ψsm in deficit irrigated di rdi sdi mollar de elche ranged between 1 55 and 2 6 mpa whereas in shavar it reached 1 5 to 2 8 mpa tables 1 2 fig 1a for wonderful trees withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set reduced the ψsm to 1 7 and 1 68 mpa during two consecutive seasons martínez nícolás et al 2019 for rabab subjected over two seasons to various prd and di treatments the ψsm varied between 2 65 and 3 28 mpa fig 1a b parvizi et al 2016 the gs of rabab reduced linearly with decreasing ψs and according to parvizi et al 2016 non linearly with increasing vapour pressure deficit until 7 kpa after which it dropped sharply in response to further increases in vapour pressure deficit with two exceptions tables 1 2 galindo et al 2014a selahvarzi et al 2017 second season the lowest seasonal gs for the rdi and sdi treatments coincided with the ψsm galindo et al 2013 2014b martínez nícolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 selahvarzi et al 2017 first season according to a linear regression relationship between relative gs and ψsm for mollar de elche shavar and wonderful data combined fig 1b relative gs decreased by 29 and 55 at ψsm values of 1 5 mpa and 2 mpa respectively under the specific experimental conditions where water was withheld for different periods once off before harvest galindo et al 2014b fig 1a b me5 the relative gs of mollar de elche trees decreased at a lower rate compared to where rdi or sdi was practiced galindo et al 2013 martínez nícolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 for the cv rabab data of two seasons combined indicated that gs decreased at a similar rate to that of mollar de elche shavar and wonderful subjected to rdi sdi even though the range of ψsm hardly overlapped fig 1b several di studies ranked the degree of water stress that the trees were subjected to according to the stomatal response tables 1 2 in general a relative reduction in midday gs of between 19 and 36 was considered mild moderate whereas a decrease of between 53 and 77 was considered to be severe table 3 a moderate water deficit of 1 55 mpa during the second half of linear fruit growth was considered sufficient to affect yield final fruit size and fruit quality characteristics of mollar de elche mellisho et al 2012 classification according to galindo et al 2014b and parvizi et al 2016 did not compare with that of the other studies and was excluded from table 3 galindo et al 2014b classed mollar de elche midday ψs of 2 9 3 2 and lower than 3 5 mpa as mild severe and very severe water stress table 1 parvizi et al 2016 described water deficits at the end of fruit growth stage with ψsm table 2 of between 2 65 to 3 03 mpa as mild trees irrigated at 75 etc and between 3 13 and 3 28 mpa as severe trees irrigated at 50 etc however ψs of the cv rabab trees irrigated every four days at 100 etc 6 drippers per tree and 75 etc prd irrigation on alternate sides of the tree 3 drippers per tree was more or less comparable in both seasons whereas in the 75 and 50 etc di irrigation on one side of the tree 3 drippers per tree and 50 etc prd treatments it was notably lower compared to the aforementioned two treatments after about 80 days from bud burst parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 pomegranate cultivars differ in their ability to control their water status under water deficit conditions ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 pourghayoumi et al 2017a b the leaf relative water content of shishehgap decreased at a greater rate than that of rabab leaves with increasing water stress up to 25 of field capacity ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 at 50 of field capacity the relative water content of leaves of shishehgap was c 30 less than in the control while this reduction was only 12 5 in rabab enhanced control of plant water status in rabab is attributed to a stronger antioxidant system able to tolerate drought related oxidative stress and more effective accumulation of soluble carbohydrates for osmotic adjustment ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 midday ψs of several commercial iranian cultivars subjected to 14 days of drought in a greenhouse study decreased to values of between 5 35 and 6 63 mpa with that of the control ranging between 1 2 and 1 8 mpa pourghayoumi et al 2017a the most drought tolerant cultivar had higher leaf relative water content ψs and intrinsic water use efficiency iwue or ratio of net photosynthesis an to gs and greater ability for osmotic adjustment compared to the other cultivars pourghayoumi et al 2017b found clear differences in metabolite contents and antioxidant enzyme activity among the cultivars differing in drought tolerance cultivars also differed with regard to the ability to recover physiologically after rehydration pourghayoumi et al 2017a b more research regarding the mechanism allowing fast recovery after rehydration and prevention of photo inhibitory damage in plants subjected to drought stress are needed catola et al 2016 rabab trees subjected to prd irrigation strategies had significantly higher ψs compared to those in corresponding di strategies fig 1b parvizi et al 2016 irrigation at 50 etc reduced ψs significantly compared to the 75 and or 100 etc treatments about three months after bud break applying severe water stress i e 50 etc with prd and di strategies affected gas exchange parameters significantly compared to full irrigation and mild water stress parvizi et al 2016 partial root zone drying strategies had higher leaf water use efficiency transpiration efficiency or an tr than di due to higher net photosynthesis at comparable transpiration rates tr transpiration efficiency increased by increasing the level of water stress i e from irrigating at 75 etc to 50 etc the fully irrigated trees had lower iwue compared to the other irrigation strategies with no notable differences in iwue for prd and di strategies in both levels of water stress in greece the prd strategy applied by noitsakis et al 2016 differed from that utilized by parvizi et al 2016 in iran applying 100 etc to one side of the root zone instead of to the whole root zone increased predawn leaf water potential of wonderful pomegranate trees on several occasions significantly noitsakis et al 2016 irrigation applied at 50 etc to one side of the root zone significantly decreased predawn leaf water potential after the first month of treatment and for the remainder of the season compared to the control and 100 etc prd treatment decreasing beyond 0 5 mpa at some stage table 2 during this period stomatal conductance transpiration and to a lesser degree photosynthesis rate decreased significantly with a decrease in the volume of irrigation water applied and with a smaller area of application i e one side of root zone vs full root zone noitsakis et al 2016 attributed lower stomatal conductance despite higher predawn leaf water potential values in the 100 etc prd treatment compared to the control to chemical signals involved in stomatal regulation the authors hypothesized that in the absence of drought or under mild drought conditions the primary signal controlling stomatal conductance are root chemical signals whereas under intense drought conditions tree water status plays a more important role this is in direct contrast to rodrίguez et al 2012 who considered the process to operate vice versa in this regard parvizi et al 2016 hypothesized that the pomegranate tree response to water stress is mainly based on environmental conditions so that in arid conditions with high vapour pressure deficit their study hydraulic i e turgor related signalling contributed to stomatal control but in humid conditions with low vapour pressure deficit intrigliolo et al 2011a non hydraulic chemical signalling possibly occurred in this regard diaz espejo et al 2018 attributed poor effectivity of prd as an irrigation strategy in practice to the assumption that root to shoot abscisic acid signalling controls the stomatal response to water stress whereas more recent research indicated that shoot to root rather than root to shoot signalling of abscisic acid may regulate stomatal conductance more research is required for pomegranate regarding the physiological response mechanisms employed under water stress and the associated crop performance 4 phenological development in egypt during two consecutive seasons increasing irrigation application to 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees from 280 to 600 mm per season resulted in 24 to 34 more flowers per shoot c 10 more fruit set and 8 6 less fruit drop khattab et al 2011 in spain mild water stress ψs less than 1 4 mpa applied early in the season through rdi 25 etc during flowering fruit set and early fruit growth 100 etc during remainder of season and sdi 50 etc throughout the season decreased drop of fruit and flowers of mollar de elche trees intrigliolo et al 2013 in another study no irrigation during flowering and fruit set in two consecutive seasons decreased midday ψs for seven year old mollar de elche trees to 1 58 and 1 67 mpa and for the cv wonderful to 1 7 and 1 68 mpa martínez nícolás et al 2019 the rdi no irrigation until the end of fruit set 115 etc for the remainder of season compared to irrigation applied at 115 etc throughout the season increased the number of flowers per tree for molar de elche and wonderful trees in the first season by c 163 and 32 respectively and in the second season by 39 and 65 respectively in iran rdi no irrigation until the end of fruit set 100 etc for the remainder of the season applied to seven year old shavar pomegranate trees in two consecutive seasons resulted in minimum ψs values of c 1 5 and c 1 8 mpa near the end of fruit set selahvarzi et al 2017 the rdi decreased the number of lateral flowers on average over two seasons by c 38 compared to where irrigation was applied at 100 etc and increased fruit set on the lateral flowers compared to the 100 etc and sdi 50 etc throughout the season treatments in addition the rdi treatment shortened the flowering period compared to that of fully watered and sdi trees by c 42 and 49 respectively the rdi may have delayed the first and advanced the second and third flowering waves by inducing earlier completion of current year shoot growth or modified plant hormonal balance which promoted earlier flowering in the first season the trees subjected to sdi had a comparable number of lateral flowers and fruit set to the 100 etc trees however in the second season the lateral flowers decreased by 17 and fruit set by c 37 compared to the well watered trees at the end of fruit set the sdi trees had less water stress compared to the rdi trees but later in the season reached minimum midday ψs of c 2 1 mpa and c 2 8 mpa in the two respective seasons sustained deficit irrigation treatments with its longer duration affect not only current season production but also fruit bud development for the following season the degree of impact is determined by the severity of the water deficit that develops during the season additional research is needed to determine the effect of water stress timing degree duration on bud differentiation and fruit set of pomegranate trees 5 vegetative growth water deficits of 40 or more of fully watered status field capacity decreased vegetative growth of one year old potted pomegranate plants grown in greenhouses relative to fully watered controls xie et al 2015 ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 soil water depletion of two litre pots to 60 40 and 20 of fully watered status reduced chinese pomegranate seedling height of 897 mm by between 13 and 43 stem diameter of 14 6 mm by between 22 and 46 and shoot dry weight by between 16 to 57 xie et al 2015 root dry weight tended to increase by between 10 and 25 whereas the root shoot ratio increased significantly from 0 16 in the control plants to values of 0 26 and 0 47 in plants at 40 and 20 water content respectively drought tolerance diversity of pomegranate cultivars may be attributed to differences in sensitivity to water stress at biochemical level which affect the water status and growth ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 in iran irrigating pomegranate trees at 50 and 25 of field capacity fc reduced new shoot growth relative to the 100 fc treatment for the cv shishehgap by 21 and 50 respectively and for the less sensitive cv rabbab by only 4 and 23 for the respective treatments the water deficit at 25 fc also induced less severe leaf necrosis and leaf drop in rabbab compared to shishehgap leaf relative water content of rabbab compared to shishehgap decreased less as leaves had a stronger antioxidant system and accumulated more soluble carbohydrates allowing it to withstand more water stress in chile where only 30 etc was applied to newly planted pomegranate trees cv wonderful in a sandy loam soil water deficits reduced canopy volume trunk growth rate and trunk cumulative growth compared to where 100 and or 130 etc was applied during the second season bugueño et al 2016 trees receiving 70 etc tended to have lower canopy volume and trunk cumulative growth compared to trees where 130 etc was applied indicating the onset of some plant stress in young trees trunk growth rate was a more sensitive indicator of water deficits than maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds and a 33 decrease in optimal trunk growth rate was considered to indicate suboptimal growth stressed conditions for young wonderful pomegranate plants bugueño et al 2016 in spain mds is accepted as a more suitable water stress indicator for full bearing pomegranate trees intrigliolo et al 2011b galindo et al 2013 the mds of full bearing mollar de elche trees generally increased in response to water stress with increasingly negative ψs intrigliolo et al 2011b galindo et al 2013 however more research in this regard is needed as statistically significant different regression relationships between mds and ψs applied earlier and later in fruit development and after fruit removal intrigliolo et al 2011b whereas galindo et al 2013 found a sharp decrease in mds below a threshold ψs of 1 67 mpa with regard to young bearing pomegranate trees there appears to be a balance between plant available water and the competition for assimilates between different types of vegetative growth and yield in india yield of three year old cv ganesh increased with increasing area per leaf fig 2 a but both area per leaf and yield decreased when plant height exceeded c 179 cm in treatments which replaced more than 40 of evaporated water fig 2b afria et al 1998 for every 10 cm increase in plant height beyond 179 cm the estimated leaf area decrease was c 4 and the yield loss 10 8 a higher irrigation regime for three year old orchards may therefore rather promote tree structure development than leaf photosynthetic capacity and yield whereas drier conditions may secure a first harvest but restrict tree growth however yield of a four year old cv bhagwa high density planting subjected to different degrees of water deficit for one season decreased linearly with tree height and leaf area index haneef et al 2014 drip irrigating the plants on alternate days at 75 and 50 of the crop water requirement reduced tree height by c 8 and 13 plant spread by c 9 and 14 and leaf area index by c 14 and 28 respectively relative to where 100 of the water requirement was applied in this case the detrimental effect of water deficits on vegetative growth was reflected directly in the yield response regulated deficit irrigation is used as a tool in high density fruit orchards to limit excessive vegetative growth chalmers et al 1984 in spain no irrigation during flowering and fruit set compared to daily irrigation at 115 etc for two consecutive seasons decreased total shoot growth for seven year old mollar de elche trees by 46 and 49 respectively martínez nícolás et al 2019 the shoot growth of wonderful trees of similar age appeared to be less sensitive to water deficits since total shoot growth decreased only by 6 and 37 for the two seasons the midday ψs for the two cultivars reached seasonal minimum values near the end of flowering and fruit set and ranged between 1 58 and 1 7 mpa in iran withholding irrigation of 7 year old cv shahvar trees from the beginning of the growing season until the end of the fruit set stage rdi over two seasons delayed initial vegetative growth by c 10 days and reduced growth rate compared to trees irrigated at 100 etc selahvarzi et al 2017 the rdi decreased midday ψs during this period to c 1 5 and c 1 8 mpa in the two respective seasons whereas midday ψs of the fully irrigated trees remained between 0 3 and 1 2 mpa the final shoot length of trees subjected to rdi during fruit set compared to the control dropped by 31 7 and 12 6 in the first and second season respectively for trees irrigated at 50 etc throughout the season sdi shoot elongation was similar to that of the well watered control in the first growing season for about the first two months during this period the sdi midday ψs was mostly above c 1 mpa with a minimum of c 1 3 mpa selahvarzi et al 2017 the shoot elongation rate decreased during the last month with midday ψs during this period decreasing to c 1 5 and even beyond 2 mpa poorer growth of sdi shoots compared to that of the 100 etc treatment from the beginning of the second season may partially be due to significant water status differences of the trees the midday ψs in the well watered trees was above 1 mpa for the greatest part of the shoot growth period until end fruit set whereas that of the sdi trees was generally below 1 mpa also in iran applying 50 etc via prd or di decreased leaf area index of nine year old cv rabab by 22 on average compared to trees where 100 etc or 75 etc prd or di was applied parvizi et al 2016 the leaf area index tended to be higher in the prd compared to the di strategies but it was not significantly higher leaf senescence of deficit irrigated trees started earlier compared to that of fully and prd irrigated trees the water deficit related reduction in vegetative growth in two consecutive seasons impacted yield which decreased linearly with leaf area index measured at 134 and 135 days after bud break in the two respective seasons parvizi et al 2016 the positive effect of irrigation on pomegranate vegetative growth was confirmed during two seasons in egypt where new shoot length leaf number per shoot and area per leaf of 5 5 m spaced 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees n 3 ten shoots per tree increased as irrigation water applied in sandy soil per season increased from 280 mm 7 m3 per tree to 600 mm 15 m3 per tree khattab et al 2011 linear regression relationships using data of two consecutive seasons combined indicated that yield increased with longer shoots more leaves per shoot and greater area per leaf fig 3 a c under the experimental conditions for the specific cultivar yield increased by 1 t ha 1 per cm increase in shoot length 1 6 t ha 1 for each additional leaf per shoot and 4 3 t ha 1 per cm2 increase in area per leaf different relationships between yield and area per leaf for young ganesh and mature manfalouty trees may be due to the effect of cultivar age and or crop management differences on leaf size figs 2a and 3c it should be noted that pomegranate is sensitive to continuous overly wet waterlogged soil conditions which lead to root rot and fungal diseases hepaksoy et al 2016 jamadar et al 2011 excessive irrigation of pomegranates should therefore be avoided and special attention be given to irrigation management especially in dense and poorly drained soils water deficits applied over several seasons can depending on the degree and duration thereof have a cumulative effect on canopy development and in the long term affect orchard productivity in california di of the cv wonderful at 35 and 50 etc in the first season only tended to decrease the canopy size by 13 relative to the 75 and 100 etc treatments zhang et al 2017 in the second and third year of di fourth and fifth growing seasons though the trees under severe medium stress were significantly smaller having 19 less canopy cover than those fully irrigated or under mild stress likewise in turkey the canopy volume of six year old hicaznar trees subjected to sdi at 50 ep decreased progressively during three subsequent seasons canopy volume was reduced by 8 3 and 9 4 10 9 and 11 8 and 14 and 14 9 respectively compared to where 100 or 125 ep was replaced respectively dinc et al 2018 the canopies of trees irrigated at sdi of 75 ep became significantly smaller compared to the well watered trees only from the second season onwards but the size difference c 10 7 remained similar over subsequent seasons increasing the irrigation interval from three to six days decreased canopy volume in the first season of sdi by c 16 but the effect was much less 5 in the second and third seasons although significant the total trunk cross sectional area of the 75 ep and 50 ep trees compared to that of trees irrigated at 100 or 125 ep tended to be significantly less only from the second season onwards total trunk cross sectional area appears to be a coarser indicator of water deficit than canopy volume since it was also not affected by irrigation interval in contrast in spain during a three year experimental period the sdi treatment 50 etc reduced trunk growth of mature mollar de elche trees by 26 compared to control trees irrigated at 100 etc intrigliolo et al 2013 in the first and second season of di canopy volume was reduced only in the sdi treatment compared to the control whereas in the third season rdi treatments 25 etc applied during flowering and fruit set and ripening respectively had a significant reduction in canopy volume compared with control trees the canopy volume reduction compared to the control was in the third year more pronounced in the sdi trees up to 30 than in the rdi treatments 6 fruit growth pomegranate fruit is a fleshy berry holland et al 2009 and the fruit growth pattern can differ between cultivars from linear to sigmoidal al yahyai et al 2009 intrigliolo et al 2012 shulman et al 1984 the length of the periods for young fruit development growth and ripening also varies among cultivars melgarejo et al 1997 parvizi et al 2016 of the publications on di sourced for this review only galindo et al 2018 for mollar de elche in spain included information on seasonal shoot and fruit growth of pomegranate if rdi is to be used as a water saving and fruit quality manipulation tool such information is critical for decision making at least for the most important cultivars in different countries the absolute fruit growth rate of mollar de elche during linear fruit growth and harvest ranged between 0 25 and 0 6 mm d 1 intrigliolo et al 2013 growth rates of fruit subjected to 25 etc rdi during linear fruit growth only reduced significantly during the middle of the di period compared to that of the 100 etc treatment and compensatory fruit growth was absent when full irrigation was restored for the same cultivar mellisho et al 2012 found that fruit of trees subjected to no irrigation during the second half of linear fruit growth did not display compensatory fruit growth after irrigation resulting in smaller fruit compared to that of well watered trees at harvest galindo et al 2014b however did report some compensatory fruit growth in response to rainfall following a period of withholding irrigation before harvest according to parvizi et al 2016 applying severe water stress i e irrigation at 50 etc with both prd and di strategies reduced fruit growth rate compared to trees irrigated at 100 etc or 75 etc prd or di strategies but only until 190 days after bud break after which fruit growth rate did not differ between treatments until harvest 7 yield yield of pomegranate trees of various cultivars growing in different countries increased linearly per tree from 19 9 to 93 9 kg per tree and per hectare from 14 2 to 52 t ha 1 as the total amount of precipitation and irrigation water applied increased from 200 to 1214 mm per season year fig 4 a b yield per tree and per hectare increased by c 6 1 kg per tree or c 2 9 t ha 1 respectively for each 100 mm irrigation water and precipitation added multiple linear regression of yield with irrigation and precipitation entered as separate variables data not shown improved the coefficient of determination of the yield estimates per tree radj 2 76 43 p 0 0001 and per hectare radj 2 55 37 p 0 0001 precipitation had no significant effect on variability of yield per hectare and accounted for a mere 2 1 of the variability in yield per tree the balance being due to differences in irrigation applied in the various research experiments yield per hectare increased linearly with etc whereas the relative yield response to etc was non linear fig 5 a b maximum relative yield was achieved for pomegranate orchards where seasonal annual etc ranged between 721 mm and 952 5 mm with relative yield decreasing non linearly with etc below an etc of 721 mm there was no simple relationship between yield which ranged between 14 2 and 47 t ha 1 and ψsm with values of between 0 99 and 3 64 mpa fig 6 the water potential dataset of the majority of authors included the cultivars mollar de elche shavar and wonderful and ranged from 0 9 to 2 8 mpa with a general decreasing trend in yield as ψsm decreased in the case of galindo et al 2014b and parvizi et al 2016 maximum yield for mollar de elche and rabab realised at lower ψsm and the combined data set ranged except for one value of 1 6 mpa from 2 6 to 3 64 mpa yield of the cv rabab decreased linearly with ψsm fig 6 if the data of intrigliolo et al 2013 with limited yield response to di are omitted from the first data group relative yield also decreased linearly with ψsm fig 7 the estimated relative yield decrease if the ψsm drops from 1 mpa to 1 5 2 and 2 5 mpa respectively amounts to 14 27 and 41 respectively early season midday ψs for several well irrigated no stress fruit trees typically falls between 0 4 and 1 mpa and during mid to late season between 0 5 and 1 2 mpa fereres et al 2012 in general for all the pomegranate cultivars discussed above relative yield decreased by 18 27 and 39 if the ψsm decreased by 0 5 1 and 1 8 mpa respectively relative to that of the well watered trees fig 8 several di strategies decreased pomegranate yield due to a reduction in fruit number and or fruit weight whereas some resulted in a yield increase relative to well watered trees tables 4 5 water deficits occurring during flowering and fruit set appear to be less critical to yield than those taking place during fruit growth and ripening withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set did not affect yield of the cultivars mollar de elche shavar and wonderful martínez nícolás et al 2019 selahvarzi et al 2017 tables 4 5 applying 25 etc during this period and during early fruit growth resulted in mild water stress and improved yield of mollar de elche relative to a well watered control intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 table 4 no irrigation until the end of fruit set decreased shavar fruit number by 19 which was offset by a 29 increase in fruit weight table 5 in contrast irrigation of mollar de elche at 25 etc from flowering until early fruit growth increased fruit numbers by 19 concomitant to a c 7 decrease in fruit weight with a net yield increase of almost 12 table 4 regulated deficit irrigation of various degrees applied during fruit growth and ripening decreased yield of mature mollar de elche orchards producing 26 to 43 7 t ha 1 by between 24 and 28 cano lamadrid et al 2018 galindo et al 2014a mellisho et al 2012 table 4 however where 25 etc was applied either during linear fruit growth or the last part of fruit growth and ripening with adequate irrigation during the remainder of the season there was on average no effect on yield over three seasons of an orchard bearing about 22 t ha 1 intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 the ψsm during linear fruit growth and the last part of fruit growth and ripening reached 1 9 mpa and 2 1 mpa respectively and tree water status was comparable to or less than in the aforementioned orchards the 25 etc rdi during linear fruit growth reduced fruit weight by 6 whereas water deficits during the last part of fruit growth and ripening had no effect table 4 the lack of response to the 25 etc rdi treatment may be due to crop load and or duration of the water deficits induced being less compared to that of the studies mentioned above table 4 cano lamadrid et al 2018 found that fruit thinning increased fruit weight of mollar de elche and wonderful significantly although 60 etc rdi during fruit growth and ripening decreased yield of mollar de elche and wonderful by 24 1 and 41 respectively it had no significant effect on fruit weight tables 4 5 the ψsm in these trees reached c 1 6 and 1 7 mpa respectively with the deviation from the mean ψs for wonderful almost reaching 2 mpa to equally compare the actual impact of water deficits for different orchards an integral of tree water status indicators over time should be calculated galindo et al 2017 however such data sets were not available for this review withholding irrigation before harvest for mollar de elche pomegranate trees for 15 25 or 34 days decreased marketable yield 37 8 t ha 1 by 38 49 and 69 respectively whereas yield was comparable for the well watered control and where irrigation was withheld for 6 days table 4 galindo et al 2014b part of the yield decrease was due to c 14 lower fruit weight in these treatments compared to fruit in the control 293 g fruit reduced expansion of fruit was attributed to severe water deficits which resulted in fruit turgor loss in spain sdi of mollar de elche applied at 50 etc did not affect yield but it decreased fruit weight by 22 relative to trees irrigated at 100 etc throughout the season intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 laribi et al 2013 table 4 in iran the effect of sdi at 50 etc was much more severe for seven year old cv shavar selahvarzi et al 2017 table 5 yield decreased for two consecutive seasons by 36 and 52 relative to the 100 etc treatment due to 14 and 30 less fruit and on average 17 lower fruit weight in california yield of the cv wonderful deficit irrigated from bearing stage was not affected until the third year of treatment centofanti et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 sustained deficit irrigation at 75 etc increased yield of the then five year old trees marginally compared to a 100 etc control whereas sdi at 50 etc did not have any significant effect table 4 zhang et al 2017 sustained deficit irrigation at 35 etc however decreased yield compared to the 100 etc by 34 due to an almost 22 decrease in fruit weight and 16 less fruit compared to the fully irrigated trees the difference in yield response of trees to a 50 etc sdi treatment in the various studies may be attributed to differences in cultivar drought tolerance crop load and climatic conditions but also to irrigation management practices and the resultant soil water availability for the cv shavar no information is available on the drip irrigation frequency applied by selahvarzi et al 2017 however in the study of centofanti et al 2017b and zhang et al 2017 for example drip irrigation was applied at different depletion levels with percentage daily use being accumulated to a threshold of 4 mm etc irrigation of similar depth was therefore applied at different frequencies for different treatments to the whole root zone in the case of parvizi et al 2014 irrigation was applied every four days only to one side of the tree with different durations to realise the treatment etc levels in the research of intrigliolo et al 2012 irrigation frequency changed during the season from once a week in spring to five times a week in summer but was similar for treatments for which irrigation duration was varied to realise the different etc levels such differences should be borne in mind when results of different research studies are compared in iran prd with a four day irrigation interval applied at 75 etc improved yield of the cv rabab by c 7 through 10 more fruit of comparable size compared to trees which received 100 etc parvizi et al 2014 table 5 however 50 etc prd as well as di applied at 75 and 50 etc to only one side of the tree decreased yield by 16 11 and 30 respectively compared to where 100 etc was applied water deficits in the 50 di treatment reduced fruit number by 25 and fruit weight by almost 20 in greece 50 etc prd applied to one side of wonderful trees from two months after bud break also decreased fruit weight compared to where 100 etc was applied to the full root zone but to lesser extent compared to that for rabab in the parvizi study noitsakis et al 2016 table 5 apart from rdi and sdi applied relative to etc or eto tables 4 5 table 6 list research studies which defined irrigation levels relative to pan evaporation afria et al 1998 dinc et al 2018 haneef et al 2014 or applied different amounts of water with without soil conditioner khattab et al 2011 2014 whereas others evaluated the effect of irrigation interval and or duration in combination with soil management practices ghosh et al 2013 seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 for young ganesh trees maximum yield was achieved where 40 of evaporated water was replaced while application of more water promoted competition between vegetative and fruit growth which decreased yield fig 2 afria et al 1998 yield of four year old high density planted bhagwa trees decreased by c 11 and 24 when irrigation replaced only 75 and 50 of pan evaporation every second day instead of 100 haneef et al 2014 table 6 the yield decrease was due to c 9 and 21 less fruit and reduced fruit weight of c 3 and 6 in the respective treatments compared to where 100 of the water requirement was applied in turkey during three seasons sdi at 50 ep reduced yield of hicaznar trees irrigated at either three or six day intervals by between 34 and 37 dinc et al 2018 table 6 yield of trees irrigated at 75 compared to 125 ep decreased by 18 5 in the first season and tended to be lower in the third table 6 fruit weight did not differ significantly between the different well watered 100 and 125 ep and sdi 75 and 50 ep treatments and averaged 473 494 and 555 g during the three experimental seasons the lower yield at the sdi trees was attributed to less fruit compared to those of the 100 and 125 ep trees in egypt during two consecutive seasons increasing irrigation application to 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees from 280 to 600 mm per season resulted in c 55 more fruit while yield more than doubled khattab et al 2011 also in egypt a comparison of the effect of three irrigation intervals 2 4 and 6 days 20 l h 1 emitters and three soil mulching practices under the trees control without mulch bitumen mulch and olive pomace mulch on nine year old manfalouty pomegranate indicated that highest yield was obtained with olive pomace mulch and an irrigation interval of 6 days seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 in india comparison of three drip irrigation treatments of different duration at two day intervals with or without mulch basin irrigation and a life saving irrigation with straw mulching found that fruit yield of 7 year old ruby trees was the highest at 3 hours drip irrigation without mulch ghosh et al 2013 8 fruit and product quality water deficits can affect pomegranate fruit and product quality by changing its appearance taste and or beneficial health effects and thereby impact its marketability three main markets exist for pomegranate fruit namely fresh consumption processing mainly arils and juice and the medicinal industry alcaraz mármol et al 2017 for producers to be profitable different consumer preferences need to be complied with borochov neori et al 2009 apart from high antioxidant capacity important fruit quality attributes include size colour juiciness taste flavour and seed hardness fawole and opara 2013 whereas aril colour total soluble solids tss and titratable acid ta contents are generally used for fruit quality assessment fawole and opara 2013 holland et al 2009 8 1 appearance 8 1 1 colour reasons for increased fruit colour in trees that experienced water stress during ripening may be increased soluble solids content which may be related to increased anthocyanin synthesis reduced vegetative growth which may improve exposure of fruit to sunlight leading to increased red colour and water stress per se which may have promoted colour pigment synthesis laribi et al 2013 mollar de elche trees irrigated daily at 33 eto during the second half of rapid fruit growth up until the last harvest had fruit with darker more reddish more bluish and more intense garnet colour than trees irrigated at 105 eto galindo et al 2014a likewise moderate water stress induced by a rdi growers practice table 1 increased peel red colour of marketable fruit from the first harvest by three to five fold compared to the control and where no irrigation was applied during the second half of linear fruit growth reflecting earlier ripening mellisho et al 2012 in addition the red colour of the arils was between 29 and 39 more intense compared to these treatments with the red colour of arils from fruit where irrigation was withheld during the second half of linear fruit growth being the poorest cano lamadrid et al 2018 found inferior red colour of juice for both mollar de elche and wonderful trees subjected to mild water stress after being irrigated at 60 etc during fruit growth and ripening according to martínez nícolás et al 2019 withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set for both mollar de elche and wonderful did not affect fruit peel colour but increased aril red greenness for the cv wonderful no irrigation until fruit set also increased the chroma of arils bartual et al 2015a comparing a control 100 etc throughout the season sdi 50 etc and rdi 25 etc during flowering and fruit set linear fruit growth and ripening respectively followed by 100 etc during the rest of the season found that the peel of fruit from trees subjected to sdi had the most intense red colour followed by those subjected to rdi during ripening the sdi resulted in more intense red and darker fruit at harvest and during the refrigerated storage period but during shelf life the fruit colour tended toward an overall yellow colour although the sdi fruit was still more red than those from the other treatments laribi et al 2013 likewise mena et al 2013 found that fruit under moderate water stress sdi at 43 eto had juice with more yellowness whereas juice of fruit under severe water stress had a more intense yellow colour with less intense red colour and higher luminosity than fruit irrigated at 75 eto or subjected to 43 eto sdi peña estévez et al 2015 also found that aril colour of fruit subjected to irrigation withholding for 16 and 26 days prior to harvest was less saturated and turned slightly to red orange compared to fruit from trees irrigated at 120 eto in contrast to the findings of bartual et al 2015a b for mollar de elche fruit peel of young bearing cv wonderful trees was lighter in colour with lower red greenness where trees were subjected to 35 etc sdi compared to where irrigation was applied at 100 75 and 50 etc levels centofanti et al 2017b in conclusion moderate water stress during the second part of fruit growth generally has positive effects on fruit skin and aril colour whereas severe water deficits may result in inferior aril colour and yellowing of fruit juice 8 1 2 juice yield and rind thickness water deficits with few exceptions appeared to decrease pomegranate peel thickness and reduce fruit juice content for the cv manfalouty the percentage fruit peel increased significantly where 280 mm irrigation water was applied per season compared to 360 and 440 mm khattab et al 2014 in the case of rabab di and prd strategies 75 and 50 etc did not affect aril or peel percentages or juice density compared to a fully irrigated control parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 however irrigating high density four year old cv bhagwa trees at 75 and 50 ep reduced juice content by 10 2 and 20 2 and decreased the rind thickness by 15 1 and 38 1 compared to where the 100 ep was applied haneef et al 2014 for shavar the aril peel ratio increased significantly where no irrigation was applied until fruit set and 50 etc sdi was applied compared to that of trees receiving 100 etc throughout the season selahvarzi et al 2017 severe drought stress during fruit growth resulted in reduced peel weight which increased the aril peel ratio selahvarzi et al 2017 according to mellisho et al 2012 irrigating mollar de elche according to growers practice by applying 74 eto during the second half of linear fruit growth and 36 eto during the end of fruit growth and ripening induced reduced peel content of fruit at the second harvest compared to the control however this di strategy did not affect the fruit moisture content relative to the well watered control mellisho et al 2012 juice yield of the same cultivar was compared to fruit from trees receiving 100 etc during the whole season also not affected by sdi at 50 etc or rdi at 25 etc during various phenological phases followed by 100 etc during the remainder of the season laribi et al 2013 for the cv rabab juice percentage was significantly higher in fruit of trees subjected to 75 or 50 etc prd compared to 50 etc di applied to one side of the root zone whereas it tended to be higher compared to fruit of the well watered control parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 juice density was not significantly affected by the di nor by the prd irrigation strategies the percentage juice of manfalouty fruit also decreased where the seasonal irrigation amount was reduced from 440 and 360 mm to 280 mm khattab et al 2014 juice percentage of wonderful fruit subjected to 100 etc and 50 etc applied to one side of the root zone were not affected relative to that of trees applying 100 etc to the whole root zone noitsakis et al 2016 in contrast to the aforementioned research fruit juice percentage of shavar pomegranate trees subjected to rdi no irrigation until fruit set 100 etc remainder of season increased by c 10 compared to fruit of trees receiving 100 etc and 50 etc sdi selahvarzi et al 2017 decreased fruit juice percentage of fruit from the sdi treatment was attributed to fewer arils and lower juiciness as a result of water deficits 8 1 3 organoleptic rating sensory analysis showed that arils from mollar de elche fruit from trees where water was withheld for 16 and 26 days before harvest showed higher visual appearance and overall quality scores than arils from fruit of fully irrigated trees whereas di appeared to increase the shelf life of arils by four days compared to the 14 days for fully irrigated trees peña estévez et al 2015 arils of mollar de elche fruit subjected to irrigation withholding 16 days prior to harvest also had 9 higher firmness compared to that of trees irrigated at 120 etc or where irrigation was withheld for 26 days peña estévez et al 2015 on the other hand arils from fruit subjected to water withholding for 26 days prior to harvest had higher colour scores compared to those where water was withheld for 16 days or which were fully irrigated which had similar scores peña estévez et al 2015 comparing growers rdi practice to non limiting soil water conditions sensory analysis also indicated that fruit of the di treatment had improved visual appearance colour flavour and overall sensory quality after storage for 14 days at 5 c compared to fruit from the fully irrigated trees independent of the pre processing storage period peña estévez et al 2016 in contrast di had a detrimental effect on fruit quality of the young high density planted cv bhagwa the organoleptic rating of fruit from trees irrigated at 75 and 50 ep decreased by 13 and 23 6 respectively compared to where the 100 ep was applied haneef et al 2014 8 1 4 cracking the main physiological disorder of pomegranate is fruit cracking which occurs when the fruit peel or cuticle fractures or split khadivi khub 2015 fruit cracking may be triggered by irregular and insufficient irrigation or by excessive rainfall especially during fruit ripening cracks reduce marketability and provide fruit access for pests and diseases causing significant income loss in the fresh market and processing industries pomegranate fruit morphological properties significantly related to fruit cracking included fruit volume and shape oblate vs spheroid the skin to fruit weight ratio as well as the aril to fruit weight ratio but not skin thickness saei et al 2014 larger fruit fruit with a ratio of fruit length to diameter of less than one and fruit containing more or larger seeds were more susceptible to cracking in addition calcium affects the biomechanical behaviour of the fruit skin and excessive calcium content may increase cracking rate according to galindo et al and references therein 2014b water stress can alter peel mechanical properties resulting in less extensibility and increased stiffness and thickness also mellisho et al and references therein 2012 indicated that decreased peel content may be related to fruit splitting incidence pomegranate cultivars differ in sensitivity to cracking hepaksoy et al 2000 khadivi khub 2015 with some crack resistant varieties displaying higher leaf level water use efficiency compared to sensitive ones hepaksoy et al 2000 intrigliolo et al 2013 found minimal cracking of mollar de elche fruit 2 6 of fruit per tree over three seasons with 25 etc rdi during fruit growth in the second season increasing cracking significantly relative to the 100 etc treatment in contrast the percentage mollar de elche fruit with cracked peels relative to total yield progressively increased with the water withholding period before harvest for 6 15 25 and 34 days being c 21 c 28 c 51 and c 64 respectively galindo et al 2014b cracking of fruit was attributed to an asymmetric increase in fruit turgor pressure after 88 4 mm rainfall occurred 10 12 days before harvest the turgor pressure of the arils increasing to a much greater extent than turgor pressure of the peel resulting in cracking for cv wonderful trees applying 100 etc to only one side of the root zone partial root zone drying caused relatively stable plant water status during the growing period which reduced fruit cracking from c 11 where irrigation was applied at 100 etc to the whole root zone or 50 etc to only one side of the root zone to c 8 of fruit noitsakis et al 2016 for rabab fruit cracking of trees irrigated at 75 or 50 etc prd was slightly less or comparable respectively to that of trees irrigated at 100 etc 6 1 of fruit parvizi et al 2014 however 75 and 50 etc di applied to only one side of the tree increased fruit cracking relative to the well watered trees by 1 5 and 4 respectively in egypt during two consecutive seasons increasing irrigation application to 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees from 280 mm to 520 mm per season decreased fruit cracking gradually from 8 6 and 9 by up to c 2 9 less whereas application of 600 mm per season only reduced cracking by 0 3 and 0 7 relative to the driest treatment khattab et al 2011 in both seasons the treatment that received the least water had the highest fruit cracking 8 6 and 9 respectively followed by the treatment that received the most water in iran for the cv post sefid darjazin application of irrigation during two consecutive seasons at 14 day intervals resulted in 19 9 and 32 8 cracking compared to 7 1 and 11 where irrigation was applied at seven day intervals ghanbarpour et al 2019 8 1 5 sunburn research regarding the effect of irrigation on sunburn levels of pomegranate fruit was very limited and results varied with seasons where mollar de elche trees were subjected to 25 etc rdi during different phenological phases or to 50 etc sdi over three seasons the effect of di on sunburn was not obvious intrigliolo et al 2013 in the second season of treatment sdi fruit had higher sunburn levels c 16 of fruit compared to well watered control 13 of fruit and where rdi was applied during ripening 12 9 of fruit however during the third season fruit subjected to rdi during flowering and fruit set had higher sunburn levels compared to the control whereas it was comparable between the sdi and control trees 8 1 6 physiological disorders and decay incidence laribi et al 2013 and bartual et al 2015a in comparing a well watered control 50 etc sdi and 25 etc rdi treatments during flowering until fruit set linear fruit growth and ripening respectively found no significant differences among treatments with regard to rind sinking after 8 weeks at 5 c and 7 days of shelf life at 20 c but sdi fruit were less susceptible to external pitting and blemishes than the rdi and control treatments after 19 weeks of cold storage and the subsequent week of shelf life at 20 c sdi reduced external physiological disorders manifested as peel pitting blemishes and sinking to between slight and moderate whereas for the rest of the treatments external physiological disorders were manifested as moderate to severe aril browning was significantly lower in sdi fruit compared to the other treatments irrigation treatments had no effect on decay incidence weight loss increased with storage time and after 19 weeks at 5 c plus the complementary shelf life period fruit subjected to sdi and rdi during ripening showed the lowest weight loss value compared to the control treatment 8 2 taste 8 2 1 total soluble solids in terms of tss 1 brix is considered a meaningful increment in the perception of fruit flavour laribi et al and references therein 2013 deficit irrigation applied to only one side of the root zone and prd strategies applying 50 etc increased tss of cv rabab fruit statistically significantly but by a mere 0 4 to 0 6 brix compared to a fully irrigated control and 75 etc di and prd strategies parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 for the cv wonderful application of 100 etc to only one side of the root zone instead of to the entire root zone increased tss by 0 8 brix whereas applying 50 etc to one side of the root zone did not affect tss relative to the control significantly noitsakis et al 2016 in spain withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set also had no effect on tss of fruit at harvest martínez nícolás et al 2019 the tss of fruit from fully irrigated young bearing wonderful trees were significantly higher in the first season of di under conditions of recurrent drought and high temperatures compared to trees subjected to 75 50 and 35 etc sdi with no differences in tss during the following season centofanti et al 2017b in india the tss of juice of young ganesh trees were the highest where 40 and 60 of evaporable water was replaced by drip irrigation with significantly lower tss where 80 and 100 was applied and even lower tss where 20 evaporable water was replaced or conventional irrigation was applied afria et al 1998 the juice tss of three year old cv ganesh increased with increasing area per leaf data not shown r2 0 7974 but similar to the relationships of area per leaf and yield respectively to plant height fig 1b decreased when plant height exceeded c 179 cm in treatments which replaced more than 40 of evaporated water juice tss of adult mollar de elche trees irrigated daily at 33 eto during the second half of rapid fruit growth until the last harvest tended to be higher relative to the 16 4 brix of well watered trees at the first harvest but increased by 1 4 and 1 7 brix relative to the 16 2 brix of the control at the two following harvests galindo et al 2014a for the same cultivar when irrigation was withheld from 26 days before harvest the juice tss was slightly higher 4 compared to those from fully irrigated trees whereas withholding irrigation from 16 days prior to harvest did not have a significant effect peña estévez et al 2015 when mollar de elche trees were subjected to 50 etc sdi and 25 etc rdi during various phenological phases the tss ranged at harvest between 16 5 and 17 5 brix and decreased during storage bartual et al 2015a laribi et al 2013 the sdi and rdi strategy applied during ripening resulted in the highest tss at harvest as well as after cold storage for 8 and 19 weeks respectively followed by a seven day shelf life period bartual et al 2015a at the end of the storage and shelf life period tss increased relative to the well watered control by 0 7 brix for fruit from rdi during fruit growth or ripening stages and by 0 9 brix for the sdi treatment irrigation of 10 year old mollar de elche trees according a growers rdi strategy increased fruit tss at the first harvest by 1 4 and 1 2 brix compared to that of a well watered control 15 5 brix and trees where irrigation was withheld during the second half of linear fruit growth 15 7 brix reflecting earlier ripening mellisho et al 2012 this trend was not evident in fruit of the second harvest for which tss ranged between 16 1 and 16 6 brix the tss of pomegranate arils processed at harvest increased after a 14 day shelf life period for the growers rdi strategy by 4 1 relative to tss at harvest whereas that of well watered trees increased by just more than 0 4 relative to the initial tss value peña estévez et al 2016 in contrast to the aforementioned studies where water deficits significantly changed fruit tss levels the tss of fruit from adult mollar de elche trees was not affected by sdi resulting in moderate 43 eto and severe 12 eto water deficits mena et al 2013 furthermore irrigation applied at 125 100 75 and 50 of ep at three and six day irrigation intervals did not affect the tss of 6 year old cv hicaznar fruit juice significantly dinc et al 2018 decreasing seasonal irrigation of manfalouty trees during two seasons from 440 mm to 280 mm did not affect fruit tss significantly whereas ta increased khattab et al 2014 the tss of mollar de elche and rabab in general increased with greater water deficits as indicated by lower ψsm fig 9 parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 previously indicated that on average over two seasons tss increased as mean ψs decreased during the fruit growth stage i e 105 days from bud burst until harvest 8 2 2 titratable acids in general pomegranate juice ta was either not affected or increased as a result of di several rdi and sdi strategies did not affect the ta of mollar de elche fruit juice significantly at harvest

estévez et al 2016 however withholding irrigation from 26 days before harvest increased the aril ta of mollar de elche at harvest by 8 compared to those from fully irrigated trees while withholding irrigation for 16 days had an insignificant effect peña estévez et al 2015 furthermore applying 50 etc sdi throughout the season or 25 etc rdi during flower and fruit set fruit growth and ripening respectively increased juice ta at harvest significantly compared to trees receiving 100 etc but with no differences in ta discernible after storage bartual et al 2015a laribi et al 2013 for the cv rabab ta increased with increasing mean soil water deficit during the fruit growth stage parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 the ta of fruit from trees irrigated according to a 50 etc di strategy was significantly higher compared to that of fully irrigated trees and those irrigated according to a 75 etc prd strategy in contrast noitsakis et al 2016 found no effect of prd irrigation strategies applying 100 etc and 50 etc to one side of the tree on juice ta of the cv wonderful withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set of this cultivar instead of irrigating at 115 etc also did not affect the juice ta at harvest martínez nícolás et al 2019 8 2 3 ph in response to different water deficits fruit juice ph increased mellisho et al 2012 was not affected centofanti et al 2017b dinc et

treatment and cold storage duration 8 3 2 anthocyanins anthocyanins are considered responsible for the colour of pomegranate skin and arils and is an important commercial quality trait laribi et al 2013 with regard to total anthocyanin content tac water stress in addition to sunlight exposure and temperature may be controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis mena et al 2013 and references therein for the cv shavar rdi until end fruit set and 50 etc sdi had no effect on tac of fruit selahvarzi et al 2017 irrigating mollar de elche trees daily at 33 eto during the second half of rapid fruit growth

however for the same cultivar the tac of fruit decreased compared to fully irrigated trees by 3 and 7 for trees subjected to water withholding for 16 and 26 days prior to harvest respectively peña estévez et al 2015 in contrast where 25 etc rdi was applied during linear fruit growth the juice tac at harvest and after cold storage increased significantly compared to that of well watered trees or those subjected to 25 etc rdi applied during flowering until fruit set or ripening respectively or to 50 etc sdi bartual et al 2015b laribi et al 2013 fruit peel and juice colour were affected differently by di and the timing of water stress for mollar de elche should therefore be taken into account with regard to anthocyanin accumulation laribi et al 2013 the sdi and rdi during ripening increased fruit skin colouration whereas rdi during linear fruit growth resulted in the highest concentration of juice anthocyanins for manfalouty fruit applying more irrigation water per season decreased the total anthocyanins in fruit khattab et al 2014 in contrast no effect of sdi at 75 50 or 35 etc was found in two consecutive seasons for young bearing cv wonderful trees on the

2014a nor did growers rdi have a significant effect relative to that of well irrigated trees mellisho et al 2012 however according to peña estévez et al 2016 total antioxidant capacity of arils from well watered mollar de elche trees was 1 4 fold higher at harvest than that of deficit irrigated fruit during shelf life of up to 14 days though the total antioxidant capacity of the control fruit decreased whereas that of the deficit irrigated fruit increased with nearly the same total antioxidant capacity for both irrigation treatments at the end of cold storage in contrast the total antioxidant capacity of fruit juice from trees subjected to moderate irrigated at 43 eto sdi and severe water stress irrigated at 12 eto sdi decreased on average by c 25 compared to that of trees subjected to no irrigated at 75 eto water stress mena et al 2013 in contrast the antioxidant activity of shavar fruit increased by 43 on average over two seasons in a 50 etc sdi treatment relative to

de elche trees subjected to di growers practice had 13 and 21 higher glucose and fructose contents respectively at harvest than the well watered control overall di had a positive effect on sugar content of pomegranate arils from fruit stored for 30 60 and 90 days peña estévez et al 2016 in contrast according to cano lamadrid et al 2018 water deficits induced by applying 60 etc during fruit growth and ripening did not affect sugars of mollar de elche fruit whereas it increased glucose and fructose in the cv wonderful mellisho et al 2012 and martínez nícolás et al 2019 however reported no effect of irrigation treatment on sucrose glucose fructose citric acid or malic acid content of pomegranate arils punicalagin content which can contribute significantly to the antioxidant activity in pomegranate juice mena et al and references therein 2013 decreased as water stress increased in the moderate irrigated at 43 eto sdi and severe water stress irrigated at 12 eto sdi treatments being 36 and 73 less than in the control at harvest this decrease in punicalagin concentration despite no change in ellagic acid punicalagin hydrolysis product concentration could indicate that moderate and severe water stress levels inhibit punicalagin biosynthesis mena et al 2013 in this regard cano lamadrid et al 2018 and martínez nícolás et al 2019 found no effect of mild water stress on punicalagin content of mollar de elche and wonderful fruit in manfalouty fruit total sugar was significantly increased by reducing the irrigation water applied from 440 mm to 360 and 280 mm per season khattab et al 2014 at harvest arils of mollar de elche fruit subjected to grower s rdi practice had significantly higher total vitamin c content compared to that of well watered trees peña estévez et al 2016 however the aril ascorbic acid content of rdi fruit was 28 of the total compared to 35 for the control there was no effect of irrigation on the ascorbic acid content during shelf life except for arils processed after a pre processing storage period of 60 days which showed higher ascorbic acid losses compared to the control according to cano lamadrid et al 2018 the level of water stress in mollar de elche and wonderful irrigated at 60 etc during fruit growth and ripening was too low to affect the citric acid and ascorbic acid content of fruit the ψsm in these two cultivars reached c 1 6 mpa martínez nícolás et al 2019 also found that withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set for these cultivars had no effect on citric acid and ascorbic acid content of fruit the vitamin c content of manfalouty fruit decreased by increasing the amount of seasonal water applied from 280 and 360 mm to 440 mm khattab et al 2014 in contrast vitamin c content of cv rabab fruit was significantly less where trees were subjected to 50 etc di compared to trees irrigated fully 100 etc or at 75 etc di or prd parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 the juice vitamin c concentration decreased with mean ψs during fruit growth stage conflicting results of water deficits on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity may be due to differences in cultivars age of trees harvest time and drought severity selahvarzi et al 2017 in addition differences in the mechanical fruit juice extracting process centofanti et al 2017a mphahlele et al 2016 and agro environmental conditions may also play a role centofanti et al 2017b 9 conclusions in general mild and severe water deficits in pomegranate trees were related to ψsm values of between 1 5 to 1 8 mpa and c 2 to 2 8 mpa respectively which could decrease stomatal conductance by between 19 to 36 and 53 to 77 relative to well watered trees water deficits decreased vegetative growth and applied over several seasons can depending on the degree and duration thereof have a cumulative effect on canopy development and in the long term affect orchard productivity for some cultivars mild water deficits during flowering and fruit set can limit shoot growth without significantly reducing yield pomegranates have depending on cultivar a linear to sigmoidal fruit growth pattern and severe water deficits affect fruit growth rate compared to that of well watered trees with minor differences late in the fruit growth stage maximum relative yield of pomegranates trees was achieved where between 721 and 953 mm etc occurred with relative yield decreasing non linearly with etc below an etc of 721 mm in general relative yield for selected cultivars decreased by 24 34 and 45 if ψsm decreased by 0 5 1 and 1 8 mpa relative to that of well watered trees yield typically decreased due to less fruit and or fruit of lower weight flowering and fruit set compared to fruit growth and ripening appears to be a less critical phenological period for application of water saving di strategies with regard to fruit and product quality the appearance taste and health properties of fruit were affected by various di strategies for selected cultivars the tss in fruit juice increased as ψsm decreased with regard to fruit skin and juice colour and bioactive compounds di studies produced conflicting results moderate stress during the second part of fruit growth generally had positive effects on fruit skin and aril colour whereas severe water deficits resulted in poor aril colour and yellowing of fruit juice in some cases for some di strategies improved red colour of fruit skin and or juice was obtained at the expense of fruit size and economic income differences in pomegranate tree physiological growth and yield responses to water deficits may be attributed to diverse cultivar drought tolerance crop load climatic conditions irrigation water quality soil water management practices and the resultant soil water availability for a large component of the existing pomegranate irrigation research studies direct comparison of results is prohibited by lack of information on the actual soil water deficits induced and differences in measurement protocols applied of which the latter may be dictated by industry practice and or availability of research equipment research with a soil plant atmosphere continuum approach that quantifies the evaporative demand tree water status as well as the actual soil water deficits that develop as a result of the irrigation strategies employed could aid in better understanding of the tree response to water deficits this knowledge is fundamental to formulate appropriate irrigation strategies to achieve optimal water use productivity variable results with different systems and

saving irrigation management strategies effectively in orchards knowledge of tree shoot and fruit growth patterns and plant response to water deficits and salinity is essential galindo et al 2018 goodwin and boland 2002 mitchell et al 1984 the focus of this review is restricted to the effects of water deficits on pomegranate tree physiology phenology vegetative growth fruit growth yield and fruit and product quality 2 nature of water deficits the effect of irrigation strategies on trees may differ depending on the timing and level of the water deficit applied the duration thereof the climatic conditions of the area and the drought tolerance of the crop via avoidance and tolerance mechanisms although the extent of the root system plays an important role in the drought tolerance of a crop inherent physiological traits of plants also determine their response to water deficits and productivity under limited water supply pinheiro et al 2005 deficit irrigation di is the application of irrigation below crop evapotranspiration etc requirements with the goal to optimise economic income with limited water fereres and soriano 2007 sustained deficit irrigation sdi entails the uniform application of a reduced proportion of the irrigation requirements throughout the season which results in the gradual development of water deficit as the season progresses fereres and soriano 2007 galindo et al 2018 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is an irrigation strategy based on a reduction of irrigation amounts only during drought tolerant plant phenological stages with full irrigation requirements being applied during drought sensitive phenological stages resulting in minimal no negative impacts on yield and crop income and having the potential to improve harvest quality galindo et al and references therein 2018 partial rootzone drying prd involves irrigating only one part of the root zone per irrigation event leaving the other part to dry to a specific soil water content before

deficit related stress indicators ayars et al 2017 buesa et al 2012 bugueño et al 2016 hepaksoy et al 2016 intrigliolo et al 2013 parvizi et al 2016 the use of eto or estimated etc as sole reference base to induce different di treatments contribute to the large variability and incompatibility of research results between different orchards since the magnitude of the deficit induced even for orchards of similar properties depend on the variation in eto also lack of actual soil water deficit information complicates comparison of stress levels induced in different studies galindo et al 2018 stressed amongst other key constraints for application of rdi the requirement for new and more precise criteria for defining water deficit for a range of different growing conditions species weather soil depth fruit load and rootstock 3 physiology apart from the research of rodrίguez et al 2012 and galindo et al 2014b on the cv mollar de elche there is a lack of information on leaf water relations of different pomegranate cultivars that mechanistically explain the leaf level response of trees to water deficits pomegranate trees are considered drought resistant and under water deficit conditions trees decrease stomatal conductance to control water loss via transpiration to avoid leaf turgor loss parvizi et al 2016 rodrίguez et al 2012 in addition in response to severe long term stress i e water withheld for up to four weeks active osmotic adjustment occurred in leaves of the cv mollar de elche enabling it to maintain turgor rodrίguez et al 2012 drought tolerance characteristics of leaves such as high apoplastic water content 42 to 58 may furthermore aid in retention of water at low leaf water potentials at turgor loss point mollar de elche leaves had osmotic potential of between 2 49 and 3 27 mpa and still a relatively high relative water content on average c 84 no elastic adjustment occurred in these leaves as a result of water stress fruit peel osmotic potential increased whereas that of arils was not affected by water deficits galindo et al 2014b fruit peel turgor loss occurred at a fruit water potential of 2 25 mpa estimated midday stem water potential ψs of 1 95 mpa and aril turgor loss at a fruit water potential of 2 69 mpa estimated midday ψs of 2 46 mpa fruit turgor loss for a period of more than six days during the end of fruit growth and ripening resulted in decreased marketable yield and fruit size despite compensative fruit growth that occurred after a rainfall event leaf water potential predawn and during the day as well as ψ s are frequently used in irrigation research to indicate the water status of fruit trees and vines crop and even cultivar specific thresholds for these indicators are linked to degrees of water constraints that impacts crop physiology and fruit quality to a lesser or more severe extent garcía tejero and zuazo 2018 myburgh 2018 since the minimum ψs midday incorporates the effects of the atmospheric demand as well as the soil water on the tree ebel et al 2001 it is frequently used commercially to schedule irrigation of woody crops itrigliolo et al 2011a though based on signal intensity considered mollar de elche photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to be more sensitive indicators of water deficits than midday ψs in addition to soil water content the ψs is also affected by irrigation water salinity climate variables and crop load stem water potential of the cv rabab decreased with increased evaporative demand as the season progressed as well as with increasing soil water deficit parvizi et al 2016 different slopes of linear regression relationships between midday ψs and soil water deficit were ascribed to the effects of higher crop load and differences in mean air temperature in contrast no significant relationship was found between cv mollar de elche ψs and soil water content in the root zone up to 0 5 m depth intrigliolo et al 2013 in this case the linear regression relationships between midday ψs and midday vapour pressure deficit in different seasons was affected by irrigation water salinity whereas increased crop load also decreased ψs the abovementioned factors most likely contributed to the variation apparent in seasonal minimum midday ψs ψsm and the associated stomatal conductance gs for several di research studies fig 1 for mollar de elche in spain in well watered control treatments gs associated with ψsm of between 0 9 and 1 6 mpa ranged between 400 and 220 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 1a galindo et al 2013 martínez nícolás et al 2019

higher at lower ψsm between 2 9 and 3 64 mpa compared to that of studies on the same cultivar where rdi or sdi treatments were applied galindo et al 2013 martínez nícolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 although these differences may be partially attributed to site specific effects of climate crop load and irrigation water salinity it is possible that plant water deficits develop physiologically differently when water is withheld completely for a continuous period compared to where the crop is preconditioned for water deficits i e where less than the crop water demand is applied daily or periodically the ψsm in deficit irrigated di rdi sdi mollar de elche ranged between 1 55 and 2 6 mpa whereas in shavar it reached 1 5 to 2 8 mpa tables 1 2 fig 1a for wonderful trees withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set reduced the ψsm to 1 7 and 1 68 mpa during two consecutive seasons martínez nícolás et al 2019 for rabab subjected over two seasons to various prd and di treatments the ψsm varied between 2 65 and 3 28 mpa fig 1a b parvizi et al 2016 the gs of rabab reduced linearly with decreasing ψs and according to parvizi et al 2016 non linearly with increasing vapour pressure deficit until 7 kpa after which it dropped sharply in response to further increases in vapour pressure deficit with two exceptions tables 1 2 galindo et al 2014a selahvarzi

and 55 at ψsm values of 1 5 mpa and 2 mpa respectively under the specific experimental conditions where water was withheld for different periods once off before harvest galindo et al 2014b fig 1a b me5 the relative gs of mollar de elche trees decreased at a lower rate compared to where rdi or sdi was practiced galindo et al 2013 martínez nícolás et al 2019 mellisho et al 2012 mena et al 2013 for the cv rabab data of two seasons combined indicated that gs decreased at a similar rate to that of mollar de elche shavar and wonderful subjected to rdi sdi even though the range of ψsm hardly overlapped fig 1b several di studies ranked the degree of water stress that the trees were subjected to according to the stomatal response tables 1 2 in general a relative reduction in midday gs of between 19 and 36 was considered mild moderate whereas a decrease of between 53 and 77 was considered to be severe table 3 a moderate water deficit of 1 55 mpa during the second half of linear fruit growth was considered sufficient to affect yield final fruit size and fruit quality characteristics of mollar de elche mellisho et al 2012 classification according to galindo et al 2014b and parvizi et al 2016 did not compare with that of the other studies and was excluded from table 3 galindo et al 2014b classed mollar de elche midday ψs of 2 9 3 2 and lower than 3 5 mpa as mild severe and very severe water stress table 1 parvizi et al 2016 described water deficits at the end of fruit growth stage with ψsm table 2 of between 2 65 to 3 03 mpa as mild trees irrigated at 75 etc and between 3 13

drippers per tree was more or less comparable in both seasons whereas in the 75 and 50 etc di irrigation on one side of the tree 3 drippers per tree and 50 etc prd treatments it was notably lower compared to the aforementioned two treatments after about 80 days from bud burst parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 pomegranate cultivars differ in their ability to control their water status under water deficit conditions ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 pourghayoumi et al 2017a b the leaf relative water content of shishehgap decreased at a greater rate than that of rabab leaves with increasing water stress up to 25 of field capacity ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 at 50 of field capacity the relative water content of leaves of shishehgap was c 30 less than in the control while this reduction was only 12 5 in rabab enhanced control of plant water status in rabab is attributed to a stronger antioxidant system able to tolerate drought related oxidative stress and more effective accumulation of soluble carbohydrates for osmotic adjustment ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 midday ψs of several commercial iranian cultivars subjected to 14 days of drought in a greenhouse study decreased to values of between 5 35 and 6 63 mpa with that of the control ranging between 1 2 and 1 8 mpa pourghayoumi et al 2017a the most drought tolerant cultivar had higher leaf relative water content ψs and intrinsic water use efficiency iwue or ratio of net photosynthesis an to gs and greater ability for osmotic adjustment compared to the other cultivars pourghayoumi et al 2017b found clear differences in metabolite contents and antioxidant enzyme activity among the cultivars differing in drought tolerance cultivars also differed with regard to the ability to recover physiologically after rehydration pourghayoumi et al 2017a b more research regarding the mechanism allowing fast recovery after rehydration and prevention of photo inhibitory damage in plants subjected to drought stress are needed catola et al 2016 rabab trees subjected to prd irrigation strategies had significantly higher ψs compared to those in corresponding di strategies fig 1b parvizi et al 2016 irrigation at 50 etc reduced ψs significantly compared to the 75 and or 100 etc treatments about three months after bud break applying severe water stress i e 50 etc with prd and di strategies affected gas exchange parameters significantly compared to full irrigation and mild water stress parvizi et al 2016 partial root zone drying strategies had higher leaf water use efficiency transpiration efficiency or an tr than di due to higher net photosynthesis at comparable transpiration rates tr transpiration efficiency increased by increasing the level of water stress i e from irrigating at 75 etc to 50 etc the fully irrigated trees had lower iwue compared to the other irrigation strategies with no notable differences in iwue for prd and di strategies in both levels of water stress in greece the prd strategy applied by noitsakis et al 2016 differed from that utilized by parvizi et al 2016 in iran applying 100 etc to one side of the root zone instead of to the whole root zone increased predawn leaf water potential of wonderful pomegranate trees on several occasions significantly noitsakis et al 2016 irrigation applied at 50 etc to one side of the root zone significantly decreased predawn leaf water potential after the first month of treatment and for the remainder of the season compared to the control and 100 etc prd treatment decreasing beyond 0 5 mpa at some stage table 2 during this period stomatal conductance transpiration and to a lesser degree photosynthesis rate decreased significantly with a decrease in the volume of irrigation water applied and with a smaller area of application i e one side of root zone vs full root zone noitsakis et al 2016 attributed lower stomatal conductance despite higher predawn leaf water potential values in the 100 etc prd treatment compared to the control to chemical signals involved in stomatal regulation the authors hypothesized that in the absence of drought or under mild drought conditions the primary signal controlling stomatal conductance are root chemical signals whereas under intense drought conditions tree water status plays a more important role this is in direct contrast to rodrίguez et al 2012 who considered the process to operate vice versa in this regard parvizi et al 2016 hypothesized that the pomegranate tree response to water stress is mainly based on environmental conditions so that in arid conditions with high vapour pressure deficit their study hydraulic i e turgor related signalling contributed to stomatal control but in humid conditions with low vapour pressure deficit intrigliolo et al 2011a non hydraulic chemical signalling possibly occurred in this regard diaz espejo et al 2018 attributed poor effectivity of prd as an irrigation strategy in practice to the assumption that root to shoot abscisic acid signalling controls the stomatal response to water stress whereas more recent research indicated that shoot to root rather than root to shoot signalling of abscisic acid may regulate stomatal conductance more research is required for pomegranate regarding the physiological response mechanisms employed under water stress and the associated crop performance 4 phenological development in egypt during two consecutive seasons increasing irrigation application to 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees from 280 to 600 mm per season resulted in 24 to 34 more flowers per shoot c 10 more fruit set and 8 6 less fruit drop khattab et al 2011 in spain mild water stress ψs less than 1 4 mpa applied early in the season through rdi 25 etc during flowering fruit set and early fruit growth 100 etc during remainder of season and sdi 50 etc throughout the season decreased drop of fruit and flowers of mollar de elche trees intrigliolo et al 2013 in another study no irrigation during flowering and fruit set in two consecutive seasons decreased midday ψs for seven year old mollar de elche trees to 1 58 and 1 67 mpa and for the cv wonderful to 1 7 and 1 68 mpa martínez nícolás et al 2019 the rdi no irrigation until the end of fruit set 115 etc for the remainder of season compared to irrigation applied at 115 etc throughout the season increased the number of flowers per tree for molar de elche and wonderful trees in the first season by c 163 and 32 respectively and in the second season by 39 and 65 respectively in iran rdi no irrigation until the end of fruit set 100 etc for the remainder of the season applied to seven year old shavar pomegranate trees in two consecutive seasons resulted in minimum ψs values of c 1 5 and c 1 8 mpa near the end of fruit set selahvarzi et al 2017 the rdi decreased the number of lateral flowers on average over two seasons by c 38 compared to where irrigation was applied at 100 etc and increased fruit set on the lateral flowers compared to the 100 etc and sdi 50 etc throughout the season treatments in addition the rdi treatment shortened the flowering period compared to that of fully watered and sdi trees by c 42 and 49 respectively the rdi may have delayed the first and advanced the second and third flowering waves by inducing earlier completion of current year shoot growth or modified plant hormonal balance which promoted earlier flowering in the first season the trees subjected to sdi had a comparable number of lateral flowers and fruit set to the 100 etc trees however in the second season the lateral flowers decreased by 17 and fruit set by c 37 compared to the well watered trees at the end of fruit set the sdi trees had less water stress compared to the rdi trees but later in the season reached minimum midday ψs of c 2 1 mpa and c 2 8 mpa in the two respective seasons sustained deficit irrigation treatments with its longer duration affect not only current season production but also fruit bud development for the following season the degree of impact is determined by the severity of the water deficit that develops during the season additional research is needed to determine the effect of water stress timing degree duration on bud differentiation and fruit set of pomegranate trees 5 vegetative growth water deficits of 40 or more of fully watered status field capacity decreased vegetative growth of one year old potted pomegranate plants grown in greenhouses relative to fully watered controls xie et al 2015 ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 soil water depletion of two litre pots to 60 40 and 20 of fully watered status reduced chinese pomegranate seedling height of 897 mm by between 13 and 43 stem diameter of 14 6 mm by between 22 and 46 and shoot dry weight by between 16 to 57 xie et al 2015 root dry weight tended to increase by between 10 and 25 whereas the root shoot ratio increased significantly from 0 16 in the control plants to values of 0 26 and 0 47 in plants at 40 and 20 water content respectively drought tolerance diversity of pomegranate cultivars may be attributed to differences in sensitivity to water stress at biochemical level which affect the water status and growth ebtedaie and shekafandeh 2016 in iran irrigating pomegranate trees at 50 and 25 of field capacity fc reduced new shoot growth relative to the 100 fc treatment for the cv shishehgap by 21 and 50 respectively and for the less sensitive cv rabbab by only 4 and 23 for the respective treatments the water deficit at 25 fc also induced less severe leaf necrosis and leaf drop in rabbab compared to shishehgap leaf relative water content of rabbab compared to shishehgap decreased less as leaves had a stronger antioxidant system and accumulated more soluble carbohydrates allowing it to withstand more water stress in chile where only 30 etc was applied to newly planted pomegranate trees cv wonderful in a sandy loam soil water deficits reduced canopy volume trunk growth rate and trunk cumulative growth compared to where 100 and or 130 etc was applied during the second season bugueño et al 2016 trees receiving 70 etc tended to have lower canopy volume and trunk cumulative growth compared to trees where 130 etc was applied indicating the onset of some plant stress in young trees trunk growth rate was a more sensitive indicator of water deficits than maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds and a 33 decrease in optimal trunk growth rate was considered to indicate suboptimal growth stressed conditions for young wonderful pomegranate plants bugueño et al 2016 in spain mds is accepted as a more suitable water stress indicator for full bearing pomegranate trees intrigliolo et al 2011b galindo et al 2013 the mds of full bearing mollar de elche trees generally increased in response to water stress with increasingly negative ψs intrigliolo et al 2011b galindo et al 2013 however more research in this regard is needed as statistically significant different regression relationships between mds and ψs applied earlier and later in fruit development and after fruit removal intrigliolo et al 2011b whereas galindo et al 2013 found a sharp decrease in mds below a threshold ψs of 1 67 mpa with regard to young bearing pomegranate trees there appears to be a balance between plant available water and the competition for assimilates between different types of vegetative growth and yield in india yield of three year old cv ganesh increased with increasing area per leaf fig 2 a but both area per leaf and yield decreased when plant height exceeded c 179 cm in treatments which replaced more than 40 of evaporated water fig 2b afria et al 1998 for every 10 cm increase in plant height beyond 179 cm the estimated leaf area decrease was c 4 and the yield loss 10 8 a higher irrigation regime for three year old orchards may therefore rather promote tree structure development than leaf photosynthetic capacity and yield whereas drier conditions may secure a first harvest but restrict tree growth however yield of a four year old cv bhagwa high density planting subjected to different degrees of water deficit for one season decreased linearly with tree height and leaf area index haneef et al 2014 drip irrigating the plants on alternate days at 75 and 50 of the crop water requirement reduced tree height by c 8 and 13 plant spread by c 9 and 14 and leaf area index by c 14 and 28 respectively relative to where 100 of the water requirement was applied in this case the detrimental effect of water deficits on vegetative growth was reflected directly in the yield response regulated deficit irrigation is used as a tool in high density fruit orchards to limit excessive vegetative growth chalmers et al 1984 in spain no irrigation during flowering and fruit set compared to daily irrigation at 115 etc for two consecutive seasons decreased total shoot growth for seven year old mollar de elche trees by 46 and 49 respectively martínez nícolás et al 2019 the shoot growth of wonderful trees of similar age appeared to be less sensitive to water deficits since total shoot growth decreased only by 6 and 37 for the two seasons the midday ψs for the two cultivars reached seasonal minimum values near the end of flowering and fruit set and ranged between 1 58 and 1 7 mpa in iran withholding irrigation of 7 year old cv shahvar trees from the beginning of the growing season until the end of the fruit set stage rdi over two seasons delayed initial vegetative growth by c 10 days and reduced growth rate compared to trees irrigated at 100 etc selahvarzi et al 2017 the rdi decreased midday ψs during this period to c 1 5 and c 1 8 mpa in the two respective seasons whereas midday ψs of the fully irrigated trees remained between 0 3 and 1 2 mpa the final shoot length of trees subjected to rdi during fruit set compared to the control dropped by 31 7 and 12 6 in the first and second season respectively for trees irrigated at 50 etc throughout the season sdi shoot elongation was similar to that of the well watered control in the first growing season for about the first two months during this period the sdi midday ψs was mostly above c 1 mpa with a minimum of c 1 3 mpa selahvarzi et al 2017 the shoot elongation rate decreased during the last month with midday ψs during this period decreasing to c 1 5 and even beyond 2 mpa poorer growth of sdi shoots compared to that of the 100 etc treatment from the beginning of the second season may partially be due to significant water status differences of the trees the midday ψs in the well watered trees was above 1 mpa for the greatest part of the shoot growth period until end fruit set whereas that of the sdi trees was generally below 1 mpa also in iran applying 50 etc via prd or di decreased leaf area index of nine year old cv rabab by 22 on average compared to trees where 100 etc or 75 etc prd or di was applied parvizi et al 2016 the leaf area index tended to be higher in the prd compared to the di strategies but it was not significantly higher leaf senescence of deficit irrigated trees started earlier compared to that of fully and prd irrigated trees the water deficit related reduction in vegetative growth in two consecutive seasons impacted yield which decreased linearly with leaf area index measured at 134 and 135 days after bud break in the two respective seasons parvizi et al 2016 the positive effect of irrigation on pomegranate vegetative growth was confirmed during two seasons in egypt where new shoot length leaf number per shoot and area per leaf of 5 5 m spaced 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees n 3 ten shoots per tree increased as irrigation water applied in sandy soil per season increased from 280 mm 7 m3 per tree to 600 mm 15 m3 per tree khattab et al 2011 linear regression relationships using data of two consecutive seasons combined indicated that yield increased with longer shoots more leaves per shoot and greater area per leaf fig 3 a c under the experimental conditions for the specific cultivar yield increased by 1 t ha 1 per cm increase in shoot length 1 6 t ha 1 for each additional leaf per shoot and 4 3 t ha 1 per cm2 increase in area per leaf different relationships between yield and area per leaf for young ganesh and mature manfalouty trees may be due to the effect of cultivar age and or crop management differences on leaf size figs 2a and 3c it should be noted that pomegranate is sensitive to continuous overly wet waterlogged soil conditions which lead to root rot and fungal diseases hepaksoy et al 2016 jamadar et al 2011 excessive irrigation of pomegranates should therefore be avoided and special attention be given to irrigation management especially in dense and poorly drained soils water deficits applied over several seasons can depending on the degree and duration thereof have a cumulative effect on canopy development and in the long term affect orchard productivity in california di of the cv wonderful at 35 and 50 etc in the first season only tended to decrease the canopy size by 13 relative to the 75 and 100 etc treatments zhang et al 2017 in the second and third year of di fourth and fifth growing seasons though the trees under severe medium stress were significantly smaller having 19 less canopy cover than those fully irrigated or under mild stress likewise in turkey the canopy volume of six year old hicaznar trees subjected to sdi at 50 ep decreased progressively during three subsequent seasons canopy volume was reduced by 8 3 and 9 4 10 9 and 11 8 and 14 and 14 9 respectively compared to where 100 or 125 ep was replaced respectively dinc et al 2018 the canopies of trees irrigated at sdi of 75 ep became significantly smaller compared to the well watered trees only from the second season onwards but the size difference c 10 7 remained similar over subsequent seasons increasing the irrigation interval from three to six days decreased canopy volume in the first season of sdi by c 16 but the effect was much less 5 in the second and third seasons although significant the total trunk cross sectional area of the 75 ep and 50 ep trees compared to that of trees irrigated at 100 or 125 ep tended to be significantly less only from the second season onwards total trunk cross sectional area appears to be a coarser indicator of water deficit than canopy volume since it was also not affected by irrigation interval in contrast in spain during a three year experimental period the sdi treatment 50 etc reduced trunk growth of mature mollar de elche trees by 26 compared to control trees irrigated at 100 etc intrigliolo et al 2013 in the first and second season of di canopy volume was reduced only in the sdi treatment compared to the control whereas in the third season rdi treatments 25 etc applied during flowering and fruit set and ripening respectively had a significant reduction in canopy volume compared with control trees the canopy volume reduction compared to the control was in the third year more pronounced in the sdi trees up to 30 than in the rdi treatments 6 fruit growth pomegranate fruit is a fleshy berry holland et al 2009 and the fruit growth pattern can differ between cultivars from linear to sigmoidal al yahyai et al 2009 intrigliolo et al 2012 shulman et al 1984 the length of the periods for young fruit development growth and ripening also varies among cultivars melgarejo et al 1997 parvizi et al 2016 of the publications on di sourced for this review only galindo et al 2018 for mollar de elche in spain included information on seasonal shoot and fruit growth of pomegranate if rdi is to be used as a water saving and fruit quality manipulation tool such information is critical for decision making at least for the most important cultivars in different countries the absolute fruit growth rate of mollar de elche during linear fruit growth and harvest ranged between 0 25 and 0 6 mm d 1 intrigliolo et al 2013 growth rates of fruit subjected to 25 etc rdi during linear fruit growth only reduced significantly during the middle of the di period compared to that of the 100 etc treatment and compensatory fruit growth was absent when full irrigation was restored for the same cultivar mellisho et al 2012 found that fruit of trees subjected to no irrigation during the second half of linear fruit growth did not display compensatory fruit growth after irrigation resulting in smaller fruit compared to that of well watered trees at harvest galindo et al 2014b however did report some compensatory fruit growth in response to rainfall following a period of withholding irrigation before harvest according to parvizi et al 2016 applying severe water stress i e irrigation at 50 etc with both prd and di strategies reduced fruit growth rate compared to trees irrigated at 100 etc or 75 etc prd or di strategies but only until 190 days after bud break after which fruit growth rate did not differ between treatments until harvest 7 yield yield of pomegranate trees of various cultivars growing in different countries increased linearly per tree from 19 9 to 93 9 kg per tree and per hectare from 14 2 to 52 t ha 1 as the total amount of precipitation and irrigation water applied increased from 200 to 1214 mm per season year fig 4 a b yield per tree and per hectare increased by c 6 1 kg per tree or c 2 9 t ha 1 respectively for each 100 mm irrigation water and precipitation added multiple linear regression of yield with irrigation and precipitation entered as separate variables data not shown improved the coefficient of determination of the yield estimates per tree radj 2 76 43 p 0 0001 and per hectare radj 2 55 37 p 0 0001 precipitation had no significant effect on variability of yield per hectare and accounted for a mere 2 1 of the variability in yield per tree the balance being due to differences in irrigation applied in the various research experiments yield per hectare increased linearly with etc whereas the relative yield response to etc was non linear fig 5 a b maximum relative yield was achieved for pomegranate orchards where seasonal annual etc ranged between 721 mm and 952 5 mm with relative yield decreasing non linearly with etc below an etc of 721 mm there was no simple relationship between yield which ranged between 14 2 and 47 t ha 1 and ψsm with values of between 0 99 and 3 64 mpa fig 6 the water potential dataset of the majority of authors included the cultivars mollar de elche shavar and wonderful and ranged from 0 9 to 2 8 mpa with a general decreasing trend in yield as ψsm decreased in the case of galindo et al 2014b and parvizi et al 2016 maximum yield for mollar de elche and rabab realised at lower ψsm and the combined data set ranged except for one value of 1 6 mpa from 2 6 to 3 64 mpa yield of the cv rabab decreased linearly with ψsm fig 6 if the data of intrigliolo et al 2013 with limited yield response to di are omitted from the first data group relative yield also decreased linearly with ψsm fig 7 the estimated relative yield decrease if the ψsm drops from 1 mpa to 1 5 2 and 2 5 mpa respectively amounts to 14 27 and 41 respectively early season midday ψs for several well irrigated no stress fruit trees typically falls between 0 4 and 1 mpa and during mid to late season between 0 5 and 1 2 mpa fereres et al 2012 in general for all the pomegranate cultivars discussed above relative yield decreased by 18 27 and 39 if the ψsm decreased by 0 5 1 and 1 8 mpa respectively relative to that of the well watered trees fig 8 several di strategies decreased pomegranate yield due to a reduction in fruit number and or fruit weight whereas some resulted in a yield increase relative to well watered trees tables 4 5 water deficits occurring during flowering and fruit set appear to be less critical to yield than those taking place during fruit growth and ripening withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set did not affect yield of the cultivars mollar de elche shavar and wonderful martínez nícolás et al 2019 selahvarzi et al 2017 tables 4 5 applying 25 etc during this period and during early fruit growth resulted in mild water stress and improved yield of mollar de elche relative to a well watered control intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 table 4 no irrigation until the end of fruit set decreased shavar fruit number by 19 which was offset by a 29 increase in fruit weight table 5 in contrast irrigation of mollar de elche at 25 etc from flowering until early fruit growth increased fruit numbers by 19 concomitant to a c 7 decrease in fruit weight with a net yield increase of almost 12 table 4 regulated deficit irrigation of various degrees applied during fruit growth and ripening decreased yield of mature mollar de elche orchards producing 26 to 43 7 t ha 1 by between 24 and 28 cano lamadrid et al 2018 galindo et al 2014a mellisho et al 2012 table 4 however where 25 etc was applied either during linear fruit growth or the last part of fruit growth and ripening with adequate irrigation during the remainder of the season there was on average no effect on yield over three seasons of an orchard bearing about 22 t ha 1 intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 the ψsm during linear fruit growth and the last part of fruit growth and ripening reached 1 9 mpa and 2 1 mpa respectively and tree water status was comparable to or less than in the aforementioned orchards the 25 etc rdi during linear fruit growth reduced fruit weight by 6 whereas water deficits during the last part of fruit growth and ripening had no effect table 4 the lack of response to the 25 etc rdi treatment may be due to crop load and or duration of the water deficits induced being less compared to that of the studies mentioned above table 4 cano lamadrid et al 2018 found that fruit thinning increased fruit weight of mollar de elche and wonderful significantly although 60 etc rdi during fruit growth and ripening decreased yield of mollar de elche and wonderful by 24 1 and 41 respectively it had no significant effect on fruit weight tables 4 5 the ψsm in these trees reached c 1 6 and 1 7 mpa respectively with the deviation from the mean ψs for wonderful almost reaching 2 mpa to equally compare the actual impact of water deficits for different orchards an integral of tree water status indicators over time should be calculated galindo et al 2017 however such data sets were not available for this review withholding irrigation before harvest for mollar de elche pomegranate trees for 15 25 or 34 days decreased marketable yield 37 8 t ha 1 by 38 49 and 69 respectively whereas yield was comparable for the well watered control and where irrigation was withheld for 6 days table 4 galindo et al 2014b part of the yield decrease was due to c 14 lower fruit weight in these treatments compared to fruit in the control 293 g fruit reduced expansion of fruit was attributed to severe water deficits which resulted in fruit turgor loss in spain sdi of mollar de elche applied at 50 etc did not affect yield but it decreased fruit weight by 22 relative to trees irrigated at 100 etc throughout the season intrigliolo et al 2012 2013 laribi et al 2013 table 4 in iran the effect of sdi at 50 etc was much more severe for seven year old cv shavar selahvarzi et al 2017 table 5 yield decreased for two consecutive seasons by 36 and 52 relative to the 100 etc treatment due to 14 and 30 less fruit and on average 17 lower fruit weight in california yield of the cv wonderful deficit irrigated from bearing stage was not affected until the third year of treatment centofanti et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 sustained deficit irrigation at 75 etc increased yield of the then five year old trees marginally compared to a 100 etc control whereas sdi at 50 etc did not have any significant effect table 4 zhang et al 2017 sustained deficit irrigation at 35 etc however decreased yield compared to the 100 etc by 34 due to an almost 22 decrease in fruit weight and 16 less fruit compared to the fully irrigated trees the difference in yield response of trees to a 50 etc sdi treatment in the various studies may be attributed to differences in cultivar drought tolerance crop load and climatic conditions but also to irrigation management practices and the resultant soil water availability for the cv shavar no information is available on the drip irrigation frequency applied by selahvarzi et al 2017 however in the study of centofanti et al 2017b and zhang et al 2017 for example drip irrigation was applied at different depletion levels with percentage daily use being accumulated to a threshold of 4 mm etc irrigation of similar depth was therefore applied at different frequencies for different treatments to the whole root zone in the case of parvizi et al 2014 irrigation was applied every four days only to one side of the tree with different durations to realise the treatment etc levels in the research of intrigliolo et al 2012 irrigation frequency changed during the season from once a week in spring to five times a week in summer but was similar for treatments for which irrigation duration was varied to realise the different etc levels such differences should be borne in mind when results of different research studies are compared in iran prd with a four day irrigation interval applied at 75 etc improved yield of the cv rabab by c 7 through 10 more fruit of comparable size compared to trees which received 100 etc parvizi et al 2014 table 5 however 50 etc prd as well as di applied at 75 and 50 etc to only one side of the tree decreased yield by 16 11 and 30 respectively compared to where 100 etc was applied water deficits in the 50 di treatment reduced fruit number by 25 and fruit weight by almost 20 in greece 50 etc prd applied to one side of wonderful trees from two months after bud break also decreased fruit weight compared to where 100 etc was applied to the full root zone but to lesser extent compared to that for rabab in the parvizi study noitsakis et al 2016 table 5 apart from rdi and sdi applied relative to etc or eto tables 4 5 table 6 list research studies which defined irrigation levels relative to pan evaporation afria et al 1998 dinc et al 2018 haneef et al 2014 or applied different amounts of water with without soil conditioner khattab et al 2011 2014 whereas others evaluated the effect of irrigation interval and or duration in combination with soil management practices ghosh et al 2013 seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 for young ganesh trees maximum yield was achieved where 40 of evaporated water was replaced while application of more water promoted competition between vegetative and fruit growth which decreased yield fig 2 afria et al 1998 yield of four year old high density planted bhagwa trees decreased by c 11 and 24 when irrigation replaced only 75 and 50 of pan evaporation every second day instead of 100 haneef et al 2014 table 6 the yield decrease was due to c 9 and 21 less fruit and reduced fruit weight of c 3 and 6 in the respective treatments compared to where 100 of the water requirement was applied in turkey during three seasons sdi at 50 ep reduced yield of hicaznar trees irrigated at either three or six day intervals by between 34 and 37 dinc et al 2018 table 6 yield of trees irrigated at 75 compared to 125 ep decreased by 18 5 in the first season and tended to be lower in the third table 6 fruit weight did not differ significantly between the different well watered 100 and 125 ep and sdi 75 and 50 ep treatments and averaged 473 494 and 555 g during the three experimental seasons the lower yield at the sdi trees was attributed to less fruit compared to those of the 100 and 125 ep trees in egypt during two consecutive seasons increasing irrigation application to 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees from 280 to 600 mm per season resulted in c 55 more fruit while yield more than doubled khattab et al 2011 also in egypt a comparison of the effect of three irrigation intervals 2 4 and 6 days 20 l h 1 emitters and three soil mulching practices under the trees control without mulch bitumen mulch and olive pomace mulch on nine year old manfalouty pomegranate indicated that highest yield was obtained with olive pomace mulch and an irrigation interval of 6 days seidhom and abd el rahman 2011 in india comparison of three drip irrigation treatments of different duration at two day intervals with or without mulch basin irrigation and a life saving irrigation with straw mulching found that fruit yield of 7 year old ruby trees was the highest at 3 hours drip irrigation without mulch ghosh et al 2013 8 fruit and product quality water deficits can affect pomegranate fruit and product quality by changing its appearance taste and or beneficial health effects and thereby impact its marketability three main markets exist for pomegranate fruit namely fresh consumption processing mainly arils and juice and the medicinal industry alcaraz mármol et al 2017 for producers to be profitable different consumer preferences need to be complied with borochov neori et al 2009 apart from high antioxidant capacity important fruit quality attributes include size colour juiciness taste flavour and seed hardness fawole and opara 2013 whereas aril colour total soluble solids tss and titratable acid ta contents are generally used for fruit quality assessment fawole and opara 2013 holland et al 2009 8 1 appearance 8 1 1 colour reasons for increased fruit colour in trees that experienced water stress during ripening may be increased soluble solids content which may be related to increased anthocyanin synthesis reduced vegetative growth which may improve exposure of fruit to sunlight leading to increased red colour and water stress per se which may have promoted colour pigment synthesis laribi et al 2013 mollar de elche trees irrigated daily at 33 eto during the second half of rapid fruit growth up until the last harvest had fruit with darker more reddish more bluish and more intense garnet colour than trees irrigated at 105 eto galindo et al 2014a likewise moderate water stress induced by a rdi growers practice table 1 increased peel red colour of marketable fruit from the first harvest by three to five fold compared to the control and where no irrigation was applied during the second half of linear fruit growth reflecting earlier ripening mellisho et al 2012 in addition the red colour of the arils was between 29 and 39 more intense compared to these treatments with the red colour of arils from fruit where irrigation was withheld during the second half of linear fruit growth being the poorest cano lamadrid et al 2018 found inferior red colour of juice for both mollar de elche and wonderful trees subjected to mild water stress after being irrigated at 60 etc during fruit growth and ripening according to martínez nícolás et al 2019 withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set for both mollar de elche and wonderful did not affect fruit peel colour but increased aril red greenness for the cv wonderful no irrigation until fruit set also increased the chroma of arils bartual et al 2015a comparing a control 100 etc throughout the season sdi 50 etc and rdi 25 etc during flowering and fruit set linear fruit growth and ripening respectively followed by 100 etc during the rest of the season found that the peel of fruit from trees subjected to sdi had the most intense red colour followed by those subjected to rdi during ripening the sdi resulted in more intense red and darker fruit at harvest and during the refrigerated storage period but during shelf life the fruit colour tended toward an overall yellow colour although the sdi fruit was still more red than those from the other treatments laribi et al 2013 likewise mena et al 2013 found that fruit under moderate water stress sdi at 43 eto had juice with more yellowness whereas juice of fruit under severe water stress had a more intense yellow colour with less intense red colour and higher luminosity than fruit irrigated at 75 eto or subjected to 43 eto sdi peña estévez et al 2015 also found that aril colour of fruit subjected to irrigation withholding for 16 and 26 days prior to harvest was less saturated and turned slightly to red orange compared to fruit from trees irrigated at 120 eto in contrast to the findings of bartual et al 2015a b for mollar de elche fruit peel of young bearing cv wonderful trees was lighter in colour with lower red greenness where trees were subjected to 35 etc sdi compared to where irrigation was applied at 100 75 and 50 etc levels centofanti et al 2017b in conclusion moderate water stress during the second part of fruit growth generally has positive effects on fruit skin and aril colour whereas severe water deficits may result in inferior aril colour and yellowing of fruit juice 8 1 2 juice yield and rind thickness water deficits with few exceptions appeared to decrease pomegranate peel thickness and reduce fruit juice content for the cv manfalouty the percentage fruit peel increased significantly where 280 mm irrigation water was applied per season compared to 360 and 440 mm khattab et al 2014 in the case of rabab di and prd strategies 75 and 50 etc did not affect aril or peel percentages or juice density compared to a fully irrigated control parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 however irrigating high density four year old cv bhagwa trees at 75 and 50 ep reduced juice content by 10 2 and 20 2 and decreased the rind thickness by 15 1 and 38 1 compared to where the 100 ep was applied haneef et al 2014 for shavar the aril peel ratio increased significantly where no irrigation was applied until fruit set and 50 etc sdi was applied compared to that of trees receiving 100 etc throughout the season selahvarzi et al 2017 severe drought stress during fruit growth resulted in reduced peel weight which increased the aril peel ratio selahvarzi et al 2017 according to mellisho et al 2012 irrigating mollar de elche according to growers practice by applying 74 eto during the second half of linear fruit growth and 36 eto during the end of fruit growth and ripening induced reduced peel content of fruit at the second harvest compared to the control however this di strategy did not affect the fruit moisture content relative to the well watered control mellisho et al 2012 juice yield of the same cultivar was compared to fruit from trees receiving 100 etc during the whole season also not affected by sdi at 50 etc or rdi at 25 etc during various phenological phases followed by 100 etc during the remainder of the season laribi et al 2013 for the cv rabab juice percentage was significantly higher in fruit of trees subjected to 75 or 50 etc prd compared to 50 etc di applied to one side of the root zone whereas it tended to be higher compared to fruit of the well watered control parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 juice density was not significantly affected by the di nor by the prd irrigation strategies the percentage juice of manfalouty fruit also decreased where the seasonal irrigation amount was reduced from 440 and 360 mm to 280 mm khattab et al 2014 juice percentage of wonderful fruit subjected to 100 etc and 50 etc applied to one side of the root zone were not affected relative to that of trees applying 100 etc to the whole root zone noitsakis et al 2016 in contrast to the aforementioned research fruit juice percentage of shavar pomegranate trees subjected to rdi no irrigation until fruit set 100 etc remainder of season increased by c 10 compared to fruit of trees receiving 100 etc and 50 etc sdi selahvarzi et al 2017 decreased fruit juice percentage of fruit from the sdi treatment was attributed to fewer arils and lower juiciness as a result of water deficits 8 1 3 organoleptic rating sensory analysis showed that arils from mollar de elche fruit from trees where water was withheld for 16 and 26 days before harvest showed higher visual appearance and overall quality scores than arils from fruit of fully irrigated trees whereas di appeared to increase the shelf life of arils by four days compared to the 14 days for fully irrigated trees peña estévez et al 2015 arils of mollar de elche fruit subjected to irrigation withholding 16 days prior to harvest also had 9 higher firmness compared to that of trees irrigated at 120 etc or where irrigation was withheld for 26 days peña estévez et al 2015 on the other hand arils from fruit subjected to water withholding for 26 days prior to harvest had higher colour scores compared to those where water was withheld for 16 days or which were fully irrigated which had similar scores peña estévez et al 2015 comparing growers rdi practice to non limiting soil water conditions sensory analysis also indicated that fruit of the di treatment had improved visual appearance colour flavour and overall sensory quality after storage for 14 days at 5 c compared to fruit from the fully irrigated trees independent of the pre processing storage period peña estévez et al 2016 in contrast di had a detrimental effect on fruit quality of the young high density planted cv bhagwa the organoleptic rating of fruit from trees irrigated at 75 and 50 ep decreased by 13 and 23 6 respectively compared to where the 100 ep was applied haneef et al 2014 8 1 4 cracking the main physiological disorder of pomegranate is fruit cracking which occurs when the fruit peel or cuticle fractures or split khadivi khub 2015 fruit cracking may be triggered by irregular and insufficient irrigation or by excessive rainfall especially during fruit ripening cracks reduce marketability and provide fruit access for pests and diseases causing significant income loss in the fresh market and processing industries pomegranate fruit morphological properties significantly related to fruit cracking included fruit volume and shape oblate vs spheroid the skin to fruit weight ratio as well as the aril to fruit weight ratio but not skin thickness saei et al 2014 larger fruit fruit with a ratio of fruit length to diameter of less than one and fruit containing more or larger seeds were more susceptible to cracking in addition calcium affects the biomechanical behaviour of the fruit skin and excessive calcium content may increase cracking rate according to galindo et al and references therein 2014b water stress can alter peel mechanical properties resulting in less extensibility and increased stiffness and thickness also mellisho et al and references therein 2012 indicated that decreased peel content may be related to fruit splitting incidence pomegranate cultivars differ in sensitivity to cracking hepaksoy et al 2000 khadivi khub 2015 with some crack resistant varieties displaying higher leaf level water use efficiency compared to sensitive ones hepaksoy et al 2000 intrigliolo et al 2013 found minimal cracking of mollar de elche fruit 2 6 of fruit per tree over three seasons with 25 etc rdi during fruit growth in the second season increasing cracking significantly relative to the 100 etc treatment in contrast the percentage mollar de elche fruit with cracked peels relative to total yield progressively increased with the water withholding period before harvest for 6 15 25 and 34 days being c 21 c 28 c 51 and c 64 respectively galindo et al 2014b cracking of fruit was attributed to an asymmetric increase in fruit turgor pressure after 88 4 mm rainfall occurred 10 12 days before harvest the turgor pressure of the arils increasing to a much greater extent than turgor pressure of the peel resulting in cracking for cv wonderful trees applying 100 etc to only one side of the root zone partial root zone drying caused relatively stable plant water status during the growing period which reduced fruit cracking from c 11 where irrigation was applied at 100 etc to the whole root zone or 50 etc to only one side of the root zone to c 8 of fruit noitsakis et al 2016 for rabab fruit cracking of trees irrigated at 75 or 50 etc prd was slightly less or comparable respectively to that of trees irrigated at 100 etc 6 1 of fruit parvizi et al 2014 however 75 and 50 etc di applied to only one side of the tree increased fruit cracking relative to the well watered trees by 1 5 and 4 respectively in egypt during two consecutive seasons increasing irrigation application to 20 year old manfalouty pomegranate trees from 280 mm to 520 mm per season decreased fruit cracking gradually from 8 6 and 9 by up to c 2 9 less whereas application of 600 mm per season only reduced cracking by 0 3 and 0 7 relative to the driest treatment khattab et al 2011 in both seasons the treatment that received the least water had the highest fruit cracking 8 6 and 9 respectively followed by the treatment that received the most water in iran for the cv post sefid darjazin application of irrigation during two consecutive seasons at 14 day intervals resulted in 19 9 and 32 8 cracking compared to 7 1 and 11 where irrigation was applied at seven day intervals ghanbarpour et al 2019 8 1 5 sunburn research regarding the effect of irrigation on sunburn levels of pomegranate fruit was very limited and results varied with seasons where mollar de elche trees were subjected to 25 etc rdi during different phenological phases or to 50 etc sdi over three seasons the effect of di on sunburn was not obvious intrigliolo et al 2013 in the second season of treatment sdi fruit had higher sunburn levels c 16 of fruit compared to well watered control 13 of fruit and where rdi was applied during ripening 12 9 of fruit however during the third season fruit subjected to rdi during flowering and fruit set had higher sunburn levels compared to the control whereas it was comparable between the sdi and control trees 8 1 6 physiological disorders and decay incidence laribi et al 2013 and bartual et al 2015a in comparing a well watered control 50 etc sdi and 25 etc rdi treatments during flowering until fruit set linear fruit growth and ripening respectively found no significant differences among treatments with regard to rind sinking after 8 weeks at 5 c and 7 days of shelf life at 20 c but sdi fruit were less susceptible to external pitting and blemishes than the rdi and control treatments after 19 weeks of cold storage and the subsequent week of shelf life at 20 c sdi reduced external physiological disorders manifested as peel pitting blemishes and sinking to between slight and moderate whereas for the rest of the treatments external physiological disorders were manifested as moderate to severe aril browning was significantly lower in sdi fruit compared to the other treatments irrigation treatments had no effect on decay incidence weight loss increased with storage time and after 19 weeks at 5 c plus the complementary shelf life period fruit subjected to sdi and rdi during ripening showed the lowest weight loss value compared to the control treatment 8 2 taste 8 2 1 total soluble solids in terms of tss 1 brix is considered a meaningful increment in the perception of fruit flavour laribi et al and references therein 2013

fully irrigated control and 75 etc di and prd strategies parvizi and sepaskhah 2015 for the cv wonderful application of 100 etc to only one side of the root zone instead of to the entire root zone increased tss by 0 8 brix whereas applying 50 etc to one side of the root zone did not affect tss relative to the control significantly noitsakis et al 2016 in spain withholding irrigation during flowering and fruit set also had no effect on tss of fruit at harvest martínez nícolás et al 2019 the tss of fruit from fully irrigated young bearing wonderful trees were significantly higher in the first season of di under conditions of recurrent drought and high temperatures compared to trees subjected to 75 50 and 35 etc sdi with no differences in tss during the following season centofanti et

40 of evaporated water juice tss of adult mollar de elche trees irrigated daily at 33 eto during the second half of rapid fruit growth until the last harvest tended to be higher relative to the 16 4 brix of well watered trees at the first harvest but increased by 1 4 and 1 7 brix relative to the 16 2 brix of the control at the two following harvests galindo et al 2014a for the same cultivar when irrigation was withheld from 26 days before harvest the juice tss was slightly higher 4 compared to those from fully irrigated trees whereas withholding irrigation from 16 days prior to harvest did not have a significant effect peña estévez et al 2015 when mollar de elche trees were subjected to 50 etc sdi and 25 etc rdi during various phenological phases the tss ranged at harvest between 16 5 and 17 5 brix and decreased during storage bartual et al 2015a laribi et al 2013 the sdi and rdi strategy applied during ripening resulted in the highest tss at harvest as well as after cold storage for 8 and 19 weeks respectively followed by a seven day shelf life period bartual et al 2015a at the end of the storage and shelf life period tss increased relative to the well watered control by 0 7 brix for fruit from rdi during fruit growth or ripening stages and by 0 9 brix for the sdi treatment irrigation of 10 year old mollar de elche trees according a growers rdi strategy increased fruit tss at the first harvest by 1 4 and 1 2 brix compared to that of a well watered control 15 5 brix and trees where irrigation was withheld during the second half of linear fruit growth 15 7 brix reflecting earlier ripening mellisho et al 2012 this trend was not evident in fruit of the second harvest for which tss ranged between 16 1 and 16 6 brix the tss of pomegranate arils processed at

initial tss value peña estévez et al 2016 in contrast to the aforementioned studies where water deficits significantly changed fruit tss levels the tss of fruit from adult mollar de elche trees was not affected by sdi resulting in moderate 43 eto and severe 12 eto water deficits mena et al 2013 furthermore irrigation applied at 125 100 75 and 50 of ep at three and six day irrigation intervals

mean ψs during fruit growth stage conflicting results of water deficits on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity may be due to differences in cultivars age of trees harvest time and drought severity selahvarzi et al 2017 in addition differences in the mechanical fruit juice extracting process centofanti et al 2017a mphahlele et al 2016 and agro environmental conditions may also play a role centofanti et al 2017b 9 conclusions in general mild and severe water deficits in pomegranate trees were related to ψsm values of between 1 5 to 1 8 mpa and c 2 to 2 8 mpa respectively which could decrease stomatal conductance by between 19 to 36 and 53 to 77 relative to well watered trees water deficits decreased vegetative growth and applied over several seasons can depending on the degree and duration thereof have a cumulative effect on canopy development and in the long term affect orchard productivity for some cultivars mild water deficits during flowering and fruit set can limit shoot growth without significantly reducing yield pomegranates have depending on cultivar a linear to sigmoidal fruit growth pattern and severe water deficits affect fruit growth rate compared to that of well watered trees with minor differences late in the fruit growth stage maximum relative yield of pomegranates trees was achieved where between 721 and 953 mm etc occurred with relative yield decreasing non linearly with etc below an etc of 721 mm in general relative yield for selected cultivars decreased by 24 34 and 45 if ψsm decreased by 0 5 1 and 1 8 mpa relative to that of well watered trees yield typically decreased due to less fruit and or fruit of lower weight flowering and fruit set compared to fruit growth and ripening appears to be a less critical phenological period for application of water saving di strategies with regard to fruit and product quality the appearance taste and health properties of fruit were affected by various di strategies for selected cultivars the tss in fruit juice increased as ψsm decreased with regard to fruit skin and juice colour and bioactive compounds di studies produced conflicting results moderate stress during the second part of fruit growth generally had positive effects on fruit skin and aril colour whereas severe water deficits resulted in poor aril colour and yellowing of fruit juice in some cases for some di strategies improved red colour of fruit skin and or juice was obtained at the expense of fruit size and economic income differences in pomegranate tree physiological growth and yield responses to water deficits may be attributed to diverse cultivar drought tolerance crop load climatic conditions irrigation water quality soil water management practices and the resultant soil water availability for a large component of the existing pomegranate irrigation research studies direct comparison of results is prohibited by lack of information on the actual soil water deficits induced and differences in measurement protocols applied of which the latter may be dictated by industry practice and or availability of research equipment research with a soil plant atmosphere continuum approach that quantifies the evaporative demand tree water status as well as the actual soil water deficits that develop as a result of the irrigation strategies employed could aid in better understanding of the tree response to water deficits this knowledge is fundamental to formulate appropriate irrigation strategies to achieve optimal water use productivity variable results with different systems and different cultivars in different countries clearly show that results from one study cannot simply be applied to another area where conditions and cultivar types may not be the same this emphasises the

10244,nitrate leaching from agricultural fields is a significant contributor of groundwater pollution globally threatening drinking water resources and downstream ecosystems quantifying nitrate leaching driven by variable climate soils and management practices is challenging but it is critical for developing sustainable agricultural production systems while irrigation and fertilizer best management practices bmps have been widely implemented to reduce agricultural nitrate leaching their ability to meet environmental protection goals remains uncertain in this study we used the soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate crop yields and nitrate leaching for corn peanut rotations under a variety of nutrient and irrigation management practices in the suwannee river basin florida where groundwater feeds springs that are protected by a federally mandated nutrient criteria of 0 35 mg l nitrate nitrogen no3 n data from a field experiment of nine irrigation and nitrogen n management treatments were used to calibrate swat with good to excellent results nash sutcliffe efficiencies from 0 72 to 0 97 for soil moisture 0 85 0 96 for crop yield 0 48 0 96 for crop n uptake and 0 15 0 82 for soil nitrate the calibrated model was then used to quantify differences in crop yields irrigation applied and nitrate leaching among practices over a range of historical weather soil moisture sensor based irrigation with 246 kg n ha for corn and 0 kg n ha for peanut had no statistical difference in yields compared to common practices in the region calendar based irrigation fertilization of 336 kg n ha corn and 17 kg n ha peanut while reducing n leaching by 40 and irrigation applied by 45 reductions of 70 kg n ha yr and 300 mm year respectively planting a rye cover crop reduced leaching by an additional 50 n ha yr for all treatments these results show the potential for widespread adoption of nutrient and water conservation practices to achieve the reductions in no3 n load needed to meet environmental and regulatory goals without impacting crop yields keywords soil moisture nitrate leaching crop yield irrigation corn peanut rotation irrigation and nutrient management practices cover crops swat 1 introduction agricultural intensification and extensification to meet the food demands of a growing global population has led to elevated groundwater pumping and nitrogen n fertilizer usage worldwide spalding and exner 1993 vitousek et al 1997 synthetic and animal waste based n fertilizers are used in most agricultural operations to enhance plant growth motavalli et al 2008 but excessive application may increase the risk of nitrate loading to groundwater singh et al 1995 nolan and ruddy 1996 erisman et al 2008 the adverse effects of elevated nitrate concentrations on human health de la monte et al 2009 and the environment mitsch et al 1999 bowen et al 2007 have prompted regulators to establish limits of allowable nitrate concentration in groundwater and surface water meeting these criteria can be challenging since they often require widespread changes in water and nutrient management practices and the effects of these changes can take decades to manifest in receiving waters vero et al 2017 van meter et al 2018 local assessment and modeling of management practice changes that provide for agricultural sustainability while maintaining groundwater quality are thus necessary to develop informed and effective watershed management strategies connectivity between agricultural lands and the underlying aquifer plays a significant role in the mass of nitrate leaching to groundwater kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 important factors include soil drainage characteristics depth to water table crop type and mass of n in applied fertilizer nitrate concentrations are typically higher under agricultural fields with well drained soils overlying highly permeable aquifers nolan 2001 for example high concentrations of nitrate are often found in karst aquifers where discrete fractures and conduits can rapidly transmit large volumes of nitrate enriched water with little attenuation vesper et al 2001 doerfliger et al 1999 the vulnerability of karst aquifers to nutrients from agriculture has been well documented boyer and pasquarell 1995 1996 panno et al 2001 peterson et al 2002 however effective management strategies to minimize the nitrate loading to karst aquifers must be developed considering local economies and hydrogeologic settings coxon 2011 development and application of robust models to support decision making is especially important in karstic regions where wide variation in travel times can cause lags of years to decades between practice implementation and surface water quality improvement meals et al 2010 amin et al 2017 fenton et al 2017 the karstic upper floridan aquifer ufa is one of the most productive aquifers in the world it is the major source of public water supply and irrigation in north and central florida bush and johnston 1988 supporting a productive agricultural economy and supplying more than 10 million people with drinking water large portions of the ufa are characterized by unconfined hydraulically connected carbonate rocks with high permeability and transmissivities which allow nutrients to leach into the aquifer and quickly travel long distances bush and johnston 1988 arthur et al 2007 agriculture and silviculture are the predominant land uses in the suwanee river basin srb that overlies the ufa in north florida increases in population and changes in land use across florida have shifted the srb toward more intensive agriculture practices such as row crops cow calf operations dairy and poultry farms fdep 2012 which has resulted in increased nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations in the ufa fdacs 2015 2018 harrington et al 2010 hochmuth et al 2014 the region also has a high density of large freshwater springs supplied with water from the ufa nitrate n concentrations in ufa springs have increased over the last 40 years from background concentrations of 0 1 mg l no3 n to above 5 mg l no3 n in some springs katz 2004 katz et al 1999 heffernan et al 2010 in response to increasing no3 n concentrations and spring ecosystem degradation a numeric nutrient criteria nnc of 0 35 mg l no3 n was set for water emanating from ufa springs 62 302 530 47 b f a c fdep 2013 total maximum daily loads tmdls epa us environmental protection agency 2016 required to achieve the nnc were then estimated and basin management action plans bmaps required to meet the tmdl have been established for ufa springs not meeting the nnc current bmaps for the srb estimate that synthetic fertilizer is the largest no3 n source to springs and specify load reductions ranging from 35 fdep 2012 to 88 fdep 2018 to meet the nnc in this regulatory setting a quantitative assessment of the effects of alternative water and nutrient management practices on crop yield irrigation water requirements and no3 n leaching is needed to determine whether adoption of agricultural bmps can achieve the load reductions mandated to achieve the nnc critically nnc have been partially or fully developed for 29 us states and territories epa us environmental protection agency 2016 and are widely adopted across europe as part of the european water framework directive poikane et al 2019 across regions developing effective nutrient mitigation approaches to meet these environmental standards while also meeting human food demand is a grand global challenge robertson and swinton 2005 davidson et al 2015 with agricultural water management at its core agricultural bmps have been widely proposed to reduce adverse water quality impacts both globally liu et al 2017 and in the srb fdep 2012 however determining the effectiveness of these practices for reducing n leaching and meeting regional water quality goals is an on going challenge due to difficulties in quantifying nutrient fate and transport processes chaubey et al 2010 for instance measuring n fertilizer transformations and losses e g leaching volatilization and denitrification is expensive time consuming and difficult due to variability in weather soil properties and agricultural management practices across fields mulla et al 2004 given these challenges computer simulation models are commonly used to leverage field observations and improve estimates of the fate and transport of water and nutrients xie et al 2015 however data intensive model calibration and validation for the specific soil climate and agricultural management conditions being modeled must be performed for models to be effective ramos and carbonell 1991 and trusted by stakeholders karki et al 2019 this work leverages a uniquely robust experimental dataset zamora et al 2018 2020 to provide quantitative estimates of long term changes in crop yield water use and no3 n leaching under alternate management scenarios this effort is part of longer term project that is bringing together scientists regulators agricultural producers and non governmental organizations to collaboratively evaluate tradeoffs among crop production water quality and water quantity associated with alternative land use and land and water management strategies the coupled swat modflow model aliyari et al 2019 wei et al 2018 was selected as the platform for this analysis because complex surface groundwater interactions in the karst watershed require explicit modeling of the groundwater system and its interaction with surface waters which are not rigorously represented in typical agricultural watershed models such as swat arabi et al 2008 bieger et al 2014 cerro et al 2014 gassman et al 2014 francesconi et al 2016 agnps young et al 1989 or epic williams et al 1989 thus the immediate goal of this study was to assess whether swat can provide reliable groundwater recharge and nutrient leaching fluxes to modflow while also producing accurate crop yields for subsequent economic environmental tradeoff analyses while other field scale agricultural models e g dssat jones et al 2003 hydrus 1 d simunek et al 2008 leaching estimation and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1992 and root zone water quality model rzwqm usda ars 1992a may be more biophysically rigorous than swat none of these models are integrated with hydrologic models that can simulate the complex watershed scale surface water groundwater interactions that are important in the study area the overall goal of this study was to use swat to simulate the long term response of crop yield crop n uptake irrigation requirements and no3 n leaching under different irrigation n fertilization and cover crop management practices for a corn peanut rotation the most common row crop rotation in the srb usda 2012 specific objectives were to 1 calibrate swat using observations from a three year irrigation and n fertilizer rate management experiment for a corn peanut rotation conducted in live oak florida zamora et al 2018 2020 2 evaluate the long term effects of the experimental irrigation and fertilization treatments on annual yield n uptake irrigation applied and no3 n leaching using calibrated parameters over a 39 year 1980 2018 historic weather record and 3 estimate the effect of planting a rye cover crop on no3 n leaching irrigation water use and yield in corn peanut rotations future studies will aggregate these practices to the watershed scale to determine the ability of changes in agricultural management practices to achieve the no3 n loading reductions required to meet the federally mandated nnc in the srb this work provides a framework for developing effective socially acceptable strategies for achieving stringent water quality regulations while maintaining a robust agricultural economy that is transferrable to other agricultural watersheds throughout the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the experimental field site is located at the north florida research and education center suwannee valley nfrec sv near live oak florida 30 31 n 82 90 w fig 1 the field is at an elevation of 49 50 m above mean sea level and has flat topography with an average slope of less than 0 5 the site consists of three types of well drained soil chipley hurricane and blanton sand ssurgo soil survey geographic database nrcs 2016 soils in the southern portion of the site are mostly chipley while those in the northern portion are mostly hurricane fig 1 the site was divided into two systems based on the timing of rotation system 1 southern portion of the site was a corn peanut corn rotation planted during 2015 17 and system 2 northern portion was a peanut corn peanut rotation grown during the same period in this manuscript results and analysis from system 1 are presented in detail results from system 2 were very similar and are thus summarized in the body of the paper and fully documented in the supplemental material systems 1 and 2 were divided into four blocks i e replicates b1 b4 each containing fifteen 12 2 mx6 1 m 74 4 m2 plots fig 1 each plot received a different irrigation management strategy n 5 and n fertilizer rate n 3 resulting in 15 treatments each with 4 replicates in this study the subset of these plots that had most field observations were selected to develop the model this subset included 9 treatments 3 irrigation methods and 3 fertilizer rates table 1 complete documentation of the field experiment can be found in zamora et al 2018 the three irrigation methods consisted of calendar based irrigation soil moisture sensor based irrigation and no irrigation rainfed calendar based irrigation for corn consisted of no irrigation for the first 30 days after planting dap unless severely windy conditions caused blowing sand to burn the plants beginning on 31 dap a target amount of 25 mm week was established that could be made up of rain or irrigation if rain events were 13 mm for 40 59 dap a 41 mm week target was established one irrigation event was skipped if 13 20 mm rainfall occurred and two irrigation events were skipped if 20 mm of rain occurred for 60 105 dap a 61 mm week irrigation target was used one irrigation event was skipped if 13 25 mm of rain occurred the day prior to a scheduled irrigation and two irrigation events were skipped if 25 mm of rain occurred finally around 105 dap at full dent stage weekly irrigation targets were reduced to 41 mm week for one week and 20 mm week for another week until finally irrigation was terminated at 115 dap individual irrigation events were 13 mm a similar calendar based irrigation schedule was applied during the peanut growing season this consisted of no irrigation from 0 to 30 dap from 31 to 44 dap 25 mm week was applied unless rainfall provided target irrigation amount from 45 to 64 dap 38 mm week was applied however if rainfall between 13 and 19 mm occurred one irrigation event was skipped and if rainfall 19 mm occurred two events were skipped finally from 65 to 135 dap 51 mm week was applied one irrigation event was skipped if 13 25 mm of rain occurred and two irrigation events were skipped if 25 mm of rain occurred individual irrigation events were 10 mm for the soil moisture sensor sms based irrigation scheduling the volumetric soil water content vwc was monitored continuously using sensors irrigation was triggered when the maximum allowable depletion mad was 50 of the difference between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp the irrigation volume required to refill the active root depth to field capacity was estimated according to guidelines proposed by zotarelli et al 2013 active root depth was varied throughout the season based on root development the three n fertilizer treatments consisted of high medium and low application rates 336 246 and 157 kg n ha for corn respectively the high fertilizer application rate of 336 kg n ha for corn and 17 kg n ha peanut is a common grower practice in the region zamora et al 2018 the medium rate closely follows the university of florida institute for food and agricultural sciences uf ifas recommendations 235 kg n ha for irrigated corn and 0 kg ha for peanut hochmuth et al 1992 mylavarapu et al 2015 the low n represents the minimum n required to establish the corn crop in the low water holding capacity low organic matter and low cation exchange capacity sandy soils at the field site for corn an extra application of up to 17 kg n ha was made within the first four weeks after planting if 76 100 mm of rainfall occurred in a week fdacs 2015 the fertilizer composition and application schedule is presented in table s1 2 2 data collection and processing table s2 summarizes the type location and frequency of data collected from each plot soil moisture content was obtained from sentek drill and drop capacitance probes sentek pty ltd 2003 installed in three replicates blocks 2 3 and 4 in each of the nine treatments fig 1 each probe consists of nine sensors placed every 100 mm interval up to 900 mm probes recorded data every 30 min which were averaged to daily values of soil moisture storage for comparison with swat daily output the sentek probes were calibrated at the factory after installation at the field site the sentek soil moisture measurements were checked against observed volumetric water content estimated using gravimetric water content measured from soil cores within the same replicate and bulk density measured at the field site to verify the factory calibration and establish their reliability for use in model calibration and validation soil nitrate n was collected from all plots at four depths 0 150 150 300 300 600 and 600 900 mm throughout the rotation aboveground biomass and nitrogen uptake were collected at key growth stages from all plots under sms based irrigation detailed information about the data collection procedures is provided in zamora et al 2018 soil properties measured at the site are summarized in table s3 2 3 model description swat is a semi distributed continuous process based watershed scale model used to evaluate the impact of different land management practices on surface and subsurface water quality and quantity sediment and agricultural yields arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2004 gassman et al 2014 for spatial representation swat delineates a watershed into hydrological response units hrus which are homogenous regions with similar slope land use and soil type neitsch et al 2011 winchell et al 2013 hrus can be used for field or plot level estimation of nitrate leaching crop yield evapotranspiration and other management practice assessments neitsch et al 2004 anand et al 2007 gitau et al 2008 sinnathamby et al 2017 moloney et al 2015 cibin et al 2015 karki et al 2019 swat has two infiltration schemes the curve number cn method at daily intervals and the green ampt method when hourly precipitation data are available cn based infiltration was used in this study swat simulates the movement of infiltrated flow between soil layers using a storage routing tipping bucket method which allows downward movement or percolation of saturated flow when field capacity of a soil layer is exceeded and the underlying layer is not saturated arnold et al 2012 mapfumo et al 2004 soil moisture distribution below field capacity is governed by plant water uptake and soil water evaporation through two parameters the soil evaporation compensation coefficient esco and the plant uptake compensation factor epco respectively vazquez amabile and engel 2005 neitsch et al 2011 the crop growth algorithm in swat is based on the environmental impact policy climate epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 neitsch et al 2004 swat calculates the potential growth of the plant for each day as a function of solar radiation and leaf area index lai actual growth and lai are dependent on stress factors including water temperature and nutrient stress swat computes the accumulation of heat units until the crop attains maturity after which crop growth ceases nair et al 2011 2 4 model setup in this study swat version 2012 rev664 was applied at the plot scale for the calibration and validation of soil and crop parameters following the approaches of anand et al 2007 maski et al 2008 marek et al 2016 2017 and chen et al 2017 the experimental area fig 1 was auto delineated into one basin with three hrus one per irrigation treatment using the usgs 30 m dem digital elevation map usda nrcs ssurgo soil map and usda nass cropland data layer cdl these hrus were converted to plots of equal size 74 4 m2 by adjusting the area in the sub basin input file and the fraction of area of hru in the hru input file marek et al 2016 moloney et al 2015 karki et al 2019 each hru was provided with information regarding management practices conducted in the experimental study period e g planting date irrigation and fertilizer schedules and harvest date the default ssurgo soil data of soil bulk density soil texture and organic carbon were replaced with field measurements zamora et al 2018 for each hru table s3 the total root zone depth in each hru was set to 900 mm with four layers 0 150 mm 150 300 mm 300 600 mm and 600 900 mm for consistency with measured soil nitrate depth resolution the source of irrigation water at the experimental site is the upper floridian aquifer which is approximately 3 m below land surface usgs 1983 with no interaction with the root zone surface runoff was never observed during the experiment at this well drained site zamora et al 2018 thus the irrigation source was set to an unlimited source outside of the field scale model domain swat daily weather data i e rainfall temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed required for the penman monteith evapotranspiration module were obtained from the live oak florida automated weather network fawn located at the experimental site 30 305 lat 82 898 long https fawn ifas ufl edu missing data were filled using the swat weather generator neitsch et al 2011 2 5 calibration methodology crop growth simulation depends on both crop biophysical processes as well as soil moisture dynamics so model calibration and validation followed an integrated approach to predict both processes reasonably wang et al 2016 sinnathamby et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the data used for calibration versus validation is summarized in table 3 the calibration procedure is detailed below soil moisture was the first variable to be calibrated with default swat crop parameters the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup 2012 was used to calibrate and validate the model and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse was chosen as the objective function abbaspour et al 2018 the sufi 2 algorithm has been extensively used in the calibration of the swat model due to its easy implementation high flexibility in selecting parameters and the range for calibration and the reduced number of model runs needed to achieve good prediction yang et al 2008 malago et al 2015 for this study the methodology recommended in the swat cup user manual abbaspour 2013 and several swat cup calibration papers yang et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2015 2018 kamali et al 2017 were followed the initial range of soil parameters were selected based on literature values arnold et al 2012 and prior experiments conducted on similar soils in the region zotarelli et al 2007 prasad et al 2015 prasad and hochmuth 2016 sensitivity analysis was carried out within swat cup to determine sensitive parameters to be included in the calibration sentek soil moisture sensor data was used to calibrate total soil moisture storage in the entire root zone 900 mm at the daily scale during the cropping season because currently swat cup has no provision to calibrate the soil moisture storage for individual soil layers swat provides a simulated soil moisture only for the whole soil column output file which is utilized by swat cup for the auto calibration process soil and hydrological parameters were calibrated using daily soil moisture storage total soil moisture from 0 to 900 mm averaged across replicates for each high n irrigation treatment i e calendar sms and rain fed from 2015 to 2017 fig 1 after a three year warm up period to stabilize the initial hydrological condition the three high n irrigation treatments were selected for calibration to account for spatial variability in soil properties across a variety of moisture regimes under the assumption of plant growth under no n stress the calibrated soil parameters were then validated for each irrigation treatment in the medium and low n fertilizer treatments the three calibrated hrus with the high n management schedule were replaced with the medium and the low n fertilizer schedule for validation after best fit soil and hydrological parameters were identified crop parameters were calibrated using the above ground biomass data averaged across replicates of the sms high n treatments note that biomass was measured at key growth stages only for sms treatments table s2 sensitivity analysis of seasonal biomass growth to swat crop parameters was conducted to determine the most sensitive parameters after which the sensitive parameters were adjusted to reproduce the observed trend of crop growth in the high n fertilizer sms treatment calibrated parameter values were validated using data from the low and medium n fertility sms treatments the calibrated soil moisture parameters were further verified by re simulating with the final crop parameters field measured harvest indices i e average fraction of final biomass removed from the field across the treatment replicates for the sms and calendar high n treatments were used to estimate yield for both corn and peanut assuming yields were optimum without any water and nutrient stress neitsch et al 2004 for those treatments the default swat nitrogen uptake parameters pltnfr 1 n uptake at emergence pltnfr 2 n uptake at 50 maturity and pltnfr 3 n uptake at full maturity and default nitrogen transformation parameters were used in all simulations the adequacy of these parameters in simulating the n balance for the experiment was assessed by comparing measured and predicted n uptake by the crop and no3 n soil concentrations soil over time for each treatment system 1 calibrated crop parameters were also validated using system 2 data for all comparisons statistical indices such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias were used nse and rmse were estimated accounting for replicate measurement variability harmel and smith 2007 harmel et al 2010 using the software fitval https abe ufl edu faculty carpena software fiteval developed by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 these modified statistical indices are denoted here as nsem and rmsem pbias was estimated without measurement variability moriasi et al 2012 the performance indices were judged based on the criteria of satisfactory nsem 0 50 to very good nsem 0 75 set by moriasi et al 2007 2012 2 6 development of long term scenarios in order to estimate irrigation requirements nitrate leaching and crop yield over the wider range of historical weather conditions the corn peanut rotation was simulated for the nine experimental treatments using 39 years of north american land data assimilation system nldas historical weather data 1980 2018 using 1980 and 1981 as warmup period in addition scenarios were developed to estimate the potential reduction in nitrate leaching if a rye winter cover crop were planted instead of letting the land remain fallow between two subsequent crops swat default parameters of rye crop was used for long term scenario while many studies have shown that winter cover crops have benefits such as preventing soil erosion improving long term soil quality and enhancing carbon sequestration basche et al 2016 kaspar and singer 2011 moore et al 2014 the impact of cover crops on reducing nitrate leaching has not been fully established martinez feria et al 2016 dabney et al 2010 thorup kristensen and dresboll 2010 a calendar irrigation schedule was developed from the historic rainfall data following an approach suggested by university of florida extension specialists table s4 sensor based irrigation was simulated with the swat auto irrigation option based on plant water demand which triggers irrigation when the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration becomes less than the user defined threshold arnold et al 2013 after multiple simulation trials and comparison with the experimental soil moisture scheduling irrigation amounts and recommendations from stakeholders a 0 65 threshold was used for both corn and peanut with an irrigation application of 13 mm day for corn and 10 mm day for peanut split application of the three n fertilizer rates used in the field experiment table 1 s1 were applied using ammonium nitrate fertilizer as it is a common source of n fertilizer in the region for simplicity fixed planting and harvesting dates were adopted throughout the simulation period table 2 based on local practices and communication with extension specialists a rye cover crop planting and herbicide application schedule was incorporated into the simulations the agricultural management schedule for the corn and peanut rotation with and without the cover crop is presented in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation table 4 presents final calibrated values ranges and p values to indicate the sensitivity of parameters p 0 05 indicates a sensitive parameter available water content awc soil evaporation compensation factor esco and plant uptake compensation factor epco were the most sensitive soil and hydrological parameters notably saturated hydraulic conductivity and curve number were not sensitive parameters best fit parameters were similar though not identical between systems table 4 total heat units required to reach maturity heat units in this experiment maturity for corn was 135 days after planting and biomass to energy ratio bio e were the sensitive crop parameters which is in accordance with previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 almeida et al 2017 faramarzi et al 2009 kiniry et al 2002 2008 maximum potential leaf area index blai for corn and peanut were assigned to be 3 and 4 respectively as specified in the swat database kiniry et al 2002 almeida et al 2017 the final ranges of bio e for corn and peanut were close to ranges included in the swat manual bio e corn 39 45 and bio e peanut 20 25 the calibrated heat units value for peanut 1800 was close to that for georgia green peanut variety 1900 estimated from previous experiments bennett et al 1993 kiniry et al 2005 the optimal harvest index parameter hvsti was set to the measured harvest index the average quantity of biomass removed from field as yield for the sms and calendar high n treatments which was 0 60 for corn and 0 55 for peanut the minimum harvest index parameter wsyf was kept at the default value of 0 3 for both corn and peanut 3 1 1 soil moisture storage fig 2 shows modeled and observed soil moisture storage for the three treatments used for calibration sms calendar and rain fed irrigation all under high n fertilization the range of the observed measurements represents the spatial variability of soil moisture across replicates for each treatment soil moisture validation for the remaining six treatments sms calendar and rain fed irrigation under medium and low n fertilization for system 1 are shown in figs s1 and s2 plots of modeled versus observed soil moisture for system 2 are presented in figs s6 s8 overall soil moisture predictions showed satisfactory to very good fits 0 67 nsem 0 97 in both calibration and validation treatments for both systems table 5 however observed soil moisture peaks during high rainfall events were under predicted in system 1 calendar and sms treatments across all fertilization rates these results indicate that although swat was able to capture general patterns of soil moisture variation across the three growing seasons for both systems soil water drained too rapidly when soil moisture was above field capacity discrepancies between simulated and observed soil moisture particularly during high rainfall events due to simplified runoff and percolation process in swat were also reported by rajib et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 swat has a simplified approach for estimating soil moisture percolation that assumes soil water above field capacity in a particular layer percolates to the next layer at a rate governed by the saturated hydraulic conductivity neitsch et al 2011 due to this swat model structure and its high sensitivity to available water content and low sensitivity to hydraulic conductivity table 4 the calibrated soil parameters were unable to reproduce some of the transient soil moisture peaks measured by the sentek probes during large particularly multi day rainfall events fig 2 however manually increasing available water content and lowering hydraulic conductivity of the soil from the calibrated parameters to try to match the peaks resulted in long periods of time where the soil moisture remained much higher than the observations deteriorating the overall model fit statistics significantly in the sandy soils at the experimental site and throughout much of the srb region the transient high soil moisture drains back to field capacity more slowly than swat predicts but typically within a few days causing this excess water and any nitrate it contains to eventually leach past the root zone the fact that nitrogen uptake and biomass accumulation by the crop as well as soil nitrate storage were adequately predicted by the model see following sections provides some reassurance that the transient inaccuracies around large rainfall events do not affect the seasonal water and nitrogen mass balances with the calibrated soil conservation service curve number scs cn the total overland runoff volume generated for the highest runoff generating treatment calendar based irrigation with high n was 0 77 of applied water precipitation plus irrigation compared to 54 for et and 46 for percolation below the root zone generally in conformance with the observation of no surface runoff at the field site the small amount of runoff generated by swat occurred during large events such as hurricane irma in september 2017 3 1 2 crop biomass and yield crop growth dynamics for corn and peanut were very well predicted nsem 0 95 for the sms irrigation treatments across both calibrated high n and validated medium and low n fertilizer rates in system 1 table 6 fig 3 validation results for yield for all treatments in system 1 fig 4 were generally consistent with measured values all nsem 0 75 however in 2017 the model over predicted both total aboveground biomass and yield for rainfed corn under all fertilization rates this may indicate that water stress is under predicted by the swat crop parameters that were calibrated using sms high n treatments validation results for crop growth dynamics for system 2 also showed very good results for 2015 peanut and 2016 corn 0 86 nsem 0 99 table 6 fig s9 but total aboveground biomass and yields were not well predicted for any peanut treatments in 2017 fig s10 low observed peanut biomass and yield in 2017 were associated with crop loss caused by hurricane irma that hit the region in september 2017 these effects were not captured in swat simulations that were calibrated under limited stress conditions mitteslet et al 2015 3 1 3 crop nitrogen uptake modeled n uptake dynamics followed the observed trends well for system 1 sms treatments using default nitrogen uptake parameters fig 5 and table 7 while observed total nitrogen uptake had high variability within treatments last column fig 4 system 1 total n uptake predictions reproduced mean observed values quite well nsem 0 48 0 96 pbias 0 1 to 9 7 fig 4 note that although there was no difference in n applied to the system 1 peanut treatments in 2016 both the observed and simulated peanut nitrogen uptake in 2016 were influenced by different irrigation treatments modeled n uptake dynamics followed well the observed trends for system 2 sms treatments in 2015 and 2016 but n uptake for peanut was significantly overpredicted in 2017 this was a result of overprediction of biomass and yield since swat was not able to correctly predict the crop loss that occurred as a result of hurricane irma in 2017 fig s11 and table 7 for system 2 total n uptake for corn was adequately predicted nsem 0 63 pbais 8 8 however for peanut n fixation plus n uptake from soil was slightly underpredicted in 2015 nsem 9 23 pbias 25 and overpredicted in 2017 nsem 11 44 pbias 89 7 fig s12 overall swat predictions of final biomass n uptake and yield for both systems agreed with the zamora et al 2018 2020 experimental results in which the calendar based and sms irrigation management practices produced statistically higher final biomass n uptake and yield than the rainfed practices zamora et al 2018 found no statistically significant differences in final corn biomass across n rates but differences in total n uptake were found between the low and the high n rates swat predicted both lower biomass and n uptake for the low n fertilizer rate 3 1 4 soil nitrate n time series of system 1 simulated and measured soil nitrate n in the entire root zone 0 900 mm for calendar sms and rainfed irrigation with high n treatments are shown in fig 6 the remainder of the system 1 treatments are shown in figs s3 and s4 and similar results for system 2 are shown in figs s13 s15 for both systems soil nitrate n simulated using default soil nitrate parameters followed the trend of the observed data with nsem values ranging from 0 55 satisfactory to 0 95 very good for all treatments except the rainfed high fertilizer treatment the rainfed high fertilizer treatment over predicted soil nitrate n for both systems primarily during the fallow season following corn production nsem 0 16 and 0 25 respectively table 8 as mentioned earlier swat overestimated the corn biomass and n uptake for the rainfed case most likely because the swat corn parameters used for calibration had no water or n stress i e sms high treatment since 40 of the corn biomass is left on the field to mineralize the erroneously high corn n uptake may have led to the erroneously high soil n in the fallow periods due to mineralization of plant residues after harvest 3 2 nitrate n leaching based on satisfactory to very good prediction of simulated crop n uptake and soil nitrate n storage the only measured components of n balance in this study simulated nitrate n leaching was compared across treatments for the corn peanut corn rotation including the fallow periods between cropping seasons system 1 fig 7 as expected the high n fertilizer practice 336 kg n ha caused more nitrate n leaching to groundwater than the medium and low fertilizer practices 246 and 157 kg n ha in all irrigation management systems similarly the medium n rate caused more nitrate leaching to groundwater than the low fertilization practice somewhat surprisingly more nitrate leaching occurred during the fallow periods between crops than during the crop growing seasons across treatments within the high n fertilizer practice calendar irrigation caused more nitrate leaching to ground water than sms and rainfed practices during the 2015 corn growing season fig 7 however the highest nitrate leaching occurred during the 2015 16 fallow period after the 2015 rainfed high corn across all treatments the corn and peanut biomass left in the field after harvest 40 and 45 respectively caused nitrate n leaching ranging from 15 to 70 kg n ha and from 10 to 20 kg n ha during the 2015 16 and 2016 17 fallow periods respectively compared to 2015 corn grown in 2017 exhibited more leaching due to extreme weather conditions and the extra 17 kg ha of n fertilizer that was added to compensate the loss of n due to leaching rain results show a 40 70 kg n ha reduction in nitrate leaching for the sms medium fertilizer treatment compared to the calendar irrigation and high n fertilizer practices that are common in the region 3 3 long term simulation results 3 3 1 crop yield the long term simulations 1980 2018 showed no significant difference in average crop yields for the high and medium n fertilizer treatments when using calendar or sms irrigation scheduling methods the rainfed and low fertility treatments showed statistically lower average yields fig 8 these results are consistent with the field experiment results reported by zamora et al 2018 the incorporation of rye as a cover crop did not show any statistical significant effect on average corn yield for the high and medium n treatments however the calendar and sms low fertility corn treatments showed an average of 12 and 9 increase in corn yield following cover crops respectively for these low fertilizer treatments the incorporation and mineralization of cover crop biomass provided additional nutrients beneficial for corn production krueger et al 2011 similar field results were reported by zotarelli et al 2009 where at lowest supplemental n rates cover crops added benefits to sweet corn yields in florida usa no statistically significant effects of cover crops on average peanut yields were observed the wide variation in predicted rainfed corn and peanut yields across all n fertility rates represents variations in water stress due to variations in annual rainfall 3 3 2 nitrate n leaching fig 9 shows long term leaching simulated over the crop rotation including fallow and cover crops between growing seasons corn fallow cover crop peanut fallow cover crop as expected high n fertilization rates resulted in more nitrate n leaching than medium fertilization rates which in turn resulted in greater leaching than low fertilization rates long term simulations showed that sms irrigation resulted in statistically significant less leaching than calendar irrigation across all fertilization rates furthermore introducing cover crops during the fallow periods reduced nitrate n leaching by a statistically significant average of approximately 50 kg n ha across all treatments the calendar based irrigation with high fertilizer and no cover crop practice resulted in 65 more leaching 120 kg n ha in comparison to the sms based irrigation with medium fertilizer and cover crop practice moreover the extra 100 kg ha fertilizer and 45 more irrigation water applied by this common practice did not provide any statistically difference in average corn or peanut yields fig 8 long term irrigation applied by the calendar treatment averaged 506 and 309 mm during corn and peanut respectively whereas the sms treatment using auto irrigation applied an average of 290 and 160 mm respectively thus average irrigation reductions of 43 and 48 were achieved by using a sensor based instead of calendar based irrigation scheduling method in corn and peanut production respectively further analysis of n leaching patterns showed that on average the calendar based irrigation with high n fertilizer practice resulted in an average of 100 kg n ha leaching within the corn growing season followed by an average of 50 kg n ha during the subsequent fallow season in contrast the rainfed high n fertilizer practice resulted in an average of 34 kg n ha leaching during the corn season and an average of 100 kg n ha leaching during the subsequent fallow period fig s5 for the rainfed corn the fertilizer not taken up by the crop during the growing season along with the n mineralization from corn residue resulted in more leaching during the fallow period than either the calendar or sms irrigation practices nitrogen leaching from peanut residue average of 50 kg ha across all management practices was significantly reduced 80 by planting rye as a cover crop compared to leaving the fields fallow between cropping seasons fig s5 4 conclusions providing quantitative support for the efficacy and economic feasibility of agricultural best management practices is becoming more and more critical as communities around the globe seek to balance agricultural production and environmental protection coupling robust field experiments of specific management practices with modeling approaches that allow inference to be drawn at larger spatiotemporal scales is particularly useful for exploring tradeoffs among alternative future scenarios and comparing results to regulatory requirements and the preferences of diverse stakeholders in this study it is shown that swat successfully estimated soil moisture crop biomass yield crop n uptake and soil nitrate for corn peanut rotations grown using a variety of irrigation and n fertilizer management practices in the suwannee river basin florida leveraging robust field measurements from a 3 year field study zamora et al 2018 2020 allowed us to predict likely long term changes in crop yields water use and n leaching over a range of historical conditions by expanding experimental results beyond the temporal limits of specific field seasons these model results provide more widely applicable guidance for reductions in nutrient loads that can be expected from bmp implementation specifically we found that improving irrigation scheduling practices reducing n fertilization rates and planting a cover crop during fallow periods has the potential to reduce no3 n leaching by 65 over current commonly used corn peanut rotation practices notably this is within the 35 88 reduction in no3 n load that is estimated to be needed to achieve the nnc in srb spring ecosystems fdep 2012 2018 furthermore our results indicate that these load reductions can be achieved without adversely affecting crop yield this suggests that an incentive program that cost shares equipment purchases and protects producers from the risk of yield reductions may be an effective way to overcome barriers to the widespread adoption of sms irrigation scheduling reduced n fertilization rates and cover cropping practices in the region building from these results we are currently engaging stakeholders to develop alternative land use land management scenarios at the watershed scale these scenarios will be used to drive a swat modlow model to evaluate tradeoffs among the regional agricultural economy surface water and groundwater quantity and stream aquifer water quality and to determine whether improved management practices alone can achieve the nnc overall the results of this study and our ongoing efforts provide a transferable framework for developing effective and economically feasible strategies for meeting water quality

10244,nitrate leaching from agricultural fields is a significant contributor of groundwater pollution globally threatening drinking water resources and downstream ecosystems quantifying nitrate leaching driven by variable climate soils and management practices is challenging but it is critical for developing sustainable agricultural production systems while irrigation and fertilizer best management practices bmps have been widely implemented to reduce agricultural nitrate leaching their ability to meet environmental protection goals remains uncertain in this study we used the soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate crop yields and nitrate leaching for corn peanut rotations under a variety of nutrient and irrigation management practices in the suwannee river basin florida where groundwater feeds springs that are protected by a federally mandated nutrient criteria of 0 35 mg l nitrate nitrogen no3 n data from a field experiment of nine irrigation and nitrogen n management treatments were used to calibrate swat with good to excellent results nash sutcliffe efficiencies from 0 72 to 0 97 for soil moisture 0 85 0 96 for crop yield 0 48 0 96 for crop n uptake and 0 15 0 82 for soil nitrate the calibrated model was then used to quantify differences in crop yields irrigation applied and nitrate leaching among practices over a range of historical weather soil moisture sensor based irrigation with 246 kg n ha for corn and 0 kg n ha for peanut had no statistical difference in yields compared to common practices in the region calendar based irrigation fertilization of 336 kg n ha corn and 17 kg n ha peanut while reducing n leaching by 40 and irrigation applied by 45 reductions of 70 kg n ha yr and 300 mm year respectively planting a rye cover crop reduced leaching by an additional 50 n ha yr for all treatments these results show the potential for widespread adoption of nutrient and water conservation practices to achieve the reductions in no3 n load needed to meet environmental and regulatory goals without impacting crop yields keywords soil moisture nitrate leaching crop yield irrigation corn peanut rotation irrigation and nutrient management practices cover crops swat 1 introduction agricultural intensification and extensification to meet the food demands of a growing global population has led to elevated groundwater pumping and nitrogen n fertilizer usage worldwide spalding and exner 1993 vitousek et al 1997 synthetic and animal waste based n fertilizers are used in most agricultural operations to enhance plant growth motavalli et al 2008 but excessive application may increase the risk of nitrate loading to groundwater singh et al 1995 nolan and ruddy 1996 erisman et al 2008 the adverse effects of elevated nitrate concentrations on human health de la monte et al 2009 and the environment mitsch et al 1999 bowen et al 2007 have prompted regulators to establish limits of allowable nitrate concentration in groundwater and surface water meeting these criteria can be challenging since they often require widespread changes in water and nutrient management practices and the effects of these changes can take decades to manifest in receiving waters vero et al 2017 van meter et al 2018 local assessment and modeling of management practice changes that provide for agricultural sustainability while maintaining groundwater quality are thus necessary to develop informed and effective watershed management strategies connectivity between agricultural lands and the underlying aquifer plays a significant role in the mass of nitrate leaching to groundwater kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 important factors include soil drainage characteristics depth to water table crop type and mass of n in applied fertilizer nitrate concentrations are typically higher under agricultural fields with well drained soils overlying highly permeable aquifers nolan 2001 for example high concentrations of nitrate are often found in karst aquifers where discrete fractures and conduits can rapidly transmit large volumes of nitrate enriched water with little attenuation vesper et al 2001 doerfliger et al 1999 the vulnerability of karst aquifers to nutrients from agriculture has been well documented boyer and pasquarell 1995 1996 panno et al 2001 peterson et al 2002 however effective management strategies to minimize the nitrate loading to karst aquifers must be developed considering local economies and hydrogeologic settings coxon 2011 development and application of robust models to support decision making is especially important in karstic regions where wide variation in travel times can cause lags of years to decades between practice implementation and surface water quality improvement meals et al 2010 amin et al 2017 fenton et al 2017 the karstic upper floridan aquifer ufa is one of the most productive aquifers in the world it is the major source of public water supply and irrigation in north and central florida bush and johnston 1988 supporting a productive agricultural economy and supplying more than 10 million people with drinking water large portions of the ufa are characterized by unconfined hydraulically connected carbonate rocks with high permeability and transmissivities which allow nutrients to leach into the aquifer and quickly travel long distances bush and johnston 1988 arthur et al 2007 agriculture and silviculture are the predominant land uses in the suwanee river basin srb that overlies the ufa in north florida increases in population and changes in land use across florida have shifted the srb toward more intensive agriculture practices such as row crops cow calf operations dairy and poultry farms fdep 2012 which has resulted in increased nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations in the ufa fdacs 2015 2018 harrington et al 2010 hochmuth et al 2014 the region also has a high density of large freshwater springs supplied with water from the ufa nitrate n concentrations in ufa springs have increased over the last 40 years from background concentrations of 0 1 mg l no3 n to above 5 mg l no3 n in some springs katz 2004 katz et al 1999 heffernan et al 2010 in response to increasing no3 n concentrations and spring ecosystem degradation a numeric nutrient criteria nnc of 0 35 mg l no3 n was set for water emanating from ufa springs 62 302 530 47 b f a

from 35 fdep 2012 to 88 fdep 2018 to meet the nnc in this regulatory setting a quantitative assessment of the effects of alternative water and nutrient management practices on crop yield irrigation water requirements and no3 n leaching is needed to determine whether adoption of agricultural bmps can achieve the load reductions mandated to achieve the nnc critically nnc have been partially or fully developed for 29 us states and territories epa us environmental protection agency 2016 and are widely adopted across europe as part of the european water framework directive poikane et al 2019 across regions developing effective nutrient mitigation approaches to meet these environmental standards while also meeting human food demand is a grand global challenge robertson and swinton 2005 davidson et al 2015 with agricultural water management at its core agricultural bmps have been widely proposed to reduce adverse water quality impacts both globally liu et al 2017 and in the srb fdep 2012 however determining the effectiveness of these practices for reducing n leaching and meeting regional water quality goals is an on going challenge due to difficulties in quantifying nutrient fate and transport processes chaubey et al 2010 for instance measuring n fertilizer transformations and losses e g leaching volatilization and denitrification is expensive time consuming and difficult due to variability in weather soil properties and agricultural management practices across fields mulla et al 2004 given these challenges computer simulation models are commonly used to leverage field observations and improve estimates of the fate and transport of water and nutrients xie et al 2015 however data intensive model calibration and validation for the specific soil climate and agricultural management conditions being modeled must be performed for models to be effective ramos and carbonell 1991 and trusted by stakeholders karki et al 2019 this work leverages a uniquely robust experimental dataset zamora et al 2018 2020 to provide quantitative estimates of long term changes in crop yield water use and no3 n leaching under alternate management scenarios this effort is part of longer term project that is bringing together scientists regulators agricultural producers and non governmental organizations to collaboratively evaluate tradeoffs among crop production water quality and water quantity associated with alternative land use and land and water management strategies the coupled swat modflow model aliyari et al 2019 wei et al 2018 was selected as the platform for this analysis because complex surface groundwater interactions in the karst watershed require explicit modeling of the groundwater system and its interaction with surface waters which are not rigorously represented in typical agricultural watershed models such as swat arabi et al 2008 bieger et al 2014 cerro et al 2014 gassman et al 2014 francesconi et al 2016 agnps young et al 1989 or epic williams et al 1989 thus the immediate goal of this study was to assess whether swat can provide reliable groundwater recharge and nutrient leaching fluxes to modflow while also producing accurate crop yields for subsequent economic environmental tradeoff analyses while other field scale agricultural models e g dssat jones et al 2003 hydrus 1 d simunek et al 2008 leaching estimation and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1992 and root zone water quality model rzwqm usda ars 1992a may be more biophysically rigorous than swat none of these models are integrated with hydrologic models that can simulate the complex watershed scale surface water groundwater interactions that are important in the study area the overall goal of this study was to use swat to simulate the long term response of crop yield crop n uptake irrigation requirements and no3 n leaching under different irrigation n fertilization and cover crop management practices for a corn peanut rotation the most common row crop rotation in the srb usda 2012 specific objectives were to 1 calibrate swat using observations from a three year irrigation and n fertilizer rate management experiment for a corn peanut rotation conducted in live oak florida zamora et al 2018 2020 2 evaluate the long term effects of the experimental irrigation and fertilization treatments on annual yield n uptake irrigation applied and no3 n leaching using calibrated parameters over a 39 year 1980 2018 historic weather record and 3 estimate the effect of planting a rye cover crop on no3 n leaching irrigation water use and yield in corn peanut rotations future studies will aggregate these practices to the watershed scale to determine the ability of changes in agricultural management practices to achieve the no3 n loading reductions required to meet the federally mandated nnc in the srb this work provides a framework for developing effective socially acceptable strategies for achieving stringent water quality regulations while maintaining a robust agricultural economy that is transferrable to other agricultural watersheds throughout the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the experimental field site is located at the north florida research and education center suwannee valley nfrec sv near live oak florida 30 31 n 82 90 w fig 1 the field is at an elevation of 49 50 m above mean sea level and has flat topography with an average slope of less than 0 5 the site consists of three types of well drained soil chipley hurricane and blanton sand ssurgo soil survey geographic database nrcs 2016 soils in the southern portion of the site are mostly chipley while those in the northern portion are mostly hurricane fig 1 the site was divided into two systems based on the timing of rotation system 1 southern portion of the site was a corn peanut corn rotation planted during 2015 17 and system 2 northern portion was a peanut corn peanut rotation grown during the same period in this manuscript results and analysis from system 1 are presented in detail results from system 2 were very similar and are thus summarized in the body of the paper and fully documented in the supplemental material systems 1 and 2 were divided into four blocks i e replicates b1 b4 each containing fifteen 12 2 mx6 1 m 74 4 m2 plots fig 1 each plot received a different irrigation management strategy n 5 and n fertilizer rate n 3 resulting in 15 treatments each with 4 replicates in this study the subset of these plots that had most field observations were selected to develop the model this subset included 9 treatments 3 irrigation methods and 3 fertilizer rates table 1 complete documentation of the field experiment can be found in zamora et al 2018 the three irrigation methods consisted of calendar based irrigation soil moisture sensor based irrigation and no irrigation rainfed calendar based irrigation for corn consisted of no irrigation for the first 30 days after planting dap unless severely windy conditions caused blowing sand to burn the plants beginning on 31 dap a target amount of 25 mm week was established that could be made up of rain or irrigation if rain events were 13 mm for 40 59 dap a 41 mm week target was established one irrigation event was skipped if 13 20 mm rainfall occurred and two irrigation events were skipped if 20 mm of rain occurred for 60 105 dap a 61 mm week irrigation target was used one irrigation event was skipped if 13 25 mm of rain occurred the day prior to a scheduled irrigation and two irrigation events were skipped if 25 mm of rain occurred finally around 105 dap at full dent stage weekly irrigation targets were reduced to 41 mm week for one week and 20 mm week for another week until finally irrigation was terminated at 115 dap individual irrigation events were 13 mm a similar calendar based irrigation schedule was applied during the peanut growing season this consisted of no irrigation from 0 to 30 dap from 31 to 44 dap 25 mm week was applied unless rainfall provided target irrigation amount from 45 to 64 dap 38 mm week was applied however if rainfall between 13 and 19 mm occurred one irrigation event was skipped and if rainfall 19 mm occurred two events were skipped finally from 65 to 135 dap 51 mm week was applied one irrigation event was skipped if 13 25 mm of rain occurred and two irrigation events were skipped if 25 mm of rain occurred individual irrigation events were 10 mm for the soil moisture sensor sms based irrigation scheduling the volumetric soil water content vwc was monitored continuously using sensors irrigation was triggered when the maximum allowable depletion mad was 50 of the difference between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp the irrigation volume required to refill the active root depth to field capacity was estimated according to guidelines proposed by zotarelli et al 2013 active root depth was varied throughout the season based on root development the three n fertilizer treatments consisted of high medium and low application rates 336 246 and 157 kg n ha for corn respectively the high fertilizer application rate of 336 kg n ha for corn and 17 kg n ha peanut is a common grower practice in the region zamora et al 2018 the medium rate closely follows the university of florida institute for food and agricultural sciences uf ifas recommendations 235 kg n ha for irrigated corn and 0 kg ha for peanut hochmuth et al 1992 mylavarapu et al 2015 the low n represents the minimum n required to establish the corn crop in the low water holding capacity low organic matter and low cation exchange capacity sandy soils at the field site for corn an extra application of up to 17 kg n ha was made within the first four weeks after planting if 76 100 mm of rainfall occurred in a week fdacs 2015 the fertilizer composition and application schedule is presented in table s1 2 2 data collection and processing table s2 summarizes the type location and frequency of data collected from each plot soil moisture content was obtained from sentek drill and drop capacitance probes sentek pty ltd 2003 installed in three replicates blocks 2 3 and 4 in each of the nine treatments fig 1 each probe consists of nine sensors placed every 100 mm interval up to 900 mm probes recorded data every 30 min which were averaged to daily values of soil moisture storage for comparison with swat daily output the sentek probes were calibrated at the factory after installation at the field site the sentek soil moisture measurements were checked against observed volumetric water content estimated using gravimetric water content measured from soil cores within the same replicate and bulk density measured at the field site to verify the factory calibration and establish their reliability for use in model calibration and validation soil nitrate n was collected from all plots at four depths 0 150 150 300 300 600 and 600 900 mm throughout the rotation aboveground biomass and nitrogen uptake were collected at key growth stages from all plots under sms based irrigation detailed information about the data collection procedures is provided in zamora et al 2018 soil properties measured at the site are summarized in table s3 2 3 model description swat is a semi distributed continuous process based watershed scale model used to evaluate the impact of different land management practices on surface and subsurface water quality and quantity sediment and agricultural yields arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2004 gassman et al 2014 for spatial representation swat delineates a watershed into hydrological response units hrus which are homogenous regions with similar slope land use and soil type neitsch et al 2011 winchell et al 2013 hrus can be used for field or plot level estimation of nitrate leaching crop yield evapotranspiration and other management practice assessments neitsch et al 2004 anand et al 2007 gitau et al 2008 sinnathamby et al 2017 moloney et al 2015 cibin et al 2015 karki et al 2019 swat has two infiltration schemes the curve number cn method at daily intervals and the green ampt method when hourly precipitation data are available cn based infiltration was used in this study swat simulates the movement of infiltrated flow between soil layers using a storage routing tipping bucket method which allows downward movement or percolation of saturated flow when field capacity of a soil layer is exceeded and the underlying layer is not saturated arnold et al 2012 mapfumo et al 2004 soil moisture distribution below field capacity is governed by plant water uptake and soil water evaporation through two parameters the soil evaporation compensation coefficient esco and the plant uptake compensation factor epco respectively vazquez amabile and engel 2005 neitsch et al 2011 the crop growth algorithm in swat is based on the environmental impact policy climate epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 neitsch et al 2004 swat calculates the potential growth of the plant for each day as a function of solar radiation and leaf area index lai actual growth and lai are dependent on stress factors including water temperature and nutrient stress swat computes the accumulation of heat units until the crop attains maturity after which crop growth ceases nair et al 2011 2 4 model setup in this study swat version 2012 rev664 was applied at the plot scale for the calibration and validation of soil and crop parameters following the approaches of anand et al 2007 maski et al 2008 marek et al 2016 2017 and chen et al 2017 the experimental area fig 1 was auto delineated into one basin with three hrus one per irrigation treatment using the usgs 30 m dem digital elevation map usda nrcs ssurgo soil map and usda nass cropland data layer cdl these hrus were converted to plots of equal size 74 4 m2 by adjusting the area in the sub basin input file and the fraction of area of hru in the hru input file marek et al 2016 moloney et al 2015 karki et al 2019 each hru was provided with information regarding management practices conducted in the experimental study period e g planting date irrigation and fertilizer schedules and harvest date the default ssurgo soil data of soil bulk density soil texture and organic carbon were replaced with field measurements zamora et al 2018 for each hru table s3 the total root zone depth in each hru was set to 900 mm with four layers 0 150 mm 150 300 mm 300 600 mm and 600 900 mm for consistency with measured soil nitrate depth resolution the source of irrigation water at the experimental site is the upper floridian aquifer which is approximately 3 m below land surface usgs 1983 with no interaction with the root zone surface runoff was never observed during the experiment at this well drained site zamora et al 2018 thus the irrigation source was set to an unlimited source outside of the field scale model domain swat daily weather

network fawn located at the experimental site 30 305 lat 82 898 long https fawn ifas ufl edu missing data were filled using the swat weather generator neitsch et al 2011 2 5 calibration methodology crop growth simulation depends on both crop biophysical processes as well as soil moisture dynamics so model calibration and validation followed an integrated approach to predict both processes reasonably wang et al 2016 sinnathamby et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the data used for calibration versus validation is summarized in table 3 the calibration procedure is detailed below soil moisture was the first variable to be calibrated with default swat crop parameters the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup 2012 was used to calibrate and validate the model and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse was chosen as the objective function abbaspour et al 2018 the sufi 2 algorithm has been extensively used in the calibration of the swat model due to its easy implementation high flexibility in selecting parameters and the range for calibration and the reduced number of model runs needed to achieve good prediction yang et al 2008 malago et al 2015 for this study the methodology recommended in the swat cup user manual abbaspour 2013 and several swat cup calibration papers yang et al 2008 abbaspour et al 2015 2018 kamali et al 2017 were followed the initial range of soil parameters were selected based on literature values arnold et al 2012 and prior experiments conducted on similar soils in the region zotarelli et al 2007 prasad et al 2015 prasad and hochmuth 2016 sensitivity analysis was carried out within swat cup to determine sensitive parameters to be included in the calibration sentek soil moisture sensor data was used to calibrate total soil moisture storage in the entire root zone 900 mm at the daily scale during the cropping season because currently swat cup has no provision to calibrate the soil moisture storage for individual soil layers swat provides a simulated soil moisture only for the whole soil column output file which is utilized by swat cup for the auto calibration process soil and hydrological parameters were calibrated using daily soil moisture storage total soil moisture from 0 to 900 mm averaged across replicates for each high n irrigation treatment i e calendar sms and rain fed from 2015 to 2017 fig 1 after a three year warm up period to stabilize the initial hydrological condition the three high n irrigation treatments were selected for calibration to account for spatial variability in soil properties across a variety of moisture regimes under the assumption of plant growth under no n stress the calibrated soil parameters were then validated for each irrigation treatment in the medium and low n fertilizer treatments the three calibrated hrus with the high n management schedule were replaced with the medium and the low n fertilizer schedule for validation after best fit soil and hydrological parameters were identified crop parameters were calibrated using the above ground biomass data averaged across replicates of the sms high n treatments note that biomass was measured at key growth stages only for sms treatments table s2 sensitivity analysis of seasonal biomass growth to swat crop parameters was conducted to determine the most sensitive parameters after which the sensitive parameters were adjusted to reproduce the observed trend of crop growth in the high n fertilizer sms treatment calibrated parameter values were validated using data from the low and medium n fertility sms treatments the calibrated soil moisture parameters were further verified by re simulating with the final crop parameters field measured harvest indices i e average fraction of final biomass removed from the field across the treatment replicates for the sms and calendar high n treatments were used to estimate yield for both corn and peanut assuming yields were optimum without any water and nutrient stress neitsch et al 2004 for those treatments the default swat nitrogen uptake parameters pltnfr 1 n uptake at emergence pltnfr 2 n uptake at 50 maturity and pltnfr 3 n uptake at full maturity and default nitrogen transformation parameters were used in all simulations the adequacy of these parameters in simulating the n balance for the experiment was assessed by comparing measured and predicted n uptake by the crop and no3 n soil concentrations soil over time for each treatment system 1 calibrated crop parameters were also validated using system 2 data for all comparisons statistical indices such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias were used nse and rmse were estimated accounting for replicate measurement variability harmel and smith 2007 harmel et al 2010 using the software fitval https abe ufl edu faculty carpena software fiteval developed by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 these modified statistical indices are denoted here as nsem and rmsem pbias was estimated without measurement variability moriasi et al 2012 the performance indices were judged based on the criteria of satisfactory nsem 0 50 to very good nsem 0 75 set by moriasi et al 2007 2012 2 6 development of long term scenarios in order to estimate irrigation requirements nitrate leaching and crop yield over the wider range of historical weather conditions the corn peanut rotation was simulated for the nine experimental treatments using 39 years of north american land data assimilation system nldas historical weather data 1980 2018 using 1980 and 1981 as warmup period in addition scenarios were developed to estimate the potential reduction in nitrate leaching if a rye winter cover crop were planted instead of letting the land remain fallow between two subsequent crops swat default parameters of rye crop was used for long term scenario while many studies have shown that winter cover crops have benefits such as preventing soil erosion improving long term soil quality and enhancing carbon sequestration basche et al 2016 kaspar and singer 2011 moore et al 2014 the impact of cover crops on reducing nitrate leaching has not been fully established martinez feria et al 2016 dabney et al 2010 thorup kristensen and dresboll 2010 a calendar irrigation schedule was developed from the historic rainfall data following an approach suggested by university of florida extension specialists table s4 sensor based irrigation was simulated with the swat auto irrigation option based on plant water demand which triggers irrigation when the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration becomes less than the user defined threshold arnold et al 2013 after multiple simulation trials and comparison with the experimental soil moisture scheduling irrigation amounts and recommendations from stakeholders a 0 65 threshold was used for both corn and peanut with an irrigation application of 13 mm day for corn and 10 mm day for peanut split application of the three n fertilizer rates used in the field experiment table 1 s1 were applied using ammonium nitrate fertilizer as it is a common source of n fertilizer in the region for simplicity fixed planting and harvesting dates were adopted throughout the simulation period table 2 based on local practices and communication with extension specialists a rye cover crop planting and herbicide application schedule was incorporated into the simulations the agricultural management schedule for the corn and peanut rotation with and without the cover crop is presented in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation table 4 presents final calibrated values ranges and p values to indicate the sensitivity of parameters p 0 05 indicates a sensitive parameter available water content awc soil evaporation compensation factor esco and plant uptake compensation factor epco were the most sensitive soil and hydrological parameters notably saturated hydraulic conductivity and curve number were not sensitive parameters best fit parameters were similar though not identical between systems table 4 total heat units required to reach maturity heat units in this experiment maturity for corn was 135 days after planting and biomass to energy ratio bio e were the sensitive crop parameters which is in accordance with previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 almeida et al 2017 faramarzi et al 2009 kiniry et al 2002 2008 maximum potential leaf area index blai for corn and peanut were assigned to be 3 and 4 respectively as specified in the swat database kiniry et al 2002 almeida et al 2017 the final ranges of bio e for corn and peanut were close to ranges included in the swat manual bio e corn 39 45 and bio e peanut 20 25 the calibrated heat units value for peanut 1800 was close to that for georgia green peanut variety 1900 estimated from previous experiments bennett et al 1993 kiniry et al 2005 the optimal harvest index parameter hvsti was set to the measured harvest index the average quantity of biomass removed from field as yield for the sms and calendar high n treatments which was 0 60 for corn and 0 55 for peanut the minimum harvest index parameter wsyf was kept at the default value of 0 3 for both corn and peanut 3 1 1 soil moisture storage fig 2 shows modeled and observed soil moisture storage for the three treatments used for calibration sms calendar and rain fed irrigation all under high n fertilization the range of the observed measurements represents the spatial variability of soil moisture across replicates for each treatment soil moisture validation for the remaining six treatments sms calendar and rain fed irrigation under medium and low n fertilization for system 1 are shown in figs s1 and s2 plots of modeled versus observed soil moisture for system 2 are presented in figs s6 s8 overall soil moisture predictions showed satisfactory to very good fits 0 67 nsem 0 97 in both calibration and validation treatments for both systems table 5 however observed soil moisture peaks during high rainfall events were under predicted in system 1 calendar and sms treatments across all fertilization rates these results indicate that although swat was able to capture general patterns of soil moisture variation across the three growing seasons for both systems soil water drained too rapidly when soil moisture was above field capacity discrepancies between simulated and observed soil moisture particularly during high rainfall events due to simplified runoff and percolation process in swat were also reported by rajib et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 swat has a simplified approach for estimating soil moisture percolation that assumes soil water above field capacity in a particular layer percolates to the next layer at a rate governed by the saturated hydraulic conductivity neitsch et al 2011 due to this swat model structure and its high sensitivity to available water content and low sensitivity to hydraulic conductivity table 4 the calibrated soil parameters were unable to reproduce some of the transient soil moisture peaks measured by the sentek probes during large particularly multi day rainfall events fig 2 however manually increasing available water content and lowering hydraulic conductivity of the soil from the calibrated parameters to try to match the peaks resulted in long periods of time where the soil moisture remained much higher than the observations deteriorating the overall model fit statistics significantly in the sandy soils at the experimental site and throughout much of the srb region the transient high soil moisture drains back to field capacity more slowly than swat predicts but typically within a few days causing this excess water and any nitrate it contains to eventually leach past the root zone the fact that nitrogen uptake and biomass accumulation by the crop as well as soil nitrate storage were adequately predicted by the model see following sections provides some reassurance that the transient inaccuracies around large rainfall events do not affect the seasonal water and nitrogen mass balances with the calibrated soil conservation service curve number scs cn the total overland runoff volume generated for the highest runoff generating treatment calendar based irrigation with high n was 0 77 of applied water precipitation plus irrigation compared to 54 for et and 46 for percolation below the root zone generally in conformance with the observation of no surface runoff at the field site the small amount of runoff generated by swat occurred during large events such as hurricane irma in september 2017 3 1 2 crop biomass and yield crop growth dynamics for corn and peanut were very well predicted nsem 0 95 for the sms irrigation treatments across both calibrated high n and validated medium and low n fertilizer rates in system 1 table 6 fig 3 validation results for yield for all treatments in system 1 fig 4 were generally consistent with measured values all nsem 0 75 however in 2017 the model over predicted both total aboveground biomass and yield for rainfed corn under all fertilization rates this may indicate that water stress is under predicted by the swat crop parameters that were calibrated using sms high n treatments validation results for crop growth dynamics for system 2 also showed very good results for 2015 peanut and 2016 corn 0 86 nsem 0 99 table 6 fig s9 but total aboveground biomass and yields were not well predicted for any peanut treatments in 2017 fig s10 low observed peanut biomass and yield in 2017 were associated with crop loss caused by hurricane irma that hit the region in september 2017 these effects were not captured in swat simulations that were calibrated under limited stress conditions mitteslet et al 2015 3 1 3 crop nitrogen uptake modeled n uptake dynamics followed the observed trends well for system 1 sms treatments using default nitrogen uptake parameters fig 5 and table 7 while observed total nitrogen uptake had high variability within treatments last column fig 4 system 1 total n uptake predictions reproduced mean observed values quite well nsem 0 48 0 96 pbias 0 1 to 9 7 fig 4 note that although there was no difference in n applied to the system 1 peanut treatments in 2016 both the observed and simulated peanut nitrogen uptake in 2016 were influenced by different irrigation treatments modeled n uptake dynamics followed well the observed trends for system 2 sms treatments in 2015 and 2016 but n uptake for peanut was significantly overpredicted in 2017 this was a result of overprediction of biomass and yield since swat was not able to correctly predict the crop loss that occurred as a result of hurricane irma in 2017 fig s11 and table 7 for system 2 total n uptake for corn was adequately predicted nsem 0 63 pbais 8 8 however for peanut n fixation plus n uptake from soil was slightly underpredicted in 2015 nsem 9 23 pbias 25 and overpredicted in 2017 nsem 11 44 pbias 89 7 fig s12 overall swat predictions of final biomass n uptake and yield for both systems agreed with the zamora et al 2018 2020 experimental results in which the calendar based and sms irrigation management practices produced statistically higher final biomass n uptake and yield than the rainfed practices zamora et al 2018 found no statistically significant differences in final corn biomass across n rates but differences in total n uptake were found between the low and the high n rates swat predicted both lower biomass and n uptake for the low n fertilizer rate 3 1 4 soil nitrate n time series of system 1 simulated and measured soil nitrate n in the entire root zone 0 900 mm for calendar sms and rainfed irrigation with high n treatments are shown in fig 6 the remainder of the system 1 treatments are shown in figs s3 and s4 and similar results for system 2 are shown in figs s13 s15 for both systems soil nitrate n simulated using default soil nitrate parameters followed the trend of the observed data with nsem values ranging from 0 55 satisfactory to 0 95 very good for all treatments except the rainfed high fertilizer treatment the rainfed high fertilizer treatment over predicted soil nitrate n for both systems primarily during the fallow season following corn production nsem 0 16 and 0 25 respectively table 8 as mentioned earlier swat overestimated the corn biomass and n uptake for the rainfed case most likely because the swat corn parameters used for calibration had no water or n stress i e sms high treatment since 40 of the corn biomass is left on the field to mineralize the erroneously high corn n uptake may have led to the erroneously high soil n in the fallow periods due to mineralization of plant residues after harvest 3 2 nitrate n leaching based on satisfactory to very good prediction of simulated crop n uptake and soil nitrate n storage the only measured components of n balance in this study simulated nitrate n leaching was compared across treatments for the corn peanut corn rotation including the fallow periods between cropping seasons system 1 fig 7 as expected the high n fertilizer practice 336 kg n ha caused more nitrate n leaching to groundwater than the medium and low fertilizer practices 246 and 157 kg n ha in all irrigation management systems similarly the medium n rate caused more nitrate leaching to groundwater than the low fertilization practice somewhat surprisingly more nitrate leaching occurred during the fallow periods between crops than during the crop growing seasons across treatments within the high n fertilizer practice calendar irrigation caused more nitrate leaching to ground water than sms and rainfed practices during the 2015 corn growing season fig 7 however the highest nitrate leaching occurred during the 2015 16 fallow period after the 2015 rainfed high corn across all treatments the corn and peanut biomass left in the field after harvest 40 and 45 respectively caused nitrate n leaching ranging from 15 to 70 kg n ha and from 10 to 20 kg n ha during the 2015 16 and 2016 17 fallow periods respectively compared to 2015 corn grown in 2017 exhibited more leaching due to extreme weather conditions and the extra 17 kg ha of n fertilizer that was added to compensate the loss of n due to leaching rain results show a 40 70 kg n ha reduction in nitrate leaching for the sms medium fertilizer treatment compared to the calendar irrigation and high n fertilizer practices that are common in the region 3 3 long term simulation results 3 3 1 crop yield the long term simulations 1980 2018 showed no significant difference in average crop yields for the high and medium n fertilizer treatments when using calendar or sms irrigation scheduling methods the rainfed and low fertility treatments showed statistically lower average yields fig 8 these results are consistent with the field experiment results reported by zamora et al 2018 the incorporation of rye as a cover crop did not show any statistical significant effect on average corn yield for the high and medium n treatments however the calendar and sms low fertility corn treatments showed an average of 12 and 9 increase in corn yield following cover crops respectively for these low fertilizer treatments the incorporation and mineralization of cover crop biomass provided additional nutrients beneficial for corn production krueger et al 2011 similar field results were reported by zotarelli et al 2009 where at lowest supplemental n rates cover crops added benefits to sweet corn yields in florida usa no statistically significant effects of cover crops on average peanut yields were observed the wide variation in predicted rainfed corn and peanut yields across all n fertility rates represents variations in water stress due to variations in annual rainfall 3 3 2 nitrate n leaching fig 9 shows long term leaching simulated over the crop rotation including fallow and cover crops between growing seasons corn fallow cover crop peanut fallow cover crop as expected high n fertilization rates resulted in more nitrate n leaching than medium fertilization rates which in turn resulted in greater leaching than low fertilization rates long term simulations showed that sms irrigation resulted in statistically significant less leaching than calendar irrigation across all fertilization rates furthermore introducing cover crops during the fallow periods reduced nitrate n leaching by a statistically significant average of approximately 50 kg n ha across all treatments the calendar based irrigation with high fertilizer and no cover crop practice resulted in 65 more leaching 120 kg n ha in comparison to the sms based irrigation with medium fertilizer and cover crop practice moreover the extra 100 kg ha fertilizer and 45 more irrigation water applied by this common practice did not provide any statistically difference in average corn or peanut yields fig 8 long term irrigation applied by the calendar treatment averaged 506 and 309 mm during corn and peanut respectively whereas the sms treatment using auto irrigation applied an average of 290 and 160 mm respectively thus average irrigation reductions of 43 and 48 were achieved by using a sensor based instead of calendar based irrigation scheduling method in corn and peanut production respectively further analysis of n leaching patterns showed that on average the calendar based irrigation with high n fertilizer practice resulted in an average of 100 kg n ha leaching within the corn growing season followed by an average of 50 kg n ha during the subsequent fallow season in contrast the rainfed high n fertilizer practice resulted in an average of 34 kg n ha leaching during the corn season and an average of 100 kg n ha leaching during the subsequent fallow period fig s5 for the rainfed corn the fertilizer not taken up by the crop during the growing season along with the n mineralization from corn residue resulted in more leaching during the fallow period than either the calendar or sms irrigation practices nitrogen leaching from peanut residue average of 50 kg ha across all management practices was significantly reduced 80 by planting rye as a cover crop compared to leaving the fields fallow between cropping seasons fig s5 4 conclusions providing quantitative support for the efficacy and economic feasibility of agricultural best management practices is becoming more and more critical as communities around the globe seek to balance agricultural production and environmental protection coupling robust field experiments of specific management practices with modeling approaches that allow inference to be drawn at larger spatiotemporal scales is particularly useful for exploring tradeoffs among alternative future scenarios and comparing results to regulatory requirements and the preferences of diverse stakeholders in this study it is shown that swat successfully estimated soil moisture crop biomass yield crop n uptake and soil nitrate for corn peanut rotations grown using a variety of irrigation and n fertilizer management practices in the suwannee river basin florida leveraging robust field measurements from a 3 year field study zamora et al 2018 2020 allowed us to predict likely long term changes in crop yields water use and n leaching over a range of historical conditions by expanding experimental results beyond the temporal limits of specific field seasons these model results provide more widely applicable guidance for reductions in nutrient loads that can be expected from bmp implementation specifically we found that improving irrigation scheduling practices reducing n fertilization rates and planting a cover crop during fallow periods has the potential to reduce no3 n leaching by 65 over current commonly used corn peanut rotation practices notably this is within the 35 88 reduction in no3 n load that is estimated to be needed to achieve the nnc in srb spring ecosystems fdep 2012 2018 furthermore our results indicate that these load reductions can be achieved without adversely affecting crop yield this suggests that an incentive program that cost shares equipment purchases and protects producers from the risk of yield reductions may be an effective way to overcome barriers to the widespread adoption of sms irrigation scheduling reduced n fertilization rates and cover cropping practices in the region building from these results we are currently engaging stakeholders to develop alternative land use land management scenarios at the watershed scale these scenarios will be used to drive a swat modlow model to evaluate tradeoffs among the regional agricultural economy surface water and groundwater quantity and stream aquifer water quality and to determine whether improved management practices alone can achieve the nnc overall the results of this study and our ongoing efforts provide a transferable framework for developing effective and economically feasible strategies for meeting water quality
