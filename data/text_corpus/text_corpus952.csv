4760,due to the complex water system and diversified management requirements the optimal water resources operation of the rivers connected lake has always been a difficulty in current researches based on the discussion of characteristics of the rivers connected lake this paper quantified the forecasting uncertainty in the operation process and set the quantified uncertainty as the objective function to establish the water resources optimal operation model of rivers connected lake the human factors were coupled to the optimal water resources operation in the model in order to obtain the optimal plan of lake water resources operation with human adaptability hongze lake was taken as an example for the analysis of water resources optimization operation plan of rivers connected lake also an integrated algorithm including the normal boundary crossing method the primal dual interior point method and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was proposed to solve the lake operation model the results proved that the optimization calculation of multi objective operation under the uncertainty conditions of hongze lake can be obtained by the proposed model and algorithm uncertainties related to forecasts of lake operation can be effectively reduced by the proposed model which thus implied the obtained operation plan in this paper is more adaptive to changing environment than the existing other plans the research results can provide technical methods for the lake water resources operation with plentiful and diverse objectives of china and other countries keywords operation uncertainty uncertainty quantification lake water operation modelling rivers connected lake 1 introduction as an important carrier of water resources lakes play an indispensable role in flood control water storage and allocation water purification ecological wetland protection and maintenance of biological species diversity they are inseparable from human life ding et al 2019 large water storage areas lakes are generally managed as reservoirs but they are not exactly the same as reservoirs kobler and schmid 2019 what they have in common is that they are both large scale water storage areas and have satisfactory storage functionality the difference between the two is that because the reservoir is artificially constructed its outflow and inflow conditions are simple with strong controllability and the storage and discharge processes of water resources can be realized by adjusting the reservoir gate however for lakes as natural resources existing in river networks and water systems especially lakes that connect multiple rivers and pass through multiple water systems the outflow and inflow conditions are extremely complex and most lakes are shallow water with complex terrain and are highly susceptible to the impact of changing environments furthermore with the development of social economy inter basin water transfer projects emerge accordingly to solve the problem of uneven distribution of water resources in order to save engineering costs water transfer projects normally choose lakes connected with rivers complex and diversified water system as the water storage lakes for the transfer which poses a greater challenge to the lakes water resources operation zhuan et al 2018 lakes that store fresh water resources can play a decent supporting role for the development and utilization of national water resources navigation and transportation fisheries and aquaculture development irrigation and water operation and storage rivers connected lake are not only limited by their own complex water resources but also affected by climate change and human activities deng and chen 2016 especially in the lake water resources operation process lake operation deviations due to inaccurate forecasting information concerning inflow to the lake water demand in the water receiving area and lake discharge will cause considerable losses to lake management wu et al 2020 at present some scholars have conducted considerable research on operation uncertainty and lake problems in terms of uncertainty the two stage stochastic programming method is used to deal with the uncertain factors in multiple water resources for cities and the optimization strategy took into account the economic penalty of water resources operation risks which could minimize the loss caused by uncertainty in water resources operation zhang et al 2009 dobson et al 2019 the disadvantage of the two stage stochastic programming method is that the probability distribution of uncertainty is closely related to the amount of information while the amount of information in the actual problem is somewhat insufficient and it is difficult to derive the probability distribution of uncertainty liu et al 2018 this is the real change when lu et al 2009 coupled the interactive fuzzy method and the two stage stochastic programming method based on interval mathematics to form a two stage interactive stochastic fuzzy programming method which could eliminate the double risks of fuzziness of the upper and lower bounds of the interval and human subjective identification to effectively describe the uncertainty in the event a multi source water supply operation model close to reality through the description of the uncertainty in the water supply operation system by the probability distribution and the interval was established parameters uncertainty was proved to exist in the reservoir operation process and have a lot of impacts on water resources management he et al 2018 under the condition of operation uncertainty the lake water resources optimal operation plan originally obtained through the conventional optimal operation model is no longer applicable in particular the impact of uncertainty may be slow and small and it is not easily noticeable in a short time but it will cause irreparable losses at some time in the future van loon and laaha 2015 tegegne and kim 2020 the existence of these uncertainties also makes it difficult for the water resources operation model to achieve the best performance zolghadr et al 2019 however how does the lake operation uncertainty exist in one way or another whether the uncertainty can be quantified and how is the uncertainty taken into consideration in lake operation these questions have not received much attention and are worth further study moreover the multi objective operation is important for rivers connected lake the stored water in lakes can be used for flood control hydropower generation irrigation and navigation zajac et al 2017 optimizing the operation system can improve the robustness of water resource management in terms of lake operation it is the fundamental goal of the research on the relationship between rivers and lakes to study the principle of optimal operation principles of rivers and lakes with the joint operation of major water conservancy projects in the rivers and lakes system as the core and to maintain a healthy rivers and lakes system pattern etten and vellekoop 2009 mao et al 2016 moradi et al 2018 taking full advantage of the capacity of major water conservancy projects and carrying out river lake project integration and optimal operation is the most economical and feasible means to maintain the healthy relationship between rivers and lakes chang et al 2010 yi et al 2018 however the water transfer project will change the connection of regional rivers and lakes the most obvious feature is that after transferring water into the lake it may promote the flow of lake water increase the self purification capacity of the water and improve the ecological environment of the lake ou et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the study has found that there is a complex water system connection between dongting lake and yangtze river when the three gorges reservoir operation changes the runoff process of yangtze river it will cause changes in the annual channel storage of dongting lake which will have a significant impact on flood control water resources allocation and water environmental protection in dongting lake area fu et al 2019 it is foreseeable that the water transfer project can realize the mutual adjustment of water resources in the system through the lakes along the way and can also form a water volume adjustment system along the water transmission line which serves multiple purposes such as realizing pre transfer of water rational use of flood resources and optimized water supply liu and dai 2017 ghale et al 2018 scientifically using the storage lakes can effectively enhance the management level of the water transfer project and improve the water resources allocation capacity of the project wang et al 2017 khazheeva and plyusnin 2018 how to conduct a multi objective operation for water resources of the rivers connected lake under uncertainty is an important and critical problem thus clarifying the connection between lakes and water systems and realizing the optimal operation of lake water resources with joint operation of water conservancy projects are the basic theoretical issues that need to be urgently studied and resolved in the current when studying the problem of optimal operation of lakes scholars rarely consider multiple optimization objectives at the same time and rarely incorporate uncertainty into the lake water resources operation system water resources operation systems that do not consider uncertainty will have potential risks to a certain extent which is not conducive to the comprehensive management of the lakes kacem et al 2016 there is still a large knowledge gap to operate rivers connected lake in an efficient way constructing an optimal operation model of rivers connected lake water resources with complex water systems and diverse target requirements and proposing an effective optimization algorithm can provide a theoretical reference and technical support for the reduction of lake water resources operation losses and lake adaptive management 2 optimal water resources operation model for rivers connected lake 2 1 rivers connected lake characteristics large freshwater lakes play a multi objective role in water supply aquaculture flood control and navigation in human life and their status is crucial among them rivers connected lakes are connected to rivers and seas and as water carrying lakes they are responsible for water supply flood control and water transfer tasks such a connection relationship will have a great influence on the ecological environment of the surrounding areas of the lakes the blocking of the rivers connected lake water system will not only cause the decline of wetland function the shrinking of the lake area frequent floods and waterlogging disasters and the weakening of water purification ability but also cut off the living environment of the living creatures around the lakes and the rivers and destroy the regional biodiversity resulting in a decrease in the species and number of vegetation birds and habitats around the lakes china has many rivers connected lakes such as hongze lake poyang lake dongting lake wuhan east lake taihu lake etc with the rapid development of the social economy in china the construction of water transfer projects and gate control projects while enhancing china s ability to operate and store lake water resources is changing the water resources situation of these lakes hongze lake is connected to yangtze river through a long river channel that is it flows into yangtze river at sanjiangying through the river course into yangtze river baoying lake and gaoyou lake and through the north jiangsu irrigation canal and the seawater channel passing respectively through the xiahe area and the erhe gate channel to the yellow sea at piandan port and at the same time through the sub huaihe yi project when the large flow flood occurs the flood is discharged into the xinyihe river and it has water resources connection with luoma lake and gaoyou lake the connection of the water system is quite complicated typical and representative therefore hongze lake is selected as a research case 2 2 uncertainty quantification of lake water resources operation rivers connected lake not only need to undertake the tasks of water supply and flood control but also need to take into account the goals of water transfer in the process of lake operation the uncertainties caused by the forecast information will lead to lake operation risks and cause inestimable operation loss zhao et al 2013 zhao and zhao 2014 know how much water is needed to supply or transfer and whether runoff will cause flood disaster in advance are fundamental to operate a lake with multi objective forecasting of runoff and water demand should be an indispensable precondition in the modelling process of lake water resources operation and lake operators thus faces the uncertainties related to forecasting error considering forecasting uncertainty in lake operation is beneficial to reduce the potential risk the water system of the rivers connected lake is complex and model simulation can be fuzzy induced by excessive generalization for lake inflow and outflow conditions in order to facilitate the quantification of the uncertainty of its operation the multi channel inflow into the lake and the multi channel release can be respectively considered as a whole thus the water lake connection system is able to be described based on the water balance theory zhao et al 2015 assuming that there are t operating periods in a lake during an operation period the t operation periods are divided into two operation phases among them operation phase 1 v 1 contains only one operation period while there are t 1 operation periods in operation phase 2 v 2 therefore the amount of water entering the lake the amount of water leaving the lake the amount of evaporation and other losses of the lake during an operation period can be expressed as q v r v e v and l v combining e v and l v to get e l v then the water balance equations of the rivers connected lake are zhao and zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 1 s 1 s 0 q 1 r 1 e l 1 2 s 2 s 1 k 2 t q 2 k r 2 k e l 2 k where k is the operation period in operation phase 2 k 2 3 t s 0 is the lake storage capacity at the beginning of phase 1 s 2 is the final storage capacity after the lake completes operation and s 1 is the adjustment storage from operation phase 1 to operation phase 2 m3 q 2 k r 2 k and e l 2 k are respectively the amount of water entering the lake the amount of water flowing out of the lake the amount of evaporation and other losses in the kth operation period in operation phase 2 m3 eliminating s 1 in 1 and 2 we can get 3 s 2 s 0 q 1 k 2 t q 2 k r 1 k 2 t r 2 k e l 1 k 2 t e l 2 k assuming that the main goals of the lake are water supply flood control and water transfer the release from the lake not only needs to meet the water demand requirements including domestic industrial agricultural and ecological environmental water use but also needs to meet the flood control and drainage objectives as well as the external water transfer storage requirements that is the amount of lake water entering the lake includes the amount of water flowing into the lake through the watercourse and the amount of water transferred into the lake while the amount of water flowing out of the lake includes the water demand in the intake area the amount of lake discharge and the amount of water transferred out of the lake therefore the lake q v and r v can be expressed separately as 4 q v q f v d i v λ v r v w d v f r v d o v χ v where q f v d i v w d v f r v d o v χ v and λ v are respectively the amount of water entering the lake in the operation stage v the amount of water transferred into the lake the water demand in the water intake area the amount of water discharged from the lake and the amount of water transferred from the lake uncertainty difference of water volume flowing out of the lake and uncertainty difference of water volume flowing into the lake m3 in the actual operation process of the lake the initial water storage capacity of the lake during an operating period and the final storage capacity of the lake at the end of the operation are fixed values to ensure that the lake still meets the water storage requirements after operation among them the final water storage capacity can be obtained through the empirical method after the end of the operating phase 1 to simplify the equations combine w d v f r v and d o v into d f v e l 1 k 2 t e l 2 k are combined into elt therefore equation 3 can be converted to 5 d f 1 χ 1 k 2 t d f 2 k k 2 t χ 2 k s 0 q 1 s 2 e l t k 2 t q 2 k in the real time operation of lakes incoming water forecasting is essential for decision support information however the uncertainty of the incoming water forecast may come from runoff monitoring error forecast model calculation error variable environmental impact error and human error et al that is it is very difficult to obtain completely accurate incoming water forecast value or the goal is even impossible to achieve therefore the amount of river water flowing into the lake q f v can be expressed as 6 q f v q f v δ v where q f v and δ v are respectively the forecast value and forecast error of lake water in the operation phase v m3 as can be seen from equation 6 if δ v 0 it means that the forecast of the lake s incoming water is too high at this time if the lake is operated with the forecast information the amount of lake water flowing out needs to be increased to ensure that the lake s water storage does not exceed the maximum water storage requirement however the over estimated runoff into the lake cannot achieve the lake s water storage target in the subsequent operation phase which greatly increases the future drought risk of the water intake area and will cause a lot of waste of water resources if δ v 0 it means that the forecast of the lake s incoming water is too low at this time the lake will store water in advance through operation and the water supply will be reduced this will not only exacerbate the contradiction between supply and demand in the water intake area but also increase the risk of flood control in the future plugging equation 4 and equation 6 into equation 5 gives 7 χ 1 δ 1 λ 1 k 2 t χ 2 k δ 2 k λ 2 k q f 1 d i 1 d f 1 k 2 t q f 2 k d i 2 k d f 2 k s 0 s 2 e l t in addition there is a certain degree of uncertainty in both the water demand forecast information of the water intake area used in the operating process and the lake pre discharge water volume information therefore d f v can be reexpressed as 8 d f v w d v f r v d o v β v where w d v f r v and β v are respectively the forecast water demand value of the water intake area the discharge volume of the lake and the water demand forecast error in the stage v of operation m3 equation 7 can be again converted to 9 l u q v χ 1 β 1 δ 1 λ 1 k 2 t χ 2 k β 2 k δ 2 k λ 2 k q f 1 d i 1 w d 1 f r 1 d o 1 s 0 s 2 e l t k 2 t q f 2 k d i 2 k w d 2 k f r 2 k d o 2 k where luqv lake uncertainty quantified value is defined as the of the uncertainty quantified value of water resources operation for water supply flood control water transfer of rivers connected lake m3 2 3 optimal operation modelling considering that rivers connected lake needs to accomplish the tasks of water supply and flood control and as a water transfer operation lake it also needs to take into account the water transfer task while incorporating uncertainty into the water resources operation system therefore the following objective functions are selected 1 objective 1 the square sum of water shortage amount in the water intake area is minimized 10 m i n w r s 2 m i n t 1 t i 1 l w d i t d o t w s i t d i t 2 where wrs2 is the sum of squares of water shortage amount in the water intake area t stands for different periods t 1 2 t i stands for different water intake areas i 1 2 l w d i t is the water demand of zone i in period t m3 w s i t is the water supply of zone i in period t m3 d o t is the outflow for the lake at time t m3 d i t is the inflow for the lake at time t m3 2 objective 2 lake operation has the least uncertainty 11 m i n t 1 t l u q v t where t stands for different periods t 1 2 t l u q v t is quantified uncertainty of lake operation for time t m3 3 objective 3 pump the least amount of water from the river into the lake 12 min t 1 t q hongze t where t stands for different periods t 1 2 t qhongze t is volume of water pumped from hongze station into the lake at time t m3 based on the east line plan the maximum pumping volume of hongze station is 150 m3 s according to the objective function of the rivers connected lake water resources optimization operation model the following conditions are selected as model constraints 1 constraints of lake water balance rolling forecast information being considered the lake should meet the water balance condition during the operation period at the same time in order to optimize lake water resources operation forecast information needs to be added to the operation model at this time the lake water resources operation with integrated forecast information has the characteristics of rolling hour by hour and for each period new operation decisions will be formulated based on the updated forecast information in order to optimize lake water resources operation forecast information needs to be added to the operation model in each period new operation decisions will be made based on the updated forecast information among them the decisions in the current period will be scheduled and executed and the decisions in subsequent periods will be updated in conjunction with the new forecasts in subsequent periods xu et al 2014 for a lake with an operation phase of t periods period t can be divided into two phases phase 1 containing 1 operation period and phase 2 containing t 1 operation periods then in phase 1 f 1 1 f 1 2 f 1 t f 1 f 2 f t are used to determine an optimal operation decision integrate it into phase 2 through rolling until the operation decision of the entire lake operation period t is completed therefore the lake water balance equation based on forecast information is 13 s t 1 s t q f t d i t e l t d o t f r t w d t where t stands for operation periods t 1 2 t s t is the water storage capacity of the lake during period t m3 s t 1 is the water storage capacity of the lake during period t 1 m3 q f v t and w d t are respectively the predicted value of the lake s water inflow and the predicted value of the water demand in the water intake area during period t m3 f r t is the amount of water discharged from the lake during period t m3 d i t and d o t are respectively the water volume transferred into and out of the lake during period t m3 e l t is the amount of lake evapotranspiration in period t m3 2 lake water level constraints 14 z t c z t z t max where z t is the water level of lake during period t m z t m a x is the maximum water level of lake during period t m z t m a x is calculated according to the limited water level of flood control of the lake during the flood season and calculated according to the highest water level of the lake during the non flood season when z t z t m a x it indicates that the lake needs to discharge water to ensure the safety of flood control at this time 15 v t q f t d i t

value determined in order to ensure the original water use benefits of the lake when z t z t c the pumping and transfer of lake water must be stopped immediately the water level of the northward transfer of hongze lake in july august september november november march and april june z t c are 12 0 m 12 0 m 11 9 m 12 0 m 12 5 m and 12 5 m 12 0 m respectively 3 lake water supply capacity

m3 4 initial and final water storage capacity of lake operation constraints during each operation period the final storage volume st at the end of the lake operation and the initial storage volume s0 are used as operation constraints 5 water demand constraints 17 j 1 j w s t j wd t where w d t is the total water demand in period t m3 6 constraints of pumping capacity of pumping station 18 0 d i t d i max 0 d o t d o max where d i max and d o max are respectively the maximum water volume pumped into the lake and the maximum water volume pumped out of the lake by the pumping station m3 7 constraint of lake discharge volume under 19 0 f r t m 1 m f r m a x m where m is the number of outgoing river channels m 1 2 m f r m a x m is the maximum flow capacity of the outgoing river channel m m3 f r t is the amount of lake discharge in period t m3 m 1 m f r m a x m is the total maximum flow capacity of the outgoing river channel m3 8 variable non negative constraints that is some variables are required to meet non negative requirements 2 4 model solution considering that the model has three objective functions the weight distribution ratio is generally chosen to turn the multiple objectives into a single one that is by assigning weights to different objectives a single objective expression with weights is formed which can be optimized and solved by a single objective optimization algorithm however through weight assignment the optimal solution of the model obtained will be affected by human subjective factors and the optimal solution does not have nonlinear universality the optimal solution for multi objective cannot be truly obtained the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is one of the better methods for solving multi objective optimization problems han et al 2014 long et al 2016 however the increase of the number of objective functions will reduce the optimization efficiency of the nsga ii algorithm reduce the convergence speed and increase the calculation complexity leading to the emergence of such problems as optimization calculation time being too long the global convergence being not strong and the pareto front distribution being uneven aboutalebi et al 2015 in order to reduce the optimization time of the nsga ii algorithm while enhancing its global convergence and improving the balance maintaining ability of the pareto front distribution try to use the normal boundary crossing method and the primal dual interior point method for the coupling of the objective functions of the optimal operation model of water resources akbari et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the main idea is to select two objective functions from three objective functions and set them as f1 and f2 respectively and set four solution sets of f11 f12 f21 and f22 among them f11 is the solution of the objective function 1 when optimizing the objective function 1 f12 is the solution of the objective function 2 when optimizing the objective function 1 f21 is the solution of the objective function 1 when optimizing the objective function 2 and f22 is the solution of objective function 2 when optimizing objective function 2 f11 f12 f21 and f22 can be solved by the primal dual interior point method then the objective functions f1 and f2 are normalized by the normal boundary crossing method the objective functions after normalization f1 and f2 respectively and the expression is as follows 20 f 1 f 1 f 12 f 11 f 12 f 2 f 2 f 22 f 21 f 22 at this time use f1 and f2 to establish a utopia line with slope 1 on the planar coordinate axis the normal line being 20 5 2 20 5 2 t the origin being f11 f22 and the endpoints being respectively 0 1 and 1 0 li et al 2014 2015 f1 and f2 are the endpoints of the pareto front assuming that x 0 x 1 is the abscissa of any point a on the utopia line then the coordinates of a can be expressed as x 1 x the pareto front in the normal space can be seen in fig 1 the closer the pareto frontieris to f11 f22 the more optimized the solution that is under l20 5 2 l20 5 2 t x 1 1 x t f1 1 f2 0 t and other constraints when l is the maximum value the corresponding pareto front is optimal at this time the objective functions f1 and f2 can be coupled into an optimal solution problem of the objective function namely 21 max l s t l 2 0 5 2 l 2 0 5 2 t x 1 1 x t f 1 1 f 2 0 t h k x 0 k 1 2 k g l x 0 1 1 2 l considering that the optimal operation model of lake water resources has three objective functions the minimum sum of squares of water shortage in the water intake area the minimum amount of water drawn into the lake from rivers and the minimum uncertainty of lake operation the two objective functions of minimum uncertainty of lake operation and the minimum amount of water drawn into the lake are selected for coupling to obtain the coupling objective function l at this time the nsga ii algorithm can be used to optimize the coupling objective function l and the minimum objective function of the sum of squares of water shortage amount in the intake area and then use fuzzy satisfaction evaluation to complete the final optimization of the pareto front solution the fuzzy satisfaction evaluation function is 22 s d j i 1 i s d i j j 1 j i 1 i s d i j where sdj is the fuzzy satisfaction of the jth solution of the pareto front with a value between 0 and 1 j is the number of solutions in the pareto front i is an optimization goal i 2 sdj non dominated solution corresponding to the maximum value is the optimal solution for multi objective optimization in general the fuzzy satisfaction function has small large and intermediate types considering that the objective functions in lake water resources operation are all minimized therefore the small type fuzzy satisfaction function is selected to optimize the pareto front the expression equation of the small type fuzzy satisfaction function is 23 s d i 0 f i f i max f i max f i f i max f i min f i min f i f i max 1 f i f i min therefore the optimization calculation process of the objective function coupling algorithm based on the normal boundary crossing method the primal dual interior point method the nsga ii algorithm and the fuzzy satisfaction evaluation can be seen in fig 2 3 case study 3 1 study area hongze lake is located in huai an city and suqian city jiangsu province china it is located 33 06 33 40 north latitude and 118 10 118 52 east longitude it has a typical humid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is between 10 and 16 c it is not only the fourth largest freshwater lake in china but also the largest plain reservoir in the huaihe river basin and an important operation reservoir for the east route of the south to north water transfer project hongze lake has multiple uses including flood control irrigation water transfer water transportation and aquaculture the general water surface area can reach 1597 km3 and the corresponding water level is 12 5 m meanwhile during the flood the water surface area can reach 3500 km3 the corresponding water level is even 15 5 m the geographical location of hongze lake and its water lake connection system is depicted in fig 3 3 2 results select 2018 as the operation year and use the data of the water inflow and water demand of hongze lake in 2018 table 1 to optimize the calculation of the water resources operation of hongze lake under uncertainty the inflow forecasting data were collected from the hydrographic office information center of huaihe river conservancy commission water demand prediction data were selected from the china institute of water resources and hydropower research among them the parameters of the nsga ii algorithm are set as follows the particle swarm population size and the number of iterations are set to 100 and 1000 respectively the crossover rate is 0 9 the mutation rate is 0 1 and the memory population size is 2 through the model calculation the pareto front of the water resources optimization operation of hongze lake in 2018 is obtained fig 4 subsequently through fuzzy satisfaction evaluation the optimal solution ranking of the water resources optimization operation of hongze lake in 2018 can be obtained table 2 the results show that the satisfaction of the first ranked program is 0 98 of which the sum of squares of water shortage in the water intake area is 0 0125 billion m3 the amount of water pumped into the lake is only 0 002 billion m3 and the operation uncertainty is also controlled at 0 01 billion m3 it can be seen that the three goals can achieve an optimal state therefore the best balance plan of the water resources optimization operation of hongze lake in 2018 can be seen in table 3 it can be seen in table 3 that the large water supply of hongze lake exists from may to august due to increased water use for agricultural irrigation there is a water supply fluctuation in october by reason of irrigation demand for winter drought crops the processes of water supply and transfer of hongze lake are relatively smooth under the optimal operation plan the forecasting uncertainty and the economy of pumping stations are considered in the process of lake operation it is no longer blindly transfer water even if permitted and thus hongze lake has enough storage capacity to receive natural inflows realizing the efficient use of lake water resources the results indicate that the uncertainty is reduced and meanwhile the flexibility and rationality of lake operation are improved by the proposed operation model which also illustrate the good robustness of optimal operation plan the comparative analysis of the model calculation results and related research results shows that the water resources optimization operation plan of hongze lake can make full use of the lake s storage capacity on the basis of effectively controlling the operation uncertainty improve the water supply satisfaction and reduce the water transfer cost of hongze lake section of the eastern route of the south north water transfer fang et al 2018 guo et al 2018 that is the optimal operation of lake water resources obtained through the model is reasonable chang et al 2019 therefore taking the quantified uncertainty as the objective function of the lake water resources optimal operation model through coupled multi objective optimization algorithm the minimum value of operation uncertainty can be obtained thereby reducing the possible loss caused by forecasting in the operation process at the same time the optimal operation model of lake water resources based on uncertainty can achieve adaptability to the influence of human factors 4 discussion lake operators in general would rather experience a temporarily small scale water shortage than making an error operation decision lake has its limiting capacity for discharge thus which can be expressed as dfv max and its total error is β β 1 β 2 β 2 k 2 t β 2 k based on the equation 8 assuming that β obey normal distribution zhao et al 2014 schwanenberg et al 2015 that is β n 0 σ we can get 24 β 1 n 0 σ 1 β 2 n 0 σ 2 σ 2 σ 1 2 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 f β 1 1 2 π σ 1 exp β 1 2 2 σ 1 2 f β 2 1 2 π σ 2 exp β 2

control and water transfer thus lotv lake operation threshold and its expectation function corresponding to wolv lake operation loss in different operation periods v 1 2 are 26 l o t v d f v m a x w d v f r v d o v β v w o l 1 l o t 1 f β 1 d β 1 w o l 2 l o t 2 f β 2 d β 2 where f β 1 and f β 2 respectively is the probability density function with regard to β 1 and β 2 it can be seen that lotv is the marginal benefit of wolv and the first and second derivatives of wolv are 27 wo l 1 dwo l 1 d β 1 β 1 l o t 1 1 σ 1 2 π exp lo t 1 2 2 σ 1 2 0 w o l 2 dwo l 2 d β 2 β 2 l o t 2 1 σ 2 2 π exp lo t

decreasing function of lotv wolv would decrease with the increase of lotv which infers that when lake discharge is unable to meet operation objectives lakes with higher storage have more significant effects on reducing the loss of operation uncertainty and inversely operation uncertainty is unquenchable for lakes with less storage thus the development of hydrological monitoring and improvement of the water demand forecasting model is an effective way to reduce operation uncertainty in small lakes lotv has the diminishing marginal benefit on wolv in conclusion for rivers connected lake with the objectives of water supply flood control and water transfer storage operation decision is to transfer water according to the maximum capacity of the pump stations and pipeline when water available in the lake is small with the increasing lake water the operation decision is changed from limited water supply to demand based water supply when the lake has its expectation water storage water available in the lake could meet the water demand in current operation period without additional water transfer here lake water transfer is under intermittent operation meanwhile there might be a higher probability of water shortage if the final expectation of water storage is small and the applicability of forecasting information depends on the acceptable risk of water shortage to lake operators there might be a higher probability of abandoned water if the final expectation water storage is large and the applicability of forecasting information depends on the acceptable risk of abandoned water to lake operators reservoir is a common research focus in which the minimum water shortage maximum economic benefit and minimum water cost are frequently used as the objective functions compared with existing works lake with a complex water system is selected as the study case in this paper and a lake optimal operation model with the objective function of forecasting uncertainty in the real operation is proposed an integrated optimization algorithm is employed to solve the model multi objective problem with high efficiency and low subjectivity a more adaptable optimal operation plan for rivers connected lake can be obtained to enhance the risk averse capacity of lake water resources system the research findings can realize the progress in the study of lake optimal operation the results suggest that forecasting uncertainty although cannot be eliminated the optimal lake operation plan with minimal luqv is obtained through the proposed model however the optimal operation modelling is limited by certain factors such as the number of objective functions the constraint conditions and the processing method of multi objective problem it can be inferred that the number threshold of the objective function in the proposed model is 4 that is the optimal computing of the model with more than 4 objective functions will be greatly affected by the subjective uncertainty from objectives combination or weight assignment the proposed integrated algorithm is unable to handle the model with the objective number greater than 4 thus which is not applicable to operate lakes in the group how to extend the applicability of the proposed operation model in lakes in the group is an issue needed to pay attention to moreover the final storage capacity after the lake completes operation s 2 in this paper is considered as the man made setting indicator and in practice s 2 is generally determined by experience from operators realizing dynamic selection for s 2 is also an important issue that deserved further study and is of great help to the full automatic operation for rivers connected lake besides in case of sudden water pollution the development of emergency operation mode for rivers connected lake is crucial for the quality of water supply and the rules of water transfer and whether water quality can be used as the model objective function remains to be further discussed due to the limited space the problems described above have not been studied in this paper but further researches such as different solutions under multiple uncertainties the method of s 2 selection the development for the multi objective optimization method and operation model will be studied in the future 5 conclusions in view of the complex characteristics of the rivers connected lake water system and the uncertainties that are difficult to eliminate in water resources operation this paper draws the following conclusions 1 the characteristics of the rivers connected lake are discussed in view of the complex characteristics of the rivers connected lake system and the uncertainties that are difficult to eliminate in water resources operation the forecast uncertainty in the lake operation process is quantified and used as the objective function a multi objective lake water resources optimal operation model is proposed 2 this paper attempts to use the normal boundary crossing method the primal dual interior point method and the nsga ii integrated algorithm to achieve the optimization calculation of the multi objective operation of the rivers connected lake 3 the proposed model can couple human factors to the optimal operation of lake water resources and can realize the optimal operation calculation of lake water resources that takes into account uncertainty taking hongze lake as an example and an optimized water resources operation plan with adaptability to human factors was obtained therefore the uncertainty based rivers connected lake water resources optimal operation model is reasonable and reliable and can provide a reference for the study of lake water resources operation with rich water system

4760,due to the complex water system and diversified management requirements the optimal water resources operation of the rivers connected lake has always been a difficulty in current researches based on the discussion of characteristics of the rivers connected lake this paper quantified the forecasting uncertainty in the operation process and set the quantified uncertainty as the objective function to establish the water resources optimal operation model of rivers connected lake the human factors were coupled to the optimal water resources operation in the model in order to obtain the optimal plan of lake water resources operation with human adaptability hongze lake was taken as an example for the analysis of water resources optimization operation plan of rivers connected lake also an integrated algorithm including the normal boundary crossing method the primal dual interior point method and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was proposed to solve the lake operation model the results proved that the optimization calculation of multi objective operation under the uncertainty conditions of hongze lake can be obtained by the proposed model and algorithm uncertainties related to forecasts of lake operation can be effectively reduced by the proposed model which thus implied the obtained operation plan in this paper is more adaptive to changing environment than the existing other plans the research results can provide technical methods for the lake water resources operation with plentiful and diverse objectives of china and other countries keywords operation uncertainty uncertainty quantification lake water operation modelling rivers connected lake 1 introduction as an important carrier of water resources lakes play an indispensable role in flood control water storage and allocation water purification ecological wetland protection and maintenance of biological species diversity they are inseparable from human life ding et al 2019 large water storage areas lakes are generally managed as reservoirs but they are not exactly the same as reservoirs kobler and schmid 2019 what they have in common is that they are both large scale water storage areas and have satisfactory storage functionality the difference between the two is that because the reservoir is artificially constructed its outflow and inflow conditions are simple with strong controllability and the storage and discharge processes of water resources can be realized by adjusting the reservoir gate however for lakes as natural resources existing in river networks and water systems especially lakes that connect multiple rivers and pass through multiple water systems the outflow and inflow conditions are extremely complex and most lakes are shallow water with complex terrain and are highly susceptible to the impact of changing environments furthermore with the development of social economy inter basin water transfer projects emerge accordingly to solve the problem of uneven distribution of water resources in order to save engineering costs water transfer projects normally choose lakes connected with rivers complex and diversified water system as the water storage lakes for the transfer which poses a greater challenge to the lakes water resources operation zhuan et al 2018 lakes that store fresh water resources can play a decent supporting role for the development and utilization of national water resources navigation and transportation fisheries and aquaculture development irrigation and water operation and storage rivers connected lake are not only limited by their own complex water resources but also affected by climate change and human activities deng and chen 2016 especially in the lake water resources operation process lake operation deviations due to inaccurate forecasting information concerning inflow to the lake water demand in the water receiving area and lake discharge will cause considerable losses to lake management wu et al 2020 at present some scholars have conducted considerable research on operation uncertainty and lake problems in terms of uncertainty the two stage stochastic programming method is used to deal with the uncertain factors in multiple water resources for cities and the optimization strategy took into account the economic penalty of water resources operation risks which could minimize the loss caused by uncertainty in water resources operation zhang et al 2009 dobson et al 2019 the disadvantage of the two stage stochastic programming method is that the probability distribution of uncertainty is closely related to the amount of information while the amount of information in the actual problem is somewhat insufficient and it is difficult to derive the probability distribution of uncertainty liu et al 2018 this is the real change when lu et al 2009 coupled the interactive fuzzy method and the two stage stochastic programming method based on interval mathematics to form a two stage interactive stochastic fuzzy programming method which could eliminate the double risks of fuzziness of the upper and lower bounds of the interval and human subjective identification to effectively describe the uncertainty in the event a multi source water supply operation model close to reality through the description of the uncertainty in the water supply operation system by the probability distribution and the interval was established parameters uncertainty was proved to exist in the reservoir operation process and have a lot of impacts on water resources management he et al 2018 under the condition of operation uncertainty the lake water resources optimal operation plan originally obtained through the conventional optimal operation model is no longer applicable in particular the impact of uncertainty may be slow and small and it is not easily noticeable in a short time but it will cause irreparable losses at some time in the future van loon and laaha 2015 tegegne and kim 2020 the existence of these uncertainties also makes it difficult for the water resources operation model to achieve the best performance zolghadr et al 2019 however how does the lake operation uncertainty exist in one way or another whether the uncertainty can be quantified and how is the uncertainty taken into consideration in lake operation these questions have not received much attention and are worth further study moreover the multi objective operation is important for rivers connected lake the stored water in lakes can be used for flood control hydropower generation irrigation and navigation zajac et al 2017 optimizing the operation system can improve the robustness of water resource management in terms of lake operation it is the fundamental goal of the research on the relationship between rivers and lakes to study the principle of optimal operation principles of rivers and lakes with the joint operation of major water conservancy projects in the rivers and lakes system as the core and to maintain a healthy rivers and lakes system pattern etten and vellekoop 2009 mao et al 2016 moradi et al 2018 taking full advantage of the capacity of major water conservancy projects and carrying out river lake project integration and optimal operation is the most economical and feasible means to maintain the healthy relationship between rivers and lakes chang et al 2010 yi et al 2018 however the water transfer project will change the connection of regional rivers and lakes the most obvious feature is that after transferring water into the lake it may promote the flow of lake water increase the self purification capacity of the water and improve the ecological environment of the lake ou et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the study has found that there is a complex water system connection between dongting lake and yangtze river when the three gorges reservoir operation changes the runoff process of yangtze river it will cause changes in the annual channel storage of dongting lake which will have a significant impact on flood control water resources allocation and water environmental protection in dongting lake area fu et al 2019 it is foreseeable that the water transfer project can realize the mutual adjustment of water resources in the system through the lakes along the way and can also form a water volume adjustment system along the water transmission line which serves multiple purposes such as realizing pre transfer of water rational use of flood resources and optimized water supply liu and dai 2017 ghale et al 2018 scientifically using the storage lakes can effectively enhance the management level of the water transfer project and improve the water resources allocation capacity of the project wang et al 2017 khazheeva and plyusnin 2018 how to conduct a multi objective operation for water resources of the rivers connected lake under uncertainty is an important and critical problem thus clarifying the connection between lakes and water systems and realizing the optimal operation of lake water resources with joint operation of water conservancy projects are the basic theoretical issues that need to be urgently studied and resolved in the current when studying the problem of optimal operation of lakes scholars rarely consider multiple optimization objectives at the same time and rarely incorporate uncertainty into the lake water resources operation system water resources operation systems that do not consider uncertainty will have potential risks to a certain extent which is not conducive to the comprehensive management of the lakes kacem et al 2016 there is still a large knowledge gap to operate rivers connected lake in an efficient way constructing an optimal operation model of rivers connected lake water resources with complex water systems and diverse target requirements and proposing an effective optimization algorithm can provide a theoretical reference and technical support for the reduction of lake water resources operation losses and lake adaptive management 2 optimal water resources operation model for rivers connected lake 2 1 rivers connected lake characteristics large freshwater lakes play a multi objective role in water supply aquaculture flood control and navigation in human life and their status is crucial among them rivers connected lakes are connected to rivers and seas and as water carrying lakes they are responsible for water supply flood control and water transfer tasks such a connection relationship will have a great influence on the ecological environment of the surrounding areas of the lakes the blocking of the rivers connected lake water system will not only cause the decline of wetland function the shrinking of the lake area frequent floods and waterlogging disasters and the weakening of water purification ability but also cut off the living environment of the living creatures around the lakes and the rivers and destroy the regional biodiversity resulting in a decrease in the species and number of vegetation birds and habitats around the lakes china has many rivers connected lakes such as hongze lake poyang lake dongting lake wuhan east lake taihu lake etc with the rapid development of the social economy in china the construction of water transfer projects and gate control projects while enhancing china s ability to operate and store lake water resources is changing the water resources situation of these lakes hongze lake is connected to yangtze river through a long river channel that is it flows into yangtze river at sanjiangying through the river course into yangtze river baoying lake and gaoyou lake and through the north jiangsu irrigation canal and the seawater channel passing respectively through the xiahe area and the erhe gate channel to the yellow sea at piandan port and at the same time through the sub huaihe yi project when the large flow flood occurs the flood is discharged into the xinyihe river and it has water resources connection with luoma lake and gaoyou lake the connection of the water system is quite complicated typical and representative therefore hongze lake is selected as a research case 2 2 uncertainty quantification of lake water resources operation rivers connected lake not only need to undertake the tasks of water supply and flood control but also need to take into account the goals of water transfer in the process of lake operation the uncertainties caused by the forecast information will lead to lake operation risks and cause inestimable operation loss zhao et al 2013 zhao and zhao 2014 know how much water is needed to supply or transfer and whether runoff will cause flood disaster in advance are fundamental to operate a lake with multi objective forecasting of runoff and water demand should be an indispensable precondition in the modelling process of lake water resources operation and lake operators thus faces the uncertainties related to forecasting error considering forecasting uncertainty in lake operation is beneficial to reduce the potential risk the water system of the rivers connected lake is complex and model simulation can be fuzzy induced by excessive generalization for lake inflow and outflow conditions in order to facilitate the quantification of the uncertainty of its operation the multi channel inflow into the lake and the multi channel release can be respectively considered as a whole thus the water lake connection system is able to be described based on the water balance theory zhao et al 2015 assuming that there are t operating periods in a lake during an operation period the t operation periods are divided into two operation phases among them operation phase 1 v 1 contains only one operation period while there are t 1 operation periods in operation phase 2 v 2 therefore the amount of water entering the lake the amount of water leaving the lake the amount of evaporation and other losses of the lake during an operation period can be expressed as q v r v e v and l v combining e v and l v to get e l v then the water balance equations of the rivers connected lake are zhao and zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 1 s 1 s 0 q 1 r 1 e l 1 2 s 2 s 1 k 2 t q 2 k r 2 k e l 2 k where k is the operation period in operation phase 2 k 2 3 t s 0 is the lake storage capacity at the beginning of phase 1 s 2 is the final storage capacity after the lake completes operation and s 1 is the adjustment storage from operation phase 1 to operation phase 2 m3 q 2 k r 2 k and e l 2 k are respectively the amount of water entering the lake the amount of water flowing out of the lake the amount of evaporation and other losses in the kth operation period in operation phase 2 m3 eliminating s 1 in 1 and 2 we can get 3 s 2 s 0 q 1 k 2 t q 2 k r 1 k 2 t r 2 k e l 1 k 2 t e l 2 k assuming that the main goals of the lake are water supply flood control and water transfer the release from the lake not only needs to meet the water demand requirements including domestic industrial agricultural and ecological environmental water use but also needs to meet the flood control and drainage objectives as well as the external water transfer storage requirements that is the amount of lake water entering the lake includes the amount of water flowing into the lake through the watercourse and the amount of water transferred into the lake while the amount of water flowing out of the lake includes the water demand in the intake area the amount of lake discharge and the amount of water transferred out of the lake therefore the lake q v and r v can be expressed separately as 4 q v q f v d i v λ v r v w d v f r v d o v χ v where q f v d i v w d v f r v d o v χ v and λ v are respectively the amount of water entering the lake in the operation stage v the amount of water transferred into the lake the water demand in the water intake area the amount of water discharged from the lake and the amount of water transferred from the lake uncertainty difference of water volume flowing out of the lake and uncertainty difference of water volume flowing into the lake m3 in the actual operation process of the lake the initial water storage capacity of the lake during an operating period and the final storage capacity of the lake at the end of the operation are fixed values to ensure that the lake still meets the water storage requirements after operation among them the final water storage capacity can be obtained through the empirical method after the end of the operating phase 1 to simplify the equations combine w d v f r v and d o v into d f v e l 1 k 2 t e l 2 k are combined into elt therefore equation 3 can be converted to 5 d f 1 χ 1 k 2 t d f 2 k k 2 t χ 2 k s 0 q 1 s 2 e l t k 2 t q 2 k in the real time operation of lakes incoming water forecasting is essential for decision support information however the uncertainty of the incoming water forecast may come from runoff monitoring error forecast model calculation error variable environmental impact error and human error et al that is it is very difficult to obtain completely accurate incoming water forecast value or the goal is even impossible to achieve therefore the amount of river water flowing into the lake q f v can be expressed as 6 q f v q f v δ v where q f v and δ v are respectively the forecast value and forecast error of lake water in the operation phase v m3 as can be seen from equation 6 if δ v 0 it means that the forecast of the lake s incoming water is too high at this time if the lake is operated with the forecast information the amount of lake water flowing out needs to be increased to ensure that the lake s water storage does not exceed the maximum water storage requirement however the over estimated runoff into the lake cannot achieve the lake s water storage target in the subsequent operation phase which greatly increases the future drought risk of the water intake area and will cause a lot of waste of water resources if δ v 0 it means that the forecast of the lake s incoming water is too low at this time the lake will store water in advance through operation and the water supply will be reduced this will not only exacerbate the contradiction between supply and demand in the water intake area but also increase the risk of flood control in the future plugging equation 4 and equation 6 into equation 5 gives 7 χ 1 δ 1 λ 1 k 2 t χ 2 k δ 2 k λ 2 k q f 1 d i 1 d f 1 k 2 t q f 2 k d i 2 k d f 2 k s 0 s 2 e l t in addition there is a certain degree of uncertainty in both the water demand forecast information of the water intake area used in the operating process and the lake pre discharge water volume information therefore d f v can be reexpressed as 8 d f v w d v f r v d o v β v where w d v f r v and β v are respectively the forecast water demand value of the water intake area the discharge volume of the lake and the water demand forecast error in the stage v of operation m3 equation 7 can be again converted to 9 l u q v χ 1 β 1 δ 1 λ 1 k 2 t χ 2 k β 2 k δ 2 k λ 2 k q f 1 d i 1 w d 1 f r 1 d o 1 s 0 s 2 e l t k 2 t q f 2 k d i 2 k w d 2 k f r 2 k d o 2 k where luqv lake uncertainty quantified value is defined as the of the uncertainty quantified value of water resources operation for water supply flood control water transfer of rivers connected lake m3 2 3 optimal operation modelling considering that rivers connected lake needs to accomplish the tasks of water supply and flood control and as a water transfer operation lake it also needs to take into account the water transfer task while incorporating uncertainty into the water resources operation system therefore the following objective functions are selected 1 objective 1 the square sum of water shortage amount in the water intake area is minimized 10 m i n w r s 2 m i n t 1 t i 1 l w d i t d o t w s i t d i t 2 where wrs2 is the sum of squares of water shortage amount in the water intake area t stands for different periods t 1 2 t i stands for different water intake areas i 1 2 l w d i t is the water demand of zone i in period t m3 w s i t is the water supply of zone i in period t m3 d o t is the outflow for the lake at time t m3 d i t is the inflow for the lake at time t m3 2 objective 2 lake operation has the least uncertainty 11 m i

lake 12 min t 1 t q hongze t where t stands for different periods t 1 2 t qhongze t is volume of water pumped from hongze station into the lake at time t m3 based on the east line plan the maximum pumping volume of hongze station is 150 m3 s according to the objective function of the rivers connected lake water resources optimization operation model the following conditions are selected as model constraints 1 constraints of lake water balance rolling forecast information being considered the lake should meet the water balance condition during the operation period at the same time in order to optimize lake water resources operation forecast information needs to be added to the operation model at this time the lake water resources operation with integrated forecast information has the characteristics of rolling hour by hour and for each period new operation decisions will be formulated based on the updated forecast information in order to optimize lake water resources operation forecast information needs to be added to the operation model in each period new operation decisions will be made based on the updated forecast information among them the decisions in the current period will be scheduled and executed and the decisions in subsequent periods will be updated in conjunction with the new forecasts in subsequent periods xu et al 2014 for a lake with an operation phase of t periods period t can be divided into two phases phase 1 containing 1 operation period and phase 2 containing t 1 operation periods then in phase 1 f 1 1 f 1 2 f 1 t f 1 f 2 f t are used to determine an optimal operation decision integrate it into phase 2 through rolling until the operation decision of the entire lake operation period t is completed therefore the lake water balance equation based on forecast information is 13 s t 1 s t q f t d i t e l t d o t f r t w d t where t stands for operation periods t 1 2 t s t is the water storage capacity of the lake during period t m3 s t 1 is the water storage capacity of the lake during period t 1 m3 q f v t and w d t are respectively the predicted value of the lake s water inflow and the predicted value of the water demand in

the maximum water level of lake during period t m z t m a x is calculated according to the limited water level of flood control of the lake during the flood season and calculated according to the highest water level of the lake during the non flood season when z t z t m a x it indicates that the lake needs to discharge water to ensure the safety of flood control at this time 15 v t q f t d i t

are required to meet non negative requirements 2 4 model solution considering that the model has three objective functions the weight distribution ratio is generally chosen to turn the multiple objectives into a single one that is by assigning weights to different objectives a single objective expression with weights is formed which can be optimized and solved by a single objective optimization algorithm however through weight assignment the optimal solution of the model obtained will be affected by human subjective factors and the optimal solution does not have nonlinear universality the optimal solution for multi objective cannot be truly obtained the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is one of the better methods for solving multi objective optimization problems han et al 2014 long et al 2016 however the increase of the number of objective functions will reduce the optimization efficiency of the nsga ii algorithm reduce the convergence speed and increase the calculation complexity leading to the emergence of such problems as optimization calculation time being too long the global convergence being not strong and the pareto front distribution being uneven aboutalebi et al 2015 in order to reduce the optimization time of the nsga ii algorithm while enhancing its global convergence and improving the balance maintaining ability of the pareto front distribution try to use the normal boundary crossing method and the primal dual interior point method for the coupling of the objective functions of the optimal operation model of water resources akbari et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the main idea is to select two objective functions from three objective functions and set them as f1 and f2 respectively and set four solution sets of f11 f12 f21 and f22 among them f11 is the solution of the objective function 1 when optimizing the objective function 1 f12 is the solution of the objective function 2 when optimizing the objective function 1 f21 is the solution of the objective function 1 when optimizing the objective function 2 and f22 is the solution of objective function 2 when optimizing objective function 2 f11 f12 f21 and f22 can be solved by the primal dual interior point method then the objective functions f1 and f2 are normalized by the normal boundary crossing method the objective functions after normalization f1 and f2 respectively and the expression is as follows 20 f 1 f 1 f 12 f 11 f 12 f 2 f 2 f 22 f 21 f 22 at this time use f1 and f2 to establish a utopia line with slope 1 on the planar coordinate axis the normal line being 20 5 2 20 5 2 t the origin being f11 f22 and the endpoints being respectively 0 1 and 1 0 li et al 2014 2015 f1 and f2 are the endpoints of the pareto front assuming that x 0 x 1 is the abscissa of any point a on the utopia line then the coordinates of a can be expressed as x 1 x the pareto front in the normal space can be seen in fig 1 the closer the pareto frontieris to f11 f22 the more optimized the solution that is under l20 5 2 l20 5 2 t x 1 1 x t f1 1 f2 0 t and other constraints when l is the maximum value the corresponding pareto front is optimal at this time the objective functions f1 and f2 can be coupled into an optimal solution problem of the objective function namely 21 max l s t l 2 0 5 2 l 2 0 5 2 t x 1 1 x t f 1 1 f 2 0 t h k x 0 k 1 2 k g l x 0 1 1 2 l considering that the optimal operation model of lake water resources has three objective functions the minimum sum of squares of water shortage in the water intake area the minimum amount of water drawn into the lake from rivers and the minimum uncertainty of lake operation the two objective functions of minimum uncertainty of lake operation and the minimum amount of water drawn into the lake are selected for coupling to obtain the coupling objective function l at this time the nsga ii algorithm can be used to optimize the coupling objective function l and the minimum objective function of the sum of squares of water shortage amount in the intake area and then use fuzzy satisfaction evaluation to complete the final optimization of the pareto front solution the fuzzy satisfaction evaluation function is 22 s d j i 1 i s d i j j 1 j i 1 i s d i j where sdj is the fuzzy satisfaction of the jth solution of the pareto front with a value between 0 and 1 j is the number of solutions in the pareto front i is an optimization goal i 2 sdj non dominated solution corresponding to the maximum value is the optimal solution for multi objective optimization in general the fuzzy satisfaction function has small large and intermediate types considering that the objective functions in lake water resources operation are all minimized therefore the small type fuzzy satisfaction function is selected to optimize the pareto front the expression equation of the small type fuzzy satisfaction function is 23 s d i 0 f i f i max f i max f i f i max f i min f i min f i f i max 1 f i f i min therefore the optimization calculation process of the objective function coupling algorithm based on the normal boundary crossing method the primal dual interior point method the nsga ii algorithm and the fuzzy satisfaction evaluation can be seen in fig 2 3 case study 3 1 study area hongze lake is located in huai an city and suqian city jiangsu province china it is located 33 06 33 40 north latitude and 118 10 118 52 east longitude it has a typical humid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is between 10 and 16 c it is not only the fourth largest freshwater lake in china

including flood control irrigation water transfer water transportation and aquaculture the general water surface area can reach 1597 km3 and the corresponding water level is 12 5 m meanwhile during the flood the water surface area can reach 3500 km3 the corresponding water level is even 15 5 m the geographical location of hongze lake and its water lake connection system is depicted in fig 3 3 2 results select 2018 as the operation year and use the data of the water inflow and water demand of hongze lake in 2018 table 1 to optimize the calculation of the water resources operation of hongze

the china institute of water resources and hydropower research among them the parameters of the nsga ii algorithm are set as follows the particle swarm population size and the number of iterations are set to 100 and 1000 respectively the crossover rate is 0 9 the mutation rate is 0 1 and the memory population size is 2 through the model calculation the pareto front of the water resources optimization operation of hongze lake in 2018 is obtained fig 4 subsequently through fuzzy satisfaction evaluation the optimal solution ranking of the water resources optimization operation of hongze lake in 2018 can be obtained table 2 the results show that the satisfaction of the first ranked program is 0 98 of which the sum of squares of water shortage in the water intake area is 0 0125 billion m3 the amount of water pumped into the lake is only 0 002 billion m3 and the operation uncertainty is also controlled at 0 01 billion m3 it can be seen that the three goals can achieve an optimal state therefore the best balance plan of the water resources optimization operation of hongze lake in 2018 can be seen in table 3 it can be seen in table 3 that the large water supply of hongze lake exists from may to august due to increased water use for agricultural irrigation there is a water supply fluctuation in october by reason of irrigation demand for winter drought crops the processes of water supply and transfer of hongze lake are relatively smooth under the optimal operation plan the forecasting uncertainty and the economy of pumping stations are considered in the process of lake operation it is no longer blindly transfer water even if permitted and thus hongze lake has enough storage capacity to receive natural inflows realizing the efficient use of lake water resources the results indicate that the uncertainty is reduced and meanwhile the flexibility and rationality of lake operation are improved by the proposed operation model which also illustrate the good robustness of optimal operation plan the comparative analysis of the model calculation results and related research results shows that the water resources optimization operation plan of hongze lake can make full use of the lake s storage capacity on the basis of effectively controlling the operation uncertainty improve the water supply satisfaction and reduce the water transfer cost of hongze lake section of the eastern route of the south north water transfer fang et al 2018 guo et al 2018 that is the optimal operation of lake water resources obtained through the model is reasonable chang et al 2019 therefore taking the quantified uncertainty as the objective function of the lake water resources optimal operation model through coupled multi objective optimization algorithm the minimum value of operation uncertainty can be obtained thereby reducing the possible loss caused by forecasting in the operation process at the same time the optimal operation model of lake water resources based on uncertainty can achieve adaptability to the influence of human factors 4 discussion lake operators in general would rather experience a temporarily small scale water shortage than making an error operation decision lake has its limiting capacity for discharge thus which can be expressed as dfv max and its total error is β β 1 β 2 β 2 k 2 t β 2 k based on the equation 8 assuming that β obey normal distribution zhao et al 2014 schwanenberg et al 2015 that is β n 0 σ we can get 24 β 1 n 0 σ 1 β 2 n 0 σ 2 σ 2 σ 1 2 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 f β 1 1 2 π σ 1 exp β 1 2 2 σ 1 2 f β 2 1 2 π σ 2 exp β 2 2 2 β 2 2 when 25 β 1 d f 1 m a x w d 1 f r 1 d o 1 β 2 d f 2 m a x k 2 n w d 2 k f r 2 k d o 2 k which means the current operation plan is unable to meet the requirements of water supply flood control and water transfer thus lotv lake operation threshold and its expectation function corresponding to wolv lake operation loss in different operation periods v 1 2 are 26 l o t v d f v m a x w d v f r v d o v β v w o l 1 l o t 1 f β 1 d β 1 w o l 2 l o t 2 f β 2 d β 2 where f β 1 and f β 2 respectively is the probability density function with regard to β 1 and β 2 it can be seen that lotv is the marginal benefit of wolv and the first and second derivatives of wolv are 27 wo l 1 dwo l 1 d β 1 β 1 l o t 1 1 σ 1 2 π exp lo t 1 2 2 σ 1 2 0 w o l 2 dwo l 2 d β 2 β 2 l o t 2 1 σ 2 2 π exp lo t

decreasing function of lotv wolv would decrease with the increase of lotv which infers that when lake discharge is unable to meet operation objectives lakes with higher storage have more significant effects on reducing the loss of operation uncertainty and inversely operation uncertainty is unquenchable for lakes with less storage thus the development of hydrological monitoring and improvement of the water demand forecasting model is an effective way to reduce operation uncertainty in small lakes lotv has the diminishing marginal benefit on wolv in conclusion for rivers connected lake with the objectives of water supply flood control and water transfer storage operation decision is to transfer water according to the maximum capacity of the pump stations and pipeline when water available in the lake is small with the increasing lake water the operation decision is changed from limited water supply to demand based water supply when the lake has its expectation water storage water available in the lake could meet the water demand in current operation period without additional water transfer here lake water transfer is under intermittent operation meanwhile there might be a higher probability of water shortage if the final expectation of water storage is small and the applicability of forecasting information depends on the acceptable risk of water shortage to lake operators there might be a higher probability of abandoned water if the final expectation water storage is large and the applicability of forecasting information depends on the acceptable risk of abandoned water to lake operators reservoir is a common research focus in which the minimum water shortage maximum economic benefit and minimum water cost are frequently used as the objective functions compared with existing works lake with a complex water system is selected as the study case in this paper and a lake optimal operation model with the objective function of forecasting uncertainty in the real operation is proposed an integrated optimization algorithm is employed to solve the model multi objective problem with high efficiency and low subjectivity a more adaptable optimal operation plan for rivers connected lake can be obtained to enhance the risk averse capacity of lake water resources system the research findings can realize the progress in the study of lake optimal operation the results suggest that forecasting uncertainty although cannot be eliminated the optimal lake operation plan with minimal luqv is obtained through the proposed model however the optimal operation modelling is limited by certain factors such as the number of objective functions the constraint conditions and the processing method of multi objective problem it can be inferred that the number threshold of the objective function in the proposed model is 4 that is the optimal computing of the model with more than 4 objective functions will be greatly affected by the subjective uncertainty from objectives combination or weight assignment the proposed integrated algorithm is unable to handle the model with the objective number greater than 4 thus which is not applicable to operate lakes in the group how to extend the applicability of the proposed operation model in lakes in the group is an issue needed to pay attention to moreover the final storage capacity after the lake completes operation s 2 in this paper is considered as the man made setting indicator and in practice s 2 is generally determined by experience from operators realizing dynamic selection for s 2 is also an important issue that deserved further study and is of great help to the full automatic operation for rivers connected lake besides in case of sudden water pollution the development of emergency operation mode for rivers connected lake is crucial for the quality of water supply and the rules of water transfer and whether water quality can be used as the model objective function remains to be further discussed due to the limited space the problems described above have not been studied in this paper but further researches such as different solutions under multiple uncertainties the method of s 2 selection the development for the multi objective optimization method and operation model will be studied in the future 5 conclusions in view of the complex characteristics of the rivers connected lake water system and the uncertainties that are difficult to eliminate in water resources operation this paper draws the following conclusions 1 the characteristics of the rivers connected lake are discussed in view of the complex characteristics of the rivers connected lake system and the uncertainties that are difficult to eliminate in water resources operation the forecast uncertainty in the lake operation process is quantified and used as the objective function a multi objective lake water resources optimal operation model is proposed 2 this paper attempts to use the normal boundary crossing method the primal dual interior point method and the nsga ii integrated algorithm to achieve the optimization calculation of the multi objective operation of the rivers connected lake 3 the proposed model can couple human factors to the optimal operation of lake water resources and can realize the optimal operation calculation of lake water resources that takes into account uncertainty taking hongze lake as an example and an optimized water resources operation plan with adaptability to human factors was obtained therefore the uncertainty based rivers connected lake water resources optimal operation model is reasonable and reliable and can provide a reference for the study of lake water resources operation with rich water system

4761,groundwater flow systems can be topography controlled in arid mountainous and or permeable areas previous theoretical studies indicated that local groundwater flow systems were usually less developed or even did not exist in recharge controlled flow systems and the whole flow system was dominated by regional groundwater flow system however the occurrence and role of local groundwater flow systems in real recharge controlled aquifer systems are rarely addressed the badain jaran desert is featured by hyper dry climate mega sand dune lake landscapes and highly permeable loose sediments making it an ideal natural laboratory to address these issues in this study the local groundwater flow system and its interaction with saline lake water in the desert inter dune aquifer are investigated via hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches the stable boron isotopic compositions reveal the existence of local groundwater flow systems in the hyper arid climate condition the fresh local flow systems regulate not only the lake water volume and the lake water groundwater mixing process but also the ion contents and isotopic compositions of saline groundwater and lake water lake water groundwater interaction manifests as fresh groundwater discharge and saline lake water intrusion this study demonstrates that boron fractionation is applicable in deciphering groundwater flow patterns and lake water groundwater interaction in the arid aquifer systems keywords boron isotopes groundwater flow systems desert topography controlled aquifer 1 introduction hierarchal groundwater flow systems can be spatially separated as local intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems tóth 1963 conditions of the surface topography hydraulic conductivity and recharge and discharge of an aquifer will produce two types of flow systems topography controlled and recharge controlled haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 recharge controlled flow systems often emerge in arid mountainous and or permeable areas while topography controlled flow systems are of common occurrence in humid low lying and or less permeable areas generally when a groundwater flow system is mainly controlled by recharge regional flow systems account for a large proportion of flow gleeson and manning 2008 then it leaves a question about the role of local flow systems in a recharge controlled aquifer the ratio of infiltration intensity r to hydraulic conductivity k is a significant factor that controls the groundwater flow systems liang et al 2013 conducted a two dimensional numerical simulation of groundwater flow patterns based on a neumann flux upper boundary the geometric configuration of their model had several depressions as the potential groundwater discharge zones they found that the dominant factor controlling the flow patterns of a drainage basin was the ratio of r k with a decrease in the ratio of r k the flow patterns changed from 1 simple local systems to 2 local intermediate and regional and finally to 3 local regional systems the whole flow system finally changed from topography controlled to recharge controlled this suggested that an isotropic and homogeneous basin would produce an approximately linearly sloping water table under the condition of a very low r k ratio in that extreme case the local groundwater flow systems were constrained in a very limited area specifically near the lowest discharge zone gleeson and manning 2008 used three dimensional numerical simulations to theoretically evaluate the role of topographic and hydrogeological variables in controlling long term deep groundwater systems in mountainous terrain they also concluded that the ratio of r k directly determined the three dimensional water table configuration and lower r k ratio resulted in a deeper water table when the water table was much lower than the surface topography the proportion of regional groundwater flow increased and the absolute volume of regional flow decreased goderniaux et al 2013 developed a numerical model to partition shallow local and deep regional flow compartments in nested groundwater flow systems the conceptual model was based on a realistic domain of four main basins in brittany france they used different recharge rates from 20 to 500 mm yr to test how the flow structure evolved with the recharge rate their results showed the hierarchal flow structure varied as a function of the recharge rate the role of recharge on the size and nature of the flow regimes was manifested in groundwater flow pathways transit time distributions and allocation of water flow volumes between local and regional groundwater flow systems the groundwater flow systems determine the hydrogeochemical patterns and evolutions wang et al 2015 investigated the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater flow systems of the dosit river basin in ordos plateau china their results showed that the degree of water rock interaction deferred in the hierarchal groundwater flow systems they noticed that in shallow local flow systems the geochemical processes were dominated by dissolution of halite and sulfate minerals in intermediate and regional flow systems these processes evolved into dissolution of halite and gypsum weathering of feldspar and ion exchange their results of the relationship between isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen indicated that the deep regional flow was recharged during the cold climate while the shallow local flow was recharged recently jiang et al 2014 identified the groundwater flow systems based on a profile of apparent resistivity in the mid low reach of the dosit river the variation of bulk resistivity in the aquifer was mainly caused by groundwater salinity therefore the groundwater flow systems determined the solute transport patterns and transport properties and conversely the solute distribution could be used to delineate the flow systems the local groundwater flow systems in recharge controlled systems deserve further investigation firstly the aforementioned studies on the existence of local flow systems are based on theoretical numerical analysis gleeson and manning 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 liang et al 2013 but no attempt has been made to examine the existence of the local groundwater flow systems in a real aquifer with an extremely low r k ratio secondly if the local flow systems do exist in a recharge controlled aquifer system what is their role in regulating water balance and hydrogeochemical circulations the badain jaran desert bjd as the second largest desert in china is famous for the world s tallest stationary dunes and a superb mega dunes lakes landscape fig 1 the height of the giant dunes usually varies from 200 to 300 m with a maximum of 460 m the climate is extremely arid with an annual precipitation rate of about 120 mm hou et al 2016 previous study obtained an estimation of annual groundwater recharge r from precipitation to be 10 50 mm with a most probable range of 30 41 mm through the thick unsaturated zone hou et al 2016 zhou and wang 2018 the loose quaternary sand sediment has a k ranging from 5 to 50 m d hou et al 2016 the ratio of r k is calculated to be as low as 5 48 10 7 1 37 10 5 which is about two to four orders of magnitude less than the r k value in previous theoretical studies gleeson and manning 2008 liang et al 2013 therefore the water table in this desert aquifer is controlled by recharge according to haitjema and mitchell bruker s criterion the climate conditions and topographic and hydrogeological settings allow the lake sub basins in the desert an ideal natural laboratory to identify the existence of local groundwater flow systems and the role of the local flow cells in regulating solute distributions and groundwater lake water interaction in this study groundwater flow patterns and groundwater lake interaction around the brine lake in the desert are investigated via hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches the multi level groundwater sampling systems are installed along two transects of the mega sand dunes around the second largest lake south sumujaran in the bjd fig 1b lake water fresh and saline groundwater samples around the south sumujaran lake are analyzed for major ion chemistry boron b concentrations and boron oxygen o hydrogen h isotopic compositions water samples from these monitoring transects foster the study of the behavior of b isotopes in the continuous changing processes from rainfall percolation to groundwater flow and fresh groundwater saline lake water interaction in addition the fractionation of boron isotopes during the processes of water flow and mixing would assist to confirm the occurrence of the local flow systems in such arid mountainous and permeable areas the role of local flow systems in regulating the hydrochemical and isotopic patterns is also investigated this is the first attempt to use boron isotopes as hydrologic tracers to study the presence and significance of local groundwater flow systems in such typical recharge controlled systems 2 boron hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in groundwater system boron is highly soluble in aqueous environment and therefore an ubiquitous constituent of nearly all water types kot 2009 spivack et al 1987 geochemical evolutionary trends of boron

groundwater dynamics barbieri 2019 gat 1996 previous studies have shown that δ2h and δ18o are capable of deciphering recharge sources in groundwater systems weyhenmeyer et al 2002 nakaya et al 2007 efforts have been made for the studies of lake water groundwater interactions using the dual isotopes krabbenhoft et al 1990 gibson et al 2002 because of their large isotopic difference among different water end members e g surface water shallow groundwater and deep groundwater coupled multiple isotopes of boron and stable 2h and 18o isotopes will provide synergistic depictions on the groundwater flow regimes patterns and the role of groundwater in solute distribution 3 study site 3 1 badain jaran desert the bjd 39 20 41 30 n 100 01 103 10 e lies in the northwest of alxa plateau in china fig 1a it is bordered by the yabulai mt to the southeast and by the heli and beida mts to the south and southwest respectively fig 1a the climate belongs to extreme continental type with hot summers and cold and dry winters gates et al 2008 despite hyper arid conditions the inter dune depressions uncover the groundwater water table leading to the occurrence of more than 100 lakes there is no river inside the bjd lake water is sourced from direct precipitation on the lake surface and groundwater recharge and sinks via evaporation the annual rainfall ranges from 68 mm to 172 mm with a mean value about 117 22 mm in the period of 1983 2012 hou et al 2016 the net lake surface evaporation rate was estimated ranging from 1040 to 1260 mm a yang et al 2010 the wind speed is progressively intensified northward with an average annual wind speed of 2 8 4 6 m s in the bjd the prevailing wind direction is from the northwest to the southeast compound transverse mega sand dunes are aligned generally from the northeast to the southwest roughly perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction dong et al 2013 the heights of mega sand dunes increase southeastward dune sediments in the bjd are mainly composed of fine and medium sand sediments on the leeward slope are usually coarser than those on the windward shao et al 2010 the windward is much gentler and has a larger rainfall contributing area than the leeward the bjd sits in one of several basin depressions of the alxa tectonic block which was formed during the late jurassic and early cretaceous fig 2 fractures and fissures are well developed in the southeast granite mountainous areas among the formations the cretaceous sandstones form the deepest aquifer with a thickness ranging from 1000 up to 4000 m wang et al 2016 the aquifer s overlying neogene clay and fine sandstone formation serves as the uppermost confining unit wang and zhou 2018 outcrops of jurassic cretaceous and tertiary sandstones are also sparsely distributed along the southeast margins of the desert ma et al 2007 in the desert area the thickness of quaternary sandy sediment aquifer varies from 100 to 300 m and this geological unit provides a huge space for groundwater flow and storage the saturated zone of quaternary sediments is generally thicker than 200 m in the bjd wang and zhou 2018 the loose sediments form the major aquifer systems which have good hydraulic connections with lake systems wu et al 2017 in the absence of adequate boreholes lake level herdsman s wells springs and wetlands in this study and from previous studies supplementary information s1 rioual et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 were employed to construct a water table map and generate the regional groundwater flow direction fig 1b regional groundwater level trends from the yabulai mt 1300 m to the discharge zones in gulunai area or heihe river basin 1000 m the regional hydraulic gradient is very subtle in lake concentrated area with a value of about 0 6 zhang et al 2015 3 2 south sumujaran lake south sumujaran lake is located at the hinterland of the bjd similar to most lakes in the desert the lake is sandwiched by two compound transverse mega sand dunes this lake sand dune sub basin system is a representative hydrogeological unit in the bjd and is used as the natural laboratory to investigate groundwater and surface water interaction and groundwater dynamics in the inter dune aquifer systems the groundwater recharge is the dominant factor to maintain the long term existence of the lake fresh groundwater supports a green ring of vegetation that populates the close vicinity around the lakes zhou and wang 2018 this brine lake has an area of 1 26 km2 and an average depth of 8 m with a maximum depth of 11 m the latest estimated mean annual evaporation was 1222 3 mm recorded by an e601 type pan installed above the south sumujaran lake gong et al 2016 based on the recorded evaporation rate annual water volume lost from evaporation at the lake surface is about 1 54 106 m3 the lake sub basin area is about 10 3 km2 given the net rainfall recharge rates to the groundwater ranging from 30 to 41 mm a hou et al 2016 zhou and wang 2018 the annual groundwater recharge volume can be 2 7 3 7 105 m3 direct rainfall recharge to the lake surface is 1 6 105 m3 a then the local groundwater recharge in the sub basin accounts for 0 18 0 24 of the total evaporation loss from the lake the intermediate groundwater flow recharge which is calculated as the difference between the lake evaporation and the rainfall recharge to the lake and the sub basin accounts for 0 66 0 72 of the total lake evaporation as the south sumujaran lake is not the lowest discharge zone of the whole desert basin the remote recharge to the lake is classified as the intermediate groundwater flow rather than regional groundwater flow 4 methodology 4 1 sampling and monitoring systems two permanent multilevel sampling systems were setup in june 2018 for periodical high resolution sampling of inter dune groundwater at the west and east transects of south sumujaran lake fig 3 a and b the system is composed of a battery of hyper hard nylon tubes whose water inlets are buried at different depths luo et al 2017 the inner diameter id of the water tube is about 5 mm so that there is not much water stored in the pipe and it only takes 1 to 2 min to flush the tube at each well a pvc tube with an id of 24 mm bundled with several nylon water tubes is used for the placement of diver solinst canada ltd to monitor the variations of water level temperature and electricity conductivity the locations of these nylon tubes and water table are shown in fig 3c and d this macroscopic multilevel groundwater sampling system has been rarely reported in desert environment and favors high spatiotemporal groundwater monitoring and sampling groundwater hydraulic gradients of the two sampling transects are measured to be 2 9 in the west and 3 34 in the east based on the water table records the shallow groundwater flow directions at the two transects are both toward the lake with the local flow direction in the west transect opposite to the regional groundwater flow direction in the sub basin 4 2 electrical resistivity tomography ert ert is a widely used method to map saline zones of an aquifer and to delineate the fresh water saline water interfaces cassiani et al 2006 zarroca et al 2011 kazakis et al 2016 electrical method was used to map subsurface conductive zones of the nearshore aquifer in this study three ert profiles along the shoreline were obtained in july 2019 at the east west and south lakeshore fig 3a the west and south transects are not perpendicularly to the lake shoreline but at a very small angle due to the large topographic gradients the west transect nearly parallels with the lake shore and intersects with the lakeshore twice 4 3 field and laboratory measurements a total of 44 groundwater samples were collected during the field campaign in october 2018 from the installed sampling systems two lake water samples were collected at both east and west of the lake another 7 saline pore water samples were collected in january 2019 below the lakebed at depths between 0 2 and 2 m about 2 m away from the shoreline near the west sampling transect all samples were analyzed in situ for alkalinity by titration hach company and temperature ph and salinity with portable probes hanna instruments pty ltd water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm ptfe filters and were stored under 4 till analysis major anions and cations i e na k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 were determined by ion chromatography ics 1100 dionex in the university of hong kong the error of each analysis was less than 3 dissolved boron concentrations of the groundwater samples taken in october 2018 were measured at southern university of science and technology china with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer with a detection limit of 1 ppt the precision of each sample was less than 2 standards and blanks were run repeatedly to allow for correction of instrumental drift and sample washout during the analysis the isotopic compositions of boron have been determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry of cesium tetraborate termo fisher finnigan germany in qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences xiao et al 1988 about 1 ml of brine water including brine lake water and groundwater and 100 ml of fresh groundwater were used for measurement the analytical procedure for b isotopic composition analysis was described in details by han et al 2018 the values are expressed as δ per mil relative to the nbs951 boric acid standard where the δ value is defined as δ11b 11b 10b sample 11b 10b nbs951 1 103 the precision of the samples is 0 05 2h and 18o isotopes were measured with oa icos laser absorption spectrometer triple isotope water analyzer at state key laboratory of marine geology tongji university shanghai the standard deviations of all samples and standards are smaller than 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively 5 geochemical and isotopic results total dissolved solids tds of the lake water are up to 132 g l the lake water is predominated by na cl type water the lake water has a high boron content of 182 70 190 56 mg l and is enriched in δ11b 12 04 13 31 relative to continental crust 7 gaillardet and lemarchand 2018 2h and 18o isotopic values of lake water are also enriched with a range of 2 81 to 2 29 for 2h and 6 94 7 06 for 18o a total of 6 saline groundwater samples were obtained from the interface between fresh groundwater and intruded saline lake water at the west lakeshore vicinity in oct 2018 their tds range from 1 40 to 86 4 g l as the salinity increases the water type changes from na hco3 cl to na cl the saline groundwater is more enriched in 11b 13 55 21 92 than lake water while their boron concentration 0 27 68 45 mg l in these groundwater samples is much lower than that in lake water table 1 the relation between tds and δ11b r2 0 82 n 8 of saline groundwater and lake water fig 4 a shows a negative correlation this is because that the saline groundwater is a mixed product of saline lake water and fresh groundwater when saline lake water intrudes into the lakeshore aquifers and mixes with ambient fresh groundwater δ11b shifts from 12 04 to 13 31 lake water to 13 55 21 92 saline groundwater δ2h and δ18o values of saline groundwater are more deficit than those in lake water and range from 60 78 to 16 82 for δ2h and from 6 08 to 3 10 for δ18o the negative relations between δ11b fig 4b and δ2h or δ18o r2 0 91 for δ2h r2 0 92 for δ18o fig 4c demonstrate the mixing process of saline lake water and fresh groundwater from another aspect the δ2h and δ18o compositions of lakebed pore water are within the transition value between lake water and nearshore fresh groundwater with a range of 24 04 to 10 70 for δ2h and 1 92 4 90 for δ18o the water type of fresh groundwater can be classified as na hco3 boron concentrations of fresh groundwater range from 0 18 to 0 82 mg l their δ11b values cover a wide span ranging from 10 02 to 11 83 boron concentration of fresh groundwater shows a positive relation with b cl fig 4d while δ11b presents a negative relation with b cl fig 4e these relations imply a substantial input of boron from dissolution rose et al 2000 b cl values increase downward in the east transect fig 4f in the west transect the b cl values overall increase with sampling elevation but there are several data points showing an opposite tendency fig 4f δ2h and δ18o values of fresh groundwater exhibit a relatively narrow range of 6 38 to 0 79 for oxygen and 63 16 to 34 99 for hydrogen table 1 6 discussion 6 1 groundwater lake water interaction 6 1 1 saline lake water intrusion values of apparent resistivity below 5 o m are indicative of a high saline concentration on the ert profiles zarroca et al 2011 saline zones are reported with resistivity values ranging from 0 1 to 10 o m kouzana et al 2010 kazakis et al 2016 as shown in fig 5 saline zones are all observed on the three ert profiles in both fig 5a and c areas with an apparent resistivity larger than 180 o m are unsaturated in the east transect saline zone can be observed in the lakeshore areas with a shallow groundwater table depth and thus with a high phreatic evaporation rate fig 5a the lakeshore aquifers are strongly influenced by saline lake water intrusion into south and west transects fig 5b and c respectively the lake water solutes are concentrated via intensive evaporation the denser lake water is unstable and intrudes into the underlying fresh groundwater fan et al 1997 yechieli and wood 2002 considering the long term existence of the brine lake the saline plume has intruded into the lakebed and the surrounding lakeshore aquifer mixed with fresh groundwater and recirculated to the lake again the shape of the intruded saline lake water plume in the discharge zone of the nested groundwater flow systems is also subject to local intermediate and regional groundwater flow zhang et al 2020 as the regional groundwater flows toward the northwest intruded saline plume is derived flowing along the same direction in the local scale the east windward slope has a larger rainfall capture area than the west leeward slope leading to the development of enhanced hydraulic gradients the east local flow and regional flow together drive the intruded saline plume to flow toward the west 6 1 2 boron isotopes in saline lake water the desert lakes are mainly fed by groundwater and receive minor input from direct rainfall to the lake surface the boron contents are usually very low in meteoric water yingkai et al 1992 thus boron in lake water is mainly derived from groundwater the groundwater has two distinct end members fresh and saline groundwater whose boron contents and isotopic compositions are also different boron contents of the lake water are higher than those of the saline groundwater and significantly higher than those of fresh groundwater but the δ11b values exhibit reverse distributions compared with its content in different water end members table 1 the high boron contents in lake water are due to the enrichment by intensive evaporation even though part of the boron in lake water is lost from adsorption into calcite the boron isotopic compositions are controlled by adsorption into calcite and the recharge sources namely fresh and saline groundwater and rainfall yingkai et al 1992 saturation index si of calcite can be calculated using phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 calcite in lake water is highly over saturated with an average calcite si of 2 2 as a result boron is prone to be co precipitated with calcite in the lake water because boron uptake is associated with boron isotope fractionation paris et al 2010 boron co precipitation with calcite plays an important role in modifying the boron isotopic compositions in lake water 6 1 3 boron isotopes in saline groundwater saline groundwater is the mixture of fresh groundwater and intruded lake water the relation between δ18o and δ2h in groundwater and lake water is indicative of the processes of lake water groundwater interactions the dots of saline groundwater are scattered along the mixing line of fresh groundwater and lake water fig 6 suggesting saline groundwater is an ideal mixed product of isotopic enriched lake water and isotope depleted fresh groundwater since there is no fractionation of hydrogen or oxygen isotopes in the mixing process to quantify the proportion of fresh groundwater f fresh and saline lake water f lake in the saline groundwater the mass balance equations can be written as 1 δ 18 o fresh f fresh δ 18 o lake f lake δ 18 o saline 2 f fresh f lake 1 where δ 18 o lake δ 18 o fresh and δ 18 o saline are isotopic oxygen values of lake water fresh and saline groundwater respectively to quantify the digested boron by adsorption and incorporation b digestion is defined as 3 b digestion b fresh f fresh b lake f lake b saline where b lake b fresh and b saline mg l are boron contents of lake water fresh and saline groundwater respectively even though the distance between the two sampling locations wl2 and wl3 fig 3c is less than 5 m tds and chemical compositions in the two locations vary significantly the area near wl2 and wl3 is the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and intruded saline lake water it is found that the f lake increases with the tds in saline groundwater table 2 the proportion of lake water in the saline groundwater increases from wl3 to wl2 and also increases with depth which is in consistence with the observation results from ert fig 5c as the saline lake water intrudes into the ambient groundwater the highly concentrated solutes interact with the aquifer matrix as shown in fig 7 a and b the ca cl ratio decreases and calcite si increases with the tds when fresh groundwater with a high ca cl ratio mixes with lake water with a low ca cl ratio the calcite precipitates the digested boron contents b digestion decrease with ca cl ratio fig 7c and increase with calcite si fig 7d which suggests the existence of boron uptake during calcite precipitation hobbs and reardon 1999 ruiz agudo et al 2012 when high b enriched saline lake water intrudes into the nearshore aquifers and the lakebed adsorption and incorporation of boron by clay minerals occur 10b has a high affinity to sorbed phases in the high ion strength solutions leading to the depletion of total boron content and the enrichment of δ11b in liquid phase harder 1970 vengosh et al 1992 the negative correlation between tds and δ11b confirms the adsorption process of boron in saline groundwater fig 4a 6 2 fractionation of boron isotopes in fresh water 6 2 1 identification of meteoric hydrogen oxygen and boron isotopes evaporation plays a crucial role in 2h and 18o isotopic fractionation craig et al 1963 cappa et al 2003 heavier isotopes are left in the residual water during the evaporation leading to the buildup of isotopic compositions in the lake water δ18o and δ2h in all the water end members have a good linear correlation of δ2h 4 6δ18o 33 14 r2 0 99n 53 fig 6 the slope of 4 6 is identical to the evaporation buildup line by previous study wu et al 2017 who conducted the pan evaporation experiment of fresh groundwater to delineate the evaporation isotopic buildup effect in the bjd the evaporation line and the global meteoric water line gmwl intersect at δ2h 92 82 and δ18o 12 98 which represents the mean meteoric hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values in the desert lmwl is yielded based on isotopes in precipitation in zhangye about 250 km from the bjd gates et al 2008 the boron contents are usually very low and δ11b is enriched in meteoric water yingkai et al 1992 the boron concentrations of rainfall range from 0 1 to 69 μg l and their δ11b values from 13 to 48 mao et al 2019 δ11b values in the atmospheric vapor reservoir follows the rayleigh distillation process which results in the boron meteoric water line δ2h 2 6δ11b 133 rose koga et al 2006 the evaporation line and the gmwl intercept at δ2h 92 82 and the meteoric boron isotopic value is calculated to be 15 45 according to the linear relation of boron and hydrogen isotopic compositions the rainfall δ11b was measured to be 16 69 in lake da qaidam qinghai china yingkai et al 1992 with similar hydro meteoric conditions to the bjd the calculated boron isotopic value is close to the measured value in da qaidam the isotopic range of 15 45 16 69 can be used as the end member value of boron in the rainfall and will be used for the following discussion in section 6 2 3 6 2 2 boron isotopes in fresh groundwater at both transects the δ11b values in the fresh groundwater decrease with both ph and boron concentrations fig 8 a and b the b oh 4 species prevail at high ph environment while b oh 3 species are dominant at low ph condition palmer et al 1987 in the viewpoint of isotopic compositions 11b is preferentially incorporated into b oh 3 in solutions whereas 10b is easily trapped into b oh 4 water sediment interactions control boron contents and isotopic compositions in solutions palmer et al 1987 pennisi et al 2006 nigro et al 2018a a negative correlation of δ11b versus boron contents in fig 8b suggests that dissolution of boron from aquifer matrix has led to depletion of δ11b and the increases of dissolved boron concentrations a positive relation between b and b cl ratio r2 0 29 in the east transect r2 0 81 in the west transect fig 4d and a negative relation between δ11b and b cl r2 0 63 in the east transect r2 0 87 in the west transect fig 4e further confirm the dissolution process 6 2 3 boron isotope evolution in fresh groundwater previous studies have well documented that the evolution of δ11b in groundwater is indicative of water rock interaction processes negrel et al 2002 the aforementioned meteoric water has a boron isotopic composition range of 15 45 to 16 69 and this range could represents the starting point of the groundwater during the water rock process sediments usually have negative boron isotopic compositions of 8 to 0 yingkai et al 1992 and fine sand sediments have negative boron isotopic compositions ranging from 20 to 10 pennisi et al 2006 the groundwater incorporating boron from dissolution of b bearing sediments results in an increase in 10b and thus a decrease in δ11b in solution fig 8a and b show the evolution trend from meteoric water to various stages of groundwater maturities the east and west transects present different increasing patterns at the east transect δ11b decreases and b increases monotonically with elevation fig 8c and d at the west transect the evolution trends of δ11b and b are more complicated both increasing and decreasing trends are presented combining the evolutionary trend of boron isotopic compositions with their spatial distributions can provide the constraints on groundwater flow pathways as shown in fig 9 a the groundwater boron contents increase downward and δ11b values decrease downward in the east transect at local scale the δ11b enriched meteoric water recharges groundwater through the thick sand dunes and then groundwater flows down gradient and finally discharges into the lake groundwater is composed of multi layered water bodies of different age with young water masses overlaying old ones in a relatively large unconfined aquifer that collects rainfall over the whole surface area of the catchment glynn and plummer 2005 vogel 1967 usually the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is one order of magnitude larger than the vertical in such a system horizontal groundwater flow rate is much higher than the vertical one when the boron isotope tracer moves through an aquifer matrix along a flow path the decreasing direction of δ11b is almost equivalent to the groundwater flow direction the minimum gradient of δ11b is likely corresponding to the direction of maximum flow rate because there is less time for water rock interaction in fast flow zone thus the spatial distribution of δ11b can be used to infer the groundwater flow dynamics as shown in the schematic in fig 9a in the dune aquifer of east windward slope vertical geochemical evolution patterns of boron and its isotopes are distinctive within several meters ascribing to the slow vertical downward velocity while the horizontal pattern is less distinctive owing to high horizontal groundwater flow rate this downward flow direction indicates that groundwater is sourced from upward and recharged by local rainfall the spatial distributions of boron contents and isotopic compositions in the west transect are different from those in the east fig 9b topographically the east and west transects are located in the windward and leeward slopes respectively the windward slope is gentler and longer than the leeward slope fig 3a assuming the groundwater basin divide is located right below the sand dune ridge the distance between the recharge area and discharge area in the west side is much shorter than that in the east side moreover the saline lake water intrudes into the aquifer in the west side with a clear interface of freshwater and saline groundwater as indicated by ert image fresh groundwater originating from the west sand dune nearby the lake has to move upward along the interface mix with intruded saline lake water and then discharge to the lake at the vicinity of the lakeshore the fresh groundwater below a depth of 4 m in the west transect is relatively enriched in δ11b because of the short local flow lines which ultimately originate from boron isotope enriched rainfall in the west sand dune the fresh groundwater above a depth of 2 m affected by direct rainfall infiltration is also enriched in δ11b therefore the enriched δ11b in fresh groundwater of west transect is originated from two sources direct rainfall recharge from ground surface and local flow with short flow streamlines fig 9b the local flow system in the east side of the lake has a lager rainfall capture area than that in the west side and thus penetrates more deeply than that in the west the longer flow streamlines in the east side lead to the result that the minimum value of δ11b in the east is smaller than that in the west 6 2 4 implications for the whole bjd the reasons why local groundwater flow systems conceptualized in fig 10 exist on the south sumujaran lake may be due to its unique lake sand dune system the major water sink in the sub basin is the evaporation in the lake however the lake volume is several times of the annual lake surface evaporation loss therefore the lake water level remains relatively constant which maintains the existence of the local flow systems around the lake shore this is different from the riverine drainage basins of previous numerical studies gleeson and manning 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 liang et al 2013 where the local flow systems near the river will shrink and even vanish as the river water level decreases there are over 100 lakes in the bjd among which 70 lakes are permanent each lake sub basin can collect local rainfall to recharge the lake water via local groundwater flow systems for permanent lakes the lake surface area is always the discharge zone and the water losts from evaporation for the ephemeral lakes their lake level is higher than the ground surface in cold seasons and the lake water losts from evaporation while in hot seasons the lake level is lower than the ground surface and the water in the inter dune depressions mainly losts via phreatic evaporation and plant transpiration thus even though the whole groundwater flow system is recharge controlled and the r k ratio is very low in the bjd the local groundwater flow systems still exist in each lake sub basin these fresh local flow systems play a significant role in regulating the lake water volume and geochemical exchange bewteen lake water and groundwater and sustaining the inter dune vegetation and the desert eco system 7 conclusion this study examines the boron contents and boron hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions in saline lake water fresh and saline groundwater in south sumujaran lake bjd china it is found that the boron contents and isotopic compositions in fresh groundwater are mainly dominated by dissolution process boron contents and isotopic compositions in saline groundwater are controlled by the mixing process and calcite digestion dominant factors of boron contents and isotopic compositions in lake water are more complicated boron contents and isotopic compositions in lake water of south sumujaran are controlled not only by water sources but also calcite digestion the boron isotopic composition evolution of fresh groundwater is used to explore the local groundwater flow boron contents and compositions of boron hydrogen and oxygen in groundwater and lake water are used to indicate the interaction processes between the local flow and intruded saline lake water in fresh groundwater boron contents tend to increase and δ11b values decrease along with groundwater flow direction the groundwater flow direction in both two sampling transects is toward the lakeshore suggesting the existence of local groundwater flow systems in such an arid mountainous and permeable area the local groundwater flow systems contribute to maintaining the long term existence of the saline lake and regulating the boron content and isotopic compositions in both saline groundwater and lake water this study provides a newly coupled stable and non traditional isotope approach to study groundwater flow patterns and lake water groundwater interaction in the desert environments it is believed that this approach can be

4761,groundwater flow systems can be topography controlled in arid mountainous and or permeable areas previous theoretical studies indicated that local groundwater flow systems were usually less developed or even did not exist in recharge controlled flow systems and the whole flow system was dominated by regional groundwater flow system however the occurrence and role of local groundwater flow systems in real recharge controlled aquifer systems are rarely addressed the badain jaran desert is featured by hyper dry climate mega sand dune lake landscapes and highly permeable loose sediments making it an ideal natural laboratory to address these issues in this study the local groundwater flow system and its interaction with saline lake water in the desert inter dune aquifer are investigated via hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches the stable boron isotopic compositions reveal the existence of local groundwater flow systems in the hyper arid climate condition the fresh local flow systems regulate not only the lake water volume and the lake water groundwater mixing process but also the ion contents and isotopic compositions of saline groundwater and lake water lake water groundwater interaction manifests as fresh groundwater discharge and saline lake water intrusion this study demonstrates that boron fractionation is applicable in deciphering groundwater flow patterns and lake water groundwater interaction in the arid aquifer systems keywords boron isotopes groundwater flow systems desert topography controlled aquifer 1 introduction hierarchal groundwater flow systems can be spatially separated as local intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems tóth 1963 conditions of the surface topography hydraulic conductivity and recharge and discharge of an aquifer will produce two types of flow systems topography controlled and recharge controlled haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 recharge controlled flow systems often emerge in arid mountainous and or permeable areas while topography controlled flow systems are of common occurrence in humid low lying and or less permeable areas generally when a groundwater flow system is mainly controlled by recharge regional flow systems account for a large proportion of flow gleeson and manning 2008 then it leaves a question about the role of local flow systems in a recharge controlled aquifer the ratio of infiltration intensity r to hydraulic conductivity k is a significant factor that controls the groundwater flow systems liang et al 2013 conducted a two dimensional numerical simulation of groundwater flow patterns based on a neumann flux upper boundary the geometric configuration of their model had several depressions as the potential groundwater discharge zones they found that the dominant factor controlling the flow patterns of a drainage basin was the ratio of r k with a decrease in the ratio of r k the flow patterns changed from 1 simple local systems to 2 local intermediate and regional and finally to 3 local regional systems the whole flow system finally changed from topography controlled to recharge controlled this suggested that an isotropic and homogeneous basin would produce an approximately linearly sloping water table under the condition of a very low r k ratio in that extreme case the local groundwater flow systems were constrained in a very limited area specifically near the lowest discharge zone gleeson and manning 2008 used three dimensional numerical simulations to theoretically evaluate the role of topographic and hydrogeological variables in controlling long term deep groundwater systems in mountainous terrain they also concluded that the ratio of r k directly determined the three dimensional water table configuration and lower r k ratio resulted in a deeper water table when the water table was much lower than the surface topography the proportion of regional groundwater flow increased and the absolute volume of regional flow decreased goderniaux et al 2013 developed a numerical model to partition shallow local and deep regional flow compartments in nested groundwater flow systems the conceptual model was based on a realistic domain of four main basins in brittany france they used different recharge rates from 20 to 500 mm yr to test how the flow structure evolved with the recharge rate their results showed the hierarchal flow structure varied as a function of the recharge rate the role of recharge on the size and nature of the flow regimes was manifested in groundwater flow pathways transit time distributions and allocation of water flow volumes between local and regional groundwater flow systems the groundwater flow systems determine the hydrogeochemical patterns and evolutions wang et al 2015 investigated the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater flow systems of the dosit river basin in ordos plateau china their results showed that the degree of water rock interaction deferred in the hierarchal groundwater flow systems they noticed that in shallow local flow systems the geochemical processes were dominated by dissolution of halite and sulfate minerals in intermediate and regional flow systems these processes evolved into dissolution of halite and gypsum weathering of feldspar and ion exchange their results of the relationship between isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen indicated that the deep regional flow was recharged during the cold climate while the shallow local flow was recharged recently jiang et al 2014 identified the groundwater flow systems based on a profile of apparent resistivity in the mid low reach of the dosit river the variation of bulk resistivity in the aquifer was mainly caused by groundwater salinity therefore the groundwater flow systems determined the solute transport patterns and transport properties and conversely the solute distribution could be used to delineate the flow systems the local groundwater flow systems in recharge controlled systems deserve further investigation firstly the aforementioned studies on the existence of local flow systems are based on theoretical numerical analysis gleeson and manning 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 liang et al 2013 but no attempt has been made to examine the existence of the local groundwater flow systems in a real aquifer with an extremely low r k ratio secondly if the local flow systems do exist in a recharge controlled aquifer system what is their role in regulating water balance and hydrogeochemical circulations the badain jaran desert bjd as the second largest desert in china is famous for the world s tallest stationary dunes and a superb mega dunes lakes landscape fig 1 the height of the giant dunes usually varies from 200 to 300 m with a maximum of 460 m the climate is extremely arid with an annual precipitation rate of about 120 mm hou et al 2016 previous study obtained an estimation of annual groundwater recharge r from precipitation to be 10 50 mm with a most probable range of 30 41 mm through the thick unsaturated zone hou et al 2016 zhou and wang 2018 the loose quaternary sand sediment has a k ranging from 5 to 50 m d hou et al 2016 the ratio of r k is calculated to be as low as 5 48 10 7 1 37 10 5 which is about two to four orders of magnitude less than the r k value in previous theoretical studies gleeson and manning 2008 liang et al 2013 therefore the water table in this desert aquifer is controlled by recharge according to haitjema and mitchell bruker s criterion the climate conditions and topographic and hydrogeological settings allow the lake sub basins in the desert an ideal natural laboratory to identify the existence of local groundwater flow systems and the role of the local flow cells in regulating solute distributions and groundwater lake water interaction in this study groundwater flow patterns and groundwater lake interaction around the brine lake in the desert are investigated via hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches the multi level groundwater sampling systems are installed along two transects of the mega sand dunes around the second largest lake south sumujaran in the bjd fig 1b lake water fresh and saline groundwater samples around the south sumujaran lake are analyzed for major ion chemistry boron b concentrations and boron oxygen o hydrogen h isotopic compositions water samples from these monitoring transects foster the study of the behavior of b isotopes in the continuous changing processes from rainfall percolation to groundwater flow and fresh groundwater saline lake water interaction in addition the fractionation of boron isotopes during the processes of water flow and mixing would assist to confirm the occurrence of the local flow systems in such arid mountainous and permeable areas the role of local flow systems in regulating the hydrochemical and isotopic patterns is also investigated this is the first attempt to use boron isotopes as hydrologic tracers to study the presence and significance of local groundwater flow systems in such typical recharge controlled systems 2 boron hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in groundwater system boron is highly soluble in aqueous environment and therefore an ubiquitous constituent of nearly all water types kot 2009 spivack et al 1987 geochemical evolutionary trends of boron

china fig 1a it is bordered by the yabulai mt to the southeast and by the heli and beida mts to the south and southwest respectively fig 1a the climate belongs to extreme continental type with hot summers and cold and dry winters gates et al 2008 despite hyper arid conditions the inter dune depressions uncover the groundwater water table leading to the occurrence of more than 100 lakes there is no river inside the bjd lake water is sourced from direct precipitation on the lake surface and groundwater recharge and sinks via evaporation the annual rainfall ranges from 68 mm to 172 mm with a mean value about 117 22 mm in the period of 1983 2012 hou et al 2016 the net lake surface evaporation rate was estimated ranging from 1040 to 1260 mm a yang et al 2010 the wind speed is progressively intensified northward with an average annual wind speed of 2 8 4 6 m s in the bjd the prevailing wind direction is from the northwest to the southeast compound transverse mega sand dunes are aligned generally from the northeast to the southwest roughly perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction dong et al 2013 the heights of mega sand dunes increase southeastward dune sediments in the bjd are mainly composed of fine and medium sand sediments on the leeward slope are usually coarser than those on the windward shao et al 2010 the windward is much gentler and has a larger rainfall contributing area than the leeward the bjd sits in one of several basin depressions of the alxa tectonic block which was formed during the late jurassic and early cretaceous fig 2 fractures and fissures are well developed in the southeast granite mountainous areas among the formations the cretaceous sandstones form the deepest aquifer with a thickness ranging from 1000 up to 4000 m wang et al 2016 the aquifer s overlying neogene clay and fine sandstone formation serves as the uppermost confining unit wang and zhou 2018 outcrops of jurassic cretaceous and tertiary sandstones are also sparsely distributed along the southeast margins of the desert ma et al 2007 in the desert area the thickness of quaternary sandy sediment aquifer varies from 100 to 300 m and this geological unit provides a huge space for groundwater flow and storage the saturated zone of quaternary sediments is generally thicker than 200 m in the bjd wang and zhou 2018 the loose sediments form the major aquifer systems which have good hydraulic connections with lake systems wu et al 2017 in the absence of adequate boreholes lake level herdsman s wells springs and wetlands in this study and from previous studies supplementary information s1 rioual et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 were employed to construct a water table map and generate the regional groundwater flow direction fig 1b regional groundwater level trends from the yabulai mt 1300 m to the discharge zones in gulunai area or heihe river basin 1000 m the regional hydraulic gradient is very subtle in lake concentrated area with a value of about 0 6 zhang et al 2015 3 2 south sumujaran lake south sumujaran lake is located at the hinterland of the bjd similar to most lakes in the desert the lake is sandwiched by two compound transverse mega sand dunes this lake sand dune sub basin system is a representative hydrogeological unit in the bjd and is used as the natural laboratory to investigate groundwater and surface water interaction and groundwater dynamics in the inter dune aquifer systems the groundwater recharge is the dominant factor to maintain the long term existence of the lake fresh groundwater supports a green ring of vegetation that populates the close vicinity around the lakes zhou and wang 2018 this brine lake has an area of 1 26 km2 and an average depth of 8 m with a maximum depth of 11 m the latest estimated mean annual evaporation was 1222 3 mm recorded by an e601 type pan installed above the south sumujaran lake gong et al 2016 based on the recorded evaporation rate annual water volume lost from evaporation at the lake surface is about 1 54 106 m3 the lake sub basin area is about 10 3 km2 given the net rainfall recharge rates to the groundwater ranging from 30 to 41 mm a hou et al 2016 zhou and wang 2018 the annual groundwater recharge volume can be 2 7 3 7 105 m3 direct rainfall recharge to the lake surface is 1 6 105 m3 a then the local groundwater recharge in the sub basin accounts for 0 18 0 24 of the total evaporation loss from the lake the intermediate groundwater flow recharge which is calculated as the difference between the lake evaporation and the rainfall recharge to the lake and the sub basin accounts for 0 66 0 72 of the total lake evaporation as the south sumujaran lake is not the lowest discharge zone of the whole desert basin the remote recharge to the lake is classified as the intermediate groundwater flow rather than regional groundwater flow 4 methodology 4 1 sampling and monitoring systems two permanent multilevel sampling systems were setup in june 2018 for periodical high resolution sampling of inter dune groundwater at the west and east transects of south sumujaran lake fig 3 a and b the system is composed of a battery of hyper hard nylon tubes whose water inlets are buried at different depths luo et al 2017 the inner diameter id of the water tube is about 5 mm so that there is not much water stored in the pipe and it only takes 1 to 2 min to flush the tube at each well a pvc tube with an id of 24 mm bundled with several nylon water tubes is used for the placement of diver solinst canada ltd to monitor the variations of water level temperature and electricity conductivity the locations of these nylon tubes and water table are shown in fig 3c and d this macroscopic multilevel groundwater sampling system has been rarely reported in desert environment and favors high spatiotemporal groundwater monitoring and sampling groundwater hydraulic gradients of the two sampling transects are measured to be 2 9 in the west and 3 34 in the east based on the water table records the shallow groundwater flow directions at the two transects are both toward the lake with the local flow direction in the west transect opposite to the regional groundwater flow direction in the sub basin 4 2 electrical resistivity tomography ert ert is a widely used method to map saline zones of an aquifer and to delineate the fresh water saline water interfaces cassiani et al 2006 zarroca et al 2011 kazakis et al 2016 electrical method was used to map subsurface conductive zones of the nearshore aquifer in this study three ert profiles along the shoreline were obtained in july 2019 at the east west and south lakeshore fig 3a the west and south transects are not perpendicularly to the lake shoreline but at a very small angle due to the large topographic gradients the west transect nearly parallels with the lake shore and intersects with the lakeshore twice 4 3 field and laboratory measurements a total of 44 groundwater samples were collected during the field campaign in october 2018 from the installed sampling systems two lake water samples were collected at both east and west of the lake another 7 saline pore water samples were collected in january 2019 below the lakebed at depths between 0 2 and 2 m about 2 m away from the shoreline near the west sampling transect all samples were analyzed in situ for alkalinity by titration hach company and temperature ph and salinity with portable probes hanna instruments pty ltd water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm ptfe filters and were stored under 4 till

dissolved boron concentrations of the groundwater samples taken in october 2018 were measured at southern university of science and technology china with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer with a detection limit of 1 ppt the precision of each sample was less than 2 standards and blanks were run repeatedly to allow for correction of instrumental drift and sample washout during the analysis the isotopic compositions of boron have been determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry of cesium tetraborate termo fisher finnigan germany in qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences xiao et al 1988 about 1 ml of brine water including brine lake water and groundwater and 100 ml of fresh groundwater were used for measurement the analytical

laboratory of marine geology tongji university shanghai the standard deviations of all samples and standards are smaller than 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively 5 geochemical and isotopic results total dissolved solids tds of the lake water are up to 132 g l the lake water is predominated by na cl type water the lake water has a high boron content of 182 70 190 56 mg l and is enriched

a total of 6 saline groundwater samples were obtained from the interface between fresh groundwater and intruded saline lake water at the west lakeshore vicinity in oct 2018 their tds range from 1 40 to 86 4 g l as the salinity increases the water type changes from na hco3 cl to na cl the saline groundwater is more enriched in 11b 13 55 21 92 than lake water while their boron concentration 0 27 68 45 mg l in these groundwater samples is much lower than that in lake water table 1 the relation between tds and δ11b r2 0 82 n 8 of saline groundwater and lake water fig 4 a shows a negative correlation this is because that the saline groundwater is a mixed product of saline lake water and fresh groundwater when saline lake water intrudes into the lakeshore aquifers and mixes with ambient fresh groundwater δ11b shifts from 12 04 to 13 31 lake water to 13 55 21 92 saline groundwater δ2h and δ18o values of saline groundwater are more deficit than those in lake water and range from 60 78 to 16 82 for δ2h and from 6 08 to 3 10 for δ18o the negative relations between δ11b fig 4b and δ2h or δ18o r2 0 91 for δ2h r2 0 92 for δ18o fig 4c demonstrate the mixing process of saline lake water and fresh groundwater from another aspect the δ2h and δ18o compositions of lakebed pore water are within the transition value between lake water and nearshore fresh groundwater with a range of 24 04 to 10 70 for δ2h and 1 92 4 90 for δ18o the water type of fresh groundwater can be classified as na hco3 boron concentrations of fresh groundwater range from 0 18 to 0 82 mg l their δ11b values cover a wide span ranging from 10 02 to 11 83 boron concentration of fresh groundwater shows a positive relation with b cl fig 4d while δ11b presents a negative relation with b cl fig 4e these relations imply a substantial input of boron from dissolution rose et al 2000 b cl values increase downward in the east transect fig 4f in the west transect the b cl values overall increase with sampling elevation but there are several data points showing an opposite tendency fig 4f δ2h and δ18o values of fresh groundwater exhibit a relatively narrow range of 6 38 to 0 79 for oxygen and 63 16 to 34 99 for hydrogen table 1 6 discussion 6 1 groundwater lake water interaction 6 1 1 saline lake water intrusion values of apparent resistivity below 5 o m are indicative of a high saline concentration on the ert profiles zarroca et al 2011 saline zones are reported with resistivity values ranging from 0 1 to 10 o m kouzana et al 2010 kazakis et al 2016 as shown in fig 5 saline zones are all observed on the three ert profiles in both fig 5a and c areas with an apparent resistivity larger than 180 o m are unsaturated in the east transect saline zone can be observed in the lakeshore areas with a shallow groundwater table depth and thus with a high phreatic evaporation rate fig 5a the lakeshore aquifers are strongly influenced by saline lake water intrusion into south and west transects fig 5b and c respectively the lake water solutes are concentrated via intensive evaporation the denser lake water is unstable and intrudes into the underlying fresh groundwater fan et al 1997 yechieli and wood 2002 considering the long term existence of the brine lake the saline plume has intruded into the lakebed and the surrounding lakeshore aquifer mixed with fresh groundwater and recirculated to the lake again the shape of the intruded saline lake water plume in the discharge zone of the nested groundwater flow systems is also subject to local intermediate and regional groundwater flow zhang et al 2020 as the regional groundwater flows toward the northwest intruded saline plume is derived flowing along the same direction in the local scale the east windward slope has a larger rainfall capture area than the west leeward slope leading to the development of enhanced hydraulic gradients the east local flow and regional flow together drive the intruded saline plume to flow toward the west 6 1 2 boron isotopes in saline lake water the desert lakes are mainly fed by groundwater and receive minor input from direct rainfall to the lake surface the boron contents are usually very low in meteoric water yingkai et al 1992 thus boron in lake water is mainly derived from groundwater the groundwater has two distinct end members fresh and saline groundwater whose boron contents and isotopic compositions are also different boron contents of the lake water are higher than those of the saline groundwater and significantly higher than those of fresh groundwater but the δ11b values exhibit reverse distributions compared with its content in different water end members table 1 the high boron contents in lake water are due to the enrichment by intensive evaporation even though part of the boron in lake water is lost from adsorption into calcite the boron isotopic compositions are controlled by adsorption into calcite and the recharge sources namely fresh and saline groundwater and rainfall yingkai et al 1992 saturation index si of calcite can be calculated using phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 calcite in lake water is highly over saturated with an average calcite si of 2 2 as a result boron is prone to be co precipitated with calcite in the lake water because boron uptake is associated with boron isotope fractionation paris et al 2010 boron co precipitation with calcite plays an important role in modifying the boron isotopic compositions in lake water 6 1 3 boron isotopes in saline groundwater saline groundwater is the mixture of fresh groundwater and intruded lake water the relation between δ18o and δ2h in groundwater and lake water is indicative of the processes of lake water groundwater interactions the dots of saline groundwater are scattered along the mixing line of fresh groundwater and lake water fig 6 suggesting saline groundwater is an ideal mixed product of isotopic enriched lake water and isotope depleted fresh groundwater since there is no fractionation of hydrogen or oxygen isotopes in the mixing process to quantify the proportion of fresh groundwater f fresh and saline lake water f lake in the saline groundwater the mass balance equations can be written as 1 δ 18 o fresh f fresh δ 18 o lake f lake δ 18 o saline 2 f fresh f lake 1 where δ 18 o lake δ 18 o fresh and δ 18 o saline are isotopic oxygen values of lake water fresh and saline groundwater respectively to quantify the digested boron by adsorption and incorporation b digestion is defined as 3 b digestion b fresh f fresh b lake f lake b saline where b lake b fresh and b saline mg l are boron contents of lake water fresh and saline groundwater respectively even though the distance between the two sampling locations wl2 and wl3 fig 3c is less than 5 m tds and chemical compositions in the two locations vary significantly the area near wl2 and wl3 is the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and intruded saline lake water it is found that the f lake increases with the tds in saline groundwater table 2 the proportion of lake water in the saline groundwater increases from wl3 to wl2 and also increases with depth which is in consistence with the observation results from ert fig 5c as the saline lake water intrudes into the ambient groundwater the highly concentrated solutes interact with the aquifer matrix as shown in fig 7 a and b the ca cl ratio decreases and calcite si increases with the tds when fresh groundwater with a high ca cl ratio mixes with lake water with a low ca cl ratio the calcite precipitates the digested boron contents b digestion decrease with ca cl ratio fig 7c and increase with calcite si fig 7d which suggests the existence of boron uptake during calcite precipitation hobbs and reardon 1999 ruiz agudo et al 2012 when high b enriched saline lake water intrudes into the nearshore aquifers and the lakebed adsorption and incorporation of boron by clay minerals occur 10b has a high affinity to sorbed phases in the high ion strength solutions leading to the depletion of total boron content and the enrichment of δ11b in liquid phase harder 1970 vengosh et al 1992 the negative correlation between tds and δ11b confirms the adsorption process of boron in saline groundwater fig 4a 6 2 fractionation of boron isotopes in fresh water 6 2 1 identification of meteoric hydrogen oxygen and boron isotopes evaporation plays a crucial role in 2h and 18o isotopic fractionation craig et al 1963 cappa et al 2003 heavier isotopes are left in the residual water during the evaporation leading to the buildup of isotopic compositions in the lake water δ18o and δ2h in all the water end members have a good linear correlation of δ2h 4 6δ18o 33 14 r2 0 99n 53 fig 6 the slope of 4 6 is identical to the evaporation buildup line by previous study wu et al 2017 who conducted the pan evaporation experiment of fresh groundwater to delineate the evaporation isotopic buildup effect in the bjd the evaporation line and the global meteoric water line gmwl intersect at δ2h 92 82 and δ18o 12 98 which represents the mean meteoric hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values in the desert lmwl is yielded based on isotopes in precipitation in zhangye about 250 km from the bjd gates et al 2008 the boron contents are usually very low and δ11b is enriched in meteoric water yingkai et al 1992 the boron concentrations of rainfall range from 0 1 to 69 μg l and their δ11b values from 13 to 48 mao et al 2019 δ11b values in the atmospheric vapor reservoir follows the rayleigh distillation process which results in the boron meteoric water line δ2h 2 6δ11b 133 rose koga et al 2006 the evaporation line and the gmwl intercept at δ2h 92 82 and the meteoric boron isotopic value is calculated to be 15 45 according to the linear relation of boron and hydrogen isotopic compositions the rainfall δ11b was measured to be 16 69 in lake da qaidam qinghai china yingkai et al 1992 with similar hydro meteoric conditions to the bjd the calculated boron isotopic value is close to the measured value in da qaidam the isotopic range of 15 45 16 69 can be used as the end member value of boron in the rainfall and will be used for the following discussion in section 6 2 3 6 2 2 boron isotopes in fresh groundwater at both transects the δ11b values in the fresh groundwater decrease with both ph and boron concentrations fig 8 a and b the b oh 4 species prevail at high ph environment while b oh 3 species are dominant at low ph condition palmer et al 1987 in the viewpoint of isotopic compositions 11b is preferentially incorporated into b oh 3 in solutions whereas 10b is easily trapped into b oh 4 water sediment interactions control boron contents and isotopic compositions in solutions palmer et al 1987 pennisi et al 2006 nigro et al 2018a a negative correlation of δ11b versus boron contents in fig 8b suggests that dissolution of boron from aquifer matrix has led to depletion of δ11b and the increases of dissolved boron concentrations a positive relation between b and b cl ratio r2 0 29 in the east transect r2 0 81 in the west transect fig 4d and a negative relation between δ11b and b cl r2 0 63 in the east transect r2 0 87 in the west transect fig 4e further confirm the dissolution process 6 2 3 boron isotope evolution in fresh groundwater previous studies have well documented that the evolution of δ11b in groundwater is indicative of water rock interaction processes negrel et al 2002 the aforementioned meteoric water has a boron isotopic composition range of 15 45 to 16 69 and this range could represents the starting point of the groundwater during the water rock process sediments usually have negative boron isotopic compositions of 8 to 0 yingkai et al 1992 and fine sand sediments have negative boron isotopic compositions ranging from 20 to 10 pennisi et al 2006 the groundwater incorporating boron from dissolution of b bearing sediments results in an increase in 10b and thus a decrease in δ11b in solution fig 8a and b show the evolution trend from meteoric water to various stages of groundwater maturities the east and west transects present different increasing patterns at the east transect δ11b decreases and b increases monotonically with elevation fig 8c and d at the west transect the evolution trends of δ11b and b are more complicated both increasing and decreasing trends are presented combining the evolutionary trend of boron isotopic compositions with their spatial distributions can provide the constraints on groundwater flow pathways as shown in fig 9 a the groundwater boron contents increase downward and δ11b values decrease downward in the east transect at local scale the δ11b enriched meteoric water recharges groundwater through the thick sand dunes and then groundwater flows down gradient and finally discharges into the lake groundwater is composed of multi layered water bodies of different age with young water masses overlaying old ones in a relatively large unconfined aquifer that collects rainfall over the whole surface area of the catchment glynn and plummer 2005 vogel 1967 usually the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is one order of magnitude larger than the vertical in such a system horizontal groundwater flow rate is much higher than the vertical one when the boron isotope tracer moves through an aquifer matrix along a flow path the decreasing direction of δ11b is almost equivalent to the groundwater flow direction the minimum gradient of δ11b is likely corresponding to the direction of maximum flow rate because there is less time for water rock interaction in fast flow zone thus the spatial distribution of δ11b can be used to infer the groundwater flow dynamics as shown in the schematic in fig 9a in the dune aquifer of east windward slope vertical geochemical evolution patterns of boron and its isotopes are distinctive within several meters ascribing to the slow vertical downward velocity while the horizontal pattern is less distinctive owing to high horizontal groundwater flow rate this downward flow direction indicates that groundwater is sourced from upward and recharged by local rainfall the spatial distributions of boron contents and isotopic compositions in the west transect are different from those in the east fig 9b topographically the east and west transects are located in the windward and leeward slopes respectively the windward slope is gentler and longer than the leeward slope fig 3a assuming the groundwater basin divide is located right below the sand dune ridge the distance between the recharge area and discharge area in the west side is much shorter than that in the east side moreover the saline lake water intrudes into the aquifer in the west side with a clear interface of freshwater and saline groundwater as indicated by ert image fresh groundwater originating from the west sand dune nearby the lake has to move upward along the interface mix with intruded saline lake water and then discharge to the lake at the vicinity of the lakeshore the fresh groundwater below a depth of 4 m in the west transect is relatively enriched in δ11b because of the short local flow lines which ultimately originate from boron isotope enriched rainfall in the west sand dune the fresh groundwater above a depth of 2 m affected by direct rainfall infiltration is also enriched in δ11b therefore the enriched δ11b in fresh groundwater of west transect is originated from two sources direct rainfall recharge from ground surface and local flow with short flow streamlines fig 9b the local flow system in the east side of the lake has a lager rainfall capture area than that in the west side and thus penetrates more deeply than that in the west the longer flow streamlines in the east side lead to the result that the minimum value of δ11b in the east is smaller than that in the west 6 2 4 implications for the whole bjd the reasons why local groundwater flow systems conceptualized in fig 10 exist on the south sumujaran lake may be due to its unique lake sand dune system the major water sink in the sub basin is the evaporation in the lake however the lake volume is several times of the annual lake surface evaporation loss therefore the lake water level remains relatively constant which maintains the existence of the local flow systems around the lake shore this is different from the riverine drainage basins of previous numerical studies gleeson and manning 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 liang et al 2013 where the local flow systems near the river will shrink and even vanish as the river water level decreases there are over 100 lakes in the bjd among which 70 lakes are permanent each lake sub basin can collect local rainfall to recharge the lake water via local groundwater flow systems for permanent lakes the lake surface area is always the discharge zone and the water losts from evaporation for the ephemeral lakes their lake level is higher than the ground surface in cold seasons and the lake water losts from evaporation while in hot seasons the lake level is lower than the ground surface and the water in the inter dune depressions mainly losts via phreatic evaporation and plant transpiration thus even though the whole groundwater flow system is recharge controlled and the r k ratio is very low in the bjd the local groundwater flow systems still exist in each lake sub basin these fresh local flow systems play a significant role in regulating the lake water volume and geochemical exchange bewteen lake water and groundwater and sustaining the inter dune vegetation and the desert eco system 7 conclusion this study examines the boron contents and boron hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions in saline lake water fresh and saline groundwater in south sumujaran lake bjd china it is found that the boron contents and isotopic compositions in fresh groundwater are mainly dominated by dissolution process boron contents and isotopic compositions in saline groundwater are controlled by the mixing process and calcite digestion dominant factors of boron contents and isotopic compositions in lake water are more complicated boron contents and isotopic compositions in lake water of south sumujaran are controlled not only by water sources but also calcite digestion the boron isotopic composition evolution of fresh groundwater is used to explore the local groundwater flow boron contents and compositions of boron hydrogen and oxygen in groundwater and lake water are used to indicate the interaction processes between the local flow and intruded saline lake water in fresh groundwater boron contents tend to increase and δ11b values decrease along with groundwater flow direction the groundwater flow direction in both two sampling transects is toward the lakeshore suggesting the existence of local groundwater flow systems in such an arid mountainous and permeable area the local groundwater flow systems contribute to maintaining the long term existence of the saline lake and regulating the boron content and isotopic compositions in both saline groundwater and lake water this study provides a newly coupled stable and non traditional isotope approach to study groundwater flow patterns and lake water groundwater interaction in the desert environments it is believed that this approach can be used in other arid endorheic watersheds in the world credit authorship contribution statement xiaolang zhang conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology resources

manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of zhang wen associate editor time averaged groundwater table above the mean sea level has been observed in unconfined coastal aquifers several theoretical solutions were presented to investigate the groundwater table overheight super elevation in response to tidal oscillations nevertheless previous analytical solutions are generally limited to dupuit forchheimer assumptions or a two dimensional free surface model in this paper we introduced a more general condition that a three dimensional kinematic boundary condition is considered an exact analytical solution of the groundwater table overheight under the multi tidal constituents was derived using the fourier transform method the solution shows the local groundwater table overheight is related to the mean aquifer thickness tidal amplitude damping coefficient as well as its positions in sand beaches in addition the analytical solution illustrates the simple linear superposition is not applicable to the multi tidal components condition whose groundwater table overheight becomes weak due to the non linear effect of the three dimensional kinematic boundary condition in addition concentrations were focused on the time averaged total flux density illustrating the groundwater exchange occurs both in the shore normal and shore parallel directions which however is missing in the previous two dimensional solution further cognitions on the groundwater circulation mechanism were also achieved which originates from the large tidal amplitude region and fans out towards the small tidal amplitude region these new findings are of great importance to extend our understandings of the groundwater hydrodynamics in unconfined coastal aquifers keywords groundwater table overheight unconfined coastal aquifer fourier transform method three dimensional kinematic boundary condition time averaged total flux density groundwater circulation 1 introduction groundwater table fluctuations are driven by the combined tides waves evaporation and precipitation as well as topographic hindrance which have important effects on hydrogeology and ecology of coastal aquifers horn 2006 hsieh et al 2015 the groundwater table overheight is one of the principal features of the groundwater hydrodynamics in coastal areas it is defined as the difference between the time averaged groundwater table and the mean sea level msl which is related to various coastal problems including saltwater intrusion agricultural industry and structure stability horn 2006 liu 2013 therefore it is always an important research topic in scientific coastal management philip 1973 followed the non linear one dimensional boussinesq equation and derived a groundwater table overheight formula expressed as δ 1 d 2 a 2 2 d where δ 1 is the super elevation value obtained by one dimensional model d is the mean aquifer thickness and a is the tidal amplitude for the case a d 1 time averaged groundwater table lies above the msl for about 22 of the tidal amplitude as the landward distance approaches infinity his findings show the important role of the non linear effect in generating a super elevation inside the sand beach nielsen 1990 relaxed the boundary condition then introduced the influence of a sloping beach face and derived the groundwater table overheight based on a perturbation approach he concluded that the sloping beach face also plays a significant role in generating the groundwater table super elevation following nielsen 1990 li et al 2000a adopted a variable transformation that confines the moving boundary to a fixed coordinate an analytical solution was acquired based on the perturbation approach as well and the magnitude of super elevation is actually the same as nielsen 1990 then li et al 2000a considered a spring neap tide condition and the result shows the super elevation value is smaller than the linear superposition of the two tides effects subsequently song et al 2006 presented a new analytical solution with the fourier series expansion to quantitatively describe the groundwater table overheight which makes up for the limitation in nielsen 1990 and li et al 2000a and could be applied to the condition when the perturbation parameter becomes larger than unity the improvement is especially applicable to sand beaches with small inclination the aforementioned studies are all based on dupuit forchheimer d f assumptions which consider a purely horizontal groundwater flow and is actually far from the reality in sand beach knight 1981 introduced a two dimensional kinematic boundary condition which takes the vertical groundwater flow into consideration and gave the same solution as philip 1973 for a steady periodic tidal oscillation which also theoretically proves philip s predictions in practice are free from d f assumptions following knight 1981 li and jiao 2003 also employed a two dimensional kinematic boundary condition and considered a more general case that the aquifer is anisotropic and inhomogeneous and affected by multi tidal components with their attempts horizontal hydraulic conductivity is found to determine the asymptotic groundwater table while the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the coastal aquifer is ineffective there exist some discrepancies in previous studies firstly some solutions are generally based on d f assumptions and the others consider no more than two dimensional free surface models knight 1981 li and jiao 2003 in fact the groundwater exchange in the sand beach is a three dimensional motion secondly only a single tidal component is included in most previous studies however the tidal constituents are always sophisticated which generally covers a wide range of frequencies li et al 2000a thirdly the time averaged total flux density is seldom concerned in the unconfined coastal aquifer induced by tidal oscillations which is significant to understand groundwater interactions between land and sea knight 1981 the objective of this paper is to extend the previous study by applying a non linear three dimensional kinematic boundary condition under multi tidal components condition so as to investigate the groundwater table overheight and groundwater circulation mechanism in a more realistic nature situation a mathematical transformation after knight 1981 was made to deal with the non linear kinematic boundary condition then an exact analytical solution of the groundwater table overheight was derived based on the fourier transform method upon which behaviors of the groundwater table overheight changing with the multi tidal condition mean aquifer thickness tidal amplitude damping coefficient as well as spatial coordinates were presented in addition the time averaged total flux density was concretely specified to explain the groundwater interaction over a periodic tide the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model under a three dimensional kinematic boundary condition is established in section 2 in section 3 the analytical solution of the groundwater table overheight is presented by the fourier transform method upon which section 4 qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the groundwater table super elevation in which overheight distribution in shore normal and shore parallel directions are particularly demonstrated in addition the spatial distribution of the time averaged total flux density in a tidal period is also presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem set up to focus on the effects of the three dimensional free surface and multi tidal components conditions the capillary as well as the seepage face is ignored li et al 2000b li and jiao 2003 the groundwater flow is assumed to transmit through an unconfined coastal aquifer with homogeneous isotropic porous medium the tidal amplitudes are not equal but have a downward trend along the coastline sun 1997 chen et al 2016 a sketch of the three dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer with a finite depth is shown in fig 1 in fig 1 h x y t is the time varying groundwater table and d is the mean aquifer thickness below the msl a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system is used with x representing the shore parallel alongshore direction y representing the shore normal cross shore direction being positive landward and z being positive upward all coordinates are confined in a semi unbounded space i e x 0 2 2 a three dimensional kinematic

kinematic boundary condition of the free surface whitham 1974 following knight 1981 we define the quantity w x y t as 6 w x y t 0 h x y t ϕ x y z t z d z the total instantaneous flux q x y t through a vertical plane is related to w x y t here the leibnitz rule is used for partial derivative with respect to x and y respectively and the solutions can be obtained by 7 w x y t x 0 h x y t ϕ x d z h x ϕ

inland boundary condition is 15 h x t y 0 eq 15 indicates that the groundwater table fluctuation is diminished as y approaches infinity accordingly the gradient of the time varying groundwater table becomes zero in y direction taking time average for both sides of eq 13 and it becomes 16 n k h t 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 0 where represents the time average over a total period t which is defined as the fluctuation period in response to all tidal constituents at the shoreline boundary steady periodic tidal constituents are considered knight 1981 17 w x 0 t 1 2 h x 0 t 2 1 2 t 0 t d j 1 n a j e m j x

f 2 x y it is equivalent to solve the following two laplace equations with corresponding boundary conditions 19 2 f 1 x 2 2 f 1 y 2 0 20 f 1 x 0 d 2 2 21 f 1 x y 0 and 22 2 f 2 x 2 2 f 2 y 2 0 23 f 2

time varying groundwater table at any place in fact can be separated into two parts the time independent term h x y i e the mean groundwater table and the time dependent fluctuation h x y t when the locations become far enough in land approximately 1000 m in sun 1997 groundwater fluctuations are essentially unaffected by the tidal oscillations in this case h x y t approaches zero and can be neglected the demarcated distance as 1000 m is denoted as my which is approximately inversely proportional to the wave number nielsen 1990 nevertheless a multi tidal system has been confirmed to propagate much more in land and also makes the distance of my further extend inland li et al 2000a when h x y t becomes close to zero the potential head can be deemed as a hydrostatic distribution that a relation between the time average groundwater table h x y and w x y t can be obtained by 40 w x y m y t 0 h x t ϕ x y z t z d z 1 2 h x y h x y t 2 1 2 h x y 2 h x y t 2 1 2 h x y 2 combing eqs 39 and 40 h x y m y can be expressed as 41 h x y m y d 2 y 2 π j 1 n a j 2 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ eq 41 indicates that the groundwater table far away from coastline is higher than msl upon which the overheight δ 3 x y generated by various tidal constituents under a three dimensional kinematic boundary condition can be obtained as 42 δ 3 d 2 y 2 π j 1 n a j 2 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ d with respect to eq 42 magnitude of the overheight is correlated to the mean aquifer thickness d tidal amplitude a damping coefficient m and positions with different x y coordinates it is obvious that when aj gets close to the mean aquifer thickness d the groundwater table overheight becomes more evident which has been shown in previous studies philip 1973 for a special case m 0 under which the tidal amplitude is the same along x direction a two dimensional situation and the solution of eq 42 degenerates to 43 δ 2 d 2 1 2 j 1 n a j 2 d where δ 2 is the overheight value obtained by a two dimensional model eq 43 is consistent with li and jiao 2003 indicating a generalization to the previous solutions by adopting the present three dimensional analytical solution for a specified tidal constituent the corresponding groundwater table overheight δ 3 j is 44 δ 3 j d 2 a j 2 y 2 π 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ d comparing eq 44 with eq 42 it is obvious that j 1 n δ 3 j δ 3 therefore the linear superposition is not applicable to the multi tidal components under the three dimensional boundary condition which is in agreement with li and jiao 2003 for a two dimensional model furthermore as discussed in appendix it proves j 1 n δ 3 j δ 3 which demonstrates that nonlinearity of the kinematic boundary condition makes the groundwater table overheight under the multi tidal condition become weak based on the above descriptions a flow diagram is presented in fig 2 to give a general overview of the proposed method in this study 4 discussions 4 1 overheight distribution in the shore normal direction applying the present three dimensional analytical solution variations of the groundwater table overheight in the shore normal direction beyond the demarcated distance are evaluated although the tidal components are complex their multiple impacts on groundwater table super elevation have been analytically presented in section 3 2 a monochromatic tide scenario is considered in this section the tidal amplitude is fixed at 1 m and the mean aquifer thickness is set as 2 m in calculation the damping coefficient of tidal amplitude is set as 10 5 m 1 fig 3 shows the spatial variation of the groundwater table overheight in the shore normal direction both analytical and numerical solutions are presented in fig 3 the numerical solution is obtained by solving eqs 16 18 using the successive over relaxation method it s clear that the numerical and analytical solutions agree well with each other for all locations which indicates accuracy of the present analytical solution on account of the variation profiles in fig 3 the decline keeps a relatively mild tendency a logarithmic coordinate is used in abscissa of fig 3 and the overheight value finally gets close to zero when y approaches infinity which can also be demonstrated by a mathematical operation of eq 44 as 45 δ 3 j lim y d 2 a j 2

approaches infinity the h x t 0 and w x t 1 2 h x 2 become completely exact so the potential head in anywhere becomes equal i e ϕ x z d ϕ z d 0 nevertheless it is observed that an obvious groundwater table overheight can be still observed even after a long landward distance e g about 5 cm above the mean aquifer thickness at y 100000 m both in the cases of x 0 m and x 25000 m fig 3 further demonstrates that at x 50000 m with a relatively small boundary tidal amplitude the overheight is more likely to keep a fairly uniform value about 0 045 m within a long landward distance about 20000 m the groundwater table super elevation varies with y coordinate has not been demonstrated in previous studies for a two dimensional model the overheight value is getting infinitely close to a fixed value i e d 2 a j 2 2 d which is independent of y when the landward distance exceeds the demarcated value my however the groundwater flow under three dimensional condition after considering the damping effect of tidal amplitude also leads to the changing groundwater table overheight in the shore normal y direction 4 2 overheight distribution in the shore parallel direction a parametric study is conducted to further examine the effects of damping coefficient as well as spatial coordinates on the magnitude of the groundwater table overheight following sun 1997 damping coefficient varies from 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 m 1 the calculation domain is set as 0 50000 m for x direction and the calculation inland position of y is fixed at 2000 m which is greater than the demarcated distance my groundwater table overheight distribution obtained using eq 44 is shown in fig 4 considering the present three dimensional kinematic boundary model a reduction of the groundwater table overheight can be observed from x 0 m to x 50000 m as presented in fig 4 when m j 1 0 6 m 1 the tidal amplitude varies from 1 m to 0 95 m along the coastline boundary and at the inland position y 2000 m the overheight is 0 1195 m at x 0 m and becomes 0 1095 m at x 50000 m in comparison the overheight values are 0 0730 m and 0 0003 m at x 0 m and x 50000 m respectively in the case of m j 1 0 4 m 1 for the case of m j 1 0 4 m 1 there is a greater alongshore overheight difference comparing with the result of m j 1 0 6 m 1 case considering these two damping coefficients the magnitude of the groundwater table overheight reduces about 4 cm at position x 0 m nevertheless the overheight values at x 50000 m presents a more significant variation about 11 cm with respect to the damping coefficient this is mainly because the evident tidal amplitude difference at the coastline boundary of x 50000 m which is only 0 0067 m for m j 1 0 4 m 1 in comparison with 0 9512 m for m j 1 0 6 m 1 to specify the difference between the two dimensional and three dimensional solutions a relative groundwater table overheight rgto hereafter was considered defined as δ 2 δ 3 δ 2 the two dimensional groundwater table overheight is calculated based on the tidal amplitude at x 0 m i e 1 m fig 5 shows the corresponding rgto distribution with respect to damping coefficient and x coordinate it is found that a universal decline of the groundwater table overheight occurs for three dimensional case comparing with the previous two dimensional results and almost all rgto are greater than 10 the deviation is mainly due to the fact that there exists damping effect of the tidal amplitude at the coastline when taking the three dimensional kinematic model into consideration under which there are evident tidal amplitude differences at the boundary there is no boundary tidal amplitude difference at x 0 m where rgto directly indicates the influence of extra groundwater flows at x 0 m rgto is 9 7 for m j 1 0 4 m 1 which is more than 5 times larger than that for m j 1 0 6 m 1 1 5 more specifically the difference of boundary tidal amplitude over a certain distance becomes greater when the damping coefficient is large leading to more significant extra groundwater exchange flows thus a smaller groundwater table overheight 4 3 time averaged total flux density time averaged total flux density tatfd hereafter is a significant factor to understand groundwater exchange between coastal aquifer and sea knight 1981 tatfd across a vertical plane can be obtained by substituting eq 39 into eqs 7 8 which can be expressed by 46 q x y t x j k x w x y t k a j 2 4 π 0 y e 2 m j ζ 2 x 2 ζ ζ x 2 y 2 2 d ζ 0 y e 2 m j ζ 2 x 2 ζ ζ x 2 y 2 2 d ζ 47 q x y t y j k y w x y t k a j 2 4 π 0 e 2 m j ξ ξ x 2 y 2 d ξ 0 e 2 m

demarcated distance my as indicated in eqs 7 8 the hydraulic conductivity was set as 10 4 m s and two damping coefficients of tidal amplitude were applied i e 10 6 m 1 and 10 4 m 1 calculations were carried out to figure out the horizontal groundwater dynamic pattern in tatfd considering the difference between the above two damping coefficients two calculation domains of 2000000 m 2000000 m and 20000 m 20000 m were used accordingly the corresponding results of the tatfd are plotted in fig 6 over one tidal period the solutions quantitatively indicate that most tatfds are rather small with a magnitude of 10 12 10 9 m2 s under the present considered conditions comparison between fig 5 a and 5 b reveals the tatfd is more significant for m j 1 0 4 m 1 with a magnitude of 10 10 10 9 m2 s whereas it is 10 12 10 11 m2 s for m j 1 0 6 m 1 bordered by the same tidal amplitude this is ascribed to the weak alongshore water head difference at the shoreline boundary for the small damping coefficient case from the overall perspective fig 6 shows that the tatfd presents a distinct spatial pattern originating from the area around x 0 and y 0 with significant magnitudes where the tidal amplitude is large and fanning out towards the small tidal amplitude regions with gradually decreased tatfd magnitudes both in the shore normal and shore parallel directions in fig 6 tatfds at x 0 m penetrating landward are along the shore normal direction owing to the fact that non flow boundary condition is adopted in section 3 2 making the analytical solution of tatfd symmetric about x 0 different from a 2d kinematic boundary condition li and jiao 2003 the present 3d tatfd solution also shows a shore parallel component at x 0 region in the direction of the decreased tidal amplitude which becomes more prominent with the increase of x position fig 6 also clearly conveys that the internal flow feature of the tatfd in the sand beach is not only due to the water exchange from ocean to land in the shore normal direction as demonstrated under the 2d kinematic boundary condition but also has a circulation pattern between the large and small tidal amplitude regions in the shore parallel direction in the region around the shoreline tatfd goes into the calculation domain for small x values whereas it moves out seaward in the large x value region leading to a clear circulation pattern comparing with fig 6 a fig 6 b shows that such circulation pattern is stronger regarding the tatfd magnitude and more spatially concentrated with respect to the alongshore position of the tatfd flow reversal in the case of a larger damping coefficient as could be expected straightforwardly these results further extend our understandings of the tatfd distribution in unconfined coastal aquifers under the 3d kinematic boundary condition 5 conclusions in this study groundwater table overheight induced by multi tidal constituents was investigated under a non linear three dimensional kinematic boundary condition an analytical solution of the groundwater table super elevation using the fourier transform method was presented the result reveals the magnitude of groundwater table overheight is related to the mean aquifer thickness tidal amplitude damping coefficient as well as x and y coordinates linear superposition of the groundwater table overheight is not applicable to the multi tidal conditions which weakens the magnitude of the asymptotic super elevation variation of the groundwater table overheight in the shore normal direction shows a relatively mild change beyond the demarcated distance and finally gets close to zero when the landward coordinate approaches infinity in addition a parametric study was conducted to examine the effects of damping coefficient of tidal amplitude as well as x and y coordinates comparing with previous two dimensional studies a reduction of the groundwater table overheight was confirmed after applying the present three dimensional kinematic model it is ascribed to the fact that there is amplitude damping effect parallels to the coastline present results also indicate there exist horizontal flows in x direction and these flows turn into manifest with the large tidal amplitude or great damping coefficient theoretical estimation of the time averaged total flux density tatfd demonstrates remarkable internal circulations between land and sea it is found that most of their values are rather small with the magnitude of 10 12 10 9 m2 s and the shore parallel component occurs along the direction of the decreased tidal amplitude in general the overall tatfd presents a distinct spatial pattern originating from the large tidal amplitude region and fanning out towards the small tidal amplitude region with the gradually decreased tatfd magnitudes the results also reveal the internal groundwater circulation feature with respect to the shore normal and shore parallel directions under the 3d kinematic boundary condition which is significantly different from the previous 2d cases credit authorship contribution statement mingzhe yang conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology

manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of zhang wen associate editor time averaged groundwater table above the mean sea level has been observed in unconfined coastal aquifers several theoretical solutions were presented to investigate the groundwater table overheight super elevation in response to tidal oscillations nevertheless previous analytical solutions are generally limited to dupuit forchheimer assumptions or a two dimensional free surface model in this paper we introduced a more general condition that a three dimensional kinematic boundary condition is considered an exact analytical solution of the groundwater table overheight under the multi tidal constituents was derived using the fourier transform method the solution shows the local groundwater table overheight is related to the mean aquifer thickness tidal amplitude damping coefficient as well as its positions in sand beaches in addition the analytical solution illustrates the simple linear superposition is not applicable to the multi tidal components condition whose groundwater table overheight becomes weak due to the non linear effect of the three dimensional kinematic boundary condition in addition concentrations were focused on the time averaged total flux density illustrating the groundwater exchange occurs both in the shore normal and shore parallel directions which however is missing in the previous two dimensional solution further cognitions on the groundwater circulation mechanism were also achieved which originates from the large tidal amplitude region and fans out towards the small tidal amplitude region these new findings are of great importance to extend our understandings of the groundwater hydrodynamics in unconfined coastal aquifers keywords groundwater table overheight unconfined coastal aquifer fourier transform method three dimensional kinematic boundary condition time averaged total flux density groundwater circulation 1 introduction groundwater table fluctuations are driven by the combined tides waves evaporation and precipitation as well as topographic hindrance which have important effects on hydrogeology and ecology of coastal aquifers horn 2006 hsieh et al 2015 the groundwater table overheight is one of the principal features of the groundwater hydrodynamics in coastal areas it is defined as the difference between the time averaged groundwater table and the mean sea level msl which is related to various coastal problems including saltwater intrusion agricultural industry and structure stability horn 2006 liu 2013 therefore it is always an important research topic in scientific coastal management philip 1973 followed the non linear one dimensional boussinesq equation and derived a groundwater table overheight formula expressed as δ 1 d 2 a 2 2 d where δ 1 is the super elevation value obtained by one dimensional model d is the mean aquifer thickness and a is the tidal amplitude for the case a d 1 time averaged groundwater table lies above the msl for about 22 of the tidal amplitude as the landward distance approaches infinity his findings show the important role of the non linear effect in generating a super elevation inside the sand beach nielsen 1990 relaxed the boundary condition then introduced the influence of a sloping beach face and derived the groundwater table overheight based on a perturbation approach he concluded that the sloping beach face also plays a significant role in generating the groundwater table super elevation following nielsen 1990 li et al 2000a adopted a variable transformation that confines the moving boundary to a fixed coordinate an analytical solution was acquired based on the perturbation approach as well and the magnitude of super elevation is actually the same as nielsen 1990 then li et al 2000a considered a spring neap tide condition and the result shows the super elevation value is smaller than the linear superposition of the two tides effects subsequently song et al 2006 presented a new analytical solution with the fourier series expansion to quantitatively describe the groundwater table overheight which makes up for the limitation in nielsen 1990 and li et al 2000a and could be applied to the condition when the perturbation parameter becomes larger than unity the improvement is especially applicable to sand beaches with small inclination the aforementioned studies are all based on dupuit forchheimer d f assumptions which consider a purely horizontal groundwater flow and is actually far from the reality in sand beach knight 1981 introduced a two dimensional kinematic boundary condition which takes the vertical groundwater flow into consideration and gave the same solution as philip 1973 for a steady periodic tidal oscillation which also theoretically proves philip s predictions in practice are free from d f assumptions following knight 1981 li and jiao 2003 also employed a two dimensional kinematic boundary condition and considered a more general case that the aquifer is anisotropic and inhomogeneous and affected by multi tidal components with their attempts horizontal hydraulic conductivity is found to determine the asymptotic groundwater table while the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the coastal aquifer is ineffective there exist some discrepancies in previous studies firstly some solutions are generally based on d f assumptions and the others consider no more than two dimensional free surface models knight 1981 li and jiao 2003 in fact the groundwater exchange in the sand beach is a three dimensional motion secondly only a single tidal component is included in most previous studies however the tidal constituents are always sophisticated which generally covers a wide range of frequencies li et al 2000a thirdly the time averaged total flux density is seldom concerned in the unconfined coastal aquifer induced by tidal oscillations which is significant to understand groundwater interactions between land and sea knight 1981 the objective of this paper is to extend the previous study by applying a non linear three dimensional kinematic boundary condition under multi tidal components condition so as to investigate the groundwater table overheight and groundwater circulation mechanism in a more realistic nature situation a mathematical transformation after knight 1981 was made to deal with the non linear kinematic boundary condition then an exact analytical solution of the groundwater table overheight was derived based on the fourier transform method upon which behaviors of the groundwater table overheight changing with the multi tidal condition mean aquifer thickness tidal amplitude damping coefficient as well as spatial coordinates were presented in addition the time averaged total flux density was concretely specified to explain the groundwater interaction over a periodic tide the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model under a three dimensional kinematic boundary condition is established in section 2 in section 3 the analytical solution of the groundwater table overheight is presented by the fourier transform method upon which section 4 qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the groundwater table super elevation in which overheight distribution in shore normal and shore parallel directions are particularly demonstrated in addition the spatial distribution of the time averaged total flux density in a tidal period is also presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem set up to focus on the effects of the three dimensional free surface and multi tidal components conditions the capillary as well as the seepage face is ignored li et al 2000b li and jiao 2003 the groundwater flow is assumed to transmit through an unconfined coastal aquifer with homogeneous isotropic porous medium the tidal amplitudes are not equal but have a downward trend along the coastline sun 1997 chen et al 2016 a sketch of the three dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer with a finite depth is shown in fig 1 in fig 1 h x y t is the time varying groundwater table and d is the mean aquifer thickness below the msl a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system is used with x representing the shore parallel alongshore direction y representing the shore normal cross shore direction being positive landward and z being positive upward all coordinates are confined in a semi unbounded space i e x 0 2 2 a three dimensional kinematic

coefficient angular frequency separation coefficient and the phase shift of the jth tidal constituents here multiple tidal constituents are considered to represent a more realistic situation the inland boundary condition is 15 h x t y 0 eq 15 indicates that the groundwater table fluctuation is diminished as y approaches infinity accordingly the gradient of the time varying groundwater table becomes zero in y direction taking time average for both sides of eq 13 and it becomes 16 n k h t 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 0 where represents the time average over a total period t which is defined as the fluctuation period in response to all tidal constituents at the shoreline boundary steady periodic tidal constituents are considered knight 1981 17 w x 0 t 1 2 h x 0 t 2 1 2 t 0 t d j 1 n a j e m j x

f 2 x y it is equivalent to solve the following two laplace equations with corresponding boundary conditions 19 2 f 1 x 2 2 f 1 y 2 0 20 f 1 x 0 d 2 2 21 f 1 x y 0 and 22 2 f 2 x 2 2 f 2 y 2 0 23 f 2

semi unbounded space x and the boundary condition in eq 23 can be replaced by 26 f 2 x 0 new j 1 n a j 2 4 e 2 m j x x 0 j 1 n a j 2 4 e 2 m j x x 0 using fourier transforms with respect to x in eqs

time varying groundwater table at any place in fact can be separated into two parts the time independent term h x y i e the mean groundwater table and the time dependent fluctuation h x y t when the locations become far enough in land approximately 1000 m in sun 1997 groundwater fluctuations are essentially unaffected by the tidal oscillations in this case h x y t approaches zero and can be neglected the demarcated distance as 1000 m is denoted as my which is approximately inversely proportional to the wave number nielsen 1990 nevertheless a multi tidal system has been confirmed to propagate much more in land and also makes the distance of my further extend inland li et al 2000a when h x y t becomes close to zero the potential head can be deemed as a hydrostatic distribution that a relation between the time average groundwater table h x y and w x y t can be obtained by 40 w x y m y t 0 h x t ϕ x y z t z d z 1 2 h x y h x y t 2 1 2 h x y 2 h x y t 2 1 2 h x y 2 combing eqs 39 and 40 h x y m y can be expressed as 41 h x y m y d 2 y 2 π j 1 n a j 2 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ eq 41 indicates that the groundwater table far away from coastline is higher than msl upon which the overheight δ 3 x y generated by various tidal constituents under a three dimensional kinematic boundary condition can be obtained as 42 δ 3 d 2 y 2 π j 1 n a j 2 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ d with respect to eq 42 magnitude of the overheight is correlated to the mean aquifer thickness d tidal amplitude a damping coefficient m and positions with different x y coordinates it is obvious that when aj gets close to the mean aquifer thickness d the groundwater table overheight becomes more evident which has been shown in previous studies philip 1973 for a special case m 0 under which the tidal amplitude is the same along x direction a two dimensional situation and the solution of eq 42 degenerates to 43 δ 2 d 2 1 2 j 1 n a j 2 d where δ 2 is the overheight value obtained by a two dimensional model eq 43 is consistent with li and jiao 2003 indicating a generalization to the previous solutions by adopting the present three dimensional analytical solution for a specified tidal constituent the corresponding groundwater table overheight δ 3 j is 44 δ 3 j d 2 a j 2 y 2 π 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ d comparing eq 44 with eq 42 it is obvious that j 1 n δ 3 j δ 3 therefore the linear superposition is not applicable to the multi tidal components under the three dimensional boundary condition which is in agreement with li and jiao 2003 for a two dimensional model furthermore as discussed in appendix it proves j 1 n δ 3 j δ 3 which demonstrates that nonlinearity of the kinematic boundary condition makes the groundwater table overheight under the multi tidal condition become weak based on the above descriptions a flow diagram is presented in fig 2 to give a general overview of the proposed method in this study 4 discussions 4 1 overheight distribution in the shore normal direction applying the present three dimensional analytical solution variations of the groundwater table overheight in the shore normal direction beyond the demarcated distance are evaluated although the tidal components are complex their multiple impacts on groundwater table super elevation have been analytically presented in section 3 2 a monochromatic tide scenario is considered in this section the tidal amplitude is fixed at 1 m and the mean aquifer thickness is set as 2 m in calculation the damping coefficient of tidal amplitude is set as 10 5 m 1 fig 3 shows the spatial variation of the groundwater table overheight in the shore normal direction both analytical and numerical solutions are presented in fig 3 the numerical solution is obtained by solving eqs 16 18 using the successive over relaxation method it s clear that the numerical and analytical solutions agree well with each other for all locations which indicates accuracy of the present analytical solution on account of the variation profiles in fig 3 the decline keeps a relatively mild tendency a logarithmic coordinate is used in abscissa of fig 3 and the overheight value finally gets close to zero when y approaches infinity which can also be demonstrated by a mathematical operation of eq 44 as 45 δ 3 j lim y d 2 a j 2 y 2 π 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ ζ x 2 y 2 d ζ d lim y d 2 a j 2 2 π 0 e 2 m j ζ y d ζ 0 e 2 m j ζ y d ζ d 0 m additionally a simple physical explanation for this phenomenon is that as y approaches infinity the h x t 0 and w x t 1 2 h x 2 become completely exact so the potential head in anywhere becomes equal i e ϕ x z d ϕ z d 0 nevertheless it is observed that an obvious groundwater table overheight can be still observed even after a long landward distance e g about 5 cm above the mean aquifer thickness at y 100000 m both in the cases of x 0 m and x 25000 m fig 3 further demonstrates that at x 50000 m with a relatively small boundary tidal amplitude the overheight is more likely to keep a fairly uniform value about 0 045 m within a long landward distance about 20000 m the groundwater table super elevation varies with y coordinate has not been demonstrated in previous studies for a two dimensional model the overheight value is getting infinitely close to a fixed value i e d 2 a j 2 2 d which is independent of y when the landward distance exceeds the demarcated value my however the groundwater flow under three dimensional condition after considering the damping effect of tidal amplitude also leads to the changing groundwater table overheight in the shore normal y direction 4 2 overheight distribution in the shore parallel direction a parametric study is conducted to further examine the effects of damping coefficient as well as spatial coordinates on the magnitude of the groundwater table overheight following sun 1997 damping coefficient varies from 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 m 1 the calculation domain is set as 0 50000 m for x direction and the calculation inland position of y is fixed at 2000 m which is greater than the demarcated distance my groundwater table overheight distribution obtained using eq 44 is shown in fig 4 considering the present three dimensional kinematic boundary model a reduction of the groundwater table overheight can be observed from x 0 m to x 50000 m as presented in fig 4 when m j 1 0 6 m 1 the tidal amplitude varies from 1 m to 0 95 m along the coastline boundary and at the inland position y 2000 m the overheight is 0 1195 m at x 0 m and becomes 0 1095 m at x 50000 m in comparison the overheight values are 0 0730 m and 0 0003 m at x 0 m and x 50000 m respectively in the case of m j 1 0 4 m 1 for the case of m j 1 0 4 m 1 there is a greater alongshore overheight difference comparing with the result of m j 1 0 6 m 1 case considering these two damping coefficients the magnitude of the groundwater table overheight reduces about 4 cm at position x 0 m nevertheless the overheight values at x 50000 m presents a more significant variation about 11 cm with respect to the damping coefficient this is mainly because the evident tidal amplitude difference at the coastline boundary of x 50000 m which is only 0 0067 m for m j 1 0 4 m 1 in comparison with 0 9512 m for m j 1 0 6 m 1 to specify the difference between the two dimensional and three dimensional solutions a relative groundwater table overheight rgto hereafter was considered defined as δ 2 δ 3 δ 2 the two dimensional groundwater table overheight is calculated based on the tidal amplitude at x 0 m i e 1 m fig 5 shows the corresponding rgto distribution with respect to damping coefficient and x coordinate it is found that a universal decline of the groundwater table overheight occurs for three dimensional case comparing with the previous two dimensional results and almost all rgto are greater than 10 the deviation is mainly due to the fact that there exists damping effect of the tidal amplitude at the coastline when taking the three dimensional kinematic model into consideration under which there are evident tidal amplitude differences at the boundary there is no boundary tidal amplitude difference at x 0 m where rgto directly indicates the influence of extra groundwater flows at x 0 m rgto is 9 7 for m j 1 0 4 m 1 which is more than 5 times larger than that for m j 1 0 6 m 1 1 5 more specifically the difference of boundary tidal amplitude over a certain distance becomes greater when the damping coefficient is large leading to more significant extra groundwater exchange flows thus a smaller groundwater table overheight 4 3 time averaged total flux density time averaged total flux density tatfd hereafter is a significant factor to understand groundwater exchange between coastal aquifer and sea knight 1981 tatfd across a vertical plane can be obtained by substituting eq 39 into eqs 7 8 which can be expressed by 46 q x y t x j k x w x y t k a j 2 4 π 0 y e 2 m j ζ 2 x 2 ζ ζ x 2 y 2 2 d ζ 0 y e 2 m j ζ 2 x 2 ζ ζ x 2 y 2 2 d ζ 47 q x y t y j k y w x y t k a j 2 4 π 0 e 2 m j ξ ξ x 2 y 2 d ξ 0 e 2 m

demarcated distance my as indicated in eqs 7 8 the hydraulic conductivity was set as 10 4 m s and two damping coefficients of tidal amplitude were applied i e 10 6 m 1 and 10 4 m 1 calculations were carried out to figure out the horizontal groundwater dynamic pattern in tatfd considering the difference between the above two damping coefficients two calculation domains of 2000000 m 2000000 m and 20000 m 20000 m were used accordingly the corresponding results of the tatfd are plotted in fig 6 over one tidal period the solutions quantitatively indicate that most tatfds are rather small with a magnitude of 10 12 10 9 m2 s under the present considered conditions comparison between fig 5 a and 5 b reveals the tatfd is more significant for m j 1 0 4 m 1 with a magnitude of 10 10 10 9 m2 s whereas it is 10 12 10 11 m2 s for m j 1 0 6 m 1 bordered by the same tidal amplitude this is ascribed to the weak alongshore water head difference at the shoreline boundary for the small damping coefficient case from the overall perspective fig 6 shows that the tatfd presents a distinct spatial pattern originating from the area around x 0 and y 0 with significant magnitudes where the tidal amplitude is large and fanning out towards the small tidal amplitude regions with gradually decreased tatfd magnitudes both in the shore normal and shore parallel directions in fig 6 tatfds at x 0 m penetrating landward are along the shore normal direction owing to the fact that non flow boundary condition is adopted in section 3 2 making the analytical solution of tatfd symmetric about x 0 different from a 2d kinematic boundary condition li and jiao 2003 the present 3d tatfd solution also shows a shore parallel component at x 0 region in the direction of the decreased tidal amplitude which becomes more prominent with the increase of x position fig 6 also clearly conveys that the internal flow feature of the tatfd in the sand beach is not only due to the water exchange from ocean to land in the shore normal direction as demonstrated under the 2d kinematic boundary condition but also has a circulation pattern between the large and small tidal amplitude regions in the shore parallel direction in the region around the shoreline tatfd goes into the calculation domain for small x values whereas it moves out seaward in the large x value region leading to a clear circulation pattern comparing with fig 6 a fig 6 b shows that such circulation pattern is stronger regarding the tatfd magnitude and more spatially concentrated with respect to the alongshore position of the tatfd flow reversal in the case of a larger damping coefficient as could be expected straightforwardly these results further extend our understandings of the tatfd distribution in unconfined coastal aquifers under the 3d kinematic boundary condition 5 conclusions in this study groundwater table overheight induced by multi tidal constituents was investigated under a non linear three dimensional kinematic boundary condition an analytical solution of the groundwater table super elevation using the fourier transform method was presented the result reveals the magnitude of groundwater table overheight is related to the mean aquifer thickness tidal amplitude damping coefficient as well as x and y coordinates linear superposition of the groundwater table overheight is not applicable to the multi tidal conditions which weakens the magnitude of the asymptotic super elevation variation of the groundwater table overheight in the shore normal direction shows a relatively mild change beyond the demarcated distance and finally gets close to zero when the landward coordinate approaches infinity in addition a parametric study was conducted to examine the effects of damping coefficient of tidal amplitude as well as x and y coordinates comparing with previous two dimensional studies a reduction of the groundwater table overheight was confirmed after applying the present three dimensional kinematic model it is ascribed to the fact that there is amplitude damping effect parallels to the coastline present results also indicate there exist horizontal flows in x direction and these flows turn into manifest with the large tidal amplitude or great damping coefficient theoretical estimation of the time averaged total flux density tatfd demonstrates remarkable internal circulations between land and sea it is found that most of their values are rather small with the magnitude of 10 12 10 9 m2 s and the shore parallel component occurs along the direction of the decreased tidal amplitude in general the overall tatfd presents a distinct spatial pattern originating from the large tidal amplitude region and fanning out towards the small tidal amplitude region with the gradually decreased tatfd magnitudes the results also reveal the internal groundwater circulation feature with respect to the shore normal and shore parallel directions under the 3d kinematic boundary condition which is significantly different from the previous 2d cases credit authorship contribution statement mingzhe yang conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology

4763,areas with shallow groundwater and check dams have relatively abundant water resources compared to tablelands with deep loess layers on the loess plateau in china but little attention has been paid to their potentially substantial role in groundwater recharge to date in addition during groundwater recharge preferential flow through macropores can replenish groundwater quickly leaving immobile bound water relatively unmixed different water paths result in the separation of groundwater and plant xylem water isotopic signals according to the two water worlds tww hypothesis the hypothesis has received wide attention in the last decade due to observations of stronger 2h and 18o enrichment higher δ2h and δ18o values in plant xylem water than in groundwater thus aims of this study were to analyze processes involved in groundwater recharge and evaluate the tww hypothesis by isotope δ2h and δ18o tracing at a check dam on the loess plateau we report three main findings first the groundwater table began to rise 35 days after the first large rain event during our study period showing that recharge times at the site are orders of magnitude shorter than those in tablelands of the loess plateau decades or hundreds of years second preferential and matrix flows contributed 36 and 64 respectively of the total recharge third when preferential flow prevailed no significant isotopic differences between any measured water sources were found at the check dammed site e g precipitation soil water groundwater and plant xylem water p 0 05 which conflicts with isotopic patterns predicted by the tww hypothesis in conclusion check dams in areas with shallow groundwater can substantially promote water cycling from precipitation to groundwater on the loess plateau and in similar areas this study also provides a link between hydrological and ecological processes groundwater recharge paths and plant water uptake with significant implications for fundamental ecohydrological understanding and practical hydrological predictions keywords stable isotope groundwater recharge mechanism preferential flow matrix flow 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater source globally providing water supplies for approximately two billion people richey et al 2015 however there is widespread groundwater depletion because of climate change and human activities especially in arid and semi arid regions aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 such as the loess plateau of china for example gao et al 2015 found that the groundwater storage in more than 50 of 38 examined catchments on the loess plateau significantly declined by 0 03 mm yr 1 on average between 1955 and 2010 in particularly severe cases over extraction of groundwater has caused groundwater tables to decline by 50 200 cm yr 1 huang and pang 2013 to alleviate imbalances between groundwater recharge and consumption and improve groundwater management it is important to clarify poorly understood groundwater recharge zones and processes on the loess plateau currently groundwater and its recharge on the loess plateau of china receives most attention in areas with deep soil layers such as tablelands li et al 2017b huang et al 2017 2019 where the groundwater table is more than 40 m deep and hundreds of years are needed for precipitation to reach it huang et al 2016 2017 in contrast the groundwater tables and soil moisture are relatively high in areas with check dams which are frequently built in gullies and other channels to trap runoff and sediments from steep slopes jin et al 2012 in total 57 914 of these dams had been built on the loess plateau by the end of 2011 xu et al 2018 and there are plans to build 3100 more main check dams and 12 700 small and medium sized check dams during 2020 2035 liu et al 2020 so there are increasingly urgent needs for knowledge of their effects on groundwater recharge and the water cycle the primary purpose of constructing check dams on the loess plateau are to reduce soil erosion and improve agricultural yields thus previous studies on them have mainly focused on associated changes in sedimentation streamflow and spatial distribution of soil nutrients zhang et al 2008 fu et al 2010 li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 few have considered their impact on groundwater recharge processes tan et al 2017 jin et al 2019 therefore the contributions of check dams to recharge the plateau s groundwater clearly require rigorous consideration groundwater recharge processes preferential flow and matrix flow also have important effects on plants water uptake analysis of isotopic signals δ2h and δ18o in watersheds have suggested that groundwater is isolated from water sources used by plants this phenomenon is sometimes called ecohydrological separation and has been explained by the two water worlds tww hypothesis brooks et al 2010 mcdonnell 2014 the hypothesis is broadly supported on a global scale by enrichment of 2h and 18o high δ2h and δ18o values in xylem water and soil water but not streams or groundwater evaristo et al 2015 the lack of isotopic signals in groundwater has been attributed at least in some areas to rapid recharge of groundwater by precipitation during storms via preferential flow paths e g brooks et al 2010 gierke et al 2016 de wispelaere et al 2017 preferential flow can rapidly deliver mobile water through macropores and cracks in the soil leaving immobile fractions relatively unmixed differences in water paths may lead to two separate water pools in the soil matrix good et al 2015 beven 2018 the rapidity of preferential flow reduces water s contact with mineral surfaces and hence nutrient concentrations mcdonnell 2017 sprenger et al 2019 thus plants preferentially use old water that is retained in the soil brantley et al 2017 under matrix flow conditions newly infiltrated water displaces existing water pushing it deeper into the soil profile and eventually in groundwater horton and hawkins 1965 zheng et al 2019 in the presence of hydrological connectivity such as matrix flow good et al 2015 xiang et al 2019 water that is both accessible to plants and subjected to soil evaporation also contributes to groundwater recharge thus if preferential flow prevails water accessible to plants and contributions to groundwater will have different isotopic signals accordance with the tww hypothesis but if matrix flow dominates plants and groundwater will have similar isotopic signals contrary to the hypothesis knowledge of the contributions and effects of water paths through soil on both groundwater recharge and plant water sources is clearly important for fundamental understanding of ecohydrological processes and hydrological predictions in practice therefore aims of this study were to analyze groundwater recharge processes and evaluate the tww hypothesis at a check dam on the plateau using stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen as environmental tracers more specifically we exploited the specific isotope fingerprints δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation events which can be followed as water flows through the soil profile thus isotope profiles of soil can be used to identify soil water movement we hypothesized that both matrix and preferential flow contribute to groundwater recharge the first hypothesis and that groundwater recharge paths affect isotopic signatures of water taken up by plants the second hypothesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the liudaogou catchment 38 46 38 51 n 110 21 110 23 e shenmu county northern loess plateau of china fig 1 a the area and altitude of the catchment are 6 89 km2 and 1081 1274 m respectively the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 8 4 c and 437 mm respectively this area lies in the water wind erosion crisscross region thus both engineering measures check dams and vegetation are used here to mitigate soil erosion check dams are built in gullies and other channels in the area to trap runoff and sediments from steep slopes and improve agricultural yields a reforestation and land abandonment campaign has transformed arable lands to shrubs and forests on upland hillslopes common species used in the reforestation include salix matsudana salix psammophila and caragana korshinskii meteorological data on precipitation and air temperature with 30 min resolution were obtained from a weather station located about 800 m from the sampling plot daily data for the focal year 2017 are shown in fig 2 b precipitation was measured using te525 rain gauges campbell scientific inc which provide accuracy of 1 percent at rates up to 25 4 mm hr 1 air temperature was measured using hmp45d probes which have 0 2 c accuracy at 20 c vaisala inc the groundwater table was measured at a groundwater monitoring well located about 30 m upstream of the check dam fig 1b the monitoring well was dug by hand augers and the screen was set at 1 m height from the well bottom a hobo probe u20 001 04 onset bourne usa was installed at 1 5 m depth from the bottom of the well to monitor the fluctuation of the groundwater table the study area received more than usual precipitation 656 mm in the study year 2017 during this year the seasonal distribution of precipitation was uneven mostly concentrated in july to september 61 and the average daily temperature ranged from 12 30 c in january to 29 51 c in july fig 2a the δ2h and δ18o of the precipitation ranged from 116 54 to 29 07 and 13 50 to 4 49 with weighted averages of 75 24 5 14 and 10 12 0 53 respectively salix matsudana is one of the main tree species in the check damned catchment so we chose s matsudana as the sampling plant the average height and diameter at breast height of the s matsudana trees at the site were 12 m and 27 cm respectively we selected a 2 4 104 m2 check dammed channel as the monitoring site the check dam was initially built as a soil retaining dam 30 years ago and much of the dammed channel is now full of sediments according to luo et al 2020 these sediments originated from aeolian sand of the mu us sandyland and quaternary loess formed by geological structures under combined long term effects of water and wind erosion as shown in fig 1c we selected three sampling sites in the check dammed channel of the liudaogou catchment 100 150 and 200 m upstream of the dam designated sites 1 2 and 3 respectively soil and plant xylem samples were collected at these sites and groundwater from the monitoring well on five occasions during the rainy season in 2017 july 22 august 1 august 18 september 1 and september 24 information on the rain events during the 14 day period preceding each of these sampling campaigns is presented in table 1 basic soil properties of the sampling spots are presented in table 2 2 2 water sampling for stable isotope δ2h and δ18o analysis precipitation soil water from 0 to 300 cm depths groundwater and plants xylem water were collected for the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic analysis for these analyses precipitation samples were collected as soon as a rain event ended from a polyethylene funnel and bottle with a plastic ball placed in the funnel to reduce evaporation groundwater samples were collected from the groundwater monitoring well plant samples consisted of twigs collected from the south facing side of 3 5 s matsudana trees on each sampling occasion bark was peeled from the twigs and all leaves were removed to avoid perturbance of xylem water isotopic signature by fractionation pieces of the de barked and de leaved twigs 20 30 mm long were then immediately placed in 10 ml vials and wrapped in parafilm we used a hand auger to collect soil samples at each sampling site fig 1b the soil profiles collected at different dates were limited to 3 m2 area per site to reduce soil heterogeneity soil samples were collected in 10 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm depths of soil and in 20 cm intervals for 100 300 cm depths the soil samples at each layer were divided into two groups one for isotopic analysis and the other for determination of gravimetric soil water content swc by the drying method 105 c for 12 h 2 3 stable isotope analysis plant and soil samples were extracted using the cryogenic vacuum distillation method orlowski et al 2013 gaj et al 2017 with 105 c and 180 min extraction temperature and time respectively in efforts to ensure that more than 99 of the water was collected from them the isotopic composition 2h to 1h and 18o to 16o ratios of the samples was normalized relative to the v smow vienna standard mean ocean water standard set by the international atomic energy agency the resulting ratios were then expressed in delta notation δ2h and δ18o values calculated as follows 1 δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 2 δ 2 h r sample r standard 1 a previous study has verified that there is negligible organic contamination in precipitation soil water and groundwater samples collected using these methods schultz et al 2011 the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o values of soil water n 275 precipitation n 21 and groundwater samples n 25 were determined at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china northwest a f university for this the lgr liwa v2 liquid water analyzer los gatos research inc was used providing 0 5 and 0 1 precision for h and o isotope analyses respectively each sample was injected six times after a set of six standard samples to minimize memory and drift effects oerter and bowen 2017 average amounts of isotopes obtained from injections 4 through 6 were used to calculate the isotope values of the samples the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of xylem water samples n 25 were determined using a picarro l2130 i instrument at the institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences providing 1 and 0 1 precision for the h and o isotope analyses respectively a micro combustion module picarro was used to remove organic contamination from plant xylem water 2 4 quantifying contributions of matrix and preferential flows to groundwater two groundwater recharge paths that could potentially affect groundwater water isotope values were recognized and considered in the analyses reported here matrix flow and preferential flow matrix flow refers to the relatively slow and even movement of old water and accompanying solutes through soil while sampling all pore spaces in accordance with advection dispersion theory bai et al 1996 we calculated the contributions of preferential and matrix flows to groundwater on two consecutive sampling dates t1 and t2 t1 t2 the δ2h and δ18o values of soil water in 0 300 cm layers weighted averages based on swc on t1 were used to represent the isotopic signatures of matrix flow isotopic values of precipitation weighted averages based on precipitation volumes between t1 and t2 were used to represent the isotopic signatures of preferential flow there were four consecutive sampling dates in this study july 22 august 1 august 1 august 18 august 18 september 1 and september 1 september 24 contributions of preferential and matrix flows to groundwater were estimated by stable isotope analysis in r siar version 4 2 a package designed to solve mixing models for isotopic data in a bayesian framework parnell et al 2010 following xiang et al 2019 when running the model precipitation and soil water isotopes were used as endmembers representing preferential flow and matrix flow respectively to explain the isotopic composition of groundwater the trophic enrichment factor was set to 0 for both δ2h and δ18o because trophic enrichment is not expected to change stable isotope values of recharging water moving via either matrix flow or preferential flow 2 5 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed in spss 20 0 spss 20 0 inc chicago usa the shapiro wilk test and levene s test were respectively used to check that the data met normality of distribution and homogeneity of variance requirements for planned analyses based on results of one way anova followed by post hoc tukey s tests water sources available for plant uptake were then divided into four categories shallow soil water 0 50 cm middle soil water 50 200 cm deep soil water 200 300 cm and groundwater presented diagrams were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 precipitation swc groundwater dynamics during the periods july 22 to august 1 august 1 to august 18 august 18 to september 1 and september 1 to september 24 precipitation amounted to 144 0 28 0 148 0 and 14 1 mm respectively table 1 cumulative precipitation increased in a stepwise manner fig 3 a with two surges from july 22 to august 1 and from august 18 to september 1 influencing swc dynamics as shown in fig 3b and c1 e5 shallow soil water 0 50 cm was most sensitive to precipitation and increased significantly after rainfall p 0 05 it increased substantially by 7 9 3 8 and 7 0 3 5 these and other values quoted in this paragraph are means and standard deviations for three soil profiles in the periods july 22 august 1 and august 18 september 1 respectively in contrast it decreased by 4 7 3 3 and 7 8 4 6 in the periods august 1 18 and september 1 24 respectively the water content of the middle soil layer 50 200 cm was intermediate in terms of both amounts and variation it increased by 2 1 4 6 and 4 0 2 7 in the periods july 22 august 1 and august 18 september 1 respectively and decreased by 1 3 3 6 and 1 9 3 5 between august 1 18 and september 1 24 respectively the deep soil water content 200 300 cm remained nearly constant mean 22 1 3 1 with no significant differences p 0 05 before and after rain events and higher than in the shallow and middle layers the groundwater table fell from its initial level of 3 4 m on july 1 by 0 3 m on august 1 and 0 4 m on august 18 and was lowest on august 26 fig 3a 3 2 isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water and groundwater the δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation soil water and groundwater are presented in fig 4 small rain events occurred in the 14 days prior to the sampling campaign on july 22 with a total of 6 8 mm precipitation the δ2h and δ18o values of the shallow soil water these and other values quoted in this paragraph are means and standard deviations for three soil profiles 63 75 13 78 and 8 40 1 79 respectively were higher than those of middle and deep soil water on july 22 fig 4a1 b1 because of evaporation the isotopic composition of middle soil water varied greatly with δ2h and δ18o values ranging from 111 2 to 75 24 and 15 33 to 9 64 respectively no significant differences p 0 05 were detected in isotopic values between deep soil water mean δ2h and δ18o values 85 05 6 05 and 11 28 1 11 respectively and groundwater mean δ2h and δ18o values 79 03 0 86 and 10 20 0 28 respectively there were six rain events between july 22 and august 1 with δ2h values ranging from 116 54 to 55 16 and δ18o values from 14 50 to 8 03 fig 4a2 b2 new infiltrated precipitation caused reductions in the δ2h and δ18o isotopic values of shallow soil water of 19 18 and 2 33 respectively the isotopic compositions of middle soil water fluctuated greatly with δ2h and δ18o values of 81 40 12 89 and 11 11 1 76 respectively at 60 140 cm the values at 140 200 cm were 90 85 7 81 and 12 27 1 10 respectively these values were almost identical to the weighted average values for precipitation 93 84 and 12 19 respectively suggesting the occurrence of preferential flow no significant variation p 0 05 in isotopic composition of either deep soil water or groundwater was detected between july 22 and august 1 two rain events occurred between august 1 to august 18 with total precipitation of 28 0 mm and weighted average δ2h and δ18o values of 45 21 and 6 93 respectively the isotopic values of shallow soil water were significantly higher on august 18 than on august 1 fig 4a3 b3 the δ2h and δ18o values of middle soil water ranged from 120 16 to 54 83 and from 15 44 to 7 39 respectively while those of deep soil water decreased from 89 61 to 93 82 and from 11 90 to 12 50 respectively between august 1 and august 18 in association with infiltration of precipitation in early rain events e g july 22 to july 27 no significant changes p 0 05 in isotopic ratios of groundwater between august 1 and august 18 were observed four rain events occurred in the period from august 18 to september 1 with δ2h values ranging from 91 72 to 64 75 weighted average value 83 45 and δ18o values ranging from 12 71 to 8 63 weighted average value 11 35 mixing of less enriched new water and more depleted old water led to an increase in the δ2h and δ18o values in the middle parts of the soil column on september 1 fig 4a b4 for example between august 18 and september 1 δ2h and δ18o values in the 160 200 cm layers increased from 105 84 to 98 56 and from 13 88 to 13 14 respectively during this period the δ2h and δ18o values also increased by 3 56 and 0 66 respectively in deep soil water and by 2 74 and 0 71 respectively in groundwater eight small rainfall events occurred from september 1 to september 24 resulting in isotopic enrichment of shallow soil water but no significant changes p 0 05 in isotopic values in either deep soil water or groundwater were detected 3 3 paths of groundwater recharge major rain events occurred on july 22 61 5 mm precipitation 28 9 mm h 1 intensity and august 22 92 3 mm precipitation 9 2 mm h 1 intensity during the study period and had substantial effects on water movement swc at 160 200 cm depths increased between july 22 and august 1 while the groundwater table fell suggesting that most precipitation did not recharge groundwater by preferential flow similarly estimates by the siar mixing model suggested that matrix flow contributed 65 17 of the total recharge during this period fig 5 the groundwater table still declined between august 1 and august 18 and matrix flow contributed 79 17 of the total recharge during this period the groundwater table began to rise after august 26 and preferential flow dominated the total recharge 60 15 between august 18 and september 1 overall matrix flow contributed 64 to the total recharge and the preferential flow was 36 thus supporting our first hypothesis 3 4 comparison of xylem water soil water and groundwater δ2h and δ18o values plots of the stable isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o values of soil water groundwater and xylem water samples in dual isotope space are shown in fig 6a1 5 the slope and intercept of the lmwl δ2h 7 67 δ18o 5 91 r2 0 96 were lower than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 values of all the water samples were close to the lmwl fig 6 b1 c5 shows boxplots of δ2h and δ18o values of all water samples there were generally no significant differences p 0 05 in these values among the measured water sources on august 1 or september 1 except that 200 300 cm layers on august 1 had significantly lower values than the other water sources p 0 05 in contrast on july 22 and august 18 in periods with less precipitation stronger 2h and 18o enrichment was detected in shallow soil water and xylem water than in the middle soil water deep soil water and groundwater no significant enrichment signal p 0 05 was observed in shallow soil water on september 24 possibly because weather conditions had been cloudier and cooler 4 discussion 4 1 evidence for matrix and preferential flows preferential flow and matrix flow are two widely recognized types of soil water movement li et al 2017b tan et al 2017 preferential flow has fast infiltration rates and matrix flow has long residence times so they have different effects on swc dynamics they may also lead to different isotopic profiles due to associated differences in processes including inter alia evaporation mixing of new water and old water and variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation that contributes to these flows gazis and feng 2004 thus swc dynamics and isotopic δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation and soil water can be used to identify preferential and matrix flows for example between july 22 and august 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of the 160 200 cm layers at site 1 decreased by 12 05 and 2 15 respectively to values close to weighted average values of precipitation from july 22 to july 27 one possibility is that precipitation reached these layers through preferential flow another possibility is that soil water depleted in heavy isotopes at the 60 120 cm depths on july 22 moved down to these layers changes in swc during this period provided more explanation as shown in fig 3c swc at the 60 120 and 160 200 cm depths on july 22 were 12 2 and 14 4 respectively while swc at the 160 200 cm depths on august 1 reached 21 1 swc is unlikely to increase strongly and quickly solely through matrix flow thus this recharge might have been largely due to preferential flow with some contribution from matrix flow evidence of preferential flow was also observed between august 18 and september 1 swc in the 0 100 cm layers increased from 11 4 2 1 to 19 0 3 3 and the δ2h and δ18o values on september 1 means 82 17 and 11 19 respectively were similar to the weighted average values of precipitation during this period 79 02 and 10 75 respectively evidence of mixing of recent precipitation with old water in the upper soil profile was detected on august 18 at site 1 two rain events occurred between august 1 and august 18 one with δ2h and δ18o values of 56 68 and 8 89 respectively on august 8 and another with values of 38 23 and 5 73 respectively on august 15 evaporation of shallow soil water during this period would have increased the enrichment however even under the strongest enrichment the 2h and 18o values of soil water at 50 cm depth 61 8 and 8 4 respectively were still lower than those of the precipitation clearly indicating the occurrence of mixing of precipitation and old water and thus matrix flow 4 2 the groundwater recharge process at check dammed sites as shown in fig 3a there were two main surges of precipitation during the study period from july 22 to august 1 and from august 18 to september 1 which strongly influenced swc and groundwater dynamics as summarized in fig 7 a we identified three phases with distinct groundwater recharge processes based on responses of swc and the groundwater table to precipitation during the dry period before july 22 soil water in large pores drained emptying preferential flow paths the remaining soil water was stored in small pores with poor mobility thus the groundwater table gradually dropped due to human activities extraction of water for drinking and irrigation and uptake by plants during the following intermediately wet period july 22 to august 18 precipitation first infiltrated into the soil and filled soil pores then displaced old water in the soil pushing it deeper into the soil profile like matrix flow preferential flow also occurs due to pores formed by rotten roots and animals for example li et al 2017a and li et al 2019 found that ant nests can reach depths of 60 cm on the loess plateau and influence swc to 120 cm depth our results show that the groundwater table still decreased during the intermediate period in association with the dry soil conditions most of the precipitation from july 22 to july 27 filled soil pores rather than recharging groundwater this result is consistent with findings by alley et al 2002 that most water from precipitation infiltrates and is stored in the unsaturated soil zone and eventually returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration especially in parts of the loess plateau with high evaporation and high vegetation cover chen et al 2015 during the wet period august 18 to september 1 water flowed quickly as the wetting front moved down and recharged the groundwater because soil pores had been filled during the preceding period the groundwater table began to rise after august 26 35 days after the first heavy rain event on july 22 there were also substantial mismatches in isotopic values between the groundwater then and precipitation in the large rain event 92 3 mm on august 22 possibly related to the mixture of that infiltrating precipitation previous precipitation e g from rain events between july 22 and july 27 and old water remaining in deep soil layers such mixing is most intense when the groundwater table rises and mixes with water stored in the unsaturated zone sprenger et al 2019 our data suggest that both matrix and preferential flows occurred in the groundwater recharge process and results from the siar model suggest that matrix flow and preferential flow accounted for 64 and 36 respectively of the total recharge supporting our first hypothesis 4 3 assessing the tww hypothesis the generally greater 2h and 18o enrichment in plant xylem water and shallow soil water than in stream water and groundwater prompted formulation of the tww hypothesis brooks et al 2010 goldsmith et al 2012 berry et al 2017 we observed 2h and 18o enrichment in xylem water and shallow soil water on july 22 and august 18 and their δ2h and δ18o values significantly differed from those of deep soil water and groundwater p 0 05 however differences in isotopic values we observed during periods of heavy rainfall between plants and mobile water sources do not support the hypothesis even when preferential flow prevailed e g on august 1 and september 1 fig 6 our results also suggest that our second hypothesis groundwater recharge paths affect plants water uptake should be rejected for the following reasons hydrological connectivity is enhanced when precipitation infiltrates into the soil matrix enabling exchange of new water and old water the exchange might be more pronounced in drought conditions as water taken up by roots from the soil matrix is replaced by mobile water pulled from pockets of larger pore spaces by the increasingly negative matric potential gradients in the rhizosphere evaristo et al 2019 plant thus use mixed water sources evidence of this exchange has also been provided by vargas et al 2017 who found that 75 to 95 of tightly bound water isotopically exchanged with mobile water in a glasshouse experiment with potted persea americana in two contrasting soil types similarly zhao et al 2018 found that isotopic patterns conforming to the tww hypothesis disappeared as hydrological connectivity increased in the wet season in an area with a subtropical climate in southwest china according to the tww hypothesis plants use bound water with different isotopic signatures from that of mobile water streams and groundwater but this does not mean that the ecohydrological separation will disappear when plants use groundwater for example evaristo et al 2016 still found evidence of ecohydrological separation in two tropical environments in puerto rico where groundwater apparently contributed 38 and 28 of the xylem water of mahogany swietenia spp trees at xeric and mesic hydric sites respectively unfortunately we cannot calculate the contributions of groundwater to plants at our study site because the groundwater isotope signatures sometimes overlapped with those of the soil water however in the same study catchment according to yasuda et al 2013 and luo et al 2020 the annual mean precipitation increased from 342 mm in 2004 2006 to 570 mm in 2015 2017 while the groundwater table fell substantially from 1 59 to 2 96 m in 2004 2006 to 2 89 to 4 51 m in 2015 2017 these changes were mainly attributed to increases in vegetation coverage caused by implementation of the green for grain project on the loess plateau luo et al 2020 the s matsudana trees we sampled are members of one of the most widely used species for afforestation in the project and probably one of the main consumers of groundwater the magnitude of groundwater used by plants mainly depend on groundwater depth and swc bertrand et al 2014 in addition according to the conceptual model proposed by brooks et al 2010 the wet season is the optimal time for evaluating the tww hypothesis because tightly bound water in the small pores and mobile water could coexist during this period an obvious limitation of our study is that we only obtained data covering a single three month period however at our study site more than 65 of the annual rainfall occurs from july to september so measurements during this period enable clear detection of differences in any in isotopic signatures of these water pools and water taken up by plants at such check dammed sites thus we believe that our data enable robust assessment of the hydrological aspects of the tww hypothesis considered here future work should include efforts to integrate hydrological and plant physiology considerations for example martin gomez et al 2017 probed ecophysiological strategies of two species pinus sylvestris and quercus subpyrenaica by analysing correlations between stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o in xylem and soil water leaf water potential and foliar gas exchange they found that p sylvestris has a more isohydric strategy than q subpyrenaica but q subpyrenaica is more resistant to drought probably associated with a deeper and more reliable water supply strategies to cope with water limitation strongly affect the degree to which plants take up shallow or deep soil water with clear possible implications for the tww hypothesis and associated phenomena 4 4 implications for groundwater management at check dammed sites numerous studies have focused on the process of groundwater recharge in tablelands on the loess plateau where the groundwater table is more than 40 m deep li et al 2017b huang et al 2017 2019 fig 7b table 3 a number of studies have found that matrix flow dominates groundwater recharge li 2001 huang et al 2017 yang and fu 2017 and the recharge rate varies from 30 to 70 mm yr 1 in these tablelands huang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 precipitation thus takes hundreds of years to pass through unsaturated deep loess layers and replenish groundwater li 2001 huang et al 2016 2017 li et al 2017b found that preferential flow contributed 87 4 to groundwater recharge and the total recharge rate was 107 55 mm yr 1 at an examined tableland site thus even if preferential flow dominates precipitation still takes years or even decades to recharge groundwater in tablelands of the plateau moreover some of the infiltrated precipitation driven by the tension gradient in the loess profile can only move within a limited range and cannot effectively supply groundwater infiltrated water driven by gravity can move longer distance but only if the swc reaches the maximum field capacity chen et al 2008 however due to the limited precipitation and high evapotranspiration swc of deep soil within profiles on the plateau is always lower than 60 of field capacity and cannot be replenished by rainfall in a normal year this layer of soil which has low swc permanent wilting point 60 of field capacity and is not reached by precipitation in normal years is called the dried soil layer wang et al 2011 precipitation that reaches upper parts of this dried soil layer preferentially fills pores instead of infiltrating to and recharging groundwater wang et al 2008 in contrast check dam in gullies and other channels with shallow groundwater seems to play an important role in groundwater recharge and water cycling these dams can not only trap runoff and sediments but also allow most of the precipitation intercepted by surrounding slopes to enter the soil rather than evaporate into the atmosphere shi et al 2019 found that check dams decreased runoff and sediment yield by 12 and 11 7 respectively on the loess plateau thus they can improve regional hydrological precipitation soil water groundwater cycles by enhancing connectivity between soil water and groundwater at our study site during the covered period the mean groundwater table depth was 3 6 m and it began to rise on august 26 just 35 days after the first large rain event on july 22 similarly luo et al 2020 recorded a lag between precipitation and groundwater responses of ca 12 54 days at check dammed sites in the same catchment this is much shorter than the time required in the tablelands decades or hundreds of years table 3 this means tableland with thick soil layers may make minor contributions to groundwater recharge on the loess plateau and check dammed sites with shallow groundwater may make more contributions at least per unit area this finding has important implications for assessments of groundwater s vulnerability to contamination for several reasons first the major difference in time required for groundwater recharge between check dams and tablelands may result in inaccurate estimates of groundwater pollution and potential threats to groundwater management if tableland data are used xiang et al 2019 second check dammed land has high agricultural value because it has relatively good water and nutrient conditions hence a megaproject called gully land consolidation was launched on the loess plateau in 2011 with an aim to create 266 700 ha of farmlands in valleys where substantial numbers of check dams will be built by 2020 jin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 those measures may result in fertilizer and pesticide pollution due to its excessive application ju et al 2007 particularly as our findings suggest that preferential flow may account for 36 of the total groundwater recharge and thus enable rapid transport of contaminants to the groundwater this may pose serious threats to groundwater safety on the loess plateau if we neglect effects of check dams on its recharge therefore not only the impact of check dams on groundwater recharge but also their implications for local water management strategies should be carefully considered to avoid possible pesticide pollution 5 conclusion stable isotope δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation soil water and groundwater were used to explore groundwater recharge process associated with check dam on the loess plateau results obtained using a siar model suggest that preferential and matrix flows contributed 36 and 64 respectively of groundwater recharge supporting our first hypothesis that both kinds of flow contribute in addition the groundwater table began to rise just 35 days after first heavy rain event july 22 in the wet season orders of magnitude shorter than corresponding times on tablelands of the plateau decades or hundreds of years our findings suggest that check dammed channels can make substantially greater contributions to groundwater recharge than tableland which have been more extensively studied and should be paid more attention in groundwater management in the region the process of groundwater recharge affects isotopic signatures of water taken up by plants according to the tww framework however we found no significant differences p 0 05 in isotopic values of the examined water pools precipitation soil water groundwater and plant xylem water under preferential flow conditions hydrological connectivity increased with infiltration of precipitation resulting in the mixing of new water and old water thus these isotopic patterns do not support the tww hypothesis in these surroundings this conflicts with our second hypothesis that groundwater recharge paths

4763,areas with shallow groundwater and check dams have relatively abundant water resources compared to tablelands with deep loess layers on the loess plateau in china but little attention has been paid to their potentially substantial role in groundwater recharge to date in addition during groundwater recharge preferential flow through macropores can replenish groundwater quickly leaving immobile bound water relatively unmixed different water paths result in the separation of groundwater and plant xylem water isotopic signals according to the two water worlds tww hypothesis the hypothesis has received wide attention in the last decade due to observations of stronger 2h and 18o enrichment higher δ2h and δ18o values in plant xylem water than in groundwater thus aims of this study were to analyze processes involved in groundwater recharge and evaluate the tww hypothesis by isotope δ2h and δ18o tracing at a check dam on the loess plateau we report three main findings first the groundwater table began to rise 35 days after the first large rain event during our study period showing that recharge times at the site are orders of magnitude shorter than those in tablelands of the loess plateau decades or hundreds of years second preferential and matrix flows contributed 36 and 64 respectively of the total recharge third when preferential flow prevailed no significant isotopic differences between any measured water sources were found at the check dammed site e g precipitation soil water groundwater and plant xylem water p 0 05 which conflicts with isotopic patterns predicted by the tww hypothesis in conclusion check dams in areas with shallow groundwater can substantially promote water cycling from precipitation to groundwater on the loess plateau and in similar areas this study also provides a link between hydrological and ecological processes groundwater recharge paths and plant water uptake with significant implications for fundamental ecohydrological understanding and practical hydrological predictions keywords stable isotope groundwater recharge mechanism preferential flow matrix flow 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater source globally providing water supplies for approximately two billion people richey et al 2015 however there is widespread groundwater depletion because of climate change and human activities especially in arid and semi arid regions aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 such as the loess plateau of china for example gao et al 2015 found that the groundwater storage in more than 50 of 38 examined catchments on the loess plateau significantly declined by 0 03 mm yr 1 on average between 1955 and 2010 in particularly severe cases over extraction of groundwater has caused groundwater tables to decline by 50 200 cm yr 1 huang and pang 2013 to alleviate imbalances between groundwater recharge and consumption and improve groundwater management it is important to clarify poorly understood groundwater recharge zones and processes on the loess plateau currently groundwater and its recharge on the loess plateau of china receives most attention in areas with deep soil layers such as tablelands li et al 2017b huang et al 2017 2019 where the groundwater table is more than 40 m deep and hundreds of years are needed for precipitation to reach it huang et al 2016 2017 in contrast the groundwater tables and soil moisture are relatively high in areas with check dams which are frequently built in gullies and other channels to trap runoff and sediments from steep slopes jin et al 2012 in total 57 914 of these dams had been built on the loess plateau by the end of 2011 xu et al 2018 and there are plans to build 3100 more main check dams and 12 700 small and medium sized check dams during 2020 2035 liu et al 2020 so there are increasingly urgent needs for knowledge of their effects on groundwater recharge and the water cycle the primary purpose of constructing check dams on the loess plateau are to reduce soil erosion and improve agricultural yields thus previous studies on them have mainly focused on associated changes in sedimentation streamflow and spatial distribution of soil nutrients zhang et al 2008 fu et al 2010 li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 few have considered their impact on groundwater recharge processes tan et al 2017 jin et al 2019 therefore the contributions of check dams to recharge the plateau s groundwater clearly require rigorous consideration groundwater recharge processes preferential flow and matrix flow also have important effects on plants water uptake analysis of isotopic signals δ2h and δ18o in watersheds have suggested that groundwater is isolated from water sources used by plants this phenomenon is sometimes called ecohydrological separation and has been explained by the two water worlds tww hypothesis brooks et al 2010 mcdonnell 2014 the hypothesis is broadly supported on a global scale by enrichment of 2h and 18o high δ2h and δ18o values in xylem water and soil water but not streams or groundwater evaristo et al 2015 the lack of isotopic signals in groundwater has been attributed at least in some areas to rapid recharge of groundwater by precipitation during storms via preferential flow paths e g brooks et al 2010 gierke et al 2016 de wispelaere et al 2017 preferential flow can rapidly deliver mobile water through macropores and cracks in the soil leaving immobile fractions relatively unmixed differences in water paths may lead to two separate water pools in the soil matrix good et al 2015 beven 2018 the rapidity of preferential flow reduces water s contact with mineral surfaces and hence nutrient concentrations mcdonnell 2017 sprenger et al 2019 thus plants preferentially use old water that is retained in the soil brantley et al 2017 under matrix flow conditions newly infiltrated water displaces existing water pushing it deeper into the soil profile and eventually in groundwater horton and hawkins 1965 zheng et al 2019 in the presence of hydrological connectivity such as matrix flow good et al 2015 xiang et al 2019 water that is both accessible to plants and subjected to soil evaporation also contributes to groundwater recharge thus if preferential flow prevails water accessible to plants and contributions to groundwater will have different isotopic signals accordance with the tww hypothesis but if matrix flow dominates plants and groundwater will have similar isotopic signals contrary to the hypothesis knowledge of the contributions and effects of water paths through soil on both groundwater recharge and plant water sources is clearly important for fundamental understanding of ecohydrological processes and hydrological predictions in practice therefore aims of this study were to analyze groundwater recharge processes and evaluate the tww hypothesis at a check dam on the plateau using stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen as environmental tracers more specifically we exploited the specific isotope fingerprints δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation events which can be followed as water flows through the soil profile thus isotope profiles of soil can be used to identify soil water movement we hypothesized that both matrix and preferential flow contribute to groundwater recharge the first hypothesis and that groundwater recharge paths affect isotopic signatures of water taken up by plants the second hypothesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the liudaogou catchment 38 46 38 51 n 110 21 110 23 e shenmu county northern loess plateau of china fig 1 a the area and altitude of the catchment are 6 89 km2 and 1081 1274 m respectively the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 8 4 c and 437 mm respectively this area lies in the water wind erosion crisscross region thus both engineering measures check dams and vegetation are used here to mitigate soil erosion check dams are built in gullies and other channels in the area to trap runoff and sediments from steep slopes and improve agricultural yields a reforestation and land abandonment campaign has transformed arable lands to shrubs and forests on upland hillslopes common species used in the reforestation include salix matsudana salix psammophila and caragana korshinskii meteorological data on precipitation and air temperature with 30 min resolution were obtained from a weather station located about 800 m from the sampling plot daily data for the focal year 2017 are shown in fig 2 b precipitation was measured using te525 rain gauges campbell scientific inc which provide accuracy of 1 percent at rates up to 25 4 mm hr 1 air temperature was measured using hmp45d probes which have 0 2 c accuracy at 20 c vaisala inc the groundwater table was measured at a groundwater monitoring well located about 30 m upstream of the check dam fig 1b the monitoring well was dug by hand augers and the screen was set at 1 m height from the well bottom a hobo probe u20 001 04 onset bourne usa was installed at 1 5 m depth from the bottom of the well to monitor the fluctuation of the groundwater table the study area received more than usual precipitation 656 mm in the study year 2017 during this year the seasonal distribution of precipitation was uneven mostly concentrated in july to september 61 and the average daily temperature ranged from 12 30 c in january to 29 51 c in july fig 2a the δ2h and δ18o of the precipitation ranged from 116 54 to 29 07 and 13 50 to 4 49 with weighted averages of 75 24 5 14 and 10 12 0 53 respectively salix matsudana is one of the main tree species in the check damned catchment so we chose s matsudana as the sampling plant the average height and diameter at breast height of the s matsudana trees at the site were 12 m and 27 cm respectively we selected a 2 4 104 m2 check dammed channel as the monitoring site the check dam was initially built as a soil retaining dam 30 years ago and much of the dammed channel is now full of sediments according to luo et al 2020 these sediments originated from aeolian sand of the mu us sandyland and quaternary loess formed by geological structures under combined long term effects of water and wind erosion as shown in fig 1c we selected three sampling sites in the check dammed channel of the liudaogou catchment 100 150 and 200 m upstream of the dam designated sites 1 2 and 3 respectively soil and plant xylem samples were collected at these sites and groundwater from the monitoring well on five occasions during the rainy season in 2017 july 22 august 1 august 18 september 1 and september 24 information on the rain events during the 14 day period preceding each of these sampling campaigns is presented in table 1 basic soil properties of the sampling spots are presented in table 2 2 2 water sampling for stable isotope δ2h and δ18o analysis precipitation soil water from 0 to 300 cm depths groundwater and plants xylem water were collected for the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic analysis for these analyses precipitation samples were collected as soon as a rain event ended from a polyethylene funnel and bottle with a plastic ball placed in the funnel to reduce evaporation groundwater samples were collected from the groundwater monitoring well plant samples consisted of twigs collected from the south facing side of 3 5 s matsudana trees on each sampling occasion bark was peeled from the twigs and all leaves were removed to avoid perturbance of xylem water isotopic signature by fractionation pieces of the de barked and de leaved twigs 20 30 mm long were then immediately placed in 10 ml vials and wrapped in parafilm we used a hand auger to collect soil samples at each sampling site fig 1b the soil profiles collected at different dates were limited to 3 m2 area per site to reduce soil heterogeneity soil samples were collected in 10 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm depths of soil and in 20 cm intervals for 100 300 cm depths the soil samples at each layer were divided into two groups one for isotopic analysis and the other for determination of gravimetric soil water content swc by the drying method 105 c for 12 h 2 3 stable isotope analysis plant and soil samples were extracted using the cryogenic vacuum distillation method orlowski et al 2013 gaj et al 2017 with 105 c and 180 min extraction temperature and time respectively in efforts to ensure that more than 99 of the water was collected from them the isotopic composition 2h to 1h and 18o to 16o ratios of the samples was normalized relative to the v smow vienna standard mean ocean water standard set by the international atomic energy agency the resulting ratios were then expressed in delta notation δ2h and δ18o values calculated as follows 1 δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 2 δ 2 h r sample r standard 1 a previous study has verified that there is negligible organic contamination in precipitation soil water and groundwater samples collected using these methods schultz et al 2011 the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o values of soil water n 275 precipitation n 21 and groundwater samples n 25 were determined at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china northwest a f university for this the lgr liwa v2 liquid water analyzer los gatos research inc was used providing 0 5 and 0 1 precision for h and o isotope analyses respectively each sample was injected six times after a set of six standard samples to minimize memory and drift effects oerter and bowen 2017 average amounts of isotopes obtained from injections 4 through 6 were used to calculate the isotope values of the samples the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of xylem water samples n 25 were determined using a picarro l2130 i instrument at the institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences providing 1 and 0 1 precision for the h and o isotope analyses respectively a micro combustion module picarro was used to remove organic contamination from plant xylem water 2 4 quantifying contributions of matrix and preferential flows to groundwater two groundwater recharge paths that could potentially affect groundwater water isotope values were recognized and considered in the analyses reported here matrix flow and preferential flow matrix flow refers to the relatively slow and even movement of old water and accompanying solutes through soil while sampling all pore spaces in accordance with advection dispersion theory bai et al 1996 we calculated the contributions of preferential and matrix flows to groundwater on two consecutive sampling dates t1 and t2 t1 t2 the δ2h and δ18o values of soil water in 0 300 cm layers weighted averages based on swc on t1 were used to represent the isotopic signatures of matrix flow isotopic values of precipitation weighted averages based on precipitation volumes between t1 and t2 were used to represent the isotopic signatures of preferential flow there were four consecutive sampling dates in this study july 22 august 1 august 1 august 18 august 18 september 1 and september 1 september 24 contributions of preferential and matrix flows to groundwater were estimated by stable isotope analysis in r siar version 4 2 a package designed to solve mixing models for isotopic data in a bayesian framework parnell et al 2010 following xiang et al 2019 when running the model precipitation and soil water isotopes were used as endmembers representing preferential flow and matrix flow respectively to explain the isotopic composition of groundwater the trophic enrichment factor was set to 0 for both δ2h and δ18o because trophic enrichment is not expected to change stable isotope values of recharging water moving via either matrix flow or preferential flow 2 5 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed in spss 20 0 spss 20 0 inc chicago usa the shapiro wilk test and levene s test were respectively used to check that the data met normality of distribution and homogeneity of variance requirements for planned analyses based on results of one way anova followed by post hoc tukey s tests water sources available for plant uptake were then divided into four categories shallow soil water 0 50 cm middle soil water 50 200 cm deep soil water 200 300 cm and groundwater presented diagrams were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 precipitation swc groundwater dynamics during the periods july 22 to august 1 august 1 to august 18 august 18 to september 1 and september 1 to september 24 precipitation amounted to 144 0 28 0 148 0 and 14 1 mm respectively table 1 cumulative precipitation increased in a stepwise manner fig 3 a with two surges from july 22 to august 1 and from august 18 to september 1 influencing swc dynamics as shown in fig 3b and c1 e5 shallow soil water 0 50 cm was most sensitive to precipitation and increased significantly after rainfall p 0 05 it increased substantially by 7 9 3 8 and 7 0 3 5 these and other values quoted in this paragraph are means and standard deviations for three soil profiles in the periods july 22 august 1 and august 18 september 1 respectively in contrast it decreased by 4 7 3 3 and 7 8 4 6 in the periods august 1 18 and september 1 24 respectively the water content of the middle soil layer 50 200 cm was intermediate in terms of both amounts and variation it increased by 2 1 4 6 and 4 0 2 7 in the periods july 22 august 1 and august 18 september 1 respectively and decreased by 1 3 3 6 and 1 9 3 5 between august 1 18 and september 1 24 respectively the deep soil water content 200 300 cm remained nearly constant mean 22 1 3 1 with no significant differences p 0 05 before and after rain events and higher than in the shallow and middle layers the groundwater table fell from its initial level of 3 4 m on july 1 by 0 3 m on august 1 and 0 4 m on august 18 and was lowest on august 26 fig 3a 3 2 isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water and groundwater the δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation soil water and groundwater are presented in fig 4 small rain events occurred in the 14 days prior to the sampling campaign on july 22 with a total of 6 8 mm precipitation the δ2h and δ18o values of the shallow soil water these and other values quoted in this paragraph are means and standard deviations for three soil profiles 63 75 13 78 and 8 40 1 79 respectively were higher than those of middle and deep soil water on july 22 fig 4a1 b1 because of evaporation the isotopic composition of middle soil water varied greatly with δ2h and δ18o values ranging from 111 2 to 75 24 and 15 33 to 9 64 respectively no significant differences p 0 05 were detected in isotopic values between deep soil water mean δ2h and δ18o values 85 05 6 05 and 11 28 1 11 respectively and groundwater mean δ2h and δ18o values 79 03 0 86 and 10 20 0 28 respectively there were six rain events between july 22 and august 1 with δ2h values ranging from 116 54 to 55 16 and δ18o values from 14 50 to 8 03 fig 4a2 b2 new infiltrated precipitation caused reductions in the δ2h and δ18o isotopic values of shallow soil water of 19 18 and 2 33 respectively the isotopic compositions of middle soil water fluctuated greatly with δ2h and δ18o values of 81 40 12 89 and 11 11 1 76 respectively at 60 140 cm the values at 140 200 cm were 90 85 7 81 and 12 27 1 10 respectively these values were almost identical to the weighted average values for precipitation 93 84 and 12 19 respectively suggesting the occurrence of preferential flow no significant variation p 0 05 in isotopic composition of either deep soil water or groundwater was detected between july 22 and august 1 two rain events occurred between august 1 to august 18 with total precipitation of 28 0 mm and weighted average δ2h and δ18o values of 45 21 and 6 93 respectively the isotopic values of shallow soil water were significantly higher on august 18 than on august 1 fig 4a3 b3 the δ2h and δ18o values of middle soil water ranged from 120 16 to 54 83 and from 15 44 to 7 39 respectively while those of deep soil water decreased from 89 61 to 93 82 and from 11 90 to 12 50 respectively between august 1 and august 18 in association with infiltration of precipitation in early rain events e g july 22 to july 27 no significant changes p 0 05 in isotopic ratios of groundwater between august 1 and august 18 were observed four rain events occurred in the period from august 18 to september 1 with δ2h values ranging from 91 72 to 64 75 weighted average value 83 45 and δ18o values ranging from 12 71 to 8 63 weighted average value 11 35 mixing of less enriched new water and more depleted old water led to an increase in the δ2h and δ18o values in the middle parts of the soil column on september 1 fig 4a b4 for example between august 18 and september 1 δ2h and δ18o values in the 160 200 cm layers increased from 105 84 to 98 56 and from 13 88 to 13 14 respectively during this period the δ2h and δ18o values also increased by 3 56 and 0 66 respectively in deep soil water and by 2 74 and 0 71 respectively in groundwater eight small rainfall events occurred from september 1 to september 24 resulting in isotopic enrichment of shallow soil water but no significant changes p 0 05 in isotopic values in either deep soil water or groundwater were detected 3 3 paths of groundwater recharge major rain events occurred on july 22 61 5 mm precipitation 28 9 mm h 1 intensity and august 22 92 3 mm precipitation 9 2 mm h 1 intensity during the study period and had substantial effects on water movement swc at 160 200 cm depths increased between july 22 and august 1 while the groundwater table fell suggesting that most precipitation did not recharge groundwater by preferential flow similarly estimates by the siar mixing model suggested that matrix flow contributed 65 17 of the total recharge during this period fig 5 the groundwater table still declined between august 1 and august 18 and matrix flow contributed 79 17 of the total recharge during this period the groundwater table began to rise after august 26 and preferential flow dominated the total recharge 60 15 between august 18 and september 1 overall matrix flow contributed 64 to the total recharge and the preferential flow was 36 thus supporting our first hypothesis 3 4 comparison of xylem water soil water and groundwater δ2h and δ18o values plots of the stable isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o values of soil water groundwater and xylem water samples in dual isotope space are shown in fig 6a1 5 the slope and intercept of the lmwl δ2h 7 67 δ18o 5 91 r2 0 96 were lower than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 values of all the water samples were close to the lmwl fig 6 b1 c5 shows boxplots of δ2h and δ18o values of all water samples there were generally no significant differences p 0 05 in these values among the measured water sources on august 1 or september 1 except that 200 300 cm layers on august 1 had significantly lower values than the other water sources p 0 05 in contrast on july 22 and august 18 in periods with less precipitation stronger 2h and 18o enrichment was detected in shallow soil water and xylem water than in the middle soil water deep soil water and groundwater no significant enrichment signal p 0 05 was observed in shallow soil water on september 24 possibly because weather conditions had been cloudier and cooler 4 discussion 4 1 evidence for matrix and preferential flows preferential flow and matrix flow are two widely recognized types of soil water movement li et al 2017b tan et al 2017 preferential flow has fast infiltration rates and matrix flow has long residence times so they have different effects on swc dynamics they may also lead to different isotopic profiles due to associated differences in processes including inter alia evaporation mixing of new water and old water and variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation that contributes to these flows gazis and feng 2004 thus swc dynamics and isotopic δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation and soil water can be used to identify preferential and matrix flows for example between july 22 and august 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of the 160 200 cm layers at site 1 decreased by 12 05 and 2 15 respectively to values close to weighted average values of precipitation from july 22 to july 27 one possibility is that precipitation reached these layers through preferential flow another possibility is that soil water depleted in heavy isotopes at the 60 120 cm depths on july 22 moved down to these layers changes in swc during this period provided more explanation as shown in fig 3c swc at the 60 120 and 160 200 cm depths on july 22 were 12 2 and 14 4 respectively while swc at the 160 200 cm depths on august 1 reached 21 1 swc is unlikely to increase strongly and quickly solely through matrix flow thus this recharge might have been largely due to preferential flow with some contribution from matrix flow evidence of preferential flow was also observed between august 18 and september 1 swc in the 0 100 cm layers increased from 11 4 2 1 to 19 0 3 3 and the δ2h and δ18o values on september 1 means 82 17 and 11 19 respectively were similar to the weighted average values of precipitation during this period 79 02 and 10 75 respectively evidence of mixing of recent precipitation with old water in the upper soil profile was detected on august 18 at site 1 two rain events occurred between august 1 and august 18 one with δ2h and δ18o values of 56 68 and 8 89 respectively on august 8 and another with values of 38 23 and 5 73 respectively on august 15 evaporation of shallow soil water during this period would have increased the enrichment however even under the strongest enrichment the 2h and 18o values of soil water at 50 cm depth 61 8 and 8 4 respectively were still lower than those of the precipitation clearly indicating the occurrence of mixing of precipitation and old water and thus matrix flow 4 2 the groundwater recharge process at check dammed sites as shown in fig 3a there were two main surges of precipitation during the study period from july 22 to august 1 and from august 18 to september 1 which strongly influenced swc and groundwater dynamics as summarized in fig 7 a we identified three phases with distinct groundwater recharge processes based on responses of swc and the groundwater table to precipitation during the dry period before july 22 soil water in large pores drained emptying preferential flow paths the remaining soil water was stored in small pores with poor mobility thus the groundwater table gradually dropped due to human activities extraction of water for drinking and irrigation and uptake by plants during the following intermediately wet period july 22 to august 18 precipitation first infiltrated into the soil and filled soil pores then displaced old water in the soil pushing it deeper into the soil profile like matrix flow preferential flow also occurs due to pores formed by rotten roots and animals for example li et al 2017a and li et al 2019 found that ant nests can reach depths of 60 cm on the loess plateau and influence swc to 120 cm depth our results show that the groundwater table still decreased during the intermediate period in association with the dry soil conditions most of the precipitation from july 22 to july 27 filled soil pores rather than recharging groundwater this result is consistent with findings by alley et al 2002 that most water from precipitation infiltrates and is stored in the unsaturated soil zone and eventually returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration especially in parts of the loess plateau with high evaporation and high vegetation cover chen et al 2015 during the wet period august 18 to september 1 water flowed quickly as the wetting front moved down and recharged the groundwater because soil pores had been filled during the preceding period the groundwater table began to rise after august 26 35 days after the first heavy rain event on july 22 there were also substantial mismatches in isotopic values between the groundwater then and precipitation in the large rain event 92 3 mm on august 22 possibly related to the mixture of that infiltrating precipitation previous precipitation e g from rain events between july 22 and july 27 and old water remaining in deep soil layers such mixing is most intense when the groundwater table rises and mixes with water stored in the unsaturated zone sprenger et al 2019 our data suggest that both matrix and preferential flows occurred in the groundwater recharge process and results from the siar model suggest that matrix flow and preferential flow accounted for 64 and 36 respectively of the total recharge supporting our first hypothesis 4 3 assessing the tww hypothesis the generally greater 2h and 18o enrichment in plant xylem water and shallow soil water than in stream water and groundwater prompted formulation of the tww hypothesis brooks et al 2010 goldsmith et al 2012 berry et al 2017 we observed 2h and 18o enrichment in xylem water and shallow soil water on july 22 and august 18 and their δ2h and δ18o values significantly differed from those of deep soil water and groundwater p 0 05 however differences in isotopic values we observed during periods of heavy rainfall between plants and mobile water sources do not support the hypothesis even when preferential flow prevailed e g on august 1 and september 1 fig 6 our results also suggest that our second hypothesis groundwater recharge paths affect plants water uptake should be rejected for the following reasons hydrological connectivity is enhanced when precipitation infiltrates into the soil matrix enabling exchange of new water and old water the exchange might be more pronounced in drought conditions as water taken up by roots from the soil matrix is replaced by mobile water pulled from pockets of larger pore spaces by the increasingly negative matric potential gradients in the rhizosphere evaristo et al 2019 plant thus use mixed water sources evidence of this exchange has also been provided by vargas et al 2017 who found that 75 to 95 of tightly bound water isotopically exchanged with mobile water in a glasshouse experiment with potted persea americana in two contrasting soil types similarly zhao et al 2018 found that isotopic patterns conforming to the tww hypothesis disappeared as hydrological connectivity increased in the wet season in an area with a subtropical climate in southwest china according to the tww hypothesis plants use bound water with different isotopic signatures from that of mobile water streams and groundwater but this does not mean that the ecohydrological separation will disappear when plants use groundwater for example evaristo et al 2016 still found evidence of ecohydrological separation in two tropical environments in puerto rico where groundwater apparently contributed 38 and 28 of the xylem water of mahogany swietenia spp trees at xeric and mesic hydric sites respectively unfortunately we cannot calculate the contributions of groundwater to plants at our study site because the groundwater isotope signatures sometimes overlapped with those of the soil water however in the same study catchment according to yasuda et al 2013 and luo et al 2020 the annual mean precipitation increased from 342 mm in 2004 2006 to 570 mm in 2015 2017 while the groundwater table fell substantially from 1 59 to 2 96 m in 2004 2006 to 2 89 to 4 51 m in 2015 2017 these changes were mainly attributed to increases in vegetation coverage caused by implementation of the green for grain project on the loess plateau luo et al 2020 the s matsudana trees we sampled are members of one of the most widely used species for afforestation in the project and probably one of the main consumers of groundwater the magnitude of groundwater used by plants mainly depend on groundwater depth and swc bertrand et al 2014 in addition according to the conceptual model proposed by brooks et al 2010 the wet season is the optimal time for evaluating the tww hypothesis because tightly bound water in the small pores and mobile water could coexist during this period an obvious limitation of our study is that we only obtained data covering a single three month period however at our study site more than 65 of the annual rainfall occurs from july to september so measurements during this period enable clear detection of differences in any in isotopic signatures of these water pools and water taken up by plants at such check dammed sites thus we believe that our data enable robust assessment of the hydrological aspects of the tww hypothesis considered here future work should include efforts to integrate hydrological and plant physiology considerations for example martin gomez et al 2017 probed ecophysiological strategies of two species pinus sylvestris and quercus subpyrenaica by analysing correlations between stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o in xylem and soil water leaf water potential and foliar gas exchange they found that p sylvestris has a more isohydric strategy than q subpyrenaica but q subpyrenaica is more resistant to drought probably associated with a deeper and more reliable water supply strategies to cope with water limitation strongly affect the degree to which plants take up shallow or deep soil water with clear possible implications for the tww hypothesis and associated phenomena 4 4 implications for groundwater management at check dammed sites numerous studies have focused on the process of groundwater recharge in tablelands on the loess plateau where the groundwater table is more than 40 m deep li et al 2017b huang et al 2017 2019 fig 7b table 3 a number of studies have found that matrix flow dominates groundwater recharge li 2001 huang et al 2017 yang and fu 2017 and the recharge rate varies from 30 to 70 mm yr 1 in these tablelands huang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 precipitation thus takes hundreds of years to pass through unsaturated deep loess layers and replenish groundwater li 2001 huang et al 2016 2017 li et al 2017b found that preferential flow contributed 87 4 to groundwater recharge and the total recharge rate was 107 55 mm yr 1 at an examined tableland site thus even if preferential flow dominates precipitation still takes years or even decades to recharge groundwater in tablelands of the plateau moreover some of the infiltrated precipitation driven by the tension gradient in the loess profile can only move within a limited range and cannot effectively supply groundwater infiltrated water driven by gravity can move longer distance but only if the swc reaches the maximum field capacity chen et al 2008 however due to the limited precipitation and high evapotranspiration swc of deep soil within profiles on the plateau is always lower than 60 of field capacity and cannot be replenished by rainfall in a normal year this layer of soil which has low swc permanent wilting point 60 of field capacity and is not reached by precipitation in normal years is called the dried soil layer wang et al 2011 precipitation that reaches upper parts of this dried soil layer preferentially fills pores instead of infiltrating to and recharging groundwater wang et al 2008 in contrast check dam in gullies and other channels with shallow groundwater seems to play an important role in groundwater recharge and water cycling these dams can not only trap runoff and sediments but also allow most of the precipitation intercepted by surrounding slopes to enter the soil rather than evaporate into the atmosphere shi et al 2019 found that check dams decreased runoff and sediment yield by 12 and 11 7 respectively on the loess plateau thus they can improve regional hydrological precipitation soil water groundwater cycles by enhancing connectivity between soil water and groundwater at our study site during the covered period the mean groundwater table depth was 3 6 m and it began to rise on august 26 just 35 days after the first large rain event on july 22 similarly luo et al 2020 recorded a lag between precipitation and groundwater responses of ca 12 54 days at check dammed sites in the same catchment this is much shorter than the time required in the tablelands decades or hundreds of years table 3 this means tableland with thick soil layers may make minor contributions to groundwater recharge on the loess plateau and check dammed sites with shallow groundwater may make more contributions at least per unit area this finding has important implications for assessments of groundwater s vulnerability to contamination for several reasons first the major difference in time required for groundwater recharge between check dams and tablelands may result in inaccurate estimates of groundwater pollution and potential threats to groundwater management if tableland data are used xiang et al 2019 second check dammed land has high agricultural value because it has relatively good water and nutrient conditions hence a megaproject called gully land consolidation was launched on the loess plateau in 2011 with an aim to create 266 700 ha of farmlands in valleys where substantial numbers of check dams will be built by 2020 jin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 those measures may result in fertilizer and pesticide pollution due to its excessive application ju et al 2007 particularly as our findings suggest that preferential flow may account for 36 of the total groundwater recharge and thus enable rapid transport of contaminants to the groundwater this may pose serious threats to groundwater safety on the loess plateau if we neglect effects of check dams on its recharge therefore not only the impact of check dams on groundwater recharge but also their implications for local water management strategies should be carefully considered to avoid possible pesticide pollution 5 conclusion stable isotope δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation soil water and groundwater were used to explore groundwater recharge process associated with check dam on the loess plateau results obtained using a siar model suggest that preferential and matrix flows contributed 36 and 64 respectively of groundwater recharge supporting our first hypothesis that both kinds of flow contribute in addition the groundwater table began to rise just 35 days after first heavy rain event july 22 in the wet season orders of magnitude shorter than corresponding times on tablelands of the plateau decades or hundreds of years our findings suggest that check dammed channels can make substantially greater contributions to groundwater recharge than tableland which have been more extensively studied and should be paid more attention in groundwater management in the region the process of groundwater recharge affects isotopic signatures of water taken up by plants according to the tww framework however we found no significant differences p 0 05 in isotopic values of the examined water pools precipitation soil water groundwater and plant xylem water under preferential flow conditions hydrological connectivity increased with infiltration of precipitation resulting in the mixing of new water and old water thus these isotopic patterns do not support the tww hypothesis in these surroundings this conflicts with our second hypothesis that groundwater recharge paths

4764,subsurface fluids injection is a viable alternative for controlling seawater intrusion in coastal regions and freshwater is usually served for valid fluids to generate pressure ridge towards the ocean but other fluids injection such as compressed air which presents clean and readily available is a more attractive solution for repulsing the intruded seawater where freshwater is insufficient in this study the performance of compressed air injection i e air barriers for mitigating seawater intrusion in a coastal unconfined aquifer was quantificationally assessed using a coupled water air two phase flow and saltwater transport model as compressed air is introduced into the aquifer at the toe of saltwater wedge the seaward hydraulic gradient adjacent to the coast is produced driven by the generated airflow thereby causing salt freshwater interface to retreat to the ocean the magnitude of air injection rate related to the operational cost of air barriers does not increases significantly given the progressively decreasing change rate compared to the workability of air barriers in the confined aquifer under similar conditions the reduction in intruded seawater at 365 0 d in the unconfined aquifer reaches only about 0 45 times that in the confined aquifer which indicates the significance of the boundary condition of aquifer top the sensitivity analysis of the overlying unsaturated zone reveals that with its permeability decreasing or its thickness increasing the performance of air barriers is enhanced owing to the blocking effect of the overlying layer on the escape of generated airflow and tends progressively to be stable particularly the efficacy of air barriers in the confined aquifer including the reduction in intruded seawater and the air injection rate also can be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient semipermeable layer keywords seawater intrusion control compressed air injection numerical simulation coastal unconfined aquifers water air two phase flow 1 introduction under natural undisturbed conditions density difference between seawater and freshwater and the engendered hydraulic gradient in coastal aquifers drives freshwater discharge toward the ocean and develops a saltwater wedge near the coast through the action of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion with the expected rise of sea level resulting from global warming and the excessive exploition of groundwater in coastal aquifers to meet the growing demands of freshwater the developed saltwater wedge may invade laterally further inland and contaminate the available groundwater supply werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013 lu et al 2013a 2013b 2015 i e the seawater intrusion swi thereby leading to several serious consequences with respect to both environmental and economic impacts in coastal regions werner 2010 werner et al 2013 shi and jiao 2014 effective and correction countermeasures are therefore considerably required to control or mitigate swi and to restore the coastal aquifers various methodologies have been proposed to attempt to control swi in past decades for instance the improvement in groundwater exploition patterns werner et al 2013 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 singh 2014 and the construction of subsurface physical or hydraulic barriers oude essink 2001 abarca et al 2006 botero acosta and donado 2015 the appropriate arrangement of pumping patterns in coastal regions is generally accomplished through searching the optimal abstraction strategies including rates and locations of pumping wells for multiple well systems considering simultaneously the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the aquifer and the local management structure hence numerous simulation optimization models have been applied in management swi in coastal aquifers among which the genetic algorithm optimization technique is used widely given its superior performance in identification optimal solutions mantoglou and papantoniou 2008 the vertically impermeable or semi permeable walls constructed parallel to the coast i e the subsurface physical barriers can also impede the inland motion of saltwater and have been successfully implemented in japan china india the middle east and african countries janardhana raju et al 2013 stevanović 2016 this barrier consists of two types the subsurface dams and the cutoff walls it has been demonstrated that the performance of physical barrier depends on the height or the penetration depth the distance from the coast and the relative conductivity of the barrier as well as the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy the ratio of the groundwater inflow velocity over the density driven saltwater velocity of the aquifer luyun et al 2009 2011 kaleris and ziogas 2013 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 chang et al 2019 furthermore abdoulhalik et al 2017 using experimental test and numerical model showed that the mixed physical barrier combining an impermeable cutoff wall and a semi permeable dam yielded up to 62 and 42 more saltwater intrusion reduction than the dam and the cutoff wall respectively and proposed the saltwater lifting mechanism to account for this phenomenon given that the imbalance of hydraulic gradient between the inland and the ocean is the primary inducement to cause the occurrence of swi it may be expectedly valid for controlling swi through receding the landward gradient inside the saltwater wedge i e the negative hydraulic barrier or enhancing the seaward gradient inland i e the positive hydraulic barrier negative hydraulic barriers are generally created by continuously abstracting brackish or saline water near the coast and thus brings down the piezometric head here thereby intercepting the inland moving of saltwater and restoring the aquifer todd 1980 kacimov et al 2009 masciopinto 2013 this process may lead to extracting more freshwater than saltwater from pumping wells consequently exacerbating the scarcity of available groundwater resources sherif and hamza 2001 aimed at this problem pool and carrera 2010 proposed a double pumping barrier system an inland well pumping freshwater and a seaward well pumping saltwater and this design has an efficient role in repulsion the invasive saltwater in early stages while a critical pumping rate of saltwater well is required in long term stages positive hydraulic barrier are usually developed by injecting high quality water into the coastal aquifers through infiltration pond only for an unconfined aquifer or injection wells mahesha and nagaraja 1996 mahesha 1996 thereby creating a freshwater ridge that prevents saltwater from invading inland lu et al 2017 compared the effectiveness of well injection and pond infiltration for mitigating swi in an unconfined aquifer using the analytical method and concluded that their performances are basically the same given the circular pond but the maximum net extraction rate increases greatly with the ratio of the semiaxes of the perpendicular to the parallel to the coast when the elliptic pond is applied this methodology of positive barriers is suggested to be among the most widely used techniques for controlling swi in coastal areas hussain et al 2019 moreover lu et al 2013 through analytical solutions showed that the injection of freshwater located between the toe of saltwater wedge and the pumping wells can increase the net extraction rate of pumping wells by 50 compared to the case of traditional single extraction wells nevertheless the supply of water that is available for injection into the aquifer is among the major limitation of this method in dry years and in regions that suffer from scarcity of water abd elhamid and javadi 2011 to achieve this purpose of enhancing the piezometric head inland where groundwater resource is limited other fluids instead of freshwater can also be introduced into the aquifer through the installed boreholes the subsurface fluids injection has been widely used in many geo environmental situations for various purposes such as enhancing oil production reserving valuable gas or oil arresting land subsidence disposing of contaminants and hazardous wastes tunnel construction and other applications selvadurai 2006 wong and lau 2008 teatini et al 2011 chinkulkijniwat et al 2014 among the available injected fluids compressed air as a clean fluid cannot bring a secondary contamination to the originally aquifer for the first time dror et al 2004 examined air barriers as an alternative of hydraulic barriers to impede saltwater invading through laboratory experiments hereafter sun and semprich 2013 used numerical model to explore the workability of compressed air injection for controlling swi in a confined aquifer and found that seawater is ejected from the aquifer and the seawater circulation disappears with the action of pressurized air for a coastal unconfined aquifer conceptually the injected air may escape out of the aquifer through the overlying unsaturated zones consequently causing the lower seaward pressure gradient insufficient for repulsion swi and the enormous air loss rate i e the operation cost of this approach however to the best of our knowledge it is not explicit by far what the physical process with respect to water flow airflow saltwater transport and their interactions in the unconfined aquifer driven by compressed air injection is whether this methodology for controlling swi is applicative in a coastal unconfined aquifer in terms of the environmental i e the reduction in invasive saltwater and economic i e the air loss rate performances or not and what the feasible condition is therefore in this study the performance of compressed air injection for controlling swi and the involved physical processes within an unconfined aquifer is numerically assessed and investigated through a coupled water air two phase flow and saltwater transport numerical model this numerical model describes the transformation and dissolution between the liquid phase and gas phase as well as saltwater transport in variable saturated and variable density porous media the indicators the distance of different isolines from the seaside the mass of intruded seawater and the air injection rate relating to the operation cost of air barriers were used thereafter comparisons of the reduction in saltwater intrusion and the magnitude of air injection rate induced by air injection were made for cases in the unconfined and confined aquifer furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the dependency of the effectiveness of the compressed air barrier on some parameters of the air barrier layout and the overlaying unsaturated zones and then the conditions under which the application of air injection is expected to be more applicative in repulsion the invasive saltwater were analyzed 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations the mass balance equations describing these processes with regard to water air two phase flow and saltwater transport under isothermal conditions in saturated unsaturated porous medium can be written as pruess et al 1999 1 m κ t d i v f adv κ f diff κ q κ where m κ is the total mass of component κ and three components freshwater w brine b and air a were considered in coastal groundwater systems including the unsaturated and saturated zones f adv κ and f diff κ are the advective and diffusive mass flux vector of component κ respectively q κ is the sink source term of component κ m κ is obtained by summing over the phases β liquid l and gas g phase where the liquid phase l includes freshwater brine and dissolved air and the gas phase g includes air and water vapor its general form

modeling of fluid flow and saltwater transport processes this simulator will recognize automatically the primary variables p β x b the seawater mass fraction in the liquid phase and x β a under single phase conditions while p g x b and s g 10 under two phase conditions in the following section an in situ air flow test carrier out by kramer and semprich kramer and semprich 1989 and the henry s problem was employed to inspected the reliability and veracity of the tough2 eos7 simulator in describing the interactions between the liquid and gas phase in porous media induced by air injection as well as the processes of water flow and saltwater transport with respect to swi in the aquifer respectively 2 2 in situ air flow test the in situ air flow test was conducted to explore the behavior of the outcropping types of essen soils before the subway construction using compressed air technique in essen germany kramer and semprich 1989 note that this field test does not involve the processes of saltwater transport in the air flow test pressurized air was introduced into the stratum through the zone 18 0 m to 21 0 m below the ground surface and the applied air pressure was increased stepwise by the compressor δ p 61 kpa from 0 h to 0 93 h δ p 78 kpa from 0 93 h to 1 87 h δ p 119 kpa from 1 87 h to 2 8 h δ p 160 kpa from 2 8 h to 27 h the soil profile in this test was divided into the four distinct layers fig s1 a fill layer a thick silt layer a thin permeable sand layer and a thick marl layer the groundwater table is approximately 4 75 m below the ground surface several piezometers and flow meter were adopted to measure the variations of pore pressure at different locations fig s1 and table s1 and the air injection rate during the test considering the axial symmetry of this air flow test only one fourth of the domain around the injection zone was simulated in this study the schematic of soil profile at y 0 0 m in this simulation is shown in fig s1 the model domain was set to be 100 0 m long in both the transverse and longitudinal direction to eliminate the lateral boundary effects and 25 0 m high in the vertical direction the capillary pressure and the relative permeability dependent on the liquid saturation were described by the vg and vg m model respectively which were expressed as eqs 5 through 7 corey 1954 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the involved hydraulic parameters of four soil layers listed in table s2 were taken from öttl öttl 2003 note that intrinsic permeability of the sand and marl layer were adjusted in this study given that the sand layer contains a considerable portion of silt and the marl layer presents high anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical soil permeability 5 p c p 0 s 1 λ 1 1 λ p max p c 0 where p 0 is the air entry pressure λ is a model parameter associated with the degree of soil uniformity s is the effective liquid saturation s s l s lr s ls s lr s l is the liquid saturation s lr is the residual liquid

and gas phase respectively s s l s lr 1 s lr s gr and s gr is the residual gas saturation in the numerical simulation for air injection the capillarity gravity equilibrium was used as the initial state the atmospheric boundary conditions p g p atm the atmospheric pressure p atm is 1 013 105 pa x b 0 0 and x g a 0 999 were applied at the ground surface the dirichlet boundary conditions p l p atm 20 25 ρ f g x b 0 0 and x l a 1 0 10 10 were imposed at the bottom of domain where the freshwater density ρ f is 1000 kg m3 the gravitational acceleration g is 9 81 m s2 the property and volume of the elements within the air injection regions were set as free moving and infinite and their primary variables were as follows p g p atm δ p x b 0 0 and x g a 0 999 no flow boundaries were considered at the remaining boundary the distributions of pore air pressure at profile y 0 0 m as well as the measured and simulated pore air pressure at observation points ① ④ at 27 0 h is shown in fig s1 and table s1 respectively the pore air pressure near the injection region increases driven by air injection and the simulated pore air pressure at points ① ④ agree well with the measure results fig s2 shows the temporal changes of measured and simulated air injection rate during the test the mass flux of air kg s injected into the soil interior can be obtained through adding the flux of gas phase between the injection elements and the adjacent soil elements which is calculated by the numerical model on the basis of the gas phase pressure temperature and the ideal gas law as can be seen the simulated rate is substantially consistent with the measured rate before 21 h moreover few air penetrates into the stratum before 2 8 h due to the applied air pressure insufficient for overcoming the air entry value of the marl and the groundwater pressure after 21 h the measured air injection rate increased significantly due to the existence of fractures in the field test however the medium was assumed to be porous media in the numerical simulation thereby producing the discrepancy between the simulated and measured rates in conclusion the tough2 eos7 simulator can be used to describe accurately the interaction processes between the liquid and gas phases driven by air injection in porous medium 2 3 henry s problem the henry s problem describes the processes of swi into a coastal confined aquifer and was treated as a two dimension problem the aquifer was simplified as a cross section perpendicular to the coast and parallel to the steady flow path inside the aquifer which is presented schematically in fig 1 the selected parameters and dimensions in this study are consistent with those cases solved numerically by other researchers segol et al 1975 frind 1982 huyakorn et al 1987 liu et al 2001 hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 a constant freshwater influx of 0 0066 m d was imposed on the landside a hydrostatic pressure boundary condition p l p atm ρ s g h sl z and x l a 1 0 10 10 was exposed on the seaside where seawater density ρ s is 1025 kg m3 h sl is the elevation of sea level with the model bottom as the datum and z is the vertical coordinate within the domain given the dilution of seawater outside the exit boundary the saltwater concentration on the seaside boundary was modified to allow convective mass transport out of the system over the top portion of the seaside boundary in previous studies frind 1982 huyakorn et al 1987 liu et al 2001 hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 x b 1 0 for 0 0 z 0 and x b x 0 for z 0 100 0 in the vertical direction it is worth noting that the determination of the z 0 value was vague and was specified provisionally as 80 0 m by some previous studies hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 liu et al 2001 in this study the value of z 0 was achieved iteratively by modifying the source code of tough2 eos7 as follows the horizontal direction of water flow on the seaside is judged every time step at first then if groundwater flows out of the aquifer the concentration boundary is set to be x b x 0 otherwise the concentration boundary is set to be x b 1 0 the initial conditions were set to be freshwater filled over the entire domain the steady state of salt freshwater distribution inside the aquifer was obtained by performing transient analysis for a sufficiently long simulation time as can be seen from fig 1 the 0 5 isochlor distribution at the steady state calculated by the tough2 eos7 simulator is substantially consistent with those from previous studies segol et al 1975 frind 1982 huyakorn et al 1987 liu et al 2001 hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 and the intersection of 0 5 isochlor with the seaside reaches about 70 6 m close to the preset value of 80 0 m in previous studies hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 therefore the improvement of the tough2 eos7 source code in this study is capable of describing the fact of the dilution of seawater outside the exit boundary and the numerical model can be used to obtain the steady state of salt freshwater distribution within the aquifer for a more general swi problem 2 4 model descriptions and numerical methods a two dimension and vertical cross shore unconfined aquifer modified on the basis of that of henry s problem i e adding a 10 0 m thick layer vertically shown in fig 2 was used to assess the performance of air barriers for controlling swi in a coastal unconfined aquifer in this study the unconfined aquifer was also assumed homogenous and isotropic that is some complex geological factors such as geologic faults dead end pore rock fracture a highly permeable and anisotropy layer which may be in favor of the accumulation of generated airflow or promote the escape of airflow from the macro pores in soils could not be taken into account in this study the involved unsaturated hydraulic parameters were assigned by reference to those of sandy loam given the intrinsic permeability of the soil used in this study is close to that of sandy loam carsel and parrish 1988 and are listed in table 1 the other parameters were accordant with that of the henry s problem the capillarity gravity equilibrium and the steady state of salt freshwater distribution free of air barriers within the unconfined aquifer was firstly obtained the setting of initial and boundary conditions in this simulation were in accord with that of the henry s problem except that the lateral boundary above 100 0 m and the ground surface were imposed by the atmospheric boundary p g p atm x b 0 0 and x g a 0 999 the steady state of the distributions of groundwater flow and saltwater concentration within the unconfined aquifer is shown in fig 2 as can be seen seawater enters into the aquifer along the aquifer bottom and exits out of the upper part of the seaside driven by the inland hydraulic gradient thus forming a salt freshwater circulation the elevation of groundwater level on the landside reaches about 102 5 m 2 5 m higher than the sea level and the generated seaward hydraulic gradient attains 0 0125 which is within the range of gradients commonly used in previous studies chang and clement 2012 abdoulhalik et al 2017 especially the distribution of 0 5 isochlor in the unconfined aquifer is substantially the same with that of the henry s problem from fig 2 the intersection of 0 05 isochlor with the aquifer bottom at the steady state reaches about x 83 9 m which was assumed to be the toe of salt freshwater interface and the air injection well should be placed in this position or its landside referring to sun and semprich 2013 the zone 79 0 m x 80 0 m 0 0 m z 15 0 m was selected to introduce pressurized air in this study note that the vertical position and length of the injection region may affect the performance of air barriers for mitigating swi but the common processes with respect to the behaviors of groundwater flow and airflow as well as the saltwater wedge dynamics with the action of air injection in the unconfined aquifer can be captured and described on this configuration in order to reveal accurately the horizontal position of injection well the discretization of the aquifer was refined and the horizontal mesh size adjacent to the injection zone ranged from 1 0 m to 2 0 m meanwhile given that the applied air pressure should not be lower than the maximum groundwater pressure within the injection zone about 975 5 kpa to ensure compressed air permeating into the aquifer the air pressure applied in this case was set to be 1000 kpa in the transient state simulation for compressed air injection the steady state for capillarity gravity and salinity free of barrier was used as the initial condition the duration of air injection was 365 0 d the landside below the groundwater level was represented by the dirichlet boundary condition p l p atm ρ f g 102 5 z x b 0 0 and x l a 1 0 10 10 the seaside boundary below the sea level was also described by the dirichlet boundary condition regardless of the dilution of seawater due to the short simulation time p l p atm ρ s g h sl z x b steady and x l a 1 0 10 10 where x b steady is the value of seawater mass fraction at the initial steady state the setting of the elements within the air injection regions is similar to that in the in situ air flow test the remaining boundary conditions remained the same as for the steady state conditions five observation points a e fig 2 considering the location of air injection and the motion path of generated airflow within the aquifer were selected to capture the temporal variations of relevant variables within the model domain over the course of compressed air injection and their coordinates are listed in table 2 3 analysis and discussion of the simulation results 3 1 changes in the fluid pressure and flow field fig 3 shows the distributions of pore air pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure and airflow within the model domain at different times after compressed air injection as compressed air is injected into the aquifer air flows upwardly and laterally due to its smaller density and the surrounding pressure gradient of gas phase thereby causing the pore air pressure near and above the injection regions to increase that is the position and length of injection zone may alter the migration path of airflow and the distributions of pore air pressure within the model domain thereby affecting the workability of air barriers for repulsing the intruded seawater at 7 0 d the upward airflow transports to the overlying unsaturated zones and escapes out of the ground surface thereafter the generated airflow gathers around the model top and spreads laterally it is observed that the outflow of compressed air is primarily through the top of model domain and the upper part of landside fig 3 f consequently as shown in fig 4 a bulb shaped desaturated zone within the aquifer is formed and expands upward gradually until it is connected to the upper unsaturated zones fig 4 a c hereafter the range of unsaturated zone within the whole system extends to the landside and seaside developing an approximate fan pattern fig 4 e f fig 5 shows the equivalent freshwater hydraulic head and groundwater flow within the model domain at the steady state before compressed air injection and at different times after compressed air injection note that the hydraulic head is defined as h z p l ρ f g where p l is the pore water pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure and the same below at 1 0 d driven by the generated airflow the shape of hydraulic head contours changes significantly compared to that at the initial steady state fig 5 a and presents an arc shape around the injection region thereby forming a pressure gradient towards the ground surface the landside and the seaside as a result groundwater flows landward at the left side of injection region and flows seaward at the other side that is with the action of pressurized airflow from the injection zone saltwater distributed over the salt freshwater interface is pushed towards the ocean therefore it can be suggested that even the air barrier does not completely penetrate the entire aquifer the seaward hydraulic gradient adjacent can be produced as long as the applied air pressure exceeds a certain threshold subsequently the center of hydraulic head contours moves upward with time and the magnitude of the maximum hydraulic head increases accordingly however when airflow can flow out of the ground surface 7 0 d the reverse phenomenon appears at 365 0 d the maximum hydraulic head and the maximum seaward water velocity within the aquifer reaches about 118 9 m and 6 08 10 4 m s respectively moreover the crossover between the line of zero horizontal water velocity and the aquifer bottom migrates to the position of x 134 5 m moving seaward by 45 0 m compared to that of the steady state therefore it is proven again that the air injection wells should be laid at the front edge of salt freshwater interface otherwise influenced by the action of air injection saltwater might be driven landward to the aquifer fig 6 depicts the changes in the pore air pressure and liquid saturation with time after compressed air injection at points a e the pore air pressure at these points varies in a similar way increasing rapidly to a maximum value firstly then decreasing quickly before decreasing slowly until a quasi steady value is reached from points a c the same horizontal coordinates and points c e the same vertical coordinates the maximum and steady value of pore air pressure decreases with the distance from the injection region additionally the liquid saturation of points a e reduces in order and the diminution begins at about 1 31 d 3 79 d 6 33 d 10 78 d and 13 39 d respectively this phenomenon also demonstrates that the generated airflow driven by air injection moves upward at first and then spreads laterally in particular given that the greater pressure gradient and the atmospheric boundary at the landside the time when the liquid saturation begins to decrease at point d is earlier than that at point e fig 7 shows the time evolution of water velocity and air velocity at points f and g points f and g is located in the upper unsaturated zones caused by the propagating airflow and the lower saturated zones respectively fig 4 f and their detailed coordinates are presented in table 2 note that a positive vertical and horizontal velocity in this figure represents air or water flowing upward and seaward respectively from fig 7 a the generated airflow reaches point f at about 14 6 d before that driven by the application of compressed air injection the magnitude of seaward water velocity increases rapidly whereas the value of upward water velocity increases firstly and then decreases given the center of hydraulic head contours moving continually fig 5 after that the state of point f becomes unsaturated and water therein is displaced by air consequently both the horizontal and vertical water velocity decreases and recovers gradually to zero conversely air always flows seaward and upward over the whole simulation time and its velocity increases progressively at 365 0 d the vertical and horizontal air velocity reaches about 1 31 10 3 m s and 6 08 10 4 m s respectively from fig 7 b the state of point g remains always liquid saturated during compressed air injection driven by the generated airflow the value of seaward horizontal water velocity increases firstly and then decreases to a steady value of 1 81 10 7 m s whereas the water flow vertically flows upward firstly and then downward and at 365 0 d the water vertically flows upward and its velocity achieved 1 81 10 7 m s from the temporal changes in relevant variables at these observation points their value tends progressively to be stable and particularly the magnitude of the velocity of water flow at 365 0 d is considerably small this variation suggests that the model domain reaches basically a steady state 3 2 changes in the saltwater concentration fig 8 shows the distributions of saltwater concentration at 365 0 d and of 0 5 isochlor at different times within the aquifer after compressed air injection as can be seen compared to that at the steady state fig 2 the salt freshwater interface retreats to the ocean and the distance of intruded seawater decreases as shown in fig 9 a the intersection between the 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 isochlor and the aquifer bottom moves 15 25 m 16 83 m and 15 26 m along the aquifer bottom respectively after compressed air injection for 365 0 d from fig 9 b after the application of compressed air injection lasts for 365 0 d the mass of intruded seawater decreases from 3 43 105 kg to 2 61 105 kg by about 23 8 note that the mass of intruded seawater is obtained by adding the product of the mass of liquid phase and the salinity of each elements 3 3 changes in the air injection rate the air injection rate i e the air loss rate directly relates the operation cost of buildup of air barriers as shown in fig 10 the air injection rate increases gradually during compressed air injection and reaches about 0 021 kg s at 365 0 d note that its change rate varies in three stages 1 from 0 d to 7 1 d the change rate increases rapidly and tends to flatten 2 from 7 1 d to 14 5 d the change rate increases quickly again and later becomes stable 3 subsequently the change rate decreases slowly to a steady value of 2 63 10 5 d 1 this fact suggests that the air injection rate i e the operational and maintenance costs of air barriers cannot increase significantly with time fig 11 a shows the temporal variations of the mass flux of air outflow through the model top the landside and the seaside as can be seen few air flows out of the seaside while the magnitude of the rate of air outflow from the ground surface and the landside increase gradually after the generated airflow arrives to these two positions about 7 1 d this fact can also be found in fig 3 moreover the magnitude of the air outflow rate from the ground surface much greater than that from the landside accounts for up to 95 of the total air outflow indicating that the ground surface is the main exit of airflow using the method of compressed air injection for mitigating swi in the unconfined aquifer during the time period from 0 to 7 1 d compressed air continually enters into the aquifer while air hardly flows out of the model domain thereby causing the pore air pressure within the aquifer to increase rapidly fig 6 a likewise the hydraulic head within the aquifer increases correspondingly driven by the pressurized airflow fig 5 b d this period also corresponds to the first stage of the change rate of air injection rate after the air begins to escape out of the model domain the difference between the air injection rate and the air outflow rate decreases continually and especially the air outflow rate is greater than the injected rate after 60 0 d fig 11 a as a result the pore air pressure and hydraulic head within the aquifer declines gradually fig 6 a and fig 5 e g overall the magnitude of the maximum hydraulic head in the center of the hydraulic head contours reaches its maximum value when the generated airflow is about to flow out of the overlying unsaturated zone about 7 1 d and then decreases gradually from 7 1 d to 365 0 d that is the time when the generated airflow begins to escape out of the domain can be identified as a critical point that affects greatly the variations of fluid pressure within the aquifer and the magnitude of air injection rate therefore the variations of the transient distributions of fluid pressure and flow field are closely associated with the air injection rate near the injected region and the air outflow rate from the ground surface and the landside fig 11 b shows the temporal changes in the mass flux of water outflow from the ground surface the landside and the seaside the water outflow from the landside increases rapidly at first to a maximum value of 0 036 kg s at 9 4 d and then decreases to a steady value of 3 69 10 4 kg s at 365 0 d the water outflow from the seaside also varies in a similar way and its maximum and steady value reaches 0 016 kg s at 11 2 d and 7 18 10 4 kg s at 365 0 d respectively the diminution and delay of water outflow rate compared to that of the landside is caused by the difference of pressure between the left and right sides as well as the asymmetry of the decorate position of injection region in the horizontal direction unlike this variation tendency the water outflow from the ground surface begins at the time when the generated airflow reaches the model top and its magnitude increases immediately to a maximum value of 0 029 kg s and then decreases rapidly later slowly to a steady value of 1 03 10 4 kg s overall the outflow of water primarily occurs during the period from 0 0 to 90 0 d and the magnitude of water outflow velocity reaches basically a considerably smaller stable value at 365 0 d 3 4 comparison with the performance in the confined aquifer in order to compare the effectiveness of compressed air injection for mitigating swi in the unconfined aquifer with that in the confined aquifer henry s problem was used as a platform for investigating numerically the variations of the distributions of fluid pressure and saltwater concentration caused by the application of compressed air injection in the confined aquifer note that the distributions of salinity at the steady state free of air barriers in the saturated zone of the unconfined aquifer and the confined aquifer were considerably the same fig 1 and fig 2 furthermore for the transient simulation of compressed air injection in the confined aquifer i e the case with confined aquifer the grid discretization the settings of boundary conditions the injection region the applied air pressure and the duration were substantially the same with that of the aforementioned unconfined aquifer i e the case with unconfined aquifer apart from that the boundary condition at the top of the confined aquifer was specified as no flow fig 12 shows the distributions of fluid pressure and flow field within the confined aquifer at 365 0 d after compressed air injection as can be seen the pattern of the distributions of pore air pressure and hydraulic head motivated by compressed air injection in the confined aquifer is significantly different from that for the case with unconfined aquifer moreover the magnitude of fluid pressure at 365 0 d within the confined aquifer is higher than that within the unconfined aquifer especially in the upper region therefore it can be suggested that the boundary of the model top affects greatly the processes of fluid flow within the aquifer over the course of compressed air injection fig 13 compares the mass of intruded seawater and the air injection rate after compressed air injection for the case with confined aquifer and the case with unconfined aquifer the decrease in the mass of intruded seawater driven by compressed air injection in the confined aquifer is much greater than that for the case with unconfined aquifer on account of the higher fluid pressure and seaward water velocity over the confined aquifer fig 12 to be specific the reduction in the mass of intruded seawater in the confined aquifer reaches about 1 81 105 kg about 52 7 approximate 2 2 times that of the unconfined aquifer similarly the air injection rate for the case with confined aquifer its steady value at 365 0 d reaches about 0 016 kg s is lower than that for the case with unconfined aquifer given that the outflow of air is only from the landside and the seaside fig 12 a hence the efficiency of air barriers for controlling swi in the confined aquifer is greater than that in the unconfined aquifer that is the upper boundary plays an important role on the repulsion of saltwater and the operational cost with the application of compressed air injection for controlling swi 4 performance of compressed air injection under different conditions from the comparisons of the performance of air barriers for controlling swi between the cases with unconfined and confined aquifer the property of regions above the saturated zone affects not only the reduction in swi but also the magnitude of the air loss rate therefore the effectiveness of compressed air injection was assessed under different layout of the air barriers i e the applied air pressure and the horizontal location of air injection and under different settings of the overlying unsaturated zone including the permeability and the thickness 4 1 applied air pressure fig 14 shows the magnitude of air injection rate and the reduction in the intruded seawater at 365 0 d after compressed air injection with different applied air pressure note that the purple and blue dashed line represents the air injection rate and the decrease in intruded seawater at 365 0 d for the case with confined aquifer and the same below specifically with the applied pressure of 1000 kpa 1050 kpa and 1100 kpa the air injection rate at 365 0 d reaches about 0 021 kg s 0 026 kg s and 0 032 kg s respectively and the decrease in the intruded seawater achieves 23 9 32 3 and 38 7 respectively as the applied air pressure rises the pressure gradient between the injection region and the adjacent aquifer increases thereby causing more compressed air to be injected into the aquifer and the magnitude of fluid pressure within the aquifer to increase as well as a result the efficiency for repelling intruded seawater is heightened with a higher applied pressure while the operation cost of buildup of air barriers is increased correspondingly nevertheless the reduction in swi in the unconfined aquifer with a higher applied pressure does not achieve the level for the case with confined aquifer as well as the amount of air injection rate greatly exceeds that for the case with confined aquifer 4 2 horizontal location of the air injection fig 15 shows the distributions of saltwater concentration within the aquifer at 365 0 d after compressed air injection with different horizontal locations of injection x 60 0 m the landside of the toe of salt freshwater interface and x 100 0 m inside the saltwater wedge note that the height of injection zone and the applied air pressure remain unchanged as the injection region is located on whether the landside or seaside of the toe of saltwater wedge the salt freshwater interface is driven to retreat to the coast to different degrees with the application of compressed air injection distinguishingly the seawater mass fraction in liquid phase near the injection zone does not decrease to nearly 0 0 as the other two cases when the injection region is situated within the saltwater wedge the main cause of this fact is that the landward and seaward flow velocity of saltwater therein driven by the application of air injection declines greatly on account of the occurrence of unsaturated zone as well as the mass of liquid phase of adjacent elements decreases as shown in fig 16 when the distance from the inland decreases from 100 m to 60 m the air injection rate at 365 0 d increases slightly and the amplitude reaches only about 0 00067 kg s but the most of the reduction in intruded seawater at 365 0 d among the three cases is achieved as compressed air is injected near the toe of salt freshwater interface this phenomenon suggests that the repulsion of pressurized air for intruded seawater becomes relatively weaker with a greater distance from the saltwater wedge and the amount of reduction in intruded seawater driven by air injection also declines due to the smaller seaward water flow velocity caused by the unsaturated zone when the injection zone is above the saltwater wedge in addition both the air injection rate and the reduction in intruded seawater does not reach the level of the case with confined aquifer 4 3 permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone different intrinsic permeability values of the overlying unsaturated zone 1 543 10 12 m2 1 543 10 13 m2 1 543 10 14 m2 and 1 543 10 15 m2 were specified to investigate its effect on the availability of the method of compressed air injection for controlling swi within the unconfined aquifer the initial steady state free of air barriers and the transient simulation for compressed air injection with different permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone was regained and re conducted respectively using similar settings as the case with unconfined aquifer note that the distributions of salinity over the aquifer at the initial steady state are substantially the same under conditions of different permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone fig s3 as shown in fig 17 as the intrinsic permeability of overlying unsaturated zone decreases from 1 543 10 12 m2 to 1 543 10 15 m2 the air injection rate at 365 0 d declines from 0 021 kg s to 0 016 kg s and the reduction in intruded seawater increases from 23 9 to 53 2 this variation tendency indicates that the existence of an overlaying semipermeable layer in an unconfined aquifer system exhibits a blocking effect on the air loss and promotes the retreating of saltwater within the saltwater wedge to the ocean in addition with the permeability of overlying unsaturated zone decreasing both the magnitude of air injection rate and the amount of intruded seawater do not decrease indefinitely but tend to be stable verging on those for the case with confined aquifer therefore it can be concluded that the performance of air barriers for controlling swi in a confined aquifer including the quantity of repelling intruded seawater and the operation cost of air barriers can also be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient semipermeable layer 4 4 thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone different thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone 5 0 m 10 0 m 20 0 m 30 0 m 40 0 m and 50 0 m were selected to analyze its effect on the performance of air barriers for mitigating swi in the unconfined aquifer also the acquiring of the initial steady state free of air barriers and the transient simulation for compressed air injection were performed using similar settings as the case with unconfined aquifer it is expected that the initial steady state of the distributions of salinity within the aquifer are almost the same with different thickness of overlying unsaturated zones fig s4 from fig 18 as the thickness of overlying unsaturated zone increases from 5 0 m to 50 0 m the magnitude of air injection rate at 365 0 d decreases from 0 022 kg s to 0 018 kg s while the reduction in intruded seawater increases from 18 9 to 35 1 moreover the changes in these two variables attains essentially quasi steady when a 50 0 m thickness unsaturated zone is imposed to this aquifer therefore similar to the case with different permeability a greater thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone also enhances the environmental and economic performances of air barriers and its effect cannot increase indefinitely however the quasi steady values of air injection rate and reduction in intruded seawater in the unconfined aquifer with the thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone increasing do not reach the level for the case with confined aquifer hence the effect of the thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone for impeding the amount of air loss is lower that of its permeability 5 conclusions in this study the behaviors of groundwater flow and airflow as well as the saltwater wedge dynamics in a hypothetical and simplified unconfined aquifer after compressed air is injected into the aquifer was thoroughly investigated using a coupled water air two phase flow and saltwater transport model sequentially the availability of air barriers for mitigating swi in an unconfined aquifer was assessed in terms of the reduction in intruded seawater and the magnitude of air injection rate moreover the phenomenon of the dilution of seawater outside the exit boundary was considered in acquiring the capillarity gravity equilibrium and the steady state of salt freshwater distribution free of air barriers in the unconfined aquifer subsequently the variations of flow field and the reduction in intruded seawater induced by compressed air injection in a confined aquifer were analyzed to compare with that in the unconfined aquifer under similar conditions in addition the performance of air barriers in the unconfined aquifer was also explored under different layouts of the air barriers and different settings of the overlying unsaturated zone driven by compressed air injection which is located near the toe of saltwater wedge the distribution of hydraulic head over the unconfined aquifer is changed drastically and a hydraulic gradient towards the seaside is generated thereby causing the salt freshwater interface to retreat to the ocean meanwhile the air injection rate related to the operational and maintenance costs of air barriers cannot increase greatly over the course of compressed air injection given that its change rate declines gradually at the later stage additionally the escape of the produced airflow is primarily through the ground surface and the landside among which the magnitude of air outflow rate from the ground surface accounts for up to 95 of the total air outflow especially the variations of fluid pressure within the model domain are closely correlated with the difference between the air injection rate and the air outflow rate compared with the case in the confined aquifer under similar conditions the performance of air barriers for controlling swi in the unconfined aquifer including the reduction in intruded seawater and the air injection rate is inferior to that in the confined aquifer which suggests that the upper boundary of the model domain affects significantly the effectiveness of air barriers as the applied air pressure increases both the efficiency for repelling intruded seawater and the magnitude of air injection rate are enhanced hardly satisfying the economical requirements for controlling swi the horizontal location of air injection has a little effect on the magnitude of air injection rate whereas the most reduction in intruded seawater is attained as compressed air is injected near the toe of saltwater wedge with the permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone decreasing the reduction in intruded seawater increases and the magnitude of air injection rate decreases due to the blocking effect of the overlying layer and both them tend to be stable approximate to those of the case with confined aquifer likewise the performance of air barriers is also improved and becomes stable as the thickness of overlying unsaturated zone increases but the level of the quasi steady state for the case with different thickness of overlying unsaturated zone cannot achieve that for the case with confined aquifer overall the performance of air barriers for mitigating swi in the confined aquifer can also be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient semipermeable layer in field applications the performance of compressed air injection for mitigating swi in the coastal unconfined aquifer may present significantly different due to the complex geological features for instance the existence of dead end pore or geologic faults may impede the escape of generated airflow out of the influenced area and enhance the retreating of intruded seawater to the coast whereas the opposite behavior may appear when rock fracture or a highly permeable and anisotropy layer exists in the aquifer therefore additional laboratory experiments and field tests would be required in future research to explore the availability of compressed air injection for controlling swi in the realistic stratum in addition in a real three dimensional situation the air barrier for controlling swi inside the aquifer can be accomplished through a row of boreholes constructed parallel to the coast in which compressed air is permeated into the aquifer through a thin steel pipe at this circumstance the setting of the involved parameters of air barrier layout including the position and length of injection zone for each borehole the applied air pressure for each borehole and the distance between any two adjacent boreholes should consider simultaneously the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the aquifer and the environmental and economic performances as a result the simulation optimization coupled model with the minimum total cost as the objective function and with the amount of reduction in intruded saltwater or the salinity at a specific position as the constraint condition is required to determine the best parameter combination of the layout of the air barrier furthermore influenced by compressed air injection the effective stress adjacent to the injection zone would decrease due to the pore pressure herein increasing thereby causing the expansion of soil skeleton the phenomenon of geological loosening in turn disturbs or promotes the flow of fluids in porous medium and then affects the workability of pressurized air injection for mitigating swi that is the establishment of the coupled numerical model which considers simultaneously water air two phase flow and saltwater transport in porous medium as well as soil skeleton deformation is also worthy of further analysis credit authorship contribution statement yongge zang conceptualization methodology validation investigation formal analysis

4764,subsurface fluids injection is a viable alternative for controlling seawater intrusion in coastal regions and freshwater is usually served for valid fluids to generate pressure ridge towards the ocean but other fluids injection such as compressed air which presents clean and readily available is a more attractive solution for repulsing the intruded seawater where freshwater is insufficient in this study the performance of compressed air injection i e air barriers for mitigating seawater intrusion in a coastal unconfined aquifer was quantificationally assessed using a coupled water air two phase flow and saltwater transport model as compressed air is introduced into the aquifer at the toe of saltwater wedge the seaward hydraulic gradient adjacent to the coast is produced driven by the generated airflow thereby causing salt freshwater interface to retreat to the ocean the magnitude of air injection rate related to the operational cost of air barriers does not increases significantly given the progressively decreasing change rate compared to the workability of air barriers in the confined aquifer under similar conditions the reduction in intruded seawater at 365 0 d in the unconfined aquifer reaches only about 0 45 times that in the confined aquifer which indicates the significance of the boundary condition of aquifer top the sensitivity analysis of the overlying unsaturated zone reveals that with its permeability decreasing or its thickness increasing the performance of air barriers is enhanced owing to the blocking effect of the overlying layer on the escape of generated airflow and tends progressively to be stable particularly the efficacy of air barriers in the confined aquifer including the reduction in intruded seawater and the air injection rate also can be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient semipermeable layer keywords seawater intrusion control compressed air injection numerical simulation coastal unconfined aquifers water air two phase flow 1 introduction under natural undisturbed conditions density difference between seawater and freshwater and the engendered hydraulic gradient in coastal aquifers drives freshwater discharge toward the ocean and develops a saltwater wedge near the coast through the action of advection and hydrodynamic dispersion with the expected rise of sea level resulting from global warming and the excessive exploition of groundwater in coastal aquifers to meet the growing demands of freshwater the developed saltwater wedge may invade laterally further inland and contaminate the available groundwater supply werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013 lu et al 2013a 2013b 2015 i e the seawater intrusion swi thereby leading to several serious consequences with respect to both environmental and economic impacts in coastal regions werner 2010 werner et al 2013 shi and jiao 2014 effective and correction countermeasures are therefore considerably required to control or mitigate swi and to restore the coastal aquifers various methodologies have been proposed to attempt to control swi in past decades for instance the improvement in groundwater exploition patterns werner et al 2013 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 singh 2014 and the construction of subsurface physical or hydraulic barriers oude essink 2001 abarca et al 2006 botero acosta and donado 2015 the appropriate arrangement of pumping patterns in coastal regions is generally accomplished through searching the optimal abstraction strategies including rates and locations of pumping wells for multiple well systems considering simultaneously the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the aquifer and the local management structure hence numerous simulation optimization models have been applied in management swi in coastal aquifers among which the genetic algorithm optimization technique is used widely given its superior performance in identification optimal solutions mantoglou and papantoniou 2008 the vertically impermeable or semi permeable walls constructed parallel to the coast i e the subsurface physical barriers can also impede the inland motion of saltwater and have been successfully implemented in japan china india the middle east and african countries janardhana raju et al 2013 stevanović 2016 this barrier consists of two types the subsurface dams and the cutoff walls it has been demonstrated that the performance of physical barrier depends on the height or the penetration depth the distance from the coast and the relative conductivity of the barrier as well as the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy the ratio of the groundwater inflow velocity over the density driven saltwater velocity of the aquifer luyun et al 2009 2011 kaleris and ziogas 2013 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 chang et al 2019 furthermore abdoulhalik et al 2017 using experimental test and numerical model showed that the mixed physical barrier combining an impermeable cutoff wall and a semi permeable dam yielded up to 62 and 42 more saltwater intrusion reduction than the dam and the cutoff wall respectively and proposed the saltwater lifting mechanism to account for this phenomenon given that the imbalance of hydraulic gradient between the inland and the ocean is the primary inducement to cause the occurrence of swi it may be expectedly valid for controlling swi through receding the landward gradient inside the saltwater wedge i e the negative hydraulic barrier or enhancing the seaward gradient inland i e the positive hydraulic barrier negative hydraulic barriers are generally created by continuously abstracting brackish or saline water near the coast and thus brings down the piezometric head here thereby intercepting the inland moving of saltwater and restoring the aquifer todd 1980 kacimov et al 2009 masciopinto 2013 this process may lead to extracting more freshwater than saltwater from pumping wells consequently exacerbating the scarcity of available groundwater resources sherif and hamza 2001 aimed at this problem pool and carrera 2010 proposed a double pumping barrier system an inland well pumping freshwater and a seaward well pumping saltwater and this design has an efficient role in repulsion the invasive saltwater in early stages while a critical pumping rate of saltwater well is required in long term stages positive hydraulic barrier are usually developed by injecting high quality water into the coastal aquifers through infiltration pond only for an unconfined aquifer or injection wells mahesha and nagaraja 1996 mahesha 1996 thereby creating a freshwater ridge that prevents saltwater from invading inland lu et al 2017 compared the effectiveness of well injection and pond infiltration for mitigating swi in an unconfined aquifer using the analytical method and concluded that their performances are basically the same given the circular pond but the maximum net extraction rate increases greatly with the ratio of the semiaxes of the perpendicular to the parallel to the coast when the elliptic pond is applied this methodology of positive barriers is suggested to be among the most widely used techniques for controlling swi in coastal areas hussain et al 2019 moreover lu et al 2013 through analytical solutions showed that the injection of freshwater located between the toe of saltwater wedge and the pumping wells can increase the net extraction rate of pumping wells by 50 compared to the case of traditional single extraction wells nevertheless the supply of water that is available for injection into the aquifer is among the major limitation of this method in dry years and in regions that suffer from scarcity of water abd elhamid and javadi 2011 to achieve this purpose of enhancing the piezometric head inland where groundwater resource is limited other fluids instead of freshwater can also be introduced into the aquifer through the installed boreholes the subsurface fluids injection has been widely used in many geo environmental situations for various purposes such as enhancing oil production reserving valuable gas or oil arresting land subsidence disposing of contaminants and hazardous wastes tunnel construction and other applications selvadurai 2006 wong and lau 2008 teatini et al 2011 chinkulkijniwat et al 2014 among the available injected fluids compressed air as a clean fluid cannot bring a secondary contamination to the originally aquifer for the first time dror et al 2004 examined air barriers as an alternative of hydraulic barriers to impede saltwater invading through laboratory experiments hereafter sun and semprich 2013 used numerical model to explore the workability of compressed air injection for controlling swi in a confined aquifer and found that seawater is ejected from the aquifer and the seawater circulation disappears with the action of pressurized air for a coastal unconfined aquifer conceptually the injected air may escape out of the aquifer through the overlying unsaturated zones consequently causing the lower seaward pressure gradient insufficient for repulsion swi and the enormous air loss rate i e the operation cost of this approach however to the best of our knowledge it is not explicit by far what the physical process with respect to water flow airflow saltwater transport and their interactions in the unconfined aquifer driven by compressed air injection is whether this methodology for controlling swi is applicative in a coastal unconfined aquifer in terms of the environmental i e the reduction in invasive saltwater and economic i e the air loss rate performances or not and what the feasible condition is therefore in this study the performance of compressed air injection for controlling swi and the involved physical processes within an unconfined aquifer is numerically assessed and investigated through a coupled water air two phase flow and saltwater transport numerical model this numerical model describes the transformation and dissolution between the liquid phase and gas phase as well as saltwater transport in variable saturated and variable density porous media the indicators the distance of different isolines from the seaside the mass of intruded seawater and the air injection rate relating to the operation cost of air barriers were used thereafter comparisons of the reduction in saltwater intrusion and the magnitude of air injection rate induced by air injection were made for cases in the unconfined and confined aquifer furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the dependency of the effectiveness of the compressed air barrier on some parameters of the air barrier layout and the overlaying unsaturated zones and then the conditions under which the application of air injection is expected to be more applicative in repulsion the invasive saltwater were analyzed 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations the mass balance equations describing these processes with regard to water air two phase flow and saltwater transport under isothermal conditions in saturated unsaturated porous medium can be written as pruess et al 1999 1 m κ t d i v f adv κ f diff κ q κ where m κ is the total mass of component κ and three components freshwater w brine b and air a were considered in coastal groundwater systems including the unsaturated and saturated zones f adv κ and f diff κ are the advective and diffusive mass flux vector of component κ respectively q κ is the sink source term of component κ m κ is obtained by summing over the phases β liquid l and gas g phase where the liquid phase l includes freshwater brine and dissolved air and the gas phase g includes air and water vapor its general form

modeling of fluid flow and saltwater transport processes this simulator will recognize automatically the primary variables p β x b the seawater mass fraction in the liquid phase and x β a under single phase conditions while p g x b and s g 10 under two phase conditions in the following section an in situ air flow test carrier out by kramer and semprich kramer and semprich 1989 and the henry s problem was employed to inspected the reliability and veracity of the tough2 eos7 simulator in describing the interactions between the liquid and gas phase in porous media induced by air injection as well as the processes of water flow and saltwater transport with respect to swi in the aquifer respectively 2 2 in situ air flow test the in situ air flow test was conducted to explore the behavior of the outcropping types of essen soils before the subway construction using compressed air technique in essen germany kramer and semprich 1989 note that this field test does not involve the processes of saltwater transport in the air flow test pressurized air was introduced into the stratum through the zone 18 0 m to 21 0 m below the ground surface and the applied air pressure was increased stepwise by the compressor δ p 61 kpa from 0 h to 0 93 h δ p 78 kpa from 0 93 h to 1 87 h δ p 119 kpa from 1 87 h to 2 8 h δ p 160 kpa from 2 8 h to 27 h the soil profile in this test was divided into the four distinct layers fig s1 a fill layer a thick silt layer a thin permeable sand layer and a thick marl layer the groundwater table is approximately 4 75 m below the ground surface several piezometers and flow meter were adopted to measure the variations of pore pressure at different locations fig s1 and table s1 and the air injection rate during the test considering the axial symmetry of this air flow test only one fourth of the domain around the injection zone was simulated in this study the schematic of soil profile at y 0 0 m in this simulation is shown in fig s1 the model domain was set to be 100 0 m long in both the transverse and longitudinal direction to eliminate the lateral boundary effects and 25 0 m high in the vertical direction the capillary pressure and the relative permeability dependent on the liquid saturation were described by the vg and vg m model respectively which were expressed as eqs 5 through 7 corey 1954 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the involved hydraulic parameters of four soil layers listed in table s2 were taken from öttl öttl 2003 note that intrinsic permeability of the sand and marl layer were adjusted in this study given that the sand layer contains a considerable portion of silt and the marl layer presents high anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical soil permeability 5 p c p 0 s 1 λ 1 1 λ p max p c 0 where p 0 is the air entry pressure λ is a model parameter associated with the degree of soil uniformity s is the effective liquid saturation s s l s lr s ls s lr s l is the liquid saturation s lr is the residual liquid saturation and s ls is the saturated liquid saturation 6 k rl s 1 1 s 1 λ λ 2 s l s ls 1 s l s ls 7 k rg 1 k rl s gr 0 1 s 2 1 s 2 s gr 0 where k rl k rg is the relative permeability of liquid phase and gas phase respectively s s l s lr 1 s lr s gr and s gr is the residual gas saturation in the numerical simulation for air injection the capillarity gravity equilibrium was used as the initial state the atmospheric boundary conditions p g p atm the atmospheric pressure p atm is 1 013 105 pa x b 0 0 and x g a 0 999 were applied at the ground surface the dirichlet boundary conditions p l p atm 20 25 ρ f g x b 0 0 and x l a 1 0 10 10 were imposed at the bottom of domain where the freshwater density ρ f is 1000 kg m3 the gravitational acceleration g is 9 81 m s2 the property and volume of the elements within the air injection regions were set as free moving and infinite and their primary variables were as follows p g p atm δ p x b 0 0 and x g a 0 999 no flow boundaries were considered at the remaining boundary the distributions of pore air pressure at profile y 0 0 m as well as the measured and simulated pore air pressure at observation points ① ④ at 27 0 h is shown in fig s1 and table s1 respectively the pore air pressure near the injection region increases driven by air injection and the simulated pore air pressure at points ① ④ agree well with the measure results fig s2 shows the temporal changes of measured and simulated air injection rate during the test the mass flux of air kg s injected into the soil interior can be obtained through adding the flux of gas phase between the injection elements and the adjacent soil elements which is calculated by the numerical model on the basis of the gas phase pressure temperature and the ideal gas law as can be seen the simulated rate is substantially consistent with the measured rate before 21 h moreover few air penetrates into the stratum before 2 8 h due to the applied air pressure insufficient for overcoming the air entry value of the marl and the groundwater pressure after 21 h the measured air injection rate increased significantly due to the existence of fractures in the field test however the medium was assumed to be porous media in the numerical simulation thereby producing the discrepancy between the simulated and measured rates in conclusion the tough2 eos7 simulator can be used to describe accurately the interaction processes between the liquid and gas phases driven by air injection in porous medium 2 3 henry s problem the henry s problem describes the processes of swi into a coastal confined aquifer and was treated as a two dimension problem the aquifer was simplified as a cross section perpendicular to the coast and parallel to the steady flow path inside the aquifer which is presented schematically in fig 1 the selected parameters and dimensions in this study are consistent with those cases solved numerically by other researchers segol et al 1975 frind 1982 huyakorn et al 1987 liu et al 2001 hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 a constant freshwater influx of 0 0066 m d was imposed on the landside a hydrostatic pressure boundary condition p l p atm ρ s g h sl z and x l a 1 0 10 10 was exposed on the seaside where seawater density ρ s is 1025 kg m3 h sl is the elevation of sea level with the model bottom as the datum and z is the vertical coordinate within the domain given the dilution of seawater outside the exit boundary the saltwater concentration on the seaside boundary was modified to allow convective mass transport out of the system over the top portion of the seaside boundary in previous studies frind 1982 huyakorn et al 1987 liu et al 2001 hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 x b 1 0 for 0 0 z 0 and x b x 0 for z 0 100 0 in the vertical direction it is worth noting that the determination of the z 0 value was vague and was specified provisionally as 80 0 m by some previous studies hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 liu et al 2001 in this study the value of z 0 was achieved iteratively by modifying the source code of tough2 eos7 as follows the horizontal direction of water flow on the seaside is judged every time step at first then if groundwater flows out of the aquifer the concentration boundary is set to be x b x 0 otherwise the concentration boundary is set to be x b 1 0 the initial conditions were set to be freshwater filled over the entire domain the steady state of salt freshwater distribution inside the aquifer was obtained by performing transient analysis for a sufficiently long simulation time as can be seen from fig 1 the 0 5 isochlor distribution at the steady state calculated by the tough2 eos7 simulator is substantially consistent with those from previous studies segol et al 1975 frind 1982 huyakorn et al 1987 liu et al 2001 hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 and the intersection of 0 5 isochlor with the seaside reaches about 70 6 m close to the preset value of 80 0 m in previous studies hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 therefore the improvement of the tough2 eos7 source code in this study is capable of describing the fact of the dilution of seawater outside the exit boundary and the numerical model can be used to obtain the steady state of salt freshwater distribution within the aquifer for a more general swi problem 2 4 model descriptions and numerical methods a two dimension and vertical cross shore unconfined aquifer modified on the basis of that of henry s problem i e adding a 10 0 m thick layer vertically shown in fig 2 was used to assess the performance of air barriers for controlling swi in a coastal unconfined aquifer in this study the unconfined aquifer was also assumed homogenous and isotropic that is some complex geological factors such as geologic faults dead end pore rock fracture a highly permeable and anisotropy layer which may be in favor of the accumulation of generated airflow or promote the escape of airflow from the macro pores in soils could not be taken into account in this study the involved unsaturated hydraulic parameters were assigned by reference to those of sandy loam given the intrinsic permeability of the soil used in this study is close to that of sandy loam carsel and parrish 1988 and are listed in table 1 the other parameters were accordant with that of the henry s problem the capillarity gravity equilibrium and the steady state of salt freshwater distribution free of air barriers within the unconfined aquifer was firstly obtained the setting of initial and boundary conditions in this simulation were in accord with that of the henry s problem except that the lateral boundary above 100 0 m and the ground surface were imposed by the atmospheric boundary p g p atm x b 0 0 and x g a 0 999 the steady state of the distributions of groundwater flow and saltwater concentration within the unconfined aquifer is shown in fig 2 as can be seen seawater enters into the aquifer along the aquifer bottom and exits out of the upper part of the seaside driven by the inland hydraulic gradient thus forming a salt freshwater circulation the elevation of groundwater level on the landside reaches about 102 5 m 2 5 m higher than the sea level and the generated seaward hydraulic gradient attains 0 0125 which is within the range of gradients commonly used in previous studies chang and clement 2012 abdoulhalik et al 2017 especially the distribution of 0 5 isochlor in the unconfined aquifer is substantially the same with that of the henry s problem from fig 2 the intersection of 0 05 isochlor with the aquifer bottom at the steady state reaches about x 83 9 m which was assumed to be the toe of salt freshwater interface and the air injection well should be placed in this position or its landside referring to sun and semprich 2013 the zone 79 0 m x 80 0 m 0 0 m z 15 0 m was selected to introduce pressurized air in this study note that the vertical position and length of the injection region may affect the performance of air barriers for mitigating swi but the common processes with respect to the behaviors of groundwater flow and airflow as well as the saltwater wedge dynamics with the action of air injection in the unconfined aquifer can be captured and described on this configuration in order to reveal accurately the horizontal position of injection well the discretization of the aquifer was refined and the horizontal mesh size adjacent to the injection zone ranged from 1 0 m to 2 0 m meanwhile given that the applied air pressure should not be lower than the maximum groundwater pressure within the injection zone about 975 5 kpa to ensure compressed air permeating into the aquifer the air pressure applied in this case was set to be 1000 kpa in the transient state simulation for compressed air injection the steady state for capillarity gravity and salinity free of barrier was used as the initial condition the duration of air injection was 365 0 d the landside below the groundwater level was represented by the dirichlet boundary condition p l p atm ρ f g 102 5 z x b 0 0 and x l a 1 0 10 10 the seaside boundary below the sea level was also described by the dirichlet boundary condition regardless of the dilution of seawater due to the short simulation time p l p atm ρ s g h sl z x b steady and x l a 1 0 10 10 where x b steady is the value of seawater mass fraction at the initial steady state the setting of the elements within the air injection regions is similar to that in the in situ air flow test the remaining boundary conditions remained the same as for the steady state conditions five observation points a e fig 2 considering the location of air injection and the motion path of generated airflow within the aquifer were selected to capture the temporal variations of relevant variables within the model domain over the course of compressed air injection and their coordinates are listed in table 2 3 analysis and discussion of the simulation results 3 1 changes in the fluid pressure and flow field fig 3 shows the distributions of pore air pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure and airflow within the model domain at different times after compressed air injection as compressed air is injected into the aquifer air flows upwardly and laterally due to its smaller density and the surrounding pressure gradient of gas phase thereby causing the pore air pressure near and above the injection regions to increase that is the position and length of injection zone may alter the migration path of airflow and the distributions of pore air pressure within the model domain thereby affecting the workability of air barriers for repulsing the intruded seawater at 7 0 d the upward airflow transports to the overlying unsaturated zones and escapes out of the ground surface thereafter the generated airflow gathers around the model top and spreads laterally it is observed that the outflow of compressed air is primarily through the top of model domain and the upper part of landside fig 3 f consequently as shown in fig 4 a bulb shaped desaturated zone within the aquifer is formed and expands upward gradually until it is connected to the upper unsaturated zones fig 4 a c hereafter the range of unsaturated zone within the whole system extends to the landside and seaside developing an approximate fan pattern fig 4 e f fig 5 shows the equivalent freshwater hydraulic head and groundwater flow within the model domain at the steady state before compressed air injection and at different times after compressed air injection note that the hydraulic head is defined as h z p l ρ f g where p l is the pore water pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure and the same below at 1 0 d driven by the generated airflow the shape of hydraulic head contours changes significantly compared to that at the initial steady state fig 5 a and presents an arc shape around the injection region thereby forming a pressure gradient towards the ground surface the landside and the seaside as a result groundwater flows landward at the left side of injection region and flows seaward at the other side that is with the action of pressurized airflow from the injection zone saltwater distributed over the salt freshwater interface is pushed towards the ocean therefore it can be suggested that even the air barrier does not completely penetrate the entire aquifer the seaward hydraulic gradient adjacent can be produced as long as the applied air pressure exceeds a certain threshold subsequently the center of hydraulic head contours moves upward with time and the magnitude of the maximum hydraulic head increases accordingly however when airflow can flow out of the ground surface 7 0 d the reverse phenomenon appears at 365 0 d the maximum hydraulic head and the maximum seaward water velocity within the aquifer reaches about 118 9 m and 6 08 10 4 m s respectively moreover the crossover between the line of zero horizontal water velocity and the aquifer bottom migrates to the position of x 134 5 m moving seaward by 45 0 m compared to that of the steady state therefore it is proven again that the air injection wells should be laid at the front edge of salt freshwater interface otherwise influenced by the action of air injection saltwater might be driven landward to the aquifer fig 6 depicts the changes in the pore air pressure and liquid saturation with time after compressed air injection at points a e the pore air pressure at these points varies in a similar way increasing rapidly to a maximum value firstly then decreasing quickly before decreasing slowly until a quasi steady value is reached from points a c the same horizontal coordinates and points c e the same vertical coordinates the maximum and steady value of pore air pressure decreases with the distance from the injection region additionally the liquid saturation of points a e reduces in order and the diminution begins at about 1 31 d 3 79 d 6 33 d 10 78 d and 13 39 d respectively this phenomenon also demonstrates that the generated airflow driven by air injection moves upward at first and then spreads laterally in particular given that the greater pressure gradient and the atmospheric boundary at the landside the time when the liquid saturation begins to decrease at point d is earlier than that at point e fig 7 shows the time evolution of water velocity and air velocity at points f and g points f and g is located in the upper unsaturated zones caused by the propagating airflow and the lower saturated zones respectively fig 4 f and their detailed coordinates are presented in table 2 note that a positive vertical and horizontal velocity in this figure represents air or water flowing upward and seaward respectively from fig 7 a the generated airflow reaches point f at about 14 6 d before that driven by the application of compressed air injection the magnitude of seaward water velocity increases rapidly whereas the value of upward water velocity increases firstly and then decreases given the center of hydraulic head contours moving continually fig 5 after that the state of point f becomes unsaturated and water therein is displaced by air consequently both the horizontal and vertical water velocity decreases and recovers gradually to zero conversely air always flows seaward and upward over the whole simulation time and its velocity increases progressively at 365 0 d the vertical and horizontal air velocity reaches about 1 31 10 3 m s and 6 08 10 4 m s respectively from fig 7 b the state of point g remains always liquid saturated during compressed air injection driven by the generated airflow the value of seaward horizontal water velocity increases firstly and then decreases to a steady value of 1 81 10 7 m s whereas the water flow vertically flows upward firstly and then downward and at 365 0 d the water vertically flows upward and its velocity achieved 1 81 10 7 m s from the temporal changes in relevant variables at these observation points their value tends progressively to be stable and particularly the magnitude of the velocity of water flow at 365 0 d is considerably small this variation suggests that the model domain reaches basically a steady state 3 2 changes in the saltwater concentration fig 8 shows the distributions of saltwater concentration at 365 0 d and of 0 5 isochlor at different times within the aquifer after compressed air injection as can be seen compared to that at the steady state fig 2 the salt freshwater interface retreats to the ocean and the distance of intruded seawater decreases as shown in fig 9 a the intersection between the 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 isochlor and the aquifer bottom moves 15 25 m 16 83 m and 15 26 m along the aquifer bottom respectively after compressed air injection for 365 0 d from fig 9 b after the application of compressed air injection lasts for 365 0 d the mass of intruded seawater decreases from 3 43 105 kg to 2 61 105 kg by about 23 8 note that the mass of intruded seawater is obtained by adding the product of the mass of liquid phase and the salinity of each elements 3 3 changes in the air injection rate the air injection rate i e the air loss rate directly relates the operation cost of buildup of air barriers as shown in fig 10 the air injection rate increases gradually during compressed air injection and reaches about 0 021 kg s at 365 0 d note that its change rate varies in three stages 1 from 0 d to 7 1 d the change rate increases rapidly and tends to flatten 2 from 7 1 d to 14 5 d the change rate increases quickly again and later becomes stable 3 subsequently the change rate decreases slowly to a steady value of 2 63 10 5 d 1 this fact suggests that the air injection rate i e the operational and maintenance costs of air barriers cannot increase significantly with time fig 11 a shows the temporal variations of the mass flux of air outflow through the model top the landside and the seaside as can be seen few air flows out of the seaside while the magnitude of the rate of air outflow from the ground surface and the landside increase gradually after the generated airflow arrives to these two positions about 7 1 d this fact can also be found in fig 3 moreover the magnitude of the air outflow rate from the ground surface much greater than that from the landside accounts for up to 95 of the total air outflow indicating that the ground surface is the main exit of airflow using the method of compressed air injection for mitigating swi in the unconfined aquifer during the time period from 0 to 7 1 d compressed air continually enters into the aquifer while air hardly flows out of the model domain thereby causing the pore air pressure within the aquifer to increase rapidly fig 6 a likewise the hydraulic head within the aquifer increases correspondingly driven by the pressurized airflow fig 5 b d this period also corresponds to the first stage of the change rate of air injection rate after the air begins to escape out of the model domain the difference between the air injection rate and the air outflow rate decreases continually and especially the air outflow rate is greater than the injected rate after 60 0 d fig 11 a as a result the pore air pressure and hydraulic head within the aquifer declines gradually fig 6 a and fig 5 e g overall the magnitude of the maximum hydraulic head in the center of the hydraulic head contours reaches its maximum value when the generated airflow is about to flow out of the overlying unsaturated zone about 7 1 d and then decreases gradually from 7 1 d to 365 0 d that is the time when the generated airflow begins to escape out of the domain can be identified as a critical point that affects greatly the variations of fluid pressure within the aquifer and the magnitude of air injection rate therefore the variations of the transient distributions of fluid pressure and flow field are closely associated with the air injection rate near the injected region and the air outflow rate from the ground surface and the landside fig 11 b shows the temporal changes in the mass flux of water outflow from the ground surface the landside and the seaside the water outflow from the landside increases rapidly at first to a maximum value of 0 036 kg s at 9 4 d and then decreases to a steady value of 3 69 10 4 kg s at 365 0 d the water outflow from the seaside also varies in a similar way and its maximum and steady value reaches 0 016 kg s at 11 2 d and 7 18 10 4 kg s at 365 0 d respectively the diminution and delay of water outflow rate compared to that of the landside is caused by the difference of pressure between the left and right sides as well as the asymmetry of the decorate position of injection region in the horizontal direction unlike this variation tendency the water outflow from the ground surface begins at the time when the generated airflow reaches the model top and its magnitude increases immediately to a maximum value of 0 029 kg s and then decreases rapidly later slowly to a steady value of 1 03 10 4 kg s overall the outflow of water primarily occurs during the period from 0 0 to 90 0 d and the magnitude of water outflow velocity reaches basically a considerably smaller stable value at 365 0 d 3 4 comparison with the performance in the confined aquifer in order to compare the effectiveness of compressed air injection for mitigating swi in the unconfined aquifer with that in the confined aquifer henry s problem was used as a platform for investigating numerically the variations of the distributions of fluid pressure and saltwater concentration caused by the application of compressed air injection in the confined aquifer note that the distributions of salinity at the steady state free of air barriers in the saturated zone of the unconfined aquifer and the confined aquifer were considerably the same fig 1 and fig 2 furthermore for the transient simulation of compressed air injection in the confined aquifer i e the case with confined aquifer the grid discretization the settings of boundary conditions the injection region the applied air pressure and the duration were substantially the same with that of the aforementioned unconfined aquifer i e the case with unconfined aquifer apart from that the boundary condition at the top of the confined aquifer was specified as no flow fig 12 shows the distributions of fluid pressure and flow field within the confined aquifer at 365 0 d after compressed air injection as can be seen the pattern of the distributions of pore air pressure and hydraulic head motivated by compressed air injection in the confined aquifer is significantly different from that for the case with unconfined aquifer moreover the magnitude of fluid pressure at 365 0 d within the confined aquifer is higher than that within the unconfined aquifer especially in the upper region therefore it can be suggested that the boundary of the model top affects greatly the processes of fluid flow within the aquifer over the course of compressed air injection fig 13 compares the mass of intruded seawater and the air injection rate after compressed air injection for the case with confined aquifer and the case with unconfined aquifer the decrease in the mass of intruded seawater driven by compressed air injection in the confined aquifer is much greater than that for the case with unconfined aquifer on account of the higher fluid pressure and seaward water velocity over the confined aquifer fig 12 to be specific the reduction in the mass of intruded seawater in the confined aquifer reaches about 1 81 105 kg about 52 7 approximate 2 2 times that of the unconfined aquifer similarly the air injection rate for the case with confined aquifer its steady value at 365 0 d reaches about 0 016 kg s is lower than that for the case with unconfined aquifer given that the outflow of air is only from the landside and the seaside fig 12 a hence the efficiency of air barriers for controlling swi in the confined aquifer is greater than that in the unconfined aquifer that is the upper boundary plays an important role on the repulsion of saltwater and the operational cost with the application of compressed air injection for controlling swi 4 performance of compressed air injection under different conditions from the comparisons of the performance of air barriers for controlling swi between the cases with unconfined and confined aquifer the property of regions above the saturated zone affects not only the reduction in swi but also the magnitude of the air loss rate therefore the effectiveness of compressed air injection was assessed under different layout of the air barriers i e the applied air pressure and the horizontal location of air injection and under different settings of the overlying unsaturated zone including the permeability and the thickness 4 1 applied air pressure fig 14 shows the magnitude of air injection rate and the reduction in the intruded seawater at 365 0 d after compressed air injection with different applied air pressure note that the purple and blue dashed line represents the air injection rate and the decrease in intruded seawater at 365 0 d for the case with confined aquifer and the same below specifically with the applied pressure of 1000 kpa 1050 kpa and 1100 kpa the air injection rate at 365 0 d reaches about 0 021 kg s 0 026 kg s and 0 032 kg s respectively and the decrease in the intruded seawater achieves 23 9 32 3 and 38 7 respectively as the applied air pressure rises the pressure gradient between the injection region and the adjacent aquifer increases thereby causing more compressed air to be injected into the aquifer and the magnitude of fluid pressure within the aquifer to increase as well as a result the efficiency for repelling intruded seawater is heightened with a higher applied pressure while the operation cost of buildup of air barriers is increased correspondingly nevertheless the reduction in swi in the unconfined aquifer with a higher applied pressure does not achieve the level for the case with confined aquifer as well as the amount of air injection rate greatly exceeds that for the case with confined aquifer 4 2 horizontal location of the air injection fig 15 shows the distributions of saltwater concentration within the aquifer at 365 0 d after compressed air injection with different horizontal locations of injection x 60 0 m the landside of the toe of salt freshwater interface and x 100 0 m inside the saltwater wedge note that the height of injection zone and the applied air pressure remain unchanged as the injection region is located on whether the landside or seaside of the toe of saltwater wedge the salt freshwater interface is driven to retreat to the coast to different degrees with the application of compressed air injection distinguishingly the seawater mass fraction in liquid phase near the injection zone does not decrease to nearly 0 0 as the other two cases when the injection region is situated within the saltwater wedge the main cause of this fact is that the landward and seaward flow velocity of saltwater therein driven by the application of air injection declines greatly on account of the occurrence of unsaturated zone as well as the mass of liquid phase of adjacent elements decreases as shown in fig 16 when the distance from the inland decreases from 100 m to 60 m the air injection rate at 365 0 d increases slightly and the amplitude reaches only about 0 00067 kg s but the most of the reduction in intruded seawater at 365 0 d among the three cases is achieved as compressed air is injected near the toe of salt freshwater interface this phenomenon suggests that the repulsion of pressurized air for intruded seawater becomes relatively weaker with a greater distance from the saltwater wedge and the amount of reduction in intruded seawater driven by air injection also declines due to the smaller seaward water flow velocity caused by the unsaturated zone when the injection zone is above the saltwater wedge in addition both the air injection rate and the reduction in intruded seawater does not reach the level of the case with confined aquifer 4 3 permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone different intrinsic permeability values of the overlying unsaturated zone 1 543 10 12 m2 1 543 10 13 m2 1 543 10 14 m2 and 1 543 10 15 m2 were specified to investigate its effect on the availability of the method of compressed air injection for controlling swi within the unconfined aquifer the initial steady state free of air barriers and the transient simulation for compressed air injection with different permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone was regained and re conducted respectively using similar settings as the case with unconfined aquifer note that the distributions of salinity over the aquifer at the initial steady state are substantially the same under conditions of different permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone fig s3 as shown in fig 17 as the intrinsic permeability of overlying unsaturated zone decreases from 1 543 10 12 m2 to 1 543 10 15 m2 the air injection rate at 365 0 d declines from 0 021 kg s to 0 016 kg s and the reduction in intruded seawater increases from 23 9 to 53 2 this variation tendency indicates that the existence of an overlaying semipermeable layer in an unconfined aquifer system exhibits a blocking effect on the air loss and promotes the retreating of saltwater within the saltwater wedge to the ocean in addition with the permeability of overlying unsaturated zone decreasing both the magnitude of air injection rate and the amount of intruded seawater do not decrease indefinitely but tend to be stable verging on those for the case with confined aquifer therefore it can be concluded that the performance of air barriers for controlling swi in a confined aquifer including the quantity of repelling intruded seawater and the operation cost of air barriers can also be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient semipermeable layer 4 4 thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone different thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone 5 0 m 10 0 m 20 0 m 30 0 m 40 0 m and 50 0 m were selected to analyze its effect on the performance of air barriers for mitigating swi in the unconfined aquifer also the acquiring of the initial steady state free of air barriers and the transient simulation for compressed air injection were performed using similar settings as the case with unconfined aquifer it is expected that the initial steady state of the distributions of salinity within the aquifer are almost the same with different thickness of overlying unsaturated zones fig s4 from fig 18 as the thickness of overlying unsaturated zone increases from 5 0 m to 50 0 m the magnitude of air injection rate at 365 0 d decreases from 0 022 kg s to 0 018 kg s while the reduction in intruded seawater increases from 18 9 to 35 1 moreover the changes in these two variables attains essentially quasi steady when a 50 0 m thickness unsaturated zone is imposed to this aquifer therefore similar to the case with different permeability a greater thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone also enhances the environmental and economic performances of air barriers and its effect cannot increase indefinitely however the quasi steady values of air injection rate and reduction in intruded seawater in the unconfined aquifer with the thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone increasing do not reach the level for the case with confined aquifer hence the effect of the thickness of the overlying unsaturated zone for impeding the amount of air loss is lower that of its permeability 5 conclusions in this study the behaviors of groundwater flow and airflow as well as the saltwater wedge dynamics in a hypothetical and simplified unconfined aquifer after compressed air is injected into the aquifer was thoroughly investigated using a coupled water air two phase flow and saltwater transport model sequentially the availability of air barriers for mitigating swi in an unconfined aquifer was assessed in terms of the reduction in intruded seawater and the magnitude of air injection rate moreover the phenomenon of the dilution of seawater outside the exit boundary was considered in acquiring the capillarity gravity equilibrium and the steady state of salt freshwater distribution free of air barriers in the unconfined aquifer subsequently the variations of flow field and the reduction in intruded seawater induced by compressed air injection in a confined aquifer were analyzed to compare with that in the unconfined aquifer under similar conditions in addition the performance of air barriers in the unconfined aquifer was also explored under different layouts of the air barriers and different settings of the overlying unsaturated zone driven by compressed air injection which is located near the toe of saltwater wedge the distribution of hydraulic head over the unconfined aquifer is changed drastically and a hydraulic gradient towards the seaside is generated thereby causing the salt freshwater interface to retreat to the ocean meanwhile the air injection rate related to the operational and maintenance costs of air barriers cannot increase greatly over the course of compressed air injection given that its change rate declines gradually at the later stage additionally the escape of the produced airflow is primarily through the ground surface and the landside among which the magnitude of air outflow rate from the ground surface accounts for up to 95 of the total air outflow especially the variations of fluid pressure within the model domain are closely correlated with the difference between the air injection rate and the air outflow rate compared with the case in the confined aquifer under similar conditions the performance of air barriers for controlling swi in the unconfined aquifer including the reduction in intruded seawater and the air injection rate is inferior to that in the confined aquifer which suggests that the upper boundary of the model domain affects significantly the effectiveness of air barriers as the applied air pressure increases both the efficiency for repelling intruded seawater and the magnitude of air injection rate are enhanced hardly satisfying the economical requirements for controlling swi the horizontal location of air injection has a little effect on the magnitude of air injection rate whereas the most reduction in intruded seawater is attained as compressed air is injected near the toe of saltwater wedge with the permeability of the overlying unsaturated zone decreasing the reduction in intruded seawater increases and the magnitude of air injection rate decreases due to the blocking effect of the overlying layer and both them tend to be stable approximate to those of the case with confined aquifer likewise the performance of air barriers is also improved and becomes stable as the thickness of overlying unsaturated zone increases but the level of the quasi steady state for the case with different thickness of overlying unsaturated zone cannot achieve that for the case with confined aquifer overall the performance of air barriers for mitigating swi in the confined aquifer can also be achieved in an unconfined aquifer with an overlaying sufficient semipermeable layer in field applications the performance of compressed air injection for mitigating swi in the coastal unconfined aquifer may present significantly different due to the complex geological features for instance the existence of dead end pore or geologic faults may impede the escape of generated airflow out of the influenced area and enhance the retreating of intruded seawater to the coast whereas the opposite behavior may appear when rock fracture or a highly permeable and anisotropy layer exists in the aquifer therefore additional laboratory experiments and field tests would be required in future research to explore the availability of compressed air injection for controlling swi in the realistic stratum in addition in a real three dimensional situation the air barrier for controlling swi inside the aquifer can be accomplished through a row of boreholes constructed parallel to the coast in which compressed air is permeated into the aquifer through a thin steel pipe at this circumstance the setting of the involved parameters of air barrier layout including the position and length of injection zone for each borehole the applied air pressure for each borehole and the distance between any two adjacent boreholes should consider simultaneously the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the aquifer and the environmental and economic performances as a result the simulation optimization coupled model with the minimum total cost as the objective function and with the amount of reduction in intruded saltwater or the salinity at a specific position as the constraint condition is required to determine the best parameter combination of the layout of the air barrier furthermore influenced by compressed air injection the effective stress adjacent to the injection zone would decrease due to the pore pressure herein increasing thereby causing the expansion of soil skeleton the phenomenon of geological loosening in turn disturbs or promotes the flow of fluids in porous medium and then affects the workability of pressurized air injection for mitigating swi that is the establishment of the coupled numerical model which considers simultaneously water air two phase flow and saltwater transport in porous medium as well as soil skeleton deformation is also worthy of further analysis credit authorship contribution statement yongge zang conceptualization methodology validation investigation formal analysis
