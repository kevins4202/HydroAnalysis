19875,this study evaluates various options for full scale modular configuration of forward osmosis fo process for osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater for simultaneous desalination and water reuse through fo reverse osmosis ro hybrid system empirical relationship obtained from one fo membrane element operation was used to simulate the operational performances of different fo module configurations the main limiting criteria for module operation is to always maintain the feed pressure higher than the draw pressure throughout the housing module for safe operation without affecting membrane integrity experimental studies under the conditions tested in this study show that a single membrane housing cannot accommodate more than four elements as the draw pressure exceeds the feed pressure this then indicates that a single stage housing with eight elements is not likely to be practical for safe fo operation hence six different fo modular configurations were proposed and simulated a two stage fo configuration with multiple housings in parallel in the second stage using same or larger spacer thickness reduces draw pressure build up as the draw flow rates are reduced to half in the second stage thereby allowing more than four elements in the second stage housing the loss of feed pressure pressure drop and osmotic driving force in the second stage are compensated by operating under the pressure assisted osmosis pao mode which helps enhance permeate flux and maintains positive pressure differences between the feed and draw chamber the pao energy penalty is compensated by enhanced permeate throughput reduced membrane area and plant footprint the contribution of fo pao to total energy consumption was not significant compared to post ro desalination 90 indicating that the proposed two stage fo modular configuration is one way of making the fo full scale operation practical for fo ro hybrid system graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis reverse osmosis pressure assisted osmosis spiral wound element hybrid desalination systems 1 introduction forward osmosis fo has emerged as a promising membrane technology for desalination and wastewater treatment cath et al 2006 in the last decade academic researchers and industries have tried to improve the overall efficiency of an fo process through lab scale and pilot scale studies kim et al 2014 kim and park 2011 recent studies have proposed fo as a pre treatment to reverse osmosis ro desalination process blandin et al 2016 chekli et al 2016 in this concept seawater used as draw solution ds is subjected to osmotic dilution by fo process using low salinity feed water such as biologically treated wastewater effluent the diluted seawater is then processed by ro process to produce high quality treated and desalinated water for potable or non potable applications recent studies have shown that fo pre treatment can significantly improve the overall ro process efficiency by reducing the fouling propensity of the wastewater seawater dilution reduces the energy consumption and the system produces high quality potable water for reuse blandin et al 2016 cath et al 2010 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 demonstrated fo process coupled with low pressure ro lpro for desalination of red seawater and treatment of a secondary wastewater effluent the results showed that the specific energy consumption of fo lpro hybrid system was 50 lower than conventional seawater ro desalination 2 5 4 kwh m3 producing high quality product water altaee et al 2014 also demonstrated that fo pre treatment could enhance the performance of the ro regeneration process more recent studies have reported that fo process is very effective not only in removing a wide range of contaminants such as trace organic compounds and boron but also could significantly help to increase the lifespan of the ro membrane due to reduced cleaning frequency coday et al 2014 pressure assisted osmosis pao has been recently suggested as an alternative fo operation blandin et al 2013 choi et al 2009 coday et al 2013 the extra driving force provided by the hydraulic pressure in addition to the osmotic driving force not only enhances the fo water flux but also reduces the specific reverse salt flux srsf and the total membrane area required for an fo process blandin et al 2013 sahebi et al 2015 despite many potential advantages of the fo pao ro hybrid system there has been little or no studies to understand the operational performances of the fo or pao process at a module scale level especially involving multiple elements in series in a single housing before integrating with the ro system most fo studies have been so far conducted in a lab scale level using small membrane coupons and the performance data from such studies are difficult to translate to large or full scale fo systems performance demonstration and simulation of module scale fo operation is therefore essential for providing a better understanding of its process performance and also in their economic and environmental impact assessments few fo studies have reported using commercial 4040 4 inch diameter and 40 inch length and 8040 8 inch diameter and 40 inch length spiral wound fo membrane element and module kim et al 2014 kim and park 2011 these studies have demonstrated the significant influence of the operational parameters such as solute concentrations solution flow rates and pressures on the permeate flow rate across the fo membrane the changes in the solution flow rates could affect the pressure drop along the ds and fs channels which could become more significant in a multi element fo module operations the results obtained from a pilot scale fo operation or module scale simulation could be more realistic and useful for evaluating the economic and environmental viability of the fo ro hybrid systems although there are several studies on the economic and environmental assessment of fo hybrid systems hancock et al 2012 valladares linares et al 2016 the issues and impact of the fo membrane element arrangement such as the number of membrane elements per housing and the optimum stages at which hydraulic pressure should be applied for pao operation and their impact on the economic and environmental feasibility has not yet been evaluated in greater details the objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the performance of the fo module with multiple fo membrane elements arranged in series in a housing under different volumetric flow rates and the pressure differentials in order to establish a correlation between the operational parameters of multiple fo elements in series pilot scale fo operation was conducted the experimental data were then used to obtain an empirical correlation that can be used to extrapolate for determining the modular arrangement design scenarios in the fo process and its performance simulation as well as a sensitivity analysis for the fo pao ro hybrid system based on the different channel spacer and additional hydraulic pressure based on the performance simulation the effect of module arrangement scenarios on the economics of fo hybrid systems is evaluated this study therefore provides a better understanding of the practical issues in the system design of a full scale fo process 2 materials and methods 2 1 spiral wound fo membrane element a commercial 8040 spiral wound polyamide based thin film composite tfc fo membrane element toray industries korea was used for pilot scale fo and pao experiments the effective membrane area used for experiments and simulation is shown in table s1 of the supplementary information si each polyvinyl chloride housing contained single 8040 fo membrane element and the more detailed configuration of the fo membrane module used in this study can be found in our previous studies kim et al 2014 2016 fo process was operated with the active layer of the tfc fo membrane facing the feed solution fs and the porous support layer of the membrane facing the draw solution finally all fo tests were conducted under the co current mode of cross flow operation due to technical restrictions of our fo pilot unit for operating under the counter current mode of crossflow direction 2 2 feed and draw solutions ds consisted of sodium chloride nacl solution prepared using tap water to make it similar to the seawater osmotic pressure of 27 8 bar at 0 6 m concentration the fo hybrid systems in this study were assumed to treat wastewater effluent with an osmotic pressure of around 0 99 bar first by osmotic dilution using fo process and the downstream ro process to desalinate the diluted seawater kim et al 2016 however for this particular study the fs was prepared by using nacl only to have the osmotic pressure of 0 99 bar i e 0 02 m nacl without the presence of any organics the osmotic pressures of the solutions were calculated using the thermodynamic modelling software oli stream analyser version 9 5oli systems inc morris plains nj the initial volumes of the feed and draw solutions were 1000 l and 500 l respectively 2 3 fo pilot scale experimental procedure fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of pilot scale fo experimental set up in which low pressure pumps were used to circulate the feed and draw solutions the pressure flow rate electrical conductivity and temperature of solutions were recorded online using sensors connected to a pc data acquisition system the feed and draw inlet pressures were initially adjusted based on the specifications recommended by the manufacturer kim et al 2014 the outlet solution parameter of the first module was used as the inlet parameters of the second module and so on the parameters include the flow rates pressures and concentrations of the both the ds and fs kim et al 2014 in total experiments were conducted to simulate the series operation of up to 4 elements beyond which the experiment could not be carried out further as the pressure differential exceeded the pressure recommended by the manufacturer kim et al 2017 the module in this study refers to all the fo membrane elements loaded in the housing while fo element refers to a single fo element 2 4 determination of pure water permeability and salt rejection pure water permeability atfc and nacl rejection r of the fo element were evaluated in ro mode of operation by applying hydraulic pressure from 0 5 to 2 5 bar on the feed side atfc value was measured using tap water on both sides of the membrane while rejection rate was measured using 1 2 g l nacl as feed and with hydraulic pressure on the feed side of the membrane the atfc and r for 8040 fo membrane element were found to be 5 54 0 14 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 lmh and 87 respectively the input data for fo and pao performance simulation are shown in table s1 of the si the water fluxes in fo experiments were determined by measuring the difference in the draw flow rates between inlet and outlet of the fo membrane module which was further confirmed through the measurement of change in the mass of the ds in the ds tank in addition detail information and validation of pilot experimental flux and module scale predicted data are shown in section s1 of the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation between the operational parameters of an fo module operation fig 2 a shows the variations of average water flux the fs and ds concentrations at the outlet of each fo element operated using a single element the pilot scale fo process was able to operate up to four number of 8040 fo membrane elements in series due to the operational limitation of fo process to keep the ds pressure within the safe operating limit kim et al 2017 kim and park 2011 the highest average water flux of 25 1 lmh was observed for the first element which is expected due to the highest osmotic driving force available however the average water fluxes of each fo element decrease for the subsequent elements the decline in the fo average water flux of the downstream elements is attributed to a cumulative decrease in the osmotic driving force due to the change in the solute concentrations of the fs and ds along the module as presented in the secondary axis of fig 2 a the ds concentration decreases along the elements due to dilution by the water flux coming from the feed side the increase in the fs concentration was only slightly noticeable since the fs flow rate used in the pilot unit was much higher than the ds flow rate because of which the feed recovery rate was low for the pilot operation the water fluxes of each element refer to the cumulative average water fluxes of each fo element with a membrane area of 15 m2 it is important to note from the average flux results that under co current fo operation as applied in this study the presence of large driving force in the first element is likely to produce very high water flux which would promote membrane fouling or scaling especially if it exceeds the critical flux of the membrane this could result in increased cleaning frequency and hence reduce the membrane life phuntsho et al 2014 however the current study did not include the effect of fouling on the performances in the fo process of the different fo hybrid system scenarios the current design of the fo pilot unit also made it difficult to operate in the counter current mode of operation fig 2 b shows the pilot scale experimental data of the inlet pressure for the single fo element in a housing at different inlet fs and ds flow rates conducted using 0 6 m nacl as ds and 0 02 m nacl as fs it can be seen that when a higher fs and ds flow rates are used at the inlet of an fo element the inlet pressure increases significantly with their respective flow rates it must to be noted here that the maximum feed inlet pressure of the fo process is 4 bar as recommended by the manufacturer the feed inlet pressure decreases along the subsequent fo elements however the ds flow rate increases cumulatively along the fo channel along the module due to incoming water flux this will lead to significant increase in the pressure at the inlet of the subsequent fo elements of a housing containing multiple elements in series at the ds inlet flow rate of 5 7 lpm liter per minute the inlet pressure is 0 2 bar which increases to 0 60 bar when the inlet flow rate reaches above 10 lpm this pressure build up is seen as one of the most critical operational parameters for fo module operation as it affects the pressure difference between the fs and ds that could undermine the integrity of the fo membrane if the ds channel pressure increases above critical operational limit recommended by the manufacturer or the pressure increases above the feed pressure the thin film polyamide active layer of the fo membrane is likely to delaminate as it is not supported on the opposite side or the feed side of the fo membrane besides the initial ds flow rates and the pressure build up along the membrane module will also depend on the initial ds concentration used and the number of membrane elements in a series in a single housing or stage even at similar inlet ds flow rates if higher ds concentration is used the water flux will be higher due to increased driving force which increases the cumulative ds flow rates along the channel thereby further contributing to the pressure build up as shown in fig 2 b however given that this study is limited to using seawater as ds the concentration will not significantly change and hence the osmotic driving force is almost fixed increasing the number of elements in series within a single stage therefore increases the cumulative permeate flow rates at the last elements which contributes towards higher pressure build up this pressure build up is therefore likely to determine the maximum number of elements in series that can be safely accommodated in a single housing this number of elements in a single housing will ultimately affect the feed recovery rates and the ds dilution factor i e final diluted ds concentration that can be achieved in a single stage fo process the ds dilution factor and the concentration of the diluted ds are significant because it directly affects the energy consumption of the downstream ro process at a lower dilution factor the concentrations of the diluted ds will be higher which will ultimately increase the operating energy of the subsequent ro process which is not desirable a correlation between the initial fs and ds flow rates and its inlet pressures was developed by fitting the experimental data collected during the pilot scale fo operation as shown in fig 2 b the curve fitting provides the following empirical correlation equations that can be used to simulate and predict the variations of pressure in the housing containing multiple fo membrane elements in series at different inlet fs and ds flow rates valid for specific operating conditions of 0 6 m nacl as ds and 0 02 m nacl as fs using 8040 tfc fo membrane elements are presented in fig 2 however the empirical correlation can be represented in a more general form of equation that could be applicable to other configurations using the same membrane module as follows 1 p fs bar k 1 q fs 2 k 2 q fs k 3 2 p ds bar c 1 q ds 2 c 2 q ds c 3 where pfs and pds are the fs and ds inlet pressures and qfs and qds are the fs and ds flow rates at the inlet of fo membrane element k and c are the constants that could depend on various operational parameters such a ds and fs properties and membrane and geometric configuration of spacer and elements eqs 1 and 2 can be therefore used in simulating the pressure build up for a housing containing multiple elements in series these quadratic equations in fact resemble a standard bernoulli s equation of the fluid in a closed conduit where the pressure drop varies to the square of the flow rate flow velocity and clearly indicate the significant impact of the flow rates on the ds operating pressure during the fo operation however since the scope of this study is limited to the osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater effluent the k and c values obtained from the above empirical correlations are only to this particular scenario since the only major operating parameters available for variations are the ds and fs flow rates or cross flow as the ds or fs concentrations do not vary significantly the mass balance relationship in a continuous mode of operation liyanaarachchi et al 2016 along with the above empirical module scale model deshmukh et al 2015 can fairly simulate the performances of the fo process to suggest several modular options for system design of the fo process 3 2 determination of possible element arrangement options in series 3 2 1 simulating the variations of flow rate and pressure along the fo module in a typical ro plant up to 8 elements are connected in series in a single housing dowfilmtec 2016 wilf and klinko 2001 and the aim here is to evaluate the possibilities of a similar module arrangement for fo process simulation in module scale fo operation it has been observed that the feed and draw inlet pressures are critical kim et al 2017 as this pressure variation depends on the flow rates it is important to understand how this pressure would impact the elemental arrangement within the housing to form an fo membrane module the initial fs and ds flow rates and the permeation flow rates are therefore likely to be more critical in contributing to the pressure variation in the fo membrane elements since permeate flow rates cumulate along the element in series in a housing it depends on the water flux which in turn depends on the osmotic driving forces ds concentration it is therefore important to simulate the pressure build up by considering all these major parameters fig 3 a shows the variations of feed flow rates ds flow rates and permeate flow rates qp element along the fo elements in the housing containing 8 elements in series as the initial ds flows qds in through the ds channel it picks up the permeate water from the feed increasing its flow qdds qd in qp which then becomes a diluted ds as the water flux is generated throughout the length of the module the ds flow rate increases cumulatively along the fo module passing through each fo membrane element this cumulative increase in the ds flow rates along the downstream of the ds channel can significantly contribute towards the pressure build up the simulation shows that the ds and fs flow rates become equal at about 4th fo element in series in the housing if the point at which the fs and ds flow rates becomes equal is to be considered as the limit for the fo operation then it appears that the maximum number of fo element under the conditions simulated in this study is only four fo elements in one housing if the housing contains more than four elements the ds flow rate could exceed the feed flow rates likely creating a negative pressure differential that could undermine the fo membrane integrity this is likely to be highly critical for fixing the operational conditions of the fo process fig 3 b shows variations of the simulated feed and draw inlet pressures along the elements in a housing under different feed inlet flow rates 30 60 lpm but at fixed initial draw flow rate of 2 lpm which was the lowest flow rate we could operate in the pilot scale fo unit used for this study when the feed flow rate increases from 30 to 60 lpm the inlet feed pressure also correspondingly increases however the feed inlet pressure of each fo element decreases gradually after about 5th element in series in the same housing this pressure drop along the fo module is expected firstly due to the decrease in the feed flow rate along the feed channel as water is extracted continuously by the ds and secondly due to frictional loss within the hydraulic channel of the feed inside the membrane element if this pressure drop on the feed side is large it could likely have an impact on the pressure differential across the membrane as the pressure on the ds side will increase along its housing fig 2 b at about the 5th element the draw inlet pressure becomes equal at inlet ds flow rate of 2 lpm to the feed inlet pressure of around 1 4 bar at inlet fs flow rate of 60 lpm due to pressure build up as a result of cumulative permeate flow kim and park 2011 phuntsho et al 2014 this is in fact the similar point at which the ds and fs flow rate becomes equal based on the simulation results in fig 3 a for the initial feed flow rate of 60 lpm this pressure build up may not significantly affect the ds pumping energy as the increased permeate flow rate would naturally generate adequate hydraulic energy to drive out the diluted ds through the ds channel without the need of additional pumping load to the ds however this increased diluted ds flow rate could contribute to the pressure differential that can impact the membrane integrity which needs careful consideration when lower inlet fs flow rates are used the number of elements in series that can be safely accommodated in a single housing further decreases to 4 3 and 2 at inlet fs flow rates of 50 40 and 30 lpm this is because at these lower fs flow rates the inlet feed pressure is also correspondingly low and hence the increased inlet ds pressure could easily exceed the inlet feed pressure along the module therefore the only approach here is to operate the fs at a suitable and fixed inlet pressure even when a lower initial fs flow rates used although using a higher initial fs flow rate could increase the inlet feed pressure however this option will also increase the head loss in the system and also reduce the feed recovery rate of the system these results therefore suggest that if lower feed flow rates are to be used to enhance feed recovery rates of the fo system the only way is to operate the feed at slightly elevated feed pressure and this means subjecting the fo process under the pao mode of operation this pressure differential developed in the module would however be different for those modules operated under co and counter current cross flow directions the pressure differential along the membrane module would not vary significantly when operated in a counter current crossflow mode since the feed direction on which pressure drop occurs is associated with the direction of the ds at the inlet side where the initial pressure is also lower the influence of the initial ds flow rate on the feed and draw inlet pressure at fixed fs flow rate of 60 lpm for the number of membrane elements in series in the housing is shown in fig 3 c the number of fo membrane elements that can be safely accommodated in a single housing without exceeding the inlet feed pressure decreases with the increase in the initial ds flow rate used in the fo process for example the maximum number of elements is 5 for an initial ds flow rate of 2 lpm but decreases to 4 at an initial ds flow rates of 4 6 lpm these indicate that fo process must use lower initial ds flow rates if a higher number of fo elements is to be safely accommodated in the housing to enhance feed recovery rates however for an fo desalination plant of fixed capacity the initial ds flow rate and concentration correlate inversely phuntsho et al 2017 and hence it must be complemented by higher ds concentration however this could be a challenge for a situation such as in this study where seawater used as ds has almost fixed concentration therefore this study shows that the initial ds flow rate plays a significant role in determining the number of membrane elements in series per housing for the fo process in order to maintain safe operating pressure differential based on the results in fig 3 c the initial ds flow rate of 4 lpm was therefore selected for further simulation for 4 membrane elements in series under the conditions used in the study to maintain the least draw pressure build up even though using higher draw inlet flow rate enhances the water extraction capacity and the feed recovery rate phuntsho et al 2014 3 2 2 exploring different fo element arrangement scenarios sensitivity analysis providing more number of elements in each housing helps increase the feed recovery rates increases the production capacity and plant compactness the results from figs 2 and 3 however indicate that the total number of fo membrane elements in a single housing will be limited due to pressure build up inside the ds channel which otherwise could undermine the integrity of the fo membrane during the operations the elemental arrangement for an fo module may not be suitable if it is simply based on the established ro module and hence is likely to require certain modifications to suit its process performance several possible modular design options are proposed as shown in fig 4 and these options are based on the following criteria the hydraulic pressure of the ds should not exceed the hydraulic pressure of the fs due to pressure drop in each solution channel and this is essential to protect the integrity of the thin rejection layer of fo membrane due to likely delamination the diluted ds should have the lowest possible concentration as this determines the energy for any post treatment by the ro process pressure drops inside the ds and fs channels is mainly responsible for the pressure difference between the two channels and hence the proposed design options mostly looked at the factors responsible for these pressure drops some of the major factors responsible for pressure drop are the channel thickness initial fs and ds concentrations and its flow rates water flux through the membrane which in turn depends on the osmotic driving force and the membrane performance feed recovery rates and ds dilution factor and number of membrane elements in a single housing maintaining positive pressure difference higher pressure for fs channel therefore would involve controlling these factors that affect the pressure drop inside the channels the fluid velocity directly affects the pressure drop inside the channel pressure drop proportional to the square of the velocity and hence controlling fluid velocity is one way of controlling the pressure drop hence one way of limiting pressure on the ds channel is to start the fo process with lower initial ds flow rate at the inlet of the first element but this is not applicable for the current fo process where its target application is for osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater and seawater concentration is fairly constant the second option is to use fo membrane element with different channel thickness either in a single housing or different stages so as to limit the pressure drop inside the channel due to change in the solution flow rates another option is to elevate the hydraulic pressure of the fs i e under the pao mode to negate the pressure increase on the ds side of the fo membrane a total of six different modular design options have been proposed and compared in this study as described in fig 4 and table s2 of the si 3 3 performance simulations of the different modular options as expected fig 5 a shows that the feed inlet pressure for each fo element decreases while the draw inlet pressure increases gradually but the ds inlet pressure does not exceed the feed inlet pressure for elements arranged in series of up to 4 elements per housing for options 1 to 3 in the second stage two housings are provided in parallel with each housing containing 4 elements but of different spacer thickness for options 2 and 3 and operated under pao mode in order to compensate the loss of osmotic driving force the idea here is to divide the flow rates in order to reduce both the feed and draw inlet pressures and lower the pressure difference so that second stage can be operated safely with positive pressure difference the feed inlet was elevated to 4 bar by applying external hydraulic pressure which decreased to 3 6 bar at the last element for both options 2 and 3 it can be seen that the draw inlet pressure for option 2 increases much more rapidly compared to option 3 because of the smaller spacer thickness used and reaching almost similar to the inlet feed pressure at the end of the 8th element 4th element in the second stage the draw inlet pressure at the end of the 8th element 4th element in the second stage for option 3 is only about 3 2 bar which is much lower than the feed inlet pressure at that point these results show that by using larger channel spacer thickness and enhanced hydraulic pressure in the second stage the ds pressure build up can be mitigated and thus able to accommodate more than 4 elements in the second stage thereby increasing the feed recovery rate our estimate shows data not presented that up to 6 elements can be easily accommodated in the second stage for option 3 which could help further enhanced feed recovery rates of the fo modules it was shown in fig 5 a that by using larger spacer thickness or by operating the fo module under pao mode or both the pressure differences between the fs and ds can be maintained positive for the safe operation of the fo module this technique has been applied in options 4 5 and 6 to see whether fo modular operations can be conducted safely in a standard single stage 8 elements per housing as shown in fig 4 option 4 is in fact an extension of the option 1 to 8 elements per housing as a means for comparison it is obvious from fig 5 b that without any modification the first stage housing cannot accommodate more than 4 elements in series as the ds pressure would easily exceed the feed pressure when the same module is operated under the pao mode as in option 5 at about 4 bar feed inlet applied pressure a higher positive pressure difference can be maintained between fs and ds compared to option 4 however the ds pressure still increases above the feed pressure after the 4th fo element this shows that even by elevating the feed pressure the first stage fo module still cannot accommodate more than 4 elements per housing this is because of the very high water flux generated under the combined osmotic driving force and applied hydraulic pressure that results in higher permeate flow rates in the ds thereby rapidly increasing the draw pressure significantly this is evident from the very high cumulative permeate flow rates shown in fig 5 c for option 5 a larger spacer thickness 3 mm is used for the last four fo elements of the 8 elements in a housing in option 6 the results in fig 5 b shows that even using larger feed spacer thickness from the 5th element onwards the feed inlet pressure for element e5 remains almost same as the feed outlet of e5 this is expected because entry pressure is not expected to change although the pressure drop or build up inside the last four elements will change as evident from the results in the figure where the draw pressure build up is very gradual compared to option 5 although the draw pressure in the last three is lower compared to option 4 however it still exceeds the feed pressure above 4th elements of the housing and hence option 6 cannot be operated safely with 8 elements in a single housing using a larger spacer thickness for all the eight elements could be one way of keeping the draw pressure below feed if option 6 is to be operated safely however this will also significantly decrease the effective membrane area thereby decreasing the throughput and feed recovery rates and decreasing the footprint the results in fig 5 c show that the permeate throughput of the fo module is highest for option 5 because of the additional permeate flux due to applied pressure subjected to all the membrane elements in the module this therefore results in the highest ds dilution and hence the lowest concentration of the diluted ds with a final concentration of about 0 044 m as shown in fig 5 d the extent of ds dilution is important as this has direct implications on the energy of the ro post treatment process the results also show that the next highest permeate throughput is obtained for option 2 followed by option 3 as shown in fig 5 c and hence correspondingly lower ds dilution with a final diluted ds concentrations of 0 049 m and 0 064 m respectively fig 5 d although options 2 and 3 use the same modular configurations and hydraulic pressure option 2 shows the higher permeate throughput than option 3 due to its larger effective membrane area in the element when smaller spacer thickness is used these results show that by slightly elevating the feed hydraulic pressure it can compensate for the loss of osmotic driving force in the second stage and therefore enhance the throughput and hence the extent of dilution besides it also helps maintain a positive pressure difference between fs and ds the lowest permeate throughout was observed for options 4 and 6 as shown in fig 5 c because of which they also resulted in lower final ds dilution as presented in fig 5 d 3 4 implications of the configuration options the results in fig 5 clearly demonstrated that combining fo membranes with different channel spacer thickness in the same housing or in different stage housing can help reduce the pressure build up in the draw channel and thus their implications to the overall system should be assessed and discussed using membrane elements with larger spacer thickness reduce the packing density of the fo module increases plant footprint and reduce the feed recovery rates however operating the fo modules under pao mode not only helps maintain a positive pressure difference but also increase the permeate throughput thereby lowering the plant footprint and enhancing feed recovery rates it must also be pointed out that applying external hydraulic pressure on the feed not only incurs additional energy cost to the system but also can lower the osmotic process efficiency due to enhanced dilutive icp when operated at higher water flux than the normal osmotic flux option 5 has a similar configuration of the established ro and nf membrane processes and hence could be the most preferred configuration for fo process however based on the results in fig 5 options 2 and 3 are the most suitable modular configurations for fo process under the conditions simulated in this study these options are capable of not only maintaining positive pressure differences between the feed and draw solutions for up to a total of 8 elements in two stages it could also accommodate more than 4 elements in the second stages in a single housing thereby helping further enhance the system capacity for a fair comparison fig 6 presents the total membrane area required and specific energy consumption sec of the combined fo and ro hybrid system without energy recovery device for the six different configuration options described in fig 4 assuming a plant capacity of 100 000 m3 day at 50 feed recovery rate and pump efficiency of 85 the sec of seawater ro swro process alone was taken at 3 9 kwh m3 kim et al 2015 for comparison in this study fig 6 a clearly shows that the total membrane area required for option 1 2 3 and 5 are comparable while the total membrane area required for options 4 and 6 are significantly higher confirming the advantage of pao mode in lowering the plant footprint the total sec of all the options shown in fig 6 b indicates that the secs of the fo hybrid systems are still much lower than the conventional swro desalination process this is expected due to the osmotic dilution of the seawater by the fo process before desalination by the ro process the total sec for options 1 4 and 6 are the highest mainly because of the final diluted ds concentration which were higher that increases the sec of the ro process and this further confirms that these modular configurations are not suitable the sec of options 2 1 38 kwh m3 and 3 1 45 kwh m3 are slightly lower than most other options which further support their suitability for system configuration for modular operations of the fo ro hybrid system for all the six hybrid options considered in this study sec of ro process forms the largest proportion of the total sec and the contribution of fo and pao processes were less significant although options 1 and 6 resulted in the highest secs overall however the sec between the six options were not drastically different indicating that the suggested modular configuration of the fo ro hybrid system can be suitably adopted for fo system design it is therefore expected that with optimisation in the spacer thickness and applied hydraulic pressure there could still be potential for further reduction in the membrane and energy cost which needs further investigation including the effect of using different thickness for ds and fs channels however it must be noted that this simulation study is limited to the fo operation conditions under the co current crossflow and the results might slightly different as the directions of pressure drop changes the principles of pressure drop pressure build up for ds and pressure drop decrease for fs for fo modular operation will however still apply universally whichever configuration or cross flow directions are used 4 conclusions this study evaluated the various options for full scale modular configuration of fo process for osmotic dilution of seawater by wastewater for simultaneous desalination and water reuse through fo ro hybrid system the following conclusions were drawn from this study during fo module operation feed flow rate decreases resulting to pressure drop while the draw flow rates increases pressure build up along the membrane housing thereby reducing the pressure differences across the membrane experimental study shows that the initial ds flow rate is a very important operating parameter as it significantly affects the pressure build up along the fo housing and hence determines the safe number of fo membrane elements that can be accommodated in series in a single housing experimental studies under the conditions tested in this study show that a single housing cannot accommodate more than four elements as the draw pressure exceeds the feed pressure indicating that a normal single housing with eight elements is not likely to be practical for safe fo operation six different fo modular configurations simulated in this study show that two stage fo configuration with multiple housings in parallel in the second stage using same or larger spacer thickness can help reduce the draw pressure build up due to reduction of the draw flows in the second stage thereby allowing four or more fo elements in the second stage housing to be safely accommodated operating the second stage fo under slightly elevated feed hydraulic pressure pao mode not only compensates the loss of osmotic driving force but also enhances permeate flux and maintains positive pressure differences the energy penalty posed by the pao mode of fo operation is compensated by enhanced permeate throughput reduced membrane area and plant footprint the contribution of fo pao to the total sec of the fo ro hybrid system was not significant compared to the sec of the ro process which still consisted about 90 of the total sec this indicates that the proposed two stage fo modular configuration is one way of making the fo full scale operation practical for fo ro hybrid system

19875,this study evaluates various options for full scale modular configuration of forward osmosis fo process for osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater for simultaneous desalination and water reuse through fo reverse osmosis ro hybrid system empirical relationship obtained from one fo membrane element operation was used to simulate the operational performances of different fo module configurations the main limiting criteria for module operation is to always maintain the feed pressure higher than the draw pressure throughout the housing module for safe operation without affecting membrane integrity experimental studies under the conditions tested in this study show that a single membrane housing cannot accommodate more than four elements as the draw pressure exceeds the feed pressure this then indicates that a single stage housing with eight elements is not likely to be practical for safe fo operation hence six different fo modular configurations were proposed and simulated a two stage fo configuration with multiple housings in parallel in the second stage using same or larger spacer thickness reduces draw pressure build up as the draw flow rates are reduced to half in the second stage thereby allowing more than four elements in the second stage housing the loss of feed pressure pressure drop and osmotic driving force in the second stage are compensated by operating under the pressure assisted osmosis pao mode which helps enhance permeate flux and maintains positive pressure differences between the feed and draw chamber the pao energy penalty is compensated by enhanced permeate throughput reduced membrane area and plant footprint the contribution of fo pao to total energy consumption was not significant compared to post ro desalination 90 indicating that the proposed two stage fo modular configuration is one way of making the fo full scale operation practical for fo ro hybrid system graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis reverse osmosis pressure assisted osmosis spiral wound element hybrid desalination systems 1 introduction forward osmosis fo has emerged as a promising membrane technology for desalination and wastewater treatment cath et al 2006 in the last decade academic researchers and industries have tried to improve the overall efficiency of an fo process through lab scale and pilot scale studies kim et al 2014 kim and park 2011 recent studies have proposed fo as a pre treatment to reverse osmosis ro desalination process blandin et al 2016 chekli et al 2016 in this concept seawater used as draw solution ds is subjected to osmotic dilution by fo process using low salinity feed water such as biologically treated wastewater effluent the diluted seawater is then processed by ro process to produce high quality treated and desalinated water for potable or non potable applications recent studies have shown that fo pre treatment can significantly improve the overall ro process efficiency by reducing the fouling propensity of the wastewater seawater dilution reduces the energy consumption and the system produces high quality potable water for reuse blandin et al 2016 cath et al 2010 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 demonstrated fo process coupled with low pressure ro lpro for desalination of red seawater and treatment of a secondary wastewater effluent the results showed that the specific energy consumption of fo lpro hybrid system was 50 lower than conventional seawater ro desalination 2 5 4 kwh m3 producing high quality product water altaee et al 2014 also demonstrated that fo pre treatment could enhance the performance of the ro regeneration process more recent studies have reported that fo process is very effective not only in removing a wide range of contaminants such as trace organic compounds and boron but also could significantly help to increase the lifespan of the ro membrane due to reduced cleaning frequency coday et al 2014 pressure assisted osmosis pao has been recently suggested as an alternative fo operation blandin et al 2013 choi et al 2009 coday et al 2013 the extra driving force provided by the hydraulic pressure in addition to the osmotic driving force not only enhances the fo water flux but also reduces the specific reverse salt flux srsf and the total membrane area required for an fo process blandin et al 2013 sahebi et al 2015 despite many potential advantages of the fo pao ro hybrid system there has been little or no studies to understand the operational performances of the fo or pao process at a module scale level especially involving multiple elements in series in a single housing before integrating with the ro system most fo studies have been so far conducted in a lab scale level using small membrane coupons and the performance data from such studies are difficult to translate to large or full scale fo systems performance demonstration and simulation of module scale fo operation is therefore essential for providing a better understanding of its process performance and also in their economic and environmental impact assessments few fo studies have reported using commercial 4040 4 inch diameter and 40 inch length and 8040 8 inch diameter and 40 inch length spiral wound fo membrane element and module kim et al 2014 kim and park 2011 these studies have demonstrated the significant influence of the operational parameters such as solute concentrations solution flow rates and pressures on the permeate flow rate across the fo membrane the changes in the solution flow rates could affect the pressure drop along the ds and fs channels which could become more significant in a multi element fo module operations the results obtained from a pilot scale fo operation or module scale simulation could be more realistic and useful for evaluating the economic and environmental viability of the fo ro hybrid systems although there are several studies on the economic and environmental assessment of fo hybrid systems hancock et al 2012 valladares linares et al 2016 the issues and impact of the fo membrane element arrangement such as the number of membrane elements per housing and the optimum stages at which hydraulic pressure should be applied for pao operation and their impact on the economic and environmental feasibility has not yet been evaluated in greater details the objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the performance of the fo module with multiple fo membrane elements arranged in series in a housing under different volumetric flow rates and the pressure differentials in order to establish a correlation between the operational parameters of multiple fo elements in series pilot scale fo operation was conducted the experimental data were then used to obtain an empirical correlation that can be used to extrapolate for determining the modular arrangement design scenarios in the fo process and its performance simulation as well as a sensitivity analysis for the fo pao ro hybrid system based on the different channel spacer and additional hydraulic pressure based on the performance simulation the effect of module arrangement scenarios on the economics of fo hybrid systems is evaluated this study therefore provides a better understanding of the practical issues in the system design of a full scale fo process 2 materials and methods 2 1 spiral wound fo membrane element a commercial 8040 spiral wound polyamide based thin film composite tfc fo membrane element toray industries korea was used for pilot scale fo and pao experiments the effective membrane area used for experiments and simulation is shown in table s1 of the supplementary information si each polyvinyl chloride housing contained single 8040 fo membrane element and the more detailed configuration of the fo membrane module used in this study can be found in our previous studies kim et al 2014 2016 fo process was operated with the active layer of the tfc fo membrane facing the feed solution fs and the porous support layer of the membrane facing the draw solution finally all fo tests were conducted under the co current mode of cross flow operation due to technical restrictions of our fo pilot unit for operating under the counter current mode of crossflow direction 2 2 feed and draw solutions ds consisted of sodium chloride nacl solution prepared using tap water to make it similar to the seawater osmotic pressure of 27 8 bar at 0 6 m concentration the fo hybrid systems in this study were assumed to treat wastewater effluent with an osmotic pressure of around 0 99 bar first by osmotic dilution using fo process and the downstream ro process to desalinate the diluted seawater kim et al 2016 however for this particular study the fs was prepared by using nacl only to have the osmotic pressure of 0 99 bar i e 0 02 m nacl without the presence of any organics the osmotic pressures of the solutions were calculated using the thermodynamic modelling software oli stream analyser version 9 5oli systems inc morris plains nj the initial volumes of the feed and draw solutions were 1000 l and 500 l respectively 2 3 fo pilot scale experimental procedure fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of pilot scale fo experimental set up in which low pressure pumps were used to circulate the feed and draw solutions the pressure flow rate electrical conductivity and temperature of solutions were recorded online using sensors connected to a pc data acquisition system the feed and draw inlet pressures were initially adjusted based on the specifications recommended by the manufacturer kim et al 2014 the outlet solution parameter of the first module was used as the inlet parameters of the second module and so on the parameters include the flow rates pressures and concentrations of the both the ds and fs kim et al 2014 in total experiments were conducted to simulate the series operation of up to 4 elements beyond which the experiment could not be carried out further as the pressure differential exceeded the pressure recommended by the manufacturer kim et al 2017 the module in this study refers to all the fo membrane elements loaded in the housing while fo element refers to a single fo element 2 4 determination of pure water permeability and salt rejection pure water permeability atfc and nacl rejection r of the fo element were evaluated in ro mode of operation by applying hydraulic pressure from 0 5 to 2 5 bar on the feed side atfc value was measured using tap water on both sides of the membrane while rejection rate was measured using 1 2 g l nacl as feed and with hydraulic pressure on the feed side of the membrane the atfc and r for 8040 fo membrane element were found to be 5 54 0 14 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 lmh and 87 respectively the input data for fo and pao performance simulation are shown in table s1 of the si the water fluxes in fo experiments were determined by measuring the difference in the draw flow rates between inlet and outlet of the fo membrane module which was further confirmed through the measurement of change in the mass of the ds in the ds tank in addition detail information and validation of pilot experimental flux and module scale predicted data are shown in section s1 of the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation between the operational parameters of an fo module operation fig 2 a shows the variations of average water flux the fs and ds concentrations at the outlet of each fo element operated using a single element the pilot scale fo process was able to operate up to four number of 8040 fo membrane elements in series due to the operational limitation of fo process to keep the ds pressure within the safe operating limit kim et al 2017 kim and park 2011 the highest average water flux of 25 1 lmh was observed for the first element which is expected due to the highest osmotic driving force available however the average water fluxes of each fo element decrease for the subsequent elements the decline in the fo average water flux of the downstream elements is attributed to a cumulative decrease in the osmotic driving force due to the change in the solute concentrations of the fs and ds along the module as presented in the secondary axis of fig 2 a the ds concentration decreases along the elements due to dilution by the water flux coming from the feed side the increase in the fs concentration was only slightly noticeable since the fs flow rate used in the pilot unit was much higher than the ds flow rate because of which the feed recovery rate was low for the pilot operation the water fluxes of each element refer to the cumulative average water fluxes of each fo element with a membrane area of 15 m2 it is important to note from the average flux results that under co current fo operation as applied in this study the presence of large driving force in the first element is likely to produce very high water flux which would promote membrane fouling or scaling especially if it exceeds the critical flux of the membrane this could result in increased cleaning frequency and hence reduce the membrane life phuntsho et al 2014 however the current study did not include the effect of fouling on the performances in the fo process of the different fo hybrid system scenarios the current design of the fo pilot unit also made it difficult to operate in the counter current mode of operation fig 2 b shows the pilot scale experimental data of the inlet pressure for the single fo element in a housing at different inlet fs and ds flow rates conducted using 0 6 m nacl as ds and 0 02 m nacl as fs it can be seen that when a higher fs and ds flow rates are used at the inlet of an fo element the inlet pressure increases significantly with their respective flow rates it must to be noted here that the maximum feed inlet pressure of the fo process is 4 bar as recommended by the manufacturer the feed inlet pressure decreases along the subsequent fo elements however the ds flow rate increases cumulatively along the fo channel along the module due to incoming water flux this will lead to significant increase in the pressure at the inlet of the subsequent fo elements of a housing containing multiple elements in series at the ds inlet flow rate of 5 7 lpm liter per minute the inlet pressure is 0 2 bar which increases to 0 60 bar when the inlet flow rate reaches above 10 lpm this pressure build up is seen as one of the most critical operational parameters for fo module operation as it affects the pressure difference between the fs and ds that could undermine the integrity of the fo membrane if the ds channel pressure increases above critical operational limit recommended by the manufacturer or the pressure increases above the feed pressure the thin film polyamide active layer of the fo membrane is likely to delaminate as it is not supported on the opposite side or the feed side of the fo membrane besides the initial ds flow rates and the pressure build up along the membrane module will also depend on the initial ds concentration used and the number of membrane elements in a series in a single housing or stage even at similar inlet ds flow rates if higher ds concentration is used the water flux will be higher due to increased driving force which increases the cumulative ds flow rates along the channel thereby further contributing to the pressure build up as shown in fig 2 b however given that this study is limited to using seawater as ds the concentration will not significantly change and hence the osmotic driving force is almost fixed increasing the number of elements in series within a single stage therefore increases the cumulative permeate flow rates at the last elements which contributes towards higher pressure build up this pressure build up is therefore likely to determine the maximum number of elements in series that can be safely accommodated in a single housing this number of elements in a single housing will ultimately affect the feed recovery rates and the ds dilution factor i e final diluted ds concentration that can be achieved in a single stage fo process the ds dilution factor and the concentration of the diluted ds are significant because it directly affects the energy consumption of the downstream ro process at a lower dilution factor the concentrations of the diluted ds will be higher which will ultimately increase the operating energy of the subsequent ro process which is not desirable a correlation between the initial fs and ds flow rates and its inlet pressures was developed by fitting the experimental data collected during the pilot scale fo operation as shown in fig 2 b the curve fitting provides the following empirical correlation equations that can be used to simulate and predict the variations of pressure in the housing containing multiple fo membrane elements in series at different inlet fs and ds flow rates valid for specific operating conditions of 0 6 m nacl as ds and 0 02 m nacl as fs using 8040 tfc fo membrane elements are presented in fig 2 however the empirical correlation can be represented in a more general form of equation that could be applicable to other configurations using the same membrane module as follows 1 p fs bar k 1 q fs 2 k 2 q fs k 3 2 p ds bar c 1 q ds 2 c 2 q ds c 3 where pfs and pds are the fs and ds inlet pressures and qfs and qds are the fs and ds flow rates at the inlet of fo membrane element k and c are the constants that could depend on various operational parameters such a ds and fs properties and membrane and geometric configuration of spacer and elements eqs 1 and 2 can be therefore used in simulating the pressure build up for a housing containing multiple elements in series these quadratic equations in fact resemble a standard bernoulli s equation of the fluid in a closed conduit where the pressure drop varies to the square of the flow rate flow velocity and clearly indicate the significant impact of the flow rates on the ds operating pressure during the fo operation however since the scope of this study is limited to the osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater effluent the k and c values obtained from the above empirical correlations are only to this particular scenario since the only major operating parameters available for variations are the ds and fs flow rates or cross flow as the ds or fs concentrations do not vary significantly the mass balance relationship in a continuous mode of operation liyanaarachchi et al 2016 along with the above empirical module scale model deshmukh et al 2015 can fairly simulate the performances of the fo process to suggest several modular options for system design of the fo process 3 2 determination of possible element arrangement options in series 3 2 1 simulating the variations of flow rate and pressure along the fo module in a typical ro plant up to 8 elements are connected in series in a single housing dowfilmtec 2016 wilf and klinko 2001 and the aim here is to evaluate the possibilities of a similar module arrangement for fo process simulation in module scale fo operation it has been observed that the feed and draw inlet pressures are critical kim et al 2017 as this pressure variation depends on the flow rates it is important to understand how this pressure would impact the elemental arrangement within the housing to form an fo membrane module the initial fs and ds flow rates and the permeation flow rates are therefore likely to be more critical in contributing to the pressure variation in the fo membrane elements since permeate flow rates cumulate along the element in series in a housing it depends on the water flux which in turn depends on the osmotic driving forces ds concentration it is therefore important to simulate the pressure build up by considering all these major parameters fig 3 a shows the variations of feed flow rates ds flow rates and permeate flow rates qp element along the fo elements in the housing containing 8 elements in series as the initial ds flows qds in through the ds channel it picks up the permeate water from the feed increasing its flow qdds qd in qp which then becomes a diluted ds as the water flux is generated throughout the length of the module the ds flow rate increases cumulatively along the fo module passing through each fo membrane element this cumulative increase in the ds flow rates along the downstream of the ds channel can significantly contribute towards the pressure build up the simulation shows that the ds and fs flow rates become equal at about 4th fo element in series in the housing if the point at which the fs and ds flow rates becomes equal is to be considered as the limit for the fo operation then it appears that the maximum number of fo element under the conditions simulated in this study is only four fo elements in one housing if the housing contains more than four elements the ds flow rate could exceed the feed flow rates likely creating a negative pressure differential that could undermine the fo membrane integrity this is likely to be highly critical for fixing the operational conditions of the fo process fig 3 b shows variations of the simulated feed and draw inlet pressures along the elements in a housing under different feed inlet flow rates 30 60 lpm but at fixed initial draw flow rate of 2 lpm which was the lowest flow rate we could operate in the pilot scale fo unit used for this study when the feed flow rate increases from 30 to 60 lpm the inlet feed pressure also correspondingly increases however the feed inlet pressure of each fo element decreases gradually after about 5th element in series in the same housing this pressure drop along the fo module is expected firstly due to the decrease in the feed flow rate along the feed channel as water is extracted continuously by the ds and secondly due to frictional loss within the hydraulic channel of the feed inside the membrane element if this pressure drop on the feed side is large it could likely have an impact on the pressure differential across the membrane as the pressure on the ds side will increase along its housing fig 2 b at about the 5th element the draw inlet pressure becomes equal at inlet ds flow rate of 2 lpm to the feed inlet pressure of around 1 4 bar at inlet fs flow rate of 60 lpm due to pressure build up as a result of cumulative permeate flow kim and park 2011 phuntsho et al 2014 this is in fact the similar point at which the ds and fs flow rate becomes equal based on the simulation results in fig 3 a for the initial feed flow rate of 60 lpm this pressure build up may not significantly affect the ds pumping energy as the increased permeate flow rate would naturally generate adequate hydraulic energy to drive out the diluted ds through the ds channel without the need of additional pumping load to the ds however this increased diluted ds flow rate could contribute to the pressure differential that can impact the membrane integrity which needs careful consideration when lower inlet fs flow rates are used the number of elements in series that can be safely accommodated in a single housing further decreases to 4 3 and 2 at inlet fs flow rates of 50 40 and 30 lpm this is because at these lower fs flow rates the inlet feed pressure is also correspondingly low and hence the increased inlet ds pressure could easily exceed the inlet feed pressure along the module therefore the only approach here is to operate the fs at a suitable and fixed inlet pressure even when a lower initial fs flow rates used although using a higher initial fs flow rate could increase the inlet feed pressure however this option will also increase the head loss in the system and also reduce the feed recovery rate of the system these results therefore suggest that if lower feed flow rates are to be used to enhance feed recovery rates of the fo system the only way is to operate the feed at slightly elevated feed pressure and this means subjecting the fo process under the pao mode of operation this pressure differential developed in the module would however be different for those modules operated under co and counter current cross flow directions the pressure differential along the membrane module would not vary significantly when operated in a counter current crossflow mode since the feed direction on which pressure drop occurs is associated with the direction of the ds at the inlet side where the initial pressure is also lower the influence of the initial ds flow rate on the feed and draw inlet pressure at fixed fs flow rate of 60 lpm for the number of membrane elements in series in the housing is shown in fig 3 c the number of fo membrane elements that can be safely accommodated in a single housing without exceeding the inlet feed pressure decreases with the increase in the initial ds flow rate used in the fo process for example the maximum number of elements is 5 for an initial ds flow rate of 2 lpm but decreases to 4 at an initial ds flow rates of 4 6 lpm these indicate that fo process must use lower initial ds flow rates if a higher number of fo elements is to be safely accommodated in the housing to enhance feed recovery rates however for an fo desalination plant of fixed capacity the initial ds flow rate and concentration correlate inversely phuntsho et al 2017 and hence it must be complemented by higher ds concentration however this could be a challenge for a situation such as in this study where seawater used as ds has almost fixed concentration therefore this study shows that the initial ds flow rate plays a significant role in determining the number of membrane elements in series per housing for the fo process in order to maintain safe operating pressure differential based on the results in fig 3 c the initial ds flow rate of 4 lpm was therefore selected for further simulation for 4 membrane elements in series under the conditions used in the study to maintain the least draw pressure build up even though using higher draw inlet flow rate enhances the water extraction capacity and the feed recovery rate phuntsho et al 2014 3 2 2 exploring different fo element arrangement scenarios sensitivity analysis providing more number of elements in each housing helps increase the feed recovery rates increases the production capacity and plant compactness the results from figs 2 and 3 however indicate that the total number of fo membrane elements in a single housing will be limited due to pressure build up inside the ds channel which otherwise could undermine the integrity of the fo membrane during the operations the elemental arrangement for an fo module may not be suitable if it is simply based on the established ro module and hence is likely to require certain modifications to suit its process performance several possible modular design options are proposed as shown in fig 4 and these options are based on the following criteria the hydraulic pressure of the ds should not exceed the hydraulic pressure of the fs due to pressure drop in each solution channel and this is essential to protect the integrity of the thin rejection layer of fo membrane due to likely delamination the diluted ds should have the lowest possible concentration as this determines the energy for any post treatment by the ro process pressure drops inside the ds and fs channels is mainly responsible for the pressure difference between the two channels and hence the proposed design options mostly looked at the factors responsible for these pressure drops some of the major factors responsible for pressure drop are the channel thickness initial fs and ds concentrations and its flow rates water flux through the membrane which in turn depends on the osmotic driving force and the membrane performance feed recovery rates and ds dilution factor and number of membrane elements in a single housing maintaining positive pressure difference higher pressure for fs channel therefore would involve controlling these factors that affect the pressure drop inside the channels the fluid velocity directly affects the pressure drop inside the channel pressure drop proportional to the square of the velocity and hence controlling fluid velocity is one way of controlling the pressure drop hence one way of limiting pressure on the ds channel is to start the fo process with lower initial ds flow rate at the inlet of the first element but this is not applicable for the current fo process where its target application is for osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater and seawater concentration is fairly constant the second option is to use fo membrane element with different channel thickness either in a single housing or different stages so as to limit the pressure drop inside the channel due to change in the solution flow rates another option is to elevate the hydraulic pressure of the fs i e under the pao mode to negate the pressure increase on the ds side of the fo membrane a total of six different modular design options have been proposed and compared in this study as described in fig 4 and table s2 of the si 3 3 performance simulations of the different modular options as expected fig 5 a shows that the feed inlet pressure for each fo element decreases while the draw inlet pressure increases gradually but the ds inlet pressure does not exceed the feed inlet pressure for elements arranged in series of up to 4 elements per housing for options 1 to 3 in the second stage two housings are provided in parallel with each housing containing 4 elements but of different spacer thickness for options 2 and 3 and operated under pao mode in order to compensate the loss of osmotic driving force the idea here is to divide the flow rates in order to reduce both the feed and draw inlet pressures and lower the pressure difference so that second stage can be operated safely with positive pressure difference the feed inlet was elevated to 4 bar by applying external hydraulic pressure which decreased to 3 6 bar at the last element for both options 2 and 3 it can be seen that the draw inlet pressure for option 2 increases much more rapidly compared to option 3 because of the smaller spacer thickness used and reaching almost similar to the inlet feed pressure at the end of the 8th element 4th element in the second stage the draw inlet pressure at the end of the 8th element 4th element in the second stage for option 3 is only about 3 2 bar which is much lower than the feed inlet pressure at that point these results show that by using larger channel spacer thickness and enhanced hydraulic pressure in the second stage the ds pressure build up can be mitigated and thus able to accommodate more than 4 elements in the second stage thereby increasing the feed recovery rate our estimate shows data not presented that up to 6 elements can be easily accommodated in the second stage for option 3 which could help further enhanced feed recovery rates of the fo modules it was shown in fig 5 a that by using larger spacer thickness or by operating the fo module under pao mode or both the pressure differences between the fs and ds can be maintained positive for the safe operation of the fo module this technique has been applied in options 4 5 and 6 to see whether fo modular operations can be conducted safely in a standard single stage 8 elements per housing as shown in fig 4 option 4 is in fact an extension of the option 1 to 8 elements per housing as a means for comparison it is obvious from fig 5 b that without any modification the first stage housing cannot accommodate more than 4 elements in series as the ds pressure would easily exceed the feed pressure when the same module is operated under the pao mode as in option 5 at about 4 bar feed inlet applied pressure a higher positive pressure difference can be maintained between fs and ds compared to option 4 however the ds pressure still increases above the feed pressure after the 4th fo element this shows that even by elevating the feed pressure the first stage fo module still cannot accommodate more than 4 elements per housing this is because of the very high water flux generated under the combined osmotic driving force and applied hydraulic pressure that results in higher permeate flow rates in the ds thereby rapidly increasing the draw pressure significantly this is evident from the very high cumulative permeate flow rates shown in fig 5 c for option 5 a larger spacer thickness 3 mm is used for the last four fo elements of the 8 elements in a housing in option 6 the results in fig 5 b shows that even using larger feed spacer thickness from the 5th element onwards the feed inlet pressure for element e5 remains almost same as the feed outlet of e5 this is expected because entry pressure is not expected to change although the pressure drop or build up inside the last four elements will change as evident from the results in the figure where the draw pressure build up is very gradual compared to option 5 although the draw pressure in the last three is lower compared to option 4 however it still exceeds the feed pressure above 4th elements of the housing and hence option 6 cannot be operated safely with 8 elements in a single housing using a larger spacer thickness for all the eight elements could be one way of keeping the draw pressure below feed if option 6 is to be operated safely however this will also significantly decrease the effective membrane area thereby decreasing the throughput and feed recovery rates and decreasing the footprint the results in fig 5 c show that the permeate throughput of the fo module is highest for option 5 because of the additional permeate flux due to applied pressure subjected to all the membrane elements in the module this therefore results in the highest ds dilution and hence the lowest concentration of the diluted ds with a final concentration of about 0 044 m as shown in fig 5 d the extent of ds dilution is important as this has direct implications on the energy of the ro post treatment process the results also show that the next highest permeate throughput is obtained for option 2 followed by option 3 as shown in fig 5 c and hence correspondingly lower ds dilution with a final diluted ds concentrations of 0 049 m and 0 064 m respectively fig 5 d although options 2 and 3 use the same modular configurations and hydraulic pressure option 2 shows the higher permeate throughput than option 3 due to its larger effective membrane area in the element when smaller spacer thickness is used these results show that by slightly elevating the feed hydraulic pressure it can compensate for the loss of osmotic driving force in the second stage and therefore enhance the throughput and hence the extent of dilution besides it also helps maintain a positive pressure difference between fs and ds the lowest permeate throughout was observed for options 4 and 6 as shown in fig 5 c because of which they also resulted in lower final ds dilution as presented in fig 5 d 3 4 implications of the configuration options the results in fig 5 clearly demonstrated that combining fo membranes with different channel spacer thickness in the same housing or in different stage housing can help reduce the pressure build up in the draw channel and thus their implications to the overall system should be assessed and discussed using membrane elements with larger spacer thickness reduce the packing density of the fo module increases plant footprint and reduce the feed recovery rates however operating the fo modules under pao mode not only helps maintain a positive pressure difference but also increase the permeate throughput thereby lowering the plant footprint and enhancing feed recovery rates it must also be pointed out that applying external hydraulic pressure on the feed not only incurs additional energy cost to the system but also can lower the osmotic process efficiency due to enhanced dilutive icp when operated at higher water flux than the normal osmotic flux option 5 has a similar configuration of the established ro and nf membrane processes and hence could be the most preferred configuration for fo process however based on the results in fig 5 options 2 and 3 are the most suitable modular configurations for fo process under the conditions simulated in this study these options are capable of not only maintaining positive pressure differences between the feed and draw solutions for up to a total of 8 elements in two stages it could also accommodate more than 4 elements in the second stages in a single housing thereby helping further enhance the system capacity for a fair comparison fig 6 presents the total membrane area required and specific energy consumption sec of the combined fo and ro hybrid system without energy recovery device for the six different configuration options described in fig 4 assuming a plant capacity of 100 000 m3 day at 50 feed recovery rate and pump efficiency of 85 the sec of seawater ro swro process alone was taken at 3 9 kwh m3 kim et al 2015 for comparison in this study fig 6 a clearly shows that the total membrane area required for option 1 2 3 and 5 are comparable while the total membrane area required for options 4 and 6 are significantly higher confirming the advantage of pao mode in lowering the plant footprint the total sec of all the options shown in fig 6 b indicates that the secs of the fo hybrid systems are still much lower than the conventional swro desalination process this is expected due to the osmotic dilution of the seawater by the fo process before desalination by the ro process the total sec for options 1 4 and 6 are the highest mainly because of the final diluted ds concentration which were higher that increases the sec of the ro process and this further confirms that these modular configurations are not suitable the sec of options 2 1 38 kwh m3 and 3 1 45 kwh m3 are slightly lower than most other options which further support their suitability for system configuration for modular operations of the fo ro hybrid system for all the six hybrid options considered in this study sec of ro process forms the largest proportion of the total sec and the contribution of fo and pao processes were less significant although options 1 and 6 resulted in the highest secs overall however the sec between the six options were not drastically different indicating that the suggested modular configuration of the fo ro hybrid system can be suitably adopted for fo system design it is therefore expected that with optimisation in the spacer thickness and applied hydraulic pressure there could still be potential for further reduction in the membrane and energy cost which needs further investigation including the effect of using different thickness for ds and fs channels however it must be noted that this simulation study is limited to the fo operation conditions under the co current crossflow and the results might slightly different as the directions of pressure drop changes the principles of pressure drop pressure build up for ds and pressure drop decrease for fs for fo modular operation will however still apply universally whichever configuration or cross flow directions are used 4 conclusions this study evaluated the various options for full scale modular configuration of fo process for osmotic dilution of seawater by wastewater for simultaneous desalination and water reuse through fo ro hybrid system the following conclusions were drawn from this study during fo module operation feed flow rate decreases resulting to pressure drop while the draw flow rates increases pressure build up along the membrane housing thereby reducing the pressure differences across the membrane experimental study shows that the initial ds flow rate is a very important operating parameter as it significantly affects the pressure build up along the fo housing and hence determines the safe number of fo membrane elements that can be accommodated in series in a single housing experimental studies under the conditions tested in this study show that a single housing cannot accommodate more than four elements as the draw pressure exceeds the feed pressure indicating that a normal single housing with eight elements is not likely to be practical for safe fo operation six different fo modular configurations simulated in this study show that two stage fo configuration with multiple housings in parallel in the second stage using same or larger spacer thickness can help reduce the draw pressure build up due to reduction of the draw flows in the second stage thereby allowing four or more fo elements in the second stage housing to be safely accommodated operating the second stage fo under slightly elevated feed hydraulic pressure pao mode not only compensates the loss of osmotic driving force but also enhances permeate flux and maintains positive pressure differences the energy penalty posed by the pao mode of fo operation is compensated by enhanced permeate throughput reduced membrane area and plant footprint the contribution of fo pao to the total sec of the fo ro hybrid system was not significant compared to the sec of the ro process which still consisted about 90 of the total sec this indicates that the proposed two stage fo modular configuration is one way of making the fo full scale operation practical for fo ro hybrid system

19876,temperature change and eutrophication are known to affect phytoplankton communities but relatively little is known about the effects of interactions between simultaneous changes of temperature and nutrient loading in coastal ecosystems here we show that such interaction is key in driving diatom dinoflagellate dynamics in the east china sea diatoms and dinoflagellates responded differently to temperature nutrient concentrations and ratios and their interactions diatoms preferred lower temperature and higher nutrient concentrations while dinoflagellates were less sensitive to temperature and nutrient concentrations but tended to prevail at low phosphorus and high n p ratio conditions these different traits of diatoms and dinoflagellates resulted in the fact that both the effect of warming resulting in nutrients decline as a consequence of increasing stratification and the effect of increasing terrestrial nutrient input as a result of eutrophication might promote dinoflagellates over diatoms we predict that conservative forecasts of environmental change by the year 2100 are likely to result in the decrease of diatoms in 60 and the increase of dinoflagellates in 70 of the surface water of the east china sea and project that mean diatoms should decrease by 19 while mean dinoflagellates should increase by 60 in the surface water of the coastal east china sea this analysis is based on a series of statistical niche models of the consequences of multiple environmental changes on diatom and dinoflagellate biomass in the east china sea based on 2815 samples randomly collected from 23 cruises spanning 14 years 2002 2015 our findings reveal that dinoflagellate blooms will be more frequent and intense which will affect coastal ecosystem functioning

have dramatic impacts on marine phytoplankton and are likely to continue for many centuries doney et al 2012 hallegraeff 2010 karl and trenberth 2003 eutrophication is a major problem in many coastal ecosystems and has resulted in large phytoplankton blooms and the expansion of low oxygen dead zones anderson et al 2002 edwards et al 2006 warming affects phytoplankton in two fundamentally different ways directly through the effect of warming on metabolic rates and indirectly through physical mixing which affects nutrient availability lewandowska et al 2014 simultaneous warming and eutrophication will have complex consequences because of interactions between the processes that are driven by nutrient supply and metabolic rates there is accumulating evidence that the intensity of the response differs considerably across taxa these changes may therefore cause a shift in phytoplankton community structure barton et al 2016 edwards and richardson 2004 irwin et al 2012 wells et al 2015 xie et al 2015 within the phytoplankton community the consequences for diatoms and dinoflagellates are a major concern because these taxa play key roles in ecosystem processes and form the basis of many aquatic food webs agusti et al 2014 menden deuer and lessard 2000 diatoms and dinoflagellates are two typical groups that form harmful phytoplankton blooms which can adversely affect human health as well as marine fisheries and aquaculture anderson et al 2002 moore et al 2008 in fact dinoflagellates and diatoms account for 75 and 5 of all harmful phytoplankton species respectively smayda and reynolds 2003 various theoretical arguments based on laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that phytoplankton bloom dynamics and habitat preferences can be described in terms of nutrient availability degree of mixing and or nutrient resource ratios margalef 1977 reynolds 1987 smayda and reynolds 2001 2003 tilman 1977 all of these factors are closely correlated with coastal eutrophication and surface layer warming while numerous studies have shown that the relative abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates varies in response to regional climate warming contrasting results can be obtained hinder et al 2012 leterme et al 2005 2006 xie et al 2015 because the net effect of warming depends on other environmental changes quantitative predictive models that consider the effects of temperature and nutrient interactions on the concentrations of diatoms and dinoflagellates are still in their infancy for the lack of sufficient real time data glibert et al 2010 moore et al 2008 wells et al 2015 in this study we developed a series of statistical niche models to explore the existing relationships between the diatom and dinoflagellate biomass and environmental factors and to project the biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates in response to future environmental changes using an extensive dataset of coastal phytoplankton community composition and water quality from the entire euphotic zone in the east china sea ecs a region that is affected by both eutrophication and warming and that is important to biogeochemical cycles and fisheries previous studies have demonstrated that diatoms are dominant during much of the year in the ecs but dinoflagellates become important during late spring blooms guo et al 2014 long term studies have found that the relative biomass of diatoms compared to dinoflagellates has decreased during a time of increasing coastal eutrophication jiang et al 2014 tang et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 our earlier work revealed that differences in the responses of diatoms and dinoflagellates to temperature may result in the earlier occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms liu et al 2016 here we further propose that warming combined with eutrophication may have a great impact on the dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the ecs 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources available material makes the ecs an ideal region for studying the effects of environmental changes on phytoplankton community dynamics see si 1 we conducted 23 cruises spanning 14 years 2002 2015 and obtained 2815 pigment samples in the ecs fig 1 table s1 the cruises took place in all four seasons and during most months of the year stations were located irregularly in space and were not all the same between cruises data density was greatest near the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters fig 1 temperature salinity and water pressure were determined at every station from casts of a sea bird ctd fitted with a sea tech fluorometer using niskin bottles attached on the ctd rosette system seawater samples were taken in the euphotic zone 150 m from at least three layers the surface water 5 m the subsurface chlorophyll a chla maximum and the bottom of the euphotic zone the euphotic zone was defined as the water column down to the depth at which the downward photosynthetically active radiation par was 1 of the value just below the surface par was made using a free fall spectroradiometer spmr satlantic just prior to water sampling nutrient concentrations were determined by professional laboratories han et al 2012 liu et al 2016 to avoid issues with detection limits nutrient concentrations below the detection limit were deemed as the value of detection limit samples for phytoplankton pigment analysis were collected at every station on all cruises pigment concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc following the method presented by furuya et al 2003 and are reported in detail by liu et al 2012 the long term sea surface chla mg m 3 from august 1997 to january 2015 was extracted from multiple satellite products avhrr quikscat seawifs and modis aqua the resolutions of these four databases were 0 044 0 25 0 1 and 0 05 respectively 2 2 generalized additive mixed models to explore how temperature and nutrients influence the dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates we developed a series of generalized additive mixed models gamms which are an extension of gams see si 2 wood 2006 zuur et al 2009 fucoxanthin c f and peridinin c p concentration were used as response variables fucoxanthin and peridinin are the diagnostic photosynthetic pigments of diatoms and autotrophic peridinin containing dinoflagellates respectively roy et al 2011 phytoplankton community structure determined from diagnostic pigment concentration is widely used because it is easier to obtain high resolution data relative to microscopic and molecular methods peloquin et al 2013 temperature c salinity psu nitrate nitrite nox μmol l 1 soluble reactive phosphorus po4 μmol l 1 and the ratio of nox and po4 n p were taken as potential environmental explanatory variables silicate sio3 μmol l 1 was not incorporated into the models for reasons that silicate is usually not limiting in the ecs guo et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 and that its effect co varied with nox and or po4 during our initial test tchla the sum of chla plus divinyl chlorophyll a ng l 1 geographic and temporal parameters longitude latitude depth month were incorporated into the models as proxies for some missing parameters driving phytoplankton dynamics e g grazing light in order to account for the potential influence of the different measuring instruments we added a nominal variable representing the measurement effect for each group of cruises table s1 of all these variables we focus on the results of temperature and nutrient parameters which are most likely to change in the future before modeling we used cleveland dot plots and boxplots to check for potential outliers in both response and explanatory variables and used pairplots to check for collinearity between the explanatory variables after quality control we had 2809 observations of c f and 1998 observations of c p remaining c f c p tchla nox po4 and n p ratio were ln transformed figs s1 and s2 see si 2 to reduce collinearity we built a set of models models f1 f3 p1 p3 that use nox as the metric of nutrient availability a similar set of models models f4 f5 p4 p5 that use po4 for comparison and a set of models that use the n p ratio instead models f6 f7 p6 p7 among which a set of models models f3 p3 f5 p5 f6 p6 treated nutrient parameters as independent variables and another set of models models f1 f2 p1 p2 f4 p4 f7 p7 assumed interactions between temperature and nutrients table s2 the model without interaction between temperature and nutrient nox po4 or n p was 1 lny α a i s longitude latitude s temperature s nutrient s tchl a s salinity s depth s month ε while the model with temperature and nutrient interaction was 2 lny α a i s longitude latitude te temperature nutrient s tchl a s salinity s depth s month ε where y represents c f or c p and i denotes measuring instrument the term α is a grand mean the term ɑ i is a random intercept assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance σ a 2 which allows for random variation around the intercept and reflects between measurement variability the term s indicates a one dimensional nonlinear function based on cubic regression spline and te a two dimensional effect based on tensor product spline the two models are nested because te temperature nutrient contains s temperature s nutrient and their interaction the term ε represents within measurement variability and it is assumed to independently normally distributed with variance σ 2 furthermore the σ 2 is assumed allowing heterogeneity between months as the homogeneity assumption was violated along the month effect fig s3 see si 3 2 3 generalized linear models to simulate the effect of interactions of temperature and nutrients on the relative biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates we formulated a more robust generalized linear model glm in this model only samples of the upper 15 m were used the samples were divided into 64 bins on the basis of every 2 5 c in temperature and every 1 interval in ln transformed po4 concentrations the medians of each parameter in each bin were extracted instead of the raw data after removing those bins with less than 3 samples we had 37 available bins remaining we used the ratio of peridinin fucoxanthin c p c f instead of their absolute concentrations as the response variable temperature nox and po4 concentrations were taken as the explanatory variables the model was formulated as follows 3 c p c f a 0 4 b 0 4 c 0 4 β a b c temperature a no x b po 4 c a b c 4 which produced 25 independent variables table s4 the term β a b c is the coefficient of each variable it will be the intercept when a b and c equate zero at the same time we assumed a gamma distribution with log link function to keep the fitted ratio of c p c f more than zero model optimization was based on the aic value and the t statistic i e dropping the variables that did not reduce the aic value significantly step by step and dropping those variables that did not significantly correlated with c p c f judged by the t statistic model simulations were conducted by assuming possible changes in temperature and nutrients concentration the actual data showed the nox concentration was linearly correlated with the po4 concentration but the slope was dependent on the po4 concentration fig s4a in addition the n p ratio was nonlinearly correlated with temperature fig s4b we took this into account by linking nox as the function of po4 and temperature the model formation was built as follows 4 ln no x α β 1 ln po 4 s temperature where α is the intercept and β the slope of ln po4 the s temperature term means a cubic regression spline for the temperature the model accounted for 93 of the variance of logarithms of nox concentration then we calculate nox from po4 and temperature based on this equation all analyses were done using r in version 3 2 2 r development core team 2016 the gamms and gams were fitted with the mgcv gams with gcv smoothness estimation and gamms by reml ml wood 2006 package 3 results 3 1 long term variations of phytoplankton in the ecs long term sea surface chla concentration in our study area from multiple satellite products displayed a clear seasonal cycle in each year fig 2 a the maximum in chla occurred in spring followed by another peak in summer the magnitude of the spring algal bloom appeared to increase since 2000 except the last two years fig 2a monthly averaged tchla concentrations collected from our field observations matched well with satellite derived chla r 0 55 p 0 01 after removing four observations with tchla concentration greater than 2 5 mg m 3 given the uncertainty of satellite data and irregularity of our sampling areas the ratio of surface peridinin fucoxanthin increased during the last 10 years fig 2b high fucoxanthin occurred in early spring and summer fig s3a high peridinin values were found in late spring and summer fig s3b 3 2 partial effects of temperature and nutrients on cf and cp temperature was significantly correlated with both c f and c p with different relationships fig 3 a and b after keeping other parameters constant the partial effect of temperature on c f was significantly positive below 24 c and strongly negative above 24 c there was a plateau of high c f at temperatures of 20 24 c fig 3a c p was less sensitive to temperature than c f fig 3b c p was positively correlated with temperature in the approximate range 13 26 c insensitive to temperature at temperatures of 10 13 c and negatively correlated with temperature at temperatures of 26 30 c fig 3b the optimum temperature for c f was roughly 24 c versus 26 c for c p and the decline of c f at temperatures exceeding 24 c was much more precipitous than the analogous decline of c p at temperatures exceeding 26 c fig 3a and b these results suggest that peridinin containing dinoflagellates are better able to tolerate high temperatures than fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton both c f and c p responded nonlinearly to nutrient concentrations fig 3c f nox was positively correlated with c f at nox concentrations less than 6 μmol l 1 fig 3c c p was positively correlated with nox at nox concentrations less than 1 μmol l 1 but negatively correlated thereafter fig 3d when po4 was used as the independent variable instead of nox its effect on c f was qualitatively similar to that of nox c f and po4 were positively correlated at po4 concentrations below 0 3 μmol l 1 but there was no correlation at higher po4 concentrations fig 3e there was no highly significant correlation t test p 0 2 between po4 and c p across the range of po4 concentrations in the database 0 01 μmol l 1 to 2 7 μmol l 1 fig 3f the indication being that c p may not be sensitive to phosphate concentrations these trends also show that optimal nox and po4 concentrations for c f are much higher than those for c p the clear indication being that peridinin containing dinoflagellates tend to dominate at nutrient concentrations lower than those associated with fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton dominance c f and c p have an opposite relationship with n p ratio fig 3g and h the relationship between n p and c f was unimodal with maximum c f values at n p ratio of 16 fig 3g the correlation between n p and c p was positive across the observed range of n p ratios 0 2 300 but there was a local minimum at a n p of 16 fig 3h 3 3 combined effects of temperature and nutrients on cf and cp the interactions between temperature and nutrient concentrations were significantly correlated with both c f and c p p 0 0001 table s3 and inclusion of these interactions produced statistically better results than the models assuming no interaction table s2 see f2 p2 versus f3 p3 f4 p4 versus f5 p5 and f6 p6 versus f7 p7 the nature of the interaction between temperature and nox was clear in the case of c f fig 4 a the negative correlation between c f and temperature estimated from the partial temperature effect fig 3a for temperatures above 20 c was apparent but the magnitude of the slope was negatively correlated with nox concentrations fig 4a the implication is that fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton are better able to tolerate supraoptimal temperatures at relatively high nox concentrations the response of c p to the interaction of temperature and nox however was rather complex fig 4d c p remained relatively low but with two obvious peaks at temperatures of 18 c and 25 c and the corresponding nox concentrations were both around 1 μmol l 1 which is consistent with the partial nox effect fig 3d the interactive model of the effects of temperature and po4 on c f produced results qualitatively similar to the results of the interactive model with temperature and nox although the response surface was more complex fig 4b the effect of interactions between temperature and po4 on c p fig 4e was quite different from that of temperature and nox the model results showed high c p values in some regions where c f values were low fig 4b e at the lowest po4 concentrations c p increased dramatically with increasing temperature at intermediate po4 concentrations there was a maximum c p at a temperature of 18 c at higher po4 concentrations c p was relatively insensitive to temperature the results of these models models p2 p4 and p6 table s2 imply that the relationship between c p and temperature depends on the po4 concentration fig 4e use of n p and temperature as independent variables revealed relationships with c f and c p that were less complex than was the case when nutrient availability was quantified in terms of nutrient concentrations fig 4c f the temperature n p models suggested that c f would exceed e4 55 under most conditions fig 4c whereas c p exceeded e3 20 mostly at temperatures above 22 c and n p higher than 100 fig 4f the highest c f values were associated with n p ratios of roughly 16 and temperatures of 20 24 c fig 4c in contrast relatively high c p values were estimated at around 18 c and between 25 and 28 c when n p ratios are low and at temperatures upon 18 c when n p ratios are high fig 4f the implication of the model is that the interaction of temperature and the relative concentration of nutrients plays an important role in the outcome of competition between fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton and peridinin containing dinoflagellates in the ecs 3 4 relations of the cp cf ratio to interactions of temperature and nutrient stoichiometry the c p c f ratio showed higher values at 18 c and at above 26 c fig 5 there was a clear interaction between temperature and po4 concentration fig 5a a negative correlation was found between temperature and the c p c f ratio at po4 concentrations greater than 0 8 μmol l 1 at po4 concentrations between 0 4 μmol l 1 and 0 8 μmol l 1 there was a positive correlation between temperature and the c p c f ratio at po4 concentrations less than 0 4 μmol l 1 there was a minimum of the c p c f ratio at intermediate temperatures the ratio became higher at lower higher temperature end members the c p c f ratio was also correlated with the interaction of temperature and nox concentration it is clear that the higher ratios at 18 c occurred at nox concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μmol l 1 and the higher ratios at higher extreme temperatures occurred at nox concentrations less than 5 μmol l 1 fig 5b the implication is that the succession of fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton and peridinin containing dinoflagellates do depend on the absolute concentration of the limiting nutrient while which nutrient is limiting depends on the ambient n p ratio based on the relationships between the c p c f ratio and the interactions of temperature and nutrient concentrations we formulated a glm model equation 3 table s4 this model accounted for 97 of the variance of the c p c f ratio with the residuals showing no heterogeneity with respect to temperature fig s5 then we simulated the relationship of the c p c f ratio and temperature at three constant po4 concentrations 0 05 μmol l 1 0 25 μmol l 1 and 0 6 μmol l 1 based on this model when we assumed the molar n p ratio to be constant and equal to 16 1 the simulations presumably reflected the trends in the actual data at po4 concentrations less than 0 25 μmol l 1 but deviated from the actual data at higher po4 concentrations fig 5a and fig s6a we therefore assumed that the n p ratio varied from 8 to 32 comparing with the actual data we found that different temperatures selected for different optimum n p ratios lower temperature selected for a higher n p ratio whereas higher temperature selected for a lower n p ratio fig s6b the explanation is that in the ocean the dissolved n p ratio is not constant the data showed that the nox concentration was positively correlated with the po4 concentration and n p ratio variability was dependent on both the po4 concentration and the temperature fig s4a b we therefore calculated nox from po4 and temperature through equation 4 and repeated the simulations fig 6 3 5 future responses of cf and cp to warming and eutrophication future changes in the c f and c p as a result of warming and eutrophication are not straightforward to anticipate because the effects of temperature nutrients and their interaction are all significant because we obtained clear relationships of the interaction of temperature and n p ratio to c f and c p using gamm models f6 and p6 table s2 we simulated surface c f and c p concentrations based on assumed surface temperatures increases of 2 c and n p ratio increases of e2 7 4 while leaving other parameters constant the predicted c f concentrations decreased significantly t test p 0 05 with 60 stations showing decreased concentrations fig 7 a in contrast the predicted c p increased significantly t test p 0 05 with 70 of the stations showing an increase fig 7b the magnitude of these changes was a function of latitude and longitude most of the big changes occurred in coastal regions especially at the mouth of the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters the changes decreased in magnitude in a southeast offshore direction fig 7 we then focused on the surface waters of coastal regions with salinities less than 31 we predicted a significant decrease of c f fig 8 a and a significant increase of c p fig 8b when temperature and ln n p ratio were simultaneously increased by 0 25 c and 0 25 respectively the present surface median temperature and n p ratio in these regions are 23 0 c and e3 19 24 respectively given an increase of 2 units the values would increase to 25 c and e5 19 180 7 fold increase respectively correspondingly we predicted that the mean c f should decrease by 19 from 508 ng l 1 to 412 ng l 1 while the mean c p should increase by 60 from 334 ng l 1 to 535 ng l 1 4 discussion phytoplankton that contain peridinin are found only in the class dinophyceae roy et al 2011 although not all autotrophic dinophyceae contain peridinin zapata et al 2012 the dominant species prorocentrum donghaiense alexandrium catenella alexandrium minutum and gymnodinium catenatum in the ecs do contain guo et al 2014 zapata et al 2012 fucoxanthin fuco however is found in phytoplankton belonging to at least some species in five phytoplankton classes chrysophyceae pelagophyceae prymnesiophyceae bacillariophyceae and dinophyceae roy et al 2011 fucoxanthin is commonly associated with diatoms i e bacillariophyceae letelier et al 1993 but the presence in some of our samples of pigments such as 19 butanoyloxyfucoxanthin but and 19 hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin hex which are not associated with diatoms but are found in some species of pelagophyceae prymnesiophyceae and dinophyceae indicates that diatoms did not account for all the fucoxanthin in our samples however the fuco but and fuco hex ratios in our samples averaged 15 and 6 respectively whereas the fuco but and fuco hex ratios in dinophyceae and prymnesiophyceae for example are only about 0 5 and 0 02 respectively chang and gall 2013 letelier et al 1993 thus it seems unlikely that the fucoxanthin in our samples reflects high biomass of dinophyceae and prymnesiophyceae we do have some cases where the concentrations of but and hex exceed the fucoxanthin concentrations those cases presumably are chrysophyceae prymnesiophyceae pelagophyceae and maybe some of the dinophyceae that contain no peridinin however those are all cases where the fucoxanthin concentrations are low fig s7 another possible source of fucoxanthin may be phaeophyta but such macroalgae are usually benthic and unlikely to be contained in our water samples in our previous study diagnostic pigment concentration in the ecs was comparable to the microscopy results based on morphology liu et al 2016 thus we feel confident in assuming that most of the fucoxanthin and peridinin in our samples was associated with diatoms and dinoflagellates respectively and that all of the high fucoxanthin concentrations were the result of diatom blooms based on the raw data our gamm model revealed that c f exceeded c p in the ecs when nox and po4 concentrations were relatively high fig 3c e the c p concentrations were relatively high when po4 concentrations were less than 0 1 μmol l 1 but nox concentrations were higher than 0 5 μmol l 1 fig 3d f these patterns in fact seem reasonable if we assume that most of the fucoxanthin was associated with diatoms diatoms tend to have a competitive advantage when nutrient concentrations are high for several reasons diatoms are typically r strategists species tolerant of shear stress forces in physically disturbed water masses alves de souza et al 2008 and tend to have high maximum carbon specific nutrient uptake rates and disproportionately large storage vacuoles edwards et al 2012 litchman and klausmeier 2008 dinoflagellates however may replace diatoms by using multiple growth strategies c colonist species which predominate in chemically disturbed habitats s nutrient stress tolerant species and r to exploit abiotic habitats that support them smayda and reynolds 2003 dinoflagellate have an intrinsically high affinity for phosphate and the ability to utilize organic phosphorus compounds via alkaline phosphatase e g p donghaiense huang et al 2005 as well as mixotrophic and vertical migration capabilities as a group dinoflagellates are not very sensitive to nutrient conditions we found that lower temperatures favored diatoms and that higher temperatures inhibited the growth of diatoms that dinoflagellates were less sensitive to temperature than diatoms fig 3a and b is inconsistent with a previous found that the adaptive temperature range of diatoms skeletonema costatum 15 25 c is wider than that of dinoflagellates p donghaiense 20 25 c wang et al 2006 and the global scenario that diatoms have a wider thermal tolerance than dinoflagellates chen 2015 however we found that the temperature effect was very dependent on the nutrient regime a consequence of either species specific variations or an interact effect of the temperature and the nutrient regime on the same dominant species the result showed that diatoms can tolerate higher temperatures at high nutrient nox and po4 concentrations than at low nutrient concentrations fig 4a c the implication is that the response of diatoms to high temperature may not be a consequence of an inherent metabolic intolerance to supraoptimal temperatures as long as the temperature stress is not accompanied by the additional stress of nutrient limitation thermal stratification of marine waters will increase as a consequence of global warming which will inhibit nutrient inputs from waters below the mixed layer in the offshore waters of the ecs a reduced degree of mixing in the summer results in low nutrient availability which inhibits the growth of diatoms but has no apparent negative effect on s strategist dinoflagellate species such species include the harmful unarmored dinoflagellate cochlodinium polykrikoides which prefers a temperature of 27 c matsuoka et al 2010 in the coastal waters there is a continuous input of terrestrial nutrients from the changjiang river even when the seawater is stratified and that input benefits diatoms furuya et al 2003 high nutrient concentrations that benefit diatoms also occur in the changjiang diluted water front where it mixes with the taiwan warm current water and in the upwelling zones in the coastal waters of zhejiang and fujian provinces tang et al 2006 where diatom blooms have been reported however dinoflagellates may replace diatoms in any of these areas if there is a relaxation of the processes that deliver the allochthonous nutrients smayda 2010 for example well known late spring dinoflagellate blooms gymnodinium and prorocentrum species occur at temperatures of 18 c when nutrient concentrations are low after the phosphate has been consumed by diatoms and there is still some nitrogen remaining this phenomenon has been reported in the ecs guo et al 2014 and in other coastal and shelf areas anderson et al 2002 heisler et al 2008 similarly we found that during the summer changjiang diluted water characterized by both high temperatures and high nutrient concentrations can be a site of dinoflagellate blooms fig 4d f perhaps due to the combined ability of r and s strategists to tolerate high turbulence and phosphate depletion but otherwise eutrophic conditions the biomass of diatoms relative to that of dinoflagellates decreased from 1959 to 2009 in the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters in summer jiang et al 2014 our data fig 2 and model results indicate that this pattern may have been enhanced in the past several years using surface microscopy data dominated by pseudo nitzschia delicatissima thalassionema nitzschioides paralia sulcata and skeletonema sp for diatoms and p donghainese scrippsiella trochoidea and g lohmanni for dinoflagellates collected from cruises c1 c4 table s1 guo et al 2014 has obtained a decreasing trend for diatoms against n p ratio and an opposite trend for dinoflagellates against n p ratio our analysis of temperature and n p ratios provides additional insight into the dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the ecs an analysis of the gamm results fig 4 and an analysis of the medians of the bins of the glm results figs 5 and 6 revealed that the n p ratio may be a factor that drives the succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates and that the effect of the n p ratio is a function of temperature the n p ratio in algal biomass is positively correlated with temperature at the global scale yvon durocher et al 2015 and the external n p ratio is negatively correlated with temperature in the ecs fig s4b the implication is that the algal internal n p ratio will exceed the external n p ratio when the temperature is higher than a threshold because the internal n p ratio of dinoflagellates is generally higher than that of diatoms john and flynn 2000 rhee and gotham 1981 the high n p ratios of particulate matter at high temperatures was probably accounted for by the greater biomass of dinoflagellates the indication being that high temperatures favor dinoflagellates in the ecs in addition according to the resource ratio theory rhee and gotham 1981 tilman 1977 if the maximum growth rates of diatoms and dinoflagellates are similar diatoms will competitively eliminate dinoflagellates when external n p ratios are low whereas mixotrophic dinoflagellates will prevail when the external n p ratios are high given the fact that dinoflagellates typically have lower growth rates than do diatoms of a comparable size finkel et al 2010 the internal n p ratio must be lower for diatoms than dinoflagellates klausmeier et al 2004a 2004b the winner of the competition will therefore tend to be mixotrophic dinoflagellates when the external n p ratios are high a conclusion consistent with our observations that high n p ratios favor dinoflagellates in the ecs and a previous report that a high n p condition is more likely to promote species that have slow growth rates glibert and burkholder 2011 the n p ratio 26 20 at po4 concentrations less than 0 08 μmol l 1 was obviously higher than the n p ratio 17 8 at higher po4 concentrations the ratio of c p c f was significantly higher for po4 0 08 μmol l 1 than at the latter conditions kruskal wallis rank sum test p 0 001 fig s4c because there is evidence that the internal n p ratio is highest under phosphorus limited conditions compared to the condition of abundant resources and conditions limited by light or nitrogen klausmeier et al 2004a the dominance of dinoflagellate under high n p conditions is expected in the ecs the glm model reflected the fact that the spring dinoflagellate blooms became weaker with increasing po4 concentrations but became stronger with increasing n p ratios fig 6 and fig s6b projecting future changes of these blooms requires knowing what will happen to nutrient concentrations as a result of eutrophication assuming a c chla ratio of 50 by weight and a c n ratio of 5 68 by weight laws 1991 laws and redalje 1979 laws and wong 1979 we estimated that the percentage of nitrogen in phytoplankton was negatively correlated with nutrient concentrations and this relationship was rather insensitive to the assumed c chla and c n ratio fig s8 therefore low ambient nutrient concentrations were the result of phytoplankton taking up a large fraction of the nutrients in accord with this logic we hypothesized that there would be an increase in phytoplankton as a result of eutrophication instead of an increase of inorganic nutrient concentrations previous studies have demonstrated that the nitrogen in the ecs has been increasing while the phosphorus has been decreasing slightly as a result of the long term increase in the changjiang river discharge and an increase in nitrogen fertilizer use in china jiang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 the regression lines between nox and po4 would therefore move toward the left and up fig s4a the result would be more phosphate limited situations leading to higher n p ratios and such conditions would favor dinoflagellates to predict the future responses of diatom and dinoflagellate biomass to combined effects of warming and eutrophication we assumed a 2 c increase in water temperatures and 7 4 fold increase in the n p ratio and focused on the surface water of coastal regions with salinity less than 31 gong et al 1996 the surface waters of the ecs underwent a significant warming at a rate of 0 09 c per decade during 1870 2011 bao and ren 2014 the largest warming trend occurred in the mouth of the changjiang river where the annual mean warming rate exceeded 2 4 c per century liu and zhang 2013 and exceeded 0 49 c per decade in the summer jiang et al 2014 if this warming trend continues it is reasonable to assume that there will be a temperature rise of at least 2 c by 2100 in the surface waters of much of the ecs in addition to warming anthropogenic activities have led to a shift in the nutrient regime in the ecs especially in the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters where the n p ratio has been steadily increasing zhou et al 2008 and the observed average molar n p ratio in 2010 reached about 200 jiang et al 2014 as a result of the increase of nitrogen fertilizer use in china our presumptive future n p ratio of about 180 will therefore likely be an underestimate at least near the changjiang river estuary we predict that the mean c f should decrease by 19 and the mean c p should increase by 60 as the temperature increases by 2 c these decrease in c f and increase in c p reflect a shift from diatoms to dinoflagellates over the next century as proposed previously jiang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 we did not project changes of temperature beyond the year 2100 because it is unclear whether phytoplankton will adapt to future niches over time irwin et al 2015 changes beyond 2100 could have even more serious implications than the changes we have projected we did not project changes of n p ratio over 180 because such situations may be more complicated than we assumed here for instance although silicate is not limiting in the ecs at present increasing nitrogen input and diatom consumption will result in a decrease of si n ratio jiang et al 2014 and silicate may be the limiting factor for diatoms someday it is important to realize that the influence of changes in irradiance may alter phytoplankton community composition barton et al 2015 edwards et al 2015 but we do not feel that the predictions of our model are seriously compromised by the absence of irradiance because the indirect effect of this factor is accounted for approximately by the variables we considered in this study temperature irradiance nutrient concentrations and ratios and changes in these variables co vary irwin et al 2012 litchman and klausmeier 2008 an important caveat is that we did not consider the effect of grazing because high resolution sampling of processes such as grazing is difficult because observations in the china seas have shown that microzooplankton grazing is enhanced in eutrophic ecosystems chen et al 2012 zheng et al 2015 further study is needed to explore the effect of grazing to make more realistic predictions about the impact of future climate scenarios 5 conclusions we determined a series of quantitative functional responses of diatom and dinoflagellate biomass c f and c p resulting from the interaction of temperature and nutrient concentrations or ratios such interaction is key in driving the succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the ecs we project that decreases in diatom biomass c f of 19 should occur in 60 of stations while increases in dinoflagellate biomass c p of 60 should occur in 70 of stations as a result of anthropogenic changes in temperature and nutrient inputs such a shift projects a more important role of dinoflagellates in this coastal ecosystem including a change in the timing and increase in the spatial extent and frequency of dinoflagellate blooms these changes may be responsible for a decrease of fish production and an increase of gelatinous organisms such as jellyfish in the ecs jiang et al 2008 because the sinking rate of dinoflagellates is lower than that of diatoms guo et al 2015 these changes may also reduce the efficiency of the biological pump in the ecs such a shift in phytoplankton community structure from diatoms to dinoflagellates should be taken into consideration in future studies of global climate models carbon cycling and fishery yields acknowledgements this work was supported by grants from the national key research and development program of china no 2016yfa0601201 the china nsf nos

19876,temperature change and eutrophication are known to affect phytoplankton communities but relatively little is known about the effects of interactions between simultaneous changes of temperature and nutrient loading in coastal ecosystems here we show that such interaction is key in driving diatom dinoflagellate dynamics in the east china sea diatoms and dinoflagellates responded differently to temperature nutrient concentrations and ratios and their interactions diatoms preferred lower temperature and higher nutrient concentrations while dinoflagellates were less sensitive to temperature and nutrient concentrations but tended to prevail at low phosphorus and high n p ratio conditions these different traits of diatoms and dinoflagellates resulted in the fact that both the effect of warming resulting in nutrients decline as a consequence of increasing stratification and the effect of increasing terrestrial nutrient input as a result of eutrophication might promote dinoflagellates over diatoms we predict that conservative forecasts of environmental change by the year 2100 are likely to result in the decrease of diatoms in 60 and the increase of dinoflagellates in 70 of the surface water of the east china sea and project that mean diatoms should decrease by 19 while mean dinoflagellates should increase by 60 in the surface water of the coastal east china sea this analysis is based on a series of statistical niche models of the consequences of multiple environmental changes on diatom and dinoflagellate biomass in the east china sea based on 2815 samples randomly collected from 23 cruises spanning 14 years 2002 2015 our findings reveal that dinoflagellate blooms will be more frequent and intense which will affect coastal ecosystem functioning

have dramatic impacts on marine phytoplankton and are likely to continue for many centuries doney et al 2012 hallegraeff 2010 karl and trenberth 2003 eutrophication is a major problem in many coastal ecosystems and has resulted in large phytoplankton blooms and the expansion of low oxygen dead zones anderson et al 2002 edwards et al 2006 warming affects phytoplankton in two fundamentally different ways directly through the effect of warming on metabolic rates and indirectly through physical mixing which affects nutrient availability lewandowska et al 2014 simultaneous warming and eutrophication will have complex consequences because of interactions between the processes that are driven by nutrient supply and metabolic rates there is accumulating evidence that the intensity of the response differs considerably across taxa these changes may therefore cause a shift in phytoplankton community structure barton et al 2016 edwards and richardson 2004 irwin et al 2012 wells et al 2015 xie et al 2015 within the phytoplankton community the consequences for diatoms and dinoflagellates are a major concern because these taxa play key roles in ecosystem processes and form the basis of many aquatic food webs agusti et al 2014 menden deuer and lessard 2000 diatoms and dinoflagellates are two typical groups that form harmful phytoplankton blooms which can adversely affect human health as well as marine fisheries and aquaculture anderson et al 2002 moore et al 2008 in fact dinoflagellates and diatoms account for 75 and 5 of all harmful phytoplankton species respectively smayda and reynolds 2003 various theoretical arguments based on laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that phytoplankton bloom dynamics and habitat preferences can be described in terms of nutrient availability degree of mixing and or nutrient resource ratios margalef 1977 reynolds 1987 smayda and reynolds 2001 2003 tilman 1977 all of these factors are closely correlated with coastal eutrophication and surface layer warming while numerous studies have shown that the relative abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates varies in response to regional climate warming contrasting results can be obtained hinder et al 2012 leterme et al 2005 2006 xie et al 2015 because the net effect of warming depends on other environmental changes quantitative predictive models that consider the effects of temperature and nutrient interactions on the concentrations of diatoms and dinoflagellates are still in their infancy for the lack of sufficient real time data glibert et al 2010 moore et al 2008 wells et al 2015 in this study we developed a series of statistical niche models to explore the existing relationships between the diatom and dinoflagellate biomass and environmental factors and to project the biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates in response to future environmental changes using an extensive dataset of coastal phytoplankton community composition and water quality from the entire euphotic zone in the east china sea ecs a region that is affected by both eutrophication and warming and that is important to biogeochemical cycles and fisheries previous studies have demonstrated that diatoms are dominant during much of the year in the ecs but dinoflagellates become important during late spring blooms guo et al 2014 long term studies have found that the relative biomass of diatoms compared to dinoflagellates has decreased during a time of increasing coastal eutrophication jiang et al 2014 tang et al 2006 zhou et al 2008 our earlier work revealed that differences in the responses of diatoms and dinoflagellates to temperature may result in the earlier occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms liu et al 2016 here we further propose that warming combined with eutrophication may have a great impact on the dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the ecs 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources available material makes the ecs an ideal region for studying the effects of environmental changes on phytoplankton community dynamics see si 1 we conducted 23 cruises spanning 14 years 2002 2015 and obtained 2815 pigment samples in the ecs fig 1 table s1 the cruises took place in all four seasons and during most months of the year stations were located irregularly in space and were not all the same between cruises data density was greatest near the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters fig 1 temperature salinity and water pressure were determined at every station from casts of a sea bird ctd fitted with a sea tech fluorometer using niskin bottles attached on the ctd rosette system seawater samples were taken in the euphotic zone 150 m from at least three layers the surface water 5 m the subsurface chlorophyll a chla maximum and the bottom of the euphotic zone the euphotic zone was defined as the water column down to the depth at which the downward photosynthetically active radiation par was 1 of the value just below the surface par was made using a free fall spectroradiometer spmr satlantic just prior to water sampling nutrient concentrations were determined by professional laboratories han et al 2012 liu et al 2016 to avoid issues with detection limits nutrient concentrations below the detection limit were deemed as the value of detection limit samples for phytoplankton pigment analysis were collected at every station on all cruises pigment concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc following the method presented by furuya et al 2003 and are reported in detail by liu et al 2012 the long term sea surface chla mg m 3 from august 1997 to january 2015 was extracted from multiple satellite products avhrr quikscat seawifs and modis aqua the resolutions of these four databases were 0 044 0 25 0 1 and 0 05 respectively 2 2 generalized additive mixed models to explore how temperature and nutrients influence the dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates we developed a series of generalized additive mixed models gamms which are an extension of gams see si 2 wood 2006 zuur et al 2009 fucoxanthin c f and peridinin c p concentration were used as response variables fucoxanthin and peridinin are the diagnostic photosynthetic pigments of diatoms and autotrophic peridinin containing dinoflagellates respectively roy et al 2011 phytoplankton community structure determined from diagnostic pigment concentration is widely used because it is easier to obtain high resolution data relative to microscopic and molecular methods peloquin et al 2013 temperature c salinity psu nitrate nitrite nox μmol l 1 soluble reactive phosphorus po4 μmol l 1 and the ratio of nox and po4 n p were taken as potential environmental explanatory variables silicate sio3 μmol l 1 was not incorporated into the models for reasons that silicate is usually not limiting in the ecs guo et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 and that its effect co varied with nox and or po4 during our initial test tchla the sum of chla plus divinyl chlorophyll a ng l 1 geographic and temporal parameters longitude latitude depth month were incorporated into the models as proxies for some missing parameters driving phytoplankton dynamics e g grazing light in order to account for the potential influence of the different measuring instruments we added a nominal variable representing the measurement effect for each group of cruises table s1 of all these variables we focus on the results of temperature and nutrient parameters which are most likely to change in the future before modeling we used cleveland dot plots and boxplots to check for potential outliers in both response and explanatory variables and used pairplots to check for collinearity between the explanatory variables after quality control we had 2809 observations of c f and 1998 observations of c p remaining c f c p tchla nox po4 and n p ratio were ln transformed figs s1 and s2 see si 2 to reduce collinearity we built a set of models models f1 f3 p1 p3 that use nox as the metric of nutrient availability a similar set of models models f4 f5 p4 p5 that use po4 for comparison and a set of models that use the n p ratio instead models f6 f7 p6 p7 among which a set of models models f3 p3 f5 p5 f6 p6 treated nutrient parameters as independent variables and another set of models models f1 f2 p1 p2 f4 p4 f7 p7 assumed interactions between temperature and nutrients table s2 the model without interaction between temperature and nutrient nox po4 or n p was 1 lny α a i s longitude latitude s temperature s nutrient s tchl a s salinity s depth s month ε while the model with temperature and nutrient interaction was 2 lny α a i s longitude latitude te temperature nutrient s tchl a s salinity s depth s month ε where y represents c f or c p and i denotes measuring instrument the term α is a grand mean the term ɑ i is a random intercept assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance σ a 2 which allows for random variation around the intercept and reflects between measurement variability the term s indicates a one dimensional nonlinear function based on cubic regression spline and te a two dimensional effect based on tensor product spline the two models are nested because te temperature nutrient contains s temperature s nutrient and their interaction the term ε represents within measurement variability and it is assumed to independently normally distributed with variance σ 2 furthermore the σ 2 is assumed allowing heterogeneity between months as the homogeneity assumption was violated along the month effect fig s3 see si 3 2 3 generalized linear models to simulate the effect of interactions of temperature and nutrients on the relative biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates we formulated a more robust generalized linear model glm in this model only samples of the upper 15 m were used the samples were divided into 64 bins on the basis of every 2 5 c in temperature and every 1 interval in ln transformed po4 concentrations the medians of each parameter in each bin were extracted instead of the raw data after removing those bins with less than 3 samples we had 37 available bins remaining we used the ratio of peridinin fucoxanthin c p c f instead of their absolute concentrations as the response variable temperature nox and po4 concentrations were taken as the explanatory variables the model was formulated as follows 3 c p c f a 0 4 b 0 4 c 0 4 β a b c temperature a no x b po 4 c a b c 4 which produced 25 independent variables table s4 the term β a b c is the coefficient of each variable it will be the intercept when a b and c equate zero at the same time we assumed a gamma distribution with log link function to keep the fitted ratio of c p c f more than zero model optimization was based on the aic value and the t statistic i e dropping the variables that did not reduce the aic value significantly step by step and dropping those variables that did not significantly correlated with c p c f judged by the t statistic model simulations were conducted by assuming possible changes in temperature and nutrients concentration the actual data showed the nox concentration was linearly correlated with the po4 concentration but the slope was dependent on the po4 concentration fig s4a in addition the n p ratio was nonlinearly correlated with temperature fig s4b we took this into account by linking nox as the function of po4 and temperature the model formation was built as follows 4 ln no x α β 1 ln po 4 s temperature where α is the intercept and β the slope of ln po4 the s temperature term means a cubic regression spline for the temperature the model accounted for 93 of the variance of logarithms of nox concentration then we calculate nox from po4 and temperature based on this equation all analyses were done using r in version 3 2 2 r development core team 2016 the gamms and gams were fitted with the mgcv gams with gcv smoothness estimation and gamms by reml ml wood 2006 package 3 results 3 1 long term variations of phytoplankton in the ecs long term sea surface chla concentration in our study area from multiple satellite products displayed a clear seasonal cycle in each year fig 2 a the maximum in chla occurred in spring followed by another peak in summer the magnitude of the spring algal bloom appeared to increase since 2000 except the last two years fig 2a monthly averaged tchla concentrations collected from our field observations matched well with satellite derived chla r 0 55 p 0 01 after removing four observations with tchla concentration greater than 2 5 mg m 3 given the uncertainty of satellite data and irregularity of our sampling areas the ratio of surface peridinin fucoxanthin increased during the last 10 years fig 2b high fucoxanthin occurred in early spring and summer fig s3a high peridinin values were found in late spring and summer fig s3b 3 2 partial effects of temperature and nutrients on cf and cp temperature was significantly correlated with both c f and c p with different relationships fig 3 a and b after keeping other parameters constant the partial effect of temperature on c f was significantly positive below 24 c and strongly negative above 24 c there was a plateau of high c f at temperatures of 20 24 c fig 3a c p was less sensitive to temperature than c f fig 3b c p was positively correlated with temperature in the approximate range 13 26 c insensitive to temperature at temperatures of 10 13 c and negatively correlated with temperature at temperatures of 26 30 c fig 3b the optimum temperature for c f was roughly 24 c versus 26 c for c p and the decline of c f at temperatures exceeding 24 c was much more precipitous than the analogous decline of c p at temperatures exceeding 26 c fig 3a and b these results suggest that peridinin containing dinoflagellates are better able to tolerate high temperatures than fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton both c f and c p responded nonlinearly to nutrient concentrations fig 3c f nox was positively correlated with c f at nox concentrations less than 6 μmol l 1 fig 3c c p was positively correlated with nox at nox concentrations less than 1 μmol l 1 but negatively correlated thereafter fig 3d when po4 was used as the independent variable instead of nox its effect on c f was qualitatively similar to that of nox c f and po4 were positively correlated at po4 concentrations below 0 3 μmol l 1 but there was no correlation at higher po4 concentrations fig 3e there was no highly significant correlation t test p 0 2 between po4 and c p across the range of po4 concentrations in the database 0 01 μmol l 1 to 2 7 μmol l 1 fig 3f the indication being that c p may not be sensitive to phosphate concentrations these trends also show that optimal nox and po4 concentrations for c f are much higher than those for c p the clear indication being that peridinin containing dinoflagellates tend to dominate at nutrient concentrations lower than those associated with fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton dominance c f and c p have an opposite relationship with n p ratio fig 3g and h the relationship between n p and c f was unimodal with maximum c f values at n p ratio of 16 fig 3g the correlation between n p and c p was positive across the observed range of n p ratios 0 2 300 but there was a local minimum at a n p of 16 fig 3h 3 3 combined effects of temperature and nutrients on cf and cp the interactions between temperature and nutrient concentrations were significantly correlated with both c f and c p p 0 0001 table s3 and inclusion of these interactions produced statistically better results than the models assuming no interaction table s2 see f2 p2 versus f3 p3 f4 p4 versus f5 p5 and f6 p6 versus f7 p7 the nature of the interaction between temperature and nox was clear in the case of c f fig 4 a the negative correlation between c f and temperature estimated from the partial temperature effect fig 3a for temperatures above 20 c was apparent but the magnitude of the slope was negatively correlated with nox concentrations fig 4a the implication is that fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton are better able to tolerate supraoptimal temperatures at relatively high nox concentrations the response of c p to the interaction of temperature and nox however was rather complex fig 4d c p remained relatively low but with two obvious peaks at temperatures of 18 c and 25 c and the corresponding nox concentrations were both around 1 μmol l 1 which is consistent with the partial nox effect fig 3d the interactive model of the effects of temperature and po4 on c f produced results qualitatively similar to the results of the interactive model with temperature and nox although the response surface was more complex fig 4b the effect of interactions between temperature and po4 on c p fig 4e was quite different from that of temperature and nox the model results showed high c p values in some regions where c f values were low fig 4b e at the lowest po4 concentrations c p increased dramatically with increasing temperature at intermediate po4 concentrations there was a maximum c p at a temperature of 18 c at higher po4 concentrations c p was relatively insensitive to temperature the results of these models models p2 p4 and p6 table s2 imply that the relationship between c p and temperature depends on the po4 concentration fig 4e use of n p and temperature as independent variables revealed relationships with c f and c p that were less complex than was the case when nutrient availability was quantified in terms of nutrient concentrations fig 4c f the temperature n p models suggested that c f would exceed e4 55 under most conditions fig 4c whereas c p exceeded e3 20 mostly at temperatures above 22 c and n p higher than 100 fig 4f the highest c f values were associated with n p ratios of roughly 16 and temperatures of 20 24 c fig 4c in contrast relatively high c p values were estimated at around 18 c and between 25 and 28 c when n p ratios are low and at temperatures upon 18 c when n p ratios are high fig 4f the implication of the model is that the interaction of temperature and the relative concentration of nutrients plays an important role in the outcome of competition between fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton and peridinin containing dinoflagellates in the ecs 3 4 relations of the cp cf ratio to interactions of temperature and nutrient stoichiometry the c p c f ratio showed higher values at 18 c and at above 26 c fig 5 there was a clear interaction between temperature and po4 concentration fig 5a a negative correlation was found between temperature and the c p c f ratio at po4 concentrations greater than 0 8 μmol l 1 at po4 concentrations between 0 4 μmol l 1 and 0 8 μmol l 1 there was a positive correlation between temperature and the c p c f ratio at po4 concentrations less than 0 4 μmol l 1 there was a minimum of the c p c f ratio at intermediate temperatures the ratio became higher at lower higher temperature end members the c p c f ratio was also correlated with the interaction of temperature and nox concentration it is clear that the higher ratios at 18 c occurred at nox concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μmol l 1 and the higher ratios at higher extreme temperatures occurred at nox concentrations less than 5 μmol l 1 fig 5b the implication is that the succession of fucoxanthin containing phytoplankton and peridinin containing dinoflagellates do depend on the absolute concentration of the limiting nutrient while which nutrient is limiting depends on the ambient n p ratio based on the relationships between the c p c f ratio and the interactions of temperature and nutrient concentrations we formulated a glm model equation 3 table s4 this model accounted for 97 of the variance of the c p c f ratio with the residuals showing no heterogeneity with respect to temperature fig s5 then we simulated the relationship of the c p c f ratio and temperature at three constant po4 concentrations 0 05 μmol l 1 0 25 μmol l 1 and 0 6 μmol l 1 based on this model when we assumed the molar n p ratio to be constant and equal to 16 1 the simulations presumably reflected the trends in the actual data at po4 concentrations less than 0 25 μmol l 1 but deviated from the actual data at higher po4 concentrations fig 5a and fig s6a we therefore assumed that the n p ratio varied from 8 to 32 comparing with the actual data we found that different temperatures selected for different optimum n p ratios lower temperature selected for a higher n p ratio whereas higher temperature selected for a lower n p ratio fig s6b the explanation is that in the ocean the dissolved n p ratio is not constant the data showed that the nox concentration was positively correlated with the po4 concentration and n p ratio variability was dependent on both the po4 concentration and the temperature fig s4a b we therefore calculated nox from po4 and temperature through equation 4 and repeated the simulations fig 6 3 5 future responses of cf and cp to warming and eutrophication future changes in the c f and c p as a result of warming and eutrophication are not straightforward to anticipate because the effects of temperature nutrients and their interaction are all significant because we obtained clear relationships of the interaction of temperature and n p ratio to c f and c p using gamm models f6 and p6 table s2 we simulated surface c f and c p concentrations based on assumed surface temperatures increases of 2 c and n p ratio increases of e2 7 4 while leaving other parameters constant the predicted c f concentrations decreased significantly t test p 0 05 with 60 stations showing decreased concentrations fig 7 a in contrast the predicted c p increased significantly t test p 0 05 with 70 of the stations showing an increase fig 7b the magnitude of these changes was a function of latitude and longitude most of the big changes occurred in coastal regions especially at the mouth of the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters the changes decreased in magnitude in a southeast offshore direction fig 7 we then focused on the surface waters of coastal regions with salinities less than 31 we predicted a significant decrease of c f fig 8 a and a significant increase of c p fig 8b when temperature and ln n p ratio were simultaneously increased by 0 25 c and 0 25 respectively the present surface median temperature and n p ratio in these regions are 23 0 c and e3 19 24 respectively given an increase of 2 units the values would increase to 25 c and e5 19 180 7 fold increase respectively correspondingly we predicted that the mean c f should decrease by 19 from 508 ng l 1 to 412 ng l 1 while the mean c p should increase by 60 from 334 ng l 1 to 535 ng l 1 4 discussion phytoplankton that contain peridinin are found only in the class dinophyceae roy et al 2011 although not all autotrophic dinophyceae contain peridinin zapata et al 2012 the dominant species prorocentrum donghaiense alexandrium catenella alexandrium minutum and gymnodinium catenatum in the ecs do contain guo et al 2014 zapata et al 2012 fucoxanthin fuco however is found in phytoplankton belonging to at least some species in five phytoplankton classes chrysophyceae pelagophyceae prymnesiophyceae bacillariophyceae and dinophyceae roy et al 2011 fucoxanthin is commonly associated with diatoms i e bacillariophyceae letelier et al 1993 but the presence in some of our samples of pigments such as 19 butanoyloxyfucoxanthin but and 19 hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin hex which are not associated with diatoms but are found in some species of pelagophyceae prymnesiophyceae and dinophyceae indicates that diatoms did not account for all the fucoxanthin in our samples however the fuco but and fuco hex ratios in our samples averaged 15 and 6 respectively whereas the fuco but and fuco hex ratios in dinophyceae and prymnesiophyceae for example are only about 0 5 and 0 02 respectively chang and gall 2013 letelier et al 1993 thus it seems unlikely that the fucoxanthin in our samples reflects high biomass of dinophyceae and prymnesiophyceae we do have some cases where the concentrations of but and hex exceed the fucoxanthin concentrations those cases presumably are chrysophyceae prymnesiophyceae pelagophyceae and maybe some of the dinophyceae that contain no peridinin however those are all cases where the fucoxanthin concentrations are low fig s7 another possible source of fucoxanthin may be phaeophyta but such macroalgae are usually benthic and unlikely to be contained in our water samples in our previous study diagnostic pigment concentration in the ecs was comparable to the microscopy results based on morphology liu et al 2016 thus we feel confident in assuming that most of the fucoxanthin and peridinin in our samples was associated with diatoms and dinoflagellates respectively and that all of the high fucoxanthin concentrations were the result of diatom blooms based on the raw data our gamm model revealed that c f exceeded c p in the ecs when nox and po4 concentrations were relatively high fig 3c e the c p concentrations were relatively high when po4 concentrations were less than 0 1 μmol l 1 but nox concentrations were higher than 0 5 μmol l 1 fig 3d f these patterns in fact seem reasonable if we assume that most of the fucoxanthin was associated with diatoms diatoms tend to have a competitive advantage when nutrient concentrations are high for several reasons diatoms are typically r strategists species tolerant of shear stress forces in physically disturbed water masses alves de souza et al 2008 and tend to have high maximum carbon specific nutrient uptake rates and disproportionately large storage vacuoles edwards et al 2012 litchman and klausmeier 2008 dinoflagellates however may replace diatoms by using multiple growth strategies c colonist species which predominate in chemically disturbed habitats s nutrient stress tolerant species and r to exploit abiotic habitats that support them smayda and reynolds 2003 dinoflagellate have an intrinsically high affinity for phosphate and the ability to utilize organic phosphorus compounds via alkaline phosphatase e g p donghaiense huang et al 2005 as well as mixotrophic and vertical migration capabilities as a group dinoflagellates are not very sensitive to nutrient conditions we found that lower temperatures favored diatoms and that higher temperatures inhibited the growth of diatoms that dinoflagellates were less sensitive to temperature than diatoms fig 3a and b is inconsistent with a previous found that the adaptive temperature range of diatoms skeletonema costatum 15 25 c is wider than that of dinoflagellates p donghaiense 20 25 c wang et al 2006 and the global scenario that diatoms have a wider thermal tolerance than dinoflagellates chen 2015 however we found that the temperature effect was very dependent on the nutrient regime a consequence of either species specific variations or an interact effect of the temperature and the nutrient regime on the same dominant species the result showed that diatoms can tolerate higher temperatures at high nutrient nox and po4 concentrations than at low nutrient concentrations fig 4a c the implication is that the response of diatoms to high temperature may not be a consequence of an inherent metabolic intolerance to supraoptimal temperatures as long as the temperature stress is not accompanied by the additional stress of nutrient limitation thermal stratification of marine waters will increase as a consequence of global warming which will inhibit nutrient inputs from waters below the mixed layer in the offshore waters of the ecs a reduced degree of mixing in the summer results in low nutrient availability which inhibits the growth of diatoms but has no apparent negative effect on s strategist dinoflagellate species such species include the harmful unarmored dinoflagellate cochlodinium polykrikoides which prefers a temperature of 27 c matsuoka et al 2010 in the coastal waters there is a continuous input of terrestrial nutrients from the changjiang river even when the seawater is stratified and that input benefits diatoms furuya et al 2003 high nutrient concentrations that benefit diatoms also occur in the changjiang diluted water front where it mixes with the taiwan warm current water and in the upwelling zones in the coastal waters of zhejiang and fujian provinces tang et al 2006 where diatom blooms have been reported however dinoflagellates may replace diatoms in any of these areas if there is a relaxation of the processes that deliver the allochthonous nutrients smayda 2010 for example well known late spring dinoflagellate blooms gymnodinium and prorocentrum species occur at temperatures of 18 c when nutrient concentrations are low after the phosphate has been consumed by diatoms and there is still some nitrogen remaining this phenomenon has been reported in the ecs guo et al 2014 and in other coastal and shelf areas anderson et al 2002 heisler et al 2008 similarly we found that during the summer changjiang diluted water characterized by both high temperatures and high nutrient concentrations can be a site of dinoflagellate blooms fig 4d f perhaps due to the combined ability of r and s strategists to tolerate high turbulence and phosphate depletion but otherwise eutrophic conditions the biomass of diatoms relative to that of dinoflagellates decreased from 1959 to 2009 in the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters in summer jiang et al 2014 our data fig 2 and model results indicate that this pattern may have been enhanced in the past several years using surface microscopy data dominated by pseudo nitzschia delicatissima thalassionema nitzschioides paralia sulcata and skeletonema sp for diatoms and p donghainese scrippsiella trochoidea and g lohmanni for dinoflagellates collected from cruises c1 c4 table s1 guo et al 2014 has obtained a decreasing trend for diatoms against n p ratio and an opposite trend for dinoflagellates against n p ratio our analysis of temperature and n p ratios provides additional insight into the dynamics of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the ecs an analysis of the gamm results fig 4 and an analysis of the medians of the bins of the glm results figs 5 and 6 revealed that the n p ratio may be a factor that drives the succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates and that the effect of the n p ratio is a function of temperature the n p ratio in algal biomass is positively correlated with temperature at the global scale yvon durocher et al 2015 and the external n p ratio is negatively correlated with temperature in the ecs fig s4b the implication is that the algal internal n p ratio will exceed the external n p ratio when the temperature is higher than a threshold because the internal n p ratio of dinoflagellates is generally higher than that of diatoms john and flynn 2000 rhee and gotham 1981 the high n p ratios of particulate matter at high temperatures was probably accounted for by the greater biomass of dinoflagellates the indication being that high temperatures favor dinoflagellates in the ecs in addition according to the resource ratio theory rhee and gotham 1981 tilman 1977 if the maximum growth rates of diatoms and dinoflagellates are similar diatoms will competitively eliminate dinoflagellates when external n p ratios are low whereas mixotrophic dinoflagellates will prevail when the external n p ratios are high given the fact that dinoflagellates typically have lower growth rates than do diatoms of a comparable size finkel et al 2010 the internal n p ratio must be lower for diatoms than dinoflagellates klausmeier et al 2004a 2004b the winner of the competition will therefore tend to be mixotrophic dinoflagellates when the external n p ratios are high a conclusion consistent with our observations that high n p ratios favor dinoflagellates in the ecs and a previous report that a high n p condition is more likely to promote species that have slow growth rates glibert and burkholder 2011 the n p ratio 26 20 at po4 concentrations less than 0 08 μmol l 1 was obviously higher than the n p ratio 17 8 at higher po4 concentrations the ratio of c p c f was significantly higher for po4 0 08 μmol l 1 than at the latter conditions kruskal wallis rank sum test p 0 001 fig s4c because there is evidence that the internal n p ratio is highest under phosphorus limited conditions compared to the condition of abundant resources and conditions limited by light or nitrogen klausmeier et al 2004a the dominance of dinoflagellate under high n p conditions is expected in the ecs the glm model reflected the fact that the spring dinoflagellate blooms became weaker with increasing po4 concentrations but became stronger with increasing n p ratios fig 6 and fig s6b projecting future changes of these blooms requires knowing what will happen to nutrient concentrations as a result of eutrophication assuming a c chla ratio of 50 by weight and a c n ratio of 5 68 by weight laws 1991 laws and redalje 1979 laws and wong 1979 we estimated that the percentage of nitrogen in phytoplankton was negatively correlated with nutrient concentrations and this relationship was rather insensitive to the assumed c chla and c n ratio fig s8 therefore low ambient nutrient concentrations were the result of phytoplankton taking up a large fraction of the nutrients in accord with this logic we hypothesized that there would be an increase in phytoplankton as a result of eutrophication instead of an increase of inorganic nutrient concentrations previous studies have demonstrated that the nitrogen in the ecs has been increasing while the phosphorus has been decreasing slightly as a result of the long term increase in the changjiang river discharge and an increase in nitrogen fertilizer use in china jiang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 the regression lines between nox and po4 would therefore move toward the left and up fig s4a the result would be more phosphate limited situations leading to higher n p ratios and such conditions would favor dinoflagellates to predict the future responses of diatom and dinoflagellate biomass to combined effects of warming and eutrophication we assumed a 2 c increase in water temperatures and 7 4 fold increase in the n p ratio and focused on the surface water of coastal regions with salinity less than 31 gong et al 1996 the surface waters of the ecs underwent a significant warming at a rate of 0 09 c per decade during 1870 2011 bao and ren 2014 the largest warming trend occurred in the mouth of the changjiang river where the annual mean warming rate exceeded 2 4 c per century liu and zhang 2013 and exceeded 0 49 c per decade in the summer jiang et al 2014 if this warming trend continues it is reasonable to assume that there will be a temperature rise of at least 2 c by 2100 in the surface waters of much of the ecs in addition to warming anthropogenic activities have led to a shift in the nutrient regime in the ecs especially in the changjiang river estuary and adjacent coastal waters where the n p ratio has been steadily increasing zhou et al 2008 and the observed average molar n p ratio in 2010 reached about 200 jiang et al 2014 as a result of the increase of nitrogen fertilizer use in china our presumptive future n p ratio of about 180 will therefore likely be an underestimate at least near the changjiang river estuary we predict that the mean c f should decrease by 19 and the mean c p should increase by 60 as the temperature increases by 2 c these decrease in c f and increase in c p reflect a shift from diatoms to dinoflagellates over the next century as proposed previously jiang et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 we did not project changes of temperature beyond the year 2100 because it is unclear whether phytoplankton will adapt to future niches over time irwin et al 2015 changes beyond 2100 could have even more serious implications than the changes we have projected we did not project changes of n p ratio over 180 because such situations may be more complicated than we assumed here for instance although silicate is not limiting in the ecs at present increasing nitrogen input and diatom consumption will result in a decrease of si n ratio jiang et al 2014 and silicate may be the limiting factor for diatoms someday it is important to realize that the influence of changes in irradiance may alter phytoplankton community composition barton et al 2015 edwards et al 2015 but we do not feel that the predictions of our model are seriously compromised by the absence of irradiance because the indirect effect of this factor is accounted for approximately by the variables we considered in this study temperature irradiance nutrient concentrations and ratios and changes in these variables co vary irwin et al 2012 litchman and klausmeier 2008 an important caveat is that we did not consider the effect of grazing because high resolution sampling of processes such as grazing is difficult because observations in the china seas have shown that microzooplankton grazing is enhanced in eutrophic ecosystems chen et al 2012 zheng et al 2015 further study is needed to explore the effect of grazing to make more realistic predictions about the impact of future climate scenarios 5 conclusions we determined a series of quantitative functional responses of diatom and dinoflagellate biomass c f and c p resulting from the interaction of temperature and nutrient concentrations or ratios such interaction is key in driving the succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates in the ecs we project that decreases in diatom biomass c f of 19 should occur in 60 of stations while increases in dinoflagellate biomass c p of 60 should occur in 70 of stations as a result of anthropogenic changes in temperature and nutrient inputs such a shift projects a more important role of dinoflagellates in this coastal ecosystem including a change in the timing and increase in the spatial extent and frequency of dinoflagellate blooms these changes may be responsible for a decrease of fish production and an increase of gelatinous organisms such as jellyfish in the ecs jiang et al 2008 because the sinking rate of dinoflagellates is lower than that of diatoms guo et al 2015 these changes may also reduce the efficiency of the biological pump in the ecs such a shift in phytoplankton community structure from diatoms to dinoflagellates should be taken into consideration in future studies of global

19877,desalinated domestic wastewater is an indispensable water resource in arid regions however its recovery can be limited by calcium phosphate scaling and fouling of the membrane here we investigated calcium phosphate mineralization on oligoamide surfaces that mimics reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf membrane surfaces we used a solution that simulates desalination of secondary treated domestic wastewater effluents for calcium phosphate mineralization experiments with oligoamide coated gold surfaces attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry showed that calcium phosphate and carbonate precipitated on ro mimetic surfaces the rate of precipitation on oligoamide sensors was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance showing that scaling was more intense on the ro than the nf mimetic surface and that excessive carboxyl functional groups on both surfaces promoted scaling filtration experiments of similar solutions with commercial membranes showed that scaling was more intense on the ro membranes than on the nf membranes which supported the results obtained with the oligoamide model surfaces the results of this study can be implemented in developing ro and nf membranes to prevent calcium phosphate scaling and consequently lower water treatment costs of domestic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis sse solution quartz crystal microbalance scaling domestic wastewater desalination oligoamide 1 introduction in recent years recovered wastewater has become an important alternative water source for agricultural and industrial applications particularly in arid and semi arid regions domestic wastewater has the advantage of a lower salt concentration than other potential feed water sources such as brackish water or seawater therefore desalination by reverse osmosis ro or nanofiltration nf may achieve high recovery with relatively low energy demand however a major factor limiting recovery during domestic wastewater desalination by either technique is scaling of the membranes due to the presence of sparingly soluble salts particularly calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate chen et al 2016 khan et al 2014 ning and troyer 2007 zhao et al 2010 for instance phosphate concentrations range from 0 3 to 3 ppm at the shafdan wastewater treatment plant in the tel aviv region in israel glueckstern et al 2008 while calcium carbonate scaling can be controlled by suitable antiscalants or lowering the feed water ph chaussemier et al 2015 calcium phosphate scaling during wastewater desalination is more difficult to cope with primarily because of a lack of efficient antiscalants antony et al 2011 greenberg et al 2005 steiner et al 2010 ning and troyer 2007 studied ro desalination of treated municipal wastewater in orange county california and found that the ro membranes were fouled by calcium phosphate nanoparticles associated with organic foulants tang et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 recent works compiling langmuir pressure area isotherms dahdal et al 2016a and conducting small angle neutron scattering pipich et al 2013 have found that organic foulants and biopolymers can considerably intensify calcium phosphate scaling steiner et al 2010 compared the influence of different organic functional groups on the surface mineralization of calcium phosphate in a solution simulating the ionic profile of desalination of secondary treated domestic wastewater effluents simulated secondary treated effluents sse and ranked their effects as follows po4 3 coo nh3 coo nh3 1 1 oh ethylene glycol thin film composite membranes based on aromatic polyamides are commonly used in nf and ro they are typically composed of a thin highly crosslinked

described the step by step synthesis of an oligoamide film that mimics the chemistry and surface properties of the aromatic polyamide films in ro and nf membranes steiner et al 2011 this film was recently used for experiments studying organic fouling mechanisms via adsorption ying et al 2015 quartz crystal microbalances qcms capable of measuring nanogram mass changes have been extensively used for studying calcium phosphate mineralization on functionalized surfaces tanahashi and matsuda 1997 zhu et al 2003 in this work we investigated calcium phosphate mineralization on surfaces that mimic ro and nf membranes in domestic wastewater desalination qcm and long term immersion experiments were employed to determine the extent of mineralization and to analyze the precipitate on the different membrane mimetic surfaces the ro and nf surfaces were prepared by the stepwise synthesis of oligoamide coating on gold and were used in surface mineralization studies in sse solution steiner et al 2011 it was found that calcium phosphate mineralization was more intense on the ro mimetic surface than on the nf mimetic surface and a high excess of carboxylic groups on both ro and nf surfaces resulted in intensified mineralization the results of this study are important in selecting membrane technologies and types for the desalination of domestic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1

were prepared according to our previous publications steiner et al 2011 ying et al 2015 briefly qcm sensors or gold coated silicon wafers were immersed in a 1 mm ethanol solution of cysteamine hydrochloride for 24 h under static conditions at room temperature the ethanol was then removed and the wafers were washed with 1 triethylamine in dmf for 10 min under moderate shaking washed twice with ethanol dried under n2 gas and stored in a dry box the following synthesis steps were conducted in one glass vial all glassware was first oven dried prior to synthesis the wafer and vial were washed with dcm then 2 ml of 1 25 mm tmc in dcm solution followed by 0 5 ml of 1 375 mm triethylamine in dcm were added and agitated mildly for 5 min dcm was subsequently removed and the product was washed twice with dcm followed by dmf then 2 ml of 10 mm mpd in dmf was added and shaken mildly after 5 min dmf was removed and the product was washed twice with dmf followed by dcm the ro mimetic surfaces were made from several oligoamide layers by repeating this set of reactions until a total of either 5 5 or 6 cycles was completed a full cycle refers to the reaction with tmc followed by mpd and a half cycle refers to a reaction with tmc only piperazine was used instead of mpd in an otherwise similar protocol to prepare the nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces to terminate the reaction the wafer was soaked in water for 10 min washed twice with ethanol dried with n2 and stored under vacuum a synthesis scheme for both mimetic oligoamide surfaces on either qcm sensors or gold coated

austria two identical wafers each 2 1 cm were used for each measurement and were fitted in a specially designed adjustable gap cell to form a micro channel of width 100 150 μm the measurements used a 0 1 mm kcl electrolyte solution titrations for ph were performed using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl eight pressure ramps from 0 to 300 mbar were performed to force the electrolyte through the micro channel with four ramps in each flow direction the measured streaming currents were converted to zeta potentials using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation arjona et al 2016 bellmann et al 2007 given

precipitation experiments calcium phosphate precipitation on the ro and nf surfaces was monitored under static conditions using an e4 qcm system biolin scientific sweden equipped with open module cells which held the modified qcm sensors along with 1 0 ml of the tested solution to evaluate the stability of the modified sensors qcm experiments were initially performed by adding 1 0 ml of ultrapure water 18 1 mω cm to the cell and monitoring the frequency changes over 18 h the variation of frequency change δf hz was measured at overtones n 5 7 9 11 and 13 we considered here overtone n 7 which represents a trade off between enhanced sensitivity at higher overtones and reduced interference of solution properties at low frequencies salama et al 2014 measurements were recorded every 1 s and the size of the data set was reduced by averaging data over 60 min time intervals the qcm experiments were repeated 2 4 times for each surface and average curves were calculated for each surface statistical analysis was performed to compare the different surfaces by fitting a third degree polynomial function to each average curve and the different curves were compared by t test all statistical analyses were done using spss ibm spss statistics armonk ny ibm corp or jmp sas institute inc cary nc usa the mass change δm on the qcm sensors due to scale formation was estimated using

experiments mineralization experiments by immersion were carried out in tightly sealed 20 ml polypropylene vials containing the oligoamide surfaces 1 cm2 immersed horizontally in 5 ml sse solution for 5 days the wafers were then removed washed gently with ethanol deionized water 1 1 solution and dried in a vacuum desiccator finally the samples were characterized using atr ftir xrd sem eds and ellipsometry 2 7 scaling experiments on ro and nf commercial membranes calcium phosphate scaling tests were performed according to our previous study stein et al 2016 specifically flat sheet bw30le and nf270 membranes were used with sse as a feed solution in a crossflow filtration system equipped with a flat rectangular pressure cell with effective membrane surface area of 22 4 cm2 membranes scaling tendencies were determined by comparing water flux decline behavior the feed solution 3 4 l was circulated at 75 l h crossflow velocity of 0 93 cm s the temperature was kept at 25 0 2 c with a thermostated bath and a heat exchanger the permeate flux was continuously monitored by a liquid mass flow meter flωmega model no 5891 d1a1a5b001 brooks instrument prior to scaling experiments the membranes were compacted with di water for 24 h at 23 0 2 bar for ro membrane and 10 0 2 bar for nf membrane then with 87 6 mm nacl solution which has the same ionic strength as sse for additional 6 h a scaling experiment started by replacing the nacl solution with sse 4 l of solution the initial permeate flux was maintained as 47 0 5 l m 2 h 1 for all membranes by adjusting the applied pressure 21 25 bar for ro membranes 8 12 bar for nf salt rejection values were determined by measuring the feed and permeate conductivities at the end of each run and calculated by equation 2 2 s a l t r e j e c t i o n 1 κ p κ f 100 where κ f and κ p are the specific conductivities of feed and permeate solutions respectively when using nacl solution as feed the nf and ro membranes showed rejections of 28 8 3 8 and 92 2 2 7 respectively in the scaling experiment using sse solution the nf and ro membranes gave rejections of 33 6 2 5 and 95 6 1 4 respectively all rejection values are averages of 3 experiments the scaling experiment was conducted for 30 h and run in triplicate each time with a fresh membrane the average results are reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces our previous study demonstrated that 6 synthetic cycles of oligoamide on gold gave a surface with the same chemical properties as the aromatic polyamide film in ro membranes steiner et al 2011 here we synthesized oligoamide on gold surfaces gold qcm sensors and gold coated silicon wafers that mimic ro and nf membranes following the reported protocol steiner et al 2011 with 6 or 5 5 cycles coating with oligoamide in 5 5 cycles was performed to obtain a higher surface density of carboxylic acid groups the molecular structures of nf surfaces made in 5 5 and 6 cycles are shown in fig 1 while the molecular structures of the ro surfaces are shown in the si fig s2 ellipsometry measurements were performed on gold wafers before and after oligoamide synthesis to establish the thickness of the ro and nf oligoamides samples made in 5 5 cycles were thinner than those made in 6 cycles in both the ro and nf cases table 1 furthermore the ro surfaces were consistently thicker than the nf surfaces these trends were in accordance with the properties reported for skin layers in membranes as the polyamide films in nf membranes are much thinner than polyamide films in ro membranes freger 2003 surface wettability of the ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces was evaluated by measuring the water drop contact angle table 1 the average contact angle of the ro surface 54 4 2 1 for 6 cycles was higher than that for the nf surface 47 5 1 3 in accordance with a previous report steiner et al 2011 for both types 5 5 cycles produced a surface more hydrophilic than 6 cycles this result can be explained by the presence of aromatic carboxylic acid groups which are dominant in the surfaces made in 5 5 cycles while amine groups predominate in the oligoamide synthesized in 6 cycles the zeta potentials of the surfaces were measured using the electro kinetic streaming potential method the ph values for the isoelectric points of the ro surfaces were 3 41 and 4 11 for 5 5 and 6 cycles respectively the nf surfaces showed the same trend with isoelectric points at ph 3 3 and 3 71 for 5 5 and 6 cycles respectively see zeta potential data in si hence 5 5 cycles led to surfaces with lower isoelectric ph values than 6 cycles for both ro and nf mimetics as expected due to the higher concentration of carboxylate groups in the 5 5 cycles oligoamide 3 2 calcium phosphate precipitation on ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces on gold rates of calcium phosphate precipitation on the oligoamide surfaces were studied by qcm nf and ro films synthesized on qcm gold sensors were placed in the qcm cell the resonance frequency of the modified sensors remained stable during 18 h in water see fig 2 however replacing the water with sse solution in the different cells caused the resonance frequency gradually to decrease during 18 h of experiment for both the ro and nf surfaces the resonance frequency began to decrease after a lag time of 3 h we termed this the induction time for mineralization and determined it from the intersection of a tangent to the curve at the region where the frequency started to decrease and a line at the plateau of the curve before the frequency change began control experiments using a sse solution containing no phosphate ions found no frequency change during 18 h for either surface type fig 2 the average mass deposited on each type of sensor was calculated from the qcm data using eq 1 table 2 it is evident that 5 5 cycles more cooh groups induced calcium phosphate mineralization to a greater extent than did 6 cycles on both the ro and nf surfaces furthermore ro mimetic surfaces showed more precipitation than the nf mimetic surfaces statistical analysis for the qcm data was performed to substantiate the discrepancies in behavior among the different surfaces according to t test analysis the induction times of the surfaces were not significantly different therefore the dependence of δf on time was examined from 4 to 18 h for each line t test analysis from 4 to 18 h revealed a significant difference p 0 001 between the precipitation on the surfaces prepared in 5 5 and 6 cycles for both the ro and nf cases thus confirming that the applied cycling pattern influenced the extent of surface mineralization furthermore a comparison of the qcm precipitation on 6 cycles surfaces by t test revealed that ro surfaces were significantly different p 0 001 from the nf surfaces the observation that high concentrations of carboxylic acid groups on a surface induce calcium phosphate mineralization is in agreement with results reported by steiner et al 2010 and dahdal et al 2016a where langmuir isotherms were used to study calcium phosphate mineralization at solution air interfaces the induction of calcium phosphate mineralization in domestic wastewater desalination has also been observed in the presence of alginic acid dahdal et al 2016b which has excessive carboxylic acid groups the high concentrations of carboxylic acid groups on the surfaces considered here were confirmed by the o n and o c ratios from xps analysis table 1 see detailed data in table s1 and fig s4 in the supporting information for both the ro and nf surfaces 5 5 cycles led to a higher o n ratio than did 6 cycles which implies that 5 5 cycles produced more carboxyl groups than did 6 cycles the fact that 5 5 cycles induced more calcium phosphate precipitation than did 6 cycles may indicate the importance of carboxylic acid groups to mineralization this assumption is further supported by the streaming potential analysis of the oligoamide coated surfaces where surfaces made with 5 5 cycles showed slightly more negative zeta potentials than those made with 6 cycles fig s3 in si for both ro and nf surfaces at ph 7 in addition to in situ mineralization experiments using qcm immersion experiments were carried out for a longer period of time atr ftir spectra fig 3 were recorded for the ro and nf surfaces before and after immersion in sse solution after incubating the surfaces in sse solution for 5 days ir peaks were observed at 900 1200 cm 1 fig 3 for the ro surfaces while the nf surfaces showed only insignificant ir peaks these peaks are assigned to phosphate po3 4 vibrations ślósarczyk et al 2005 steiner et al 2010 the fact that the ro surfaces showed significant ir peaks while no significant peaks were seen on the nf surfaces indicates the greater extent of mineralization on the ro surfaces than on the nf surfaces a peak at 1052 cm 1 emerged after 5 days of incubation for both the ro and nf surfaces is attributed to po3 4 vibrations while a peak emerged at 1192 cm 1 is attributed to hydroxyapatite pleshko et al 1991 the peak shown by the ro surfaces at 1463 cm 1 corresponds to asymmetric co vibrations in carbonate ślósarczyk et al 2005 note that no ir peaks were observed for the ro and nf surfaces before the mineralization experiments probably due to the thinness of the oligoamide being below the detection limit of atr ftir measurement in summary after incubation in sse solution atr ftir spectra of the ro mimetic oligoamide surfaces showed peaks assigned to hydroxyapatite and some calcium carbonate peaks which corroborates the observation of enhanced calcium phosphate mineralization on the ro surfaces when in equilibrium with sse solution moreover 5 5 cycles of oligoamide deposition on the ro surfaces led to more intense peaks than did 6 cycles which supports the finding by qcm that a high excess of carboxylic acid groups leads to more intense mineralization after incubation in sse solution for 5 days xrd showed the ro surface to have a very low intensity peak corresponding to hydroxyapatite while the nf surface did not show any peaks other than those corresponding to gold see fig s5 this may be explained by the amorphous nature of the calcium phosphate precipitation observed on the surfaces sem analysis of the surfaces after immersion in sse solution for 5 days showed multiple particles of 0 8 6 μm see sem images in the si fig s6 eds analysis of the individual particles see data in si tables s2 s5 for both ro and nf surfaces revealed that most of the particles found on the surfaces were composed of calcium and phosphorous in addition some particles were identified as sodium chloride calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate sem with eds analysis si tables s2 s5 showed more calcium phosphate particles on the ro surfaces than on the nf surfaces which agrees with the qcm and atr ftir findings of more intense mineralization on the ro surfaces the thicknesses of the surfaces were analyzed by ellipsometry after immersion in sse solution for 5 days table 2 the average values for the samples made with 5 5 cycles 31 nm and 17 nm for ro and nf respectively were larger than those for 6 cycles 15 nm and 7 nm for ro and nf respectively for both the ro and nf surfaces 5 5 cycles led to thicker samples than were obtained for 6 cycles hence 5 5 cycles induced greater calcium phosphate mineralization than did 6 cycles as was found by the qcm and ftir analyses figs 2 and 3 3 3 scaling of ro and nf membranes during sse filtration the membranes scaling tendency was determined by comparing the rates of water flux decline as shown in fig 4 the permeate flux of the ro membranes declined by a larger extent than that of the nf membranes to 57 5 and 71 2 respectively after 30 h taking into account that calcium phosphate is the only salt that can precipitate under these conditions it can be concluded that the ro membranes were more prone to calcium phosphate scaling compared to the nf membranes the fact that the salt rejections for the ro and nf membranes are different see in materials and methods is not expected to affect the bulk concentrations in the feed as the permeate was re circulated to the reservoir nevertheless the ion concentrations on the surfaces of the ro and nf membranes might be different due to concentration polarization therefore induce different scaling propensities in summary the following reasons may lead to different scaling of ro and nf membranes during filtration 1 the difference in membrane surface chemistry as was found in this study by using the membrane mimetics 2 concentration polarization which might lead to higher ion concentrations on the ro membrane due to higher ion rejections 3 different ion selectivities for the nf and ro membranes rejections of monovalent vs divalent ions might lead to changes of scaling types and capacities nevertheless the surface chemistry of the membranes seems to have a substantial effect on scaling as the observation of higher tendency to scaling of ro membranes as compared with nf membranes complies with those from the qcm precipitation experiments and long term measurements on oligoamide surfaces that mimic ro and nf membranes which showed enhanced calcium phosphate precipitation on ro mimetic surfaces hence nf membranes might be better choice over ro membranes for treatment of secondary effluents of domestic wastewater when calcium phosphate precipitation becomes a major factor 3 4 mechanisms of calcium phosphate mineralization on ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces the oligoamide surfaces deposited in 6 cycles were dominated by amino groups however this does not rule out the presence of residual carboxyl groups that could induce mineralization likewise the oligoamide surface deposited in 5 5 cycles was dominated by carboxyl groups but contained some amino groups mineralization can be induced via the electrostatic binding of ca2 ions from the sse solution to the negatively charged carboxylate coo groups near the surface followed by interaction with po4 3 ions and then by ca2 ions onuma et al 2000 as shown in fig 5 note that the concentration of ca2 ions in the sse solution was 37 times higher than that of po4 3 ions therefore the suggested mechanism is expected to contribute significantly to mineralization the ligand interaction of carboxylic acid groups with calcium ions is also favorable the above mechanism via the carboxyl binding of calcium ions may explain the intense precipitation on the surfaces made by 5 5 cycles as they contain more coo groups than the surfaces made by 6 cycles steiner et al 2010 zhu et al 2003 the sse solution was supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite hence calcium phosphate precipitated and formed negatively charged calcium phosphate nanoclusters onuma and ito 1998 oyane et al 1999 steiner et al 2010 zhu et al 2003 which then electrostatically bound to positively charged groups on the surface nh3 and ca2 as shown in fig 5 the availability of free po4 3 ions was limited due to their low concentration in sse solution and the extremely low saturation index of ca phosphate minerals therefore it is unlikely that mineralization was initiated by the adsorption of free phosphate ions onto positively charged groups on the surface therefore the surfaces deposited in 6 cycles which have an excess of positively charged ammonium groups showed less precipitation than those deposited in 5 5 cycles for both the ro and nf surfaces 4 conclusions this study demonstrated calcium phosphate mineralization on surfaces that mimic ro and nf membranes during their immersion in solutions simulating conditions during wastewater desalination the surfaces were prepared on qcm gold sensors and gold coated silicon wafers and were confirmed by ellipsometry contact angle and xps analyses quantitative analysis of frequency change in the qcm sensors along with atr ftir sem eds and ellipsometry results confirmed the precipitation of calcium phosphate on the ro and nf mimetic surfaces the results show that the presence of excessive carboxyl groups on the produced surfaces promoted calcium phosphate scaling the ro and nf surfaces had both amine and carboxylic acid groups on their surfaces hence it is suggested that nf and ro polyamide membranes with limited surface concentrations of carboxylic acid groups will be more suitable for desalination of domestic wastewater effluents than polyamide membranes with excessive carboxylic acid groups it should be noted that in addition to mineral scaling of membranes organic fouling and biofouling need to be further considered the study also showed that nf membrane mimetics had lower scaling than ro membrane mimetics complementary filtration experiments with commercial membranes using sse solution as a feed showed that scaling was more intense on the ro membranes than on the nf membranes which supported the results obtained with the oligoamide surfaces based on that it is suggested that when adequate nf rather than ro membranes will be

19877,desalinated domestic wastewater is an indispensable water resource in arid regions however its recovery can be limited by calcium phosphate scaling and fouling of the membrane here we investigated calcium phosphate mineralization on oligoamide surfaces that mimics reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf membrane surfaces we used a solution that simulates desalination of secondary treated domestic wastewater effluents for calcium phosphate mineralization experiments with oligoamide coated gold surfaces attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry showed that calcium phosphate and carbonate precipitated on ro mimetic surfaces the rate of precipitation on oligoamide sensors was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance showing that scaling was more intense on the ro than the nf mimetic surface and that excessive carboxyl functional groups on both surfaces promoted scaling filtration experiments of similar solutions with commercial membranes showed that scaling was more intense on the ro membranes than on the nf membranes which supported the results obtained with the oligoamide model surfaces the results of this study can be implemented in developing ro and nf membranes to prevent calcium phosphate scaling and consequently lower water treatment costs of domestic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis sse solution quartz crystal microbalance scaling domestic wastewater desalination oligoamide 1 introduction in recent years recovered wastewater has become an important alternative water source for agricultural and industrial applications particularly in arid and semi arid regions domestic wastewater has the advantage of a lower salt concentration than other potential feed water sources such as brackish water or seawater therefore desalination by reverse osmosis ro or nanofiltration nf may achieve high recovery with relatively low energy demand however a major factor limiting recovery during domestic wastewater desalination by either technique is scaling of the membranes due to the presence of sparingly soluble salts particularly calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate chen et al 2016 khan et al 2014 ning and troyer 2007 zhao et al 2010 for instance phosphate concentrations range from 0 3 to 3 ppm at the shafdan wastewater treatment plant in the tel aviv region in israel glueckstern et al 2008 while calcium carbonate scaling can be controlled by suitable antiscalants or lowering the feed water ph chaussemier et al 2015 calcium phosphate scaling during wastewater desalination is more difficult to cope with primarily because of a lack of efficient antiscalants antony et al 2011 greenberg et al 2005 steiner et al 2010 ning and troyer 2007 studied ro desalination of treated municipal wastewater in orange county california and found that the ro membranes were fouled by calcium phosphate nanoparticles associated with organic foulants tang et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 recent works compiling langmuir pressure area isotherms dahdal et al 2016a and conducting small angle neutron scattering pipich et al 2013 have found that organic foulants and biopolymers can considerably intensify calcium phosphate scaling steiner et al 2010 compared the influence of different organic functional groups on the surface mineralization of calcium phosphate in a solution simulating the ionic profile of desalination of secondary treated domestic wastewater effluents simulated secondary treated effluents sse and ranked their effects as

for studying calcium phosphate mineralization on functionalized surfaces tanahashi and matsuda 1997 zhu et al 2003 in this work we investigated calcium phosphate mineralization on surfaces that mimic ro and nf membranes in domestic wastewater desalination qcm and long term immersion experiments were employed to determine the extent of mineralization and to analyze the precipitate on the different membrane mimetic surfaces the ro and nf surfaces were prepared by the stepwise synthesis of oligoamide coating on gold and were used in surface mineralization studies in sse solution steiner et al 2011 it was found that calcium phosphate mineralization was more intense on the ro mimetic surface than on the nf mimetic surface and a high excess of carboxylic groups on both ro and nf surfaces resulted in intensified mineralization the results of this study are important in selecting membrane technologies and types for the desalination of domestic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1

washed twice with dcm followed by dmf then 2 ml of 10 mm mpd in dmf was added and shaken mildly after 5 min dmf was removed and the product was washed twice with dmf followed by dcm the ro mimetic surfaces were made from several oligoamide layers by repeating this set of reactions until a total of either 5 5 or 6 cycles was completed a full cycle refers to the reaction with tmc followed by mpd and a half cycle refers to a reaction with tmc only piperazine was used instead of mpd in an otherwise similar protocol to prepare the nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces to terminate the reaction the wafer was soaked in water for 10 min washed twice with ethanol dried with n2 and stored under vacuum a synthesis scheme for both mimetic oligoamide surfaces on either qcm sensors or gold coated

precipitation experiments calcium phosphate precipitation on the ro and nf surfaces was monitored under static conditions using an e4 qcm system biolin scientific sweden equipped with open module cells which held the modified qcm sensors along with 1 0 ml of the tested solution to evaluate the stability of the modified sensors qcm experiments were initially performed by adding 1 0 ml of ultrapure water 18 1 mω cm to the cell and monitoring the frequency changes over 18 h the variation of frequency change δf hz was measured at overtones n 5 7 9 11 and 13 we considered here overtone n 7 which represents a trade off between enhanced sensitivity at higher overtones and reduced interference of solution properties at low frequencies salama et al 2014 measurements were recorded every 1 s and the size of the data set was reduced by averaging data over 60 min time intervals the qcm experiments were repeated 2 4 times for each surface and average curves were calculated for each surface

5 days the wafers were then removed washed gently with ethanol deionized water 1 1 solution and dried in a vacuum desiccator finally the samples were characterized using atr ftir xrd sem eds and ellipsometry 2 7 scaling experiments on ro and nf commercial membranes calcium phosphate scaling tests were performed according to our previous study stein et al 2016 specifically flat sheet bw30le and nf270 membranes were used with sse as a feed solution in a crossflow filtration system equipped with a flat rectangular pressure cell with effective membrane surface area of 22 4 cm2 membranes scaling tendencies were determined by comparing water flux decline behavior the feed solution 3 4 l was circulated at 75 l h crossflow velocity of 0 93 cm s the temperature was kept at 25 0 2 c with a thermostated bath and a heat exchanger the permeate flux was continuously monitored by a liquid mass flow meter flωmega model no 5891 d1a1a5b001 brooks instrument prior to scaling experiments the membranes were compacted with di water for 24 h at 23 0 2 bar for ro membrane and 10 0 2 bar for nf membrane then with 87 6 mm nacl solution which has the same ionic strength as sse for additional 6 h a scaling experiment started by replacing the nacl solution with sse 4 l of solution the initial permeate flux was maintained as 47 0 5 l m 2 h 1 for all membranes by adjusting the applied pressure 21 25 bar for ro membranes 8 12 bar for nf salt rejection values were determined by measuring the feed and permeate conductivities at the end of each run and calculated by equation 2 2 s a l t r e j e c t i o n 1 κ p κ f 100 where κ f and κ p are the specific conductivities of feed and permeate solutions respectively when using nacl solution as feed the nf and ro membranes showed rejections of 28 8 3 8 and 92 2 2 7 respectively in the scaling experiment using sse solution the nf and ro membranes gave rejections of 33 6 2 5 and 95 6 1 4 respectively all rejection values are averages of 3 experiments the scaling experiment was conducted for 30 h and run in triplicate each time with a fresh membrane the average results are reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces our previous study demonstrated that 6 synthetic cycles of oligoamide on gold gave a surface with the same chemical properties as the aromatic polyamide film in ro membranes steiner et al 2011 here we synthesized oligoamide on gold surfaces gold qcm sensors and gold coated silicon wafers that mimic ro and nf membranes following the reported protocol steiner et al 2011 with 6 or 5 5 cycles coating with oligoamide in 5 5 cycles was performed to obtain a higher surface density of carboxylic acid groups the molecular structures of nf surfaces made in 5 5 and 6 cycles are shown in fig 1 while the molecular structures of the ro surfaces are shown in the si fig s2 ellipsometry measurements were performed on gold wafers before and after oligoamide synthesis to establish the thickness of the ro and nf oligoamides samples made in 5 5 cycles were thinner than those made in 6 cycles in both the ro and nf cases table 1 furthermore the ro surfaces were consistently thicker than the nf surfaces these trends were in accordance with the properties reported for skin layers in membranes as the polyamide films in nf membranes are much thinner than polyamide films in ro membranes freger 2003 surface wettability of the ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces was evaluated by measuring the water drop contact angle table 1 the average contact angle of the ro surface 54 4 2 1 for 6 cycles was higher than that for the nf surface 47 5 1 3 in accordance with a previous report steiner et al 2011 for both types 5 5 cycles produced a surface more hydrophilic than 6 cycles this result can be explained by the presence of aromatic carboxylic acid groups which are dominant in the surfaces made in 5 5 cycles while amine groups predominate in the oligoamide synthesized in 6 cycles the zeta potentials of the surfaces were measured using the electro kinetic streaming potential method the ph values for the isoelectric points of the ro surfaces were 3 41 and 4 11 for 5 5 and 6 cycles respectively the nf surfaces showed the same trend with isoelectric points at ph 3 3 and 3 71 for 5 5 and 6 cycles respectively see zeta potential data in si hence 5 5 cycles led to surfaces with lower isoelectric ph values than 6 cycles for both ro and nf mimetics as expected due to the higher concentration of carboxylate groups in the 5 5 cycles oligoamide 3 2 calcium phosphate precipitation on ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces on gold rates of calcium phosphate precipitation on the oligoamide surfaces were studied by qcm nf and ro films synthesized on qcm gold sensors were placed in the qcm cell the resonance frequency of the modified sensors remained stable during 18 h in water see fig 2 however replacing the water with sse solution in the different cells caused the resonance frequency gradually to decrease during 18 h of experiment for both the ro and nf surfaces the resonance frequency began to decrease after a lag time of 3 h we termed this the induction time for mineralization and determined it from the intersection of a tangent to the curve at the region where the frequency started to decrease and a line at the plateau of the curve before the frequency change began control experiments using a sse solution containing no phosphate ions found no frequency change during 18 h for either surface type fig 2 the average mass deposited on each type of sensor was calculated from the qcm data using eq 1 table 2 it is evident that 5 5 cycles more cooh groups induced calcium phosphate mineralization to a greater extent than did 6 cycles on both the ro and nf surfaces furthermore ro mimetic surfaces showed more precipitation than the nf mimetic surfaces statistical analysis for the qcm data was performed to substantiate the discrepancies in behavior among the different surfaces according to t test analysis the induction times of the surfaces were not significantly different therefore the dependence of δf on time was examined from 4 to 18 h for each line t test analysis from 4 to 18 h revealed a significant difference p 0 001 between the precipitation on the surfaces prepared in 5 5 and 6 cycles for both the ro and nf cases thus confirming that the applied cycling pattern influenced the extent of surface mineralization furthermore a comparison of the qcm precipitation on 6 cycles surfaces by t test revealed that ro surfaces were significantly different p 0 001 from the nf surfaces the observation that high concentrations of carboxylic acid groups on a surface induce calcium phosphate mineralization is in agreement with results reported by steiner et al 2010 and dahdal et al 2016a where langmuir isotherms were used to study calcium phosphate mineralization at solution air interfaces the induction of calcium phosphate mineralization in domestic wastewater desalination has also been observed in the presence of alginic acid dahdal et al 2016b which has excessive carboxylic acid groups the high concentrations of carboxylic acid groups on the surfaces considered here were confirmed by the o n and o c ratios from xps analysis table 1 see detailed data in table s1 and fig s4 in the supporting information for both the ro and nf surfaces 5 5 cycles led to a higher o n ratio than did 6 cycles which implies that 5 5 cycles produced more carboxyl groups than did 6 cycles the fact that 5 5 cycles induced more calcium phosphate precipitation than did 6 cycles may indicate the importance of carboxylic acid groups to mineralization this assumption is further supported by the streaming potential analysis of the oligoamide coated surfaces where surfaces made with 5 5 cycles showed slightly more negative zeta potentials than those made with 6 cycles fig s3 in si for both ro and nf surfaces at ph 7 in addition to in situ mineralization experiments using qcm immersion experiments were carried out for a longer period of time atr ftir spectra fig 3 were recorded for the ro and nf surfaces before and after immersion in sse solution after incubating the surfaces in sse solution for 5 days ir peaks were observed at 900 1200 cm 1 fig 3 for the ro surfaces while the nf surfaces showed only insignificant ir peaks these peaks are assigned to phosphate po3 4 vibrations ślósarczyk et al 2005 steiner et al 2010 the fact that the ro surfaces showed significant ir peaks while no significant peaks were seen on the nf surfaces indicates the greater extent of mineralization on the ro surfaces than on the nf surfaces a peak at 1052 cm 1 emerged after 5 days of incubation for both the ro and nf surfaces is attributed to po3 4 vibrations while a peak emerged at 1192 cm 1 is attributed to hydroxyapatite pleshko et al 1991 the peak shown by the ro surfaces at 1463 cm 1 corresponds to asymmetric co vibrations in carbonate ślósarczyk et al 2005 note that no ir peaks were observed for the ro and nf surfaces before the mineralization experiments probably due to the thinness of the oligoamide being below the detection limit of atr ftir measurement in summary after incubation in sse solution atr ftir spectra of the ro mimetic oligoamide surfaces showed peaks assigned to hydroxyapatite and some calcium carbonate peaks which corroborates the observation of enhanced calcium phosphate mineralization on the ro surfaces when in equilibrium with sse solution moreover 5 5 cycles of oligoamide deposition on the ro surfaces led to more intense peaks than did 6 cycles which supports the finding by qcm that a high excess of carboxylic acid groups leads to more intense mineralization after incubation in sse solution for 5 days xrd showed the ro surface to have a very low intensity peak corresponding to hydroxyapatite while the nf surface did not show any peaks other than those corresponding to gold see fig s5 this may be explained by the amorphous nature of the calcium phosphate precipitation observed on the surfaces sem analysis of the surfaces after immersion in sse solution for 5 days showed multiple particles of 0 8 6 μm see sem images in the si fig s6 eds analysis of the individual particles see data in si tables s2 s5 for both ro and nf surfaces revealed that most of the particles found on the surfaces were composed of calcium and phosphorous in addition some particles were identified as sodium chloride calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate sem with eds analysis si tables s2 s5 showed more calcium phosphate particles on the ro surfaces than on the nf surfaces which agrees with the qcm and atr ftir findings of more intense mineralization on the ro surfaces the thicknesses of the surfaces were analyzed by ellipsometry after immersion in sse solution for 5 days table 2 the average values for the samples made with 5 5 cycles 31 nm and 17 nm for ro and nf respectively were larger than those for 6 cycles 15 nm and 7 nm for ro and nf respectively for both the ro and nf surfaces 5 5 cycles led to thicker samples than were obtained for 6 cycles hence 5 5 cycles induced greater calcium phosphate mineralization than did 6 cycles as was found by the qcm and ftir analyses figs 2 and 3 3 3 scaling of ro and nf membranes during sse filtration the membranes scaling tendency was determined by comparing the rates of water flux decline as shown in fig 4 the permeate flux of the ro membranes declined by a larger extent than that of the nf membranes to 57 5 and 71 2 respectively after 30 h taking into account that calcium phosphate is the only salt that can precipitate under these conditions it can be concluded that the ro membranes were more prone to calcium phosphate scaling compared to the nf membranes the fact that the salt rejections for the ro and nf membranes are different see in materials and methods is not expected to affect the bulk concentrations in the feed as the permeate was re circulated to the reservoir nevertheless the ion concentrations on the surfaces of the ro and nf membranes might be different due to concentration polarization therefore induce different scaling propensities in summary the following reasons may lead to different scaling of ro and nf membranes during filtration 1 the difference in membrane surface chemistry as was found in this study by using the membrane mimetics 2 concentration polarization which might lead to higher ion concentrations on the ro membrane due to higher ion rejections 3 different ion selectivities for the nf and ro membranes rejections of monovalent vs divalent ions might lead to changes of scaling types and capacities nevertheless the surface chemistry of the membranes seems to have a substantial effect on scaling as the observation of higher tendency to scaling of ro membranes as compared with nf membranes complies with those from the qcm precipitation experiments and long term measurements on oligoamide surfaces that mimic ro and nf membranes which showed enhanced calcium phosphate precipitation on ro mimetic surfaces hence nf membranes might be better choice over ro membranes for treatment of secondary effluents of domestic wastewater when calcium phosphate precipitation becomes a major factor 3 4 mechanisms of calcium phosphate mineralization on ro and nf mimetic oligoamide surfaces the oligoamide surfaces deposited in 6 cycles were dominated by amino groups however this does not rule out the presence of residual carboxyl groups that could induce mineralization likewise the oligoamide surface deposited in 5 5 cycles was dominated by carboxyl groups but contained some amino groups mineralization can be induced via the electrostatic binding of ca2 ions from the sse solution to the negatively charged carboxylate coo groups near the surface followed by interaction with po4 3 ions and then by ca2 ions onuma et al 2000 as shown in fig 5 note that the concentration of ca2 ions in the sse solution was 37 times higher than that of po4 3 ions therefore the suggested mechanism is expected to contribute significantly to mineralization the ligand interaction of carboxylic acid groups with calcium ions is also favorable the above mechanism via the carboxyl binding of calcium ions may explain the intense precipitation on the surfaces made by 5 5 cycles as they contain more coo groups than the surfaces made by 6 cycles steiner et al 2010 zhu et al 2003 the sse solution was supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite hence calcium phosphate precipitated and formed negatively charged calcium phosphate nanoclusters onuma and ito 1998 oyane et al 1999 steiner et al 2010 zhu et al 2003 which then electrostatically bound to positively charged groups on the surface nh3 and ca2 as shown in fig 5 the availability of free po4 3 ions was limited due to their low concentration in sse solution and the extremely low saturation index of ca phosphate minerals therefore it is unlikely that mineralization was initiated by the adsorption of free phosphate ions onto positively charged groups on the surface therefore the surfaces deposited in 6 cycles which have an excess of positively charged ammonium groups showed less precipitation than those deposited in 5 5 cycles for both the ro and nf surfaces 4 conclusions this study demonstrated calcium phosphate mineralization on surfaces that mimic ro and nf membranes during their immersion in solutions simulating conditions during wastewater desalination the surfaces were prepared on qcm gold sensors and gold coated silicon wafers and were confirmed by ellipsometry contact angle and xps analyses quantitative analysis of frequency change in the qcm sensors along with atr ftir sem eds and ellipsometry results confirmed the precipitation of calcium phosphate on the ro and nf mimetic surfaces the results show that the presence of excessive carboxyl groups on the produced surfaces promoted calcium phosphate scaling the ro and nf surfaces had both amine and carboxylic acid groups on their surfaces hence it is suggested that nf and ro polyamide membranes with limited surface concentrations of carboxylic acid groups will be more suitable for desalination of domestic wastewater effluents than polyamide membranes with excessive carboxylic acid groups it should be noted that in addition to mineral scaling of membranes organic fouling and biofouling need to be further considered the study also showed that nf membrane mimetics had lower scaling than ro membrane mimetics complementary filtration experiments with commercial membranes using sse solution as a feed showed that scaling was more intense on the ro membranes than on the nf membranes which supported the results obtained with the oligoamide surfaces based on that it is suggested that when adequate nf rather than ro membranes will be considered for treatment of secondary wastewater effluents acknowledgements the authors thank the blaustein center for scientific cooperation ben gurion university of the negev for a post doctorate

19878,to establish the association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in irrigation water escherichia coli was enumerated using two quantification methods plate counts and pma qpcr and presence absence of pathogenic microorganisms including five strains from the shiga toxigenic e coli o157 h7 o26 o103 o111 and o145 and salmonella spp were evaluated the results confirmed that surface water can be considered a microbial hazard when used for irrigation the levels of viable e coli were very similar to those of cultivable e coli except for irrigation water obtained from water reservoirs comparison between the e coli counts in samples positive and negative for the presence of pathogenic bacteria for the evaluated water sources identified e coli level of 2 35 log cfu 100 ml as a cut off able to correctly predict positive and negative samples with 93 sensitivity and 66 specificity respectively thus for the samples with levels of e coli under 2 35 log cfu 100 ml e g 2 24 log cfu 100 ml there was a 90 probability that the samples were not contaminated with pathogenic microorganism in locations with similar prevalence e coli levels in irrigation water were affected by the ambient temperature confirming that water source and climate conditions should be taken into account by growers when designing a sampling program and the frequency of the monitoring to make a better and more efficient use of their resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords indicator microorganisms agricultural water viable but non cultivable bacteria pma qpcr sampling program microbiological risk fresh produce 1 introduction agricultural water has been identified as one of the most important risk factors for fresh produce contamination with food borne pathogens during primary production efsa 2014 water sources used for irrigation are very diverse and usually characterized by different microbiological quality pachepsky et al 2011 classification of water sources based on their potential microbial contamination can be performed considering the origin of the water and the distribution systems based on this and the final uses of the water reclaimed and surface water have been categorized as the riskiest water sources pachepsky et al 2011 this is particularly relevant in water scarce areas where intensive cropping is practiced and surface water is the main source of water for irrigation this is the case in different areas in us i e california and the south of europe i e south east of spain however in these areas growers generally have access to different types of surface water including water reservoirs canals and drainage diches information concerning the microbial quality of different surface water types is still scarce the microbiological quality of irrigation water is affected by environmental factors of which weather conditions are the most important wilkes et al 2009 pachepsky et al 2011 holvoet et al 2014 recently published studies have indicated a potential association between irrigation water and the microbiological quality of fresh produce decol et al 2017 ceuppens et al 2015 establishment of microbial sampling programs for irrigation water has been purposed as a good strategy to reduce fresh produce contamination uyttendaele et al 2015 in order to develop a sampling program growers should be assisted in how the data should be collected including when where and how to perform sampling sampling programs should be based on guidelines and legislation where microbial requirements are established such as the codex alimentarius us food and drug administration s food safety modernization act fsma as well as several guidelines on good agricultural practices gap and quality assurance standards allende and monaghan 2015 specifically the new produce safety rule established under fsma has elaborated sampling programs based on data collection on e coli as an indicator of fecal contamination and potential presence of pathogens fda 2014 the rule requires growers to test and evaluate the microbial quality of their agricultural water by creating a water quality profile wqp that provides a characterization of risk based on two calculated values geometric mean gm and the statistical threshold value st fda 2014 characterization of water source via a water quality profile would entail taking 20 samples over a two year period as close to harvest as is practicable one reason for this request might be the fact that several factors affect the microbiological quality of irrigation water including weather factors i e precipitation geographical location i e presence of wild and domestic animals and seasonality i e water temperature allende and monaghan 2015 if the e coli levels exceed the gm and st criteria growers should discontinue use of that water source or apply a mitigation strategy to reduce the microbial levels before resuming the use of water sampling programs must therefore be designed to meet the specific objectives for which the data are collected and should determine the best sampling location the sampling frequency and the details of the sampling procedures harter 2008 additionally a direct correlation between the levels of any indicator and enteric pathogens in water are random site specific or time specific ashbolt et al 2001 payment and locas 2011 traditionally cultivation techniques have been commonly used to enumerate e coli in irrigation water holvoet et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 however this methodology may not represent the most suitable method for predicting the presence of bacterial pathogens ferguson et al 2013 reported that a qpcr based e coli assay was the best method for predicting the presence of bacterial pathogens in water samples it could be attributed to the presence of viable but non cultivable vbnc bacteria in environmental samples unlike normal cells that are culturable on suitable media and develop into colonies vbnc cells are living cells that have lost the ability to grow on routine media li et al 2014 in a later study truchado et al 2016a have demonstrated that both cultivable and vbnc e coli are accurate predictors of the presence of pathogenic bacteria it can be hypothesized that environmental factors might have a different impact in different irrigation water sources affecting survival of fecal indicator bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms this information however is critical to establish the water quality profile of a water source therefore the aims of this study were i to establish the association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in three types of surface water and ii to give insights on how a water sampling program should be established 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design microbial collection by systematic sampling of irrigation water was performed at three different water sources including 1 water from drainage ditches bordering farmlands and urban areas 2 water reservoirs and 3 canal water from a river transfer all these water sources correspond to surface water and have been selected because they are the three main water sources used for crop irrigation in the south east area of spain at certain times of the year these water sources can be mixed with reclaimed water coming from wastewater treatment plants and in the case of water from drainage ditches bordering farmlands and urban areas some old houses located near by these water sources may not have a wastewater discharge system in place representing a potential source of contamination 2 2 sample collection three representative locations of the three selected water sources were selected and sampled from january until december 2015 water samples were weekly collected in duplicate n 226 two samples of 2 l each were collected using sterile polypropylene plastic bottles water temperature was measured in each water source samples were transported to the laboratory 30 min approx and stored at 4 c for 16 h maximum before processing additionally at each sampling point 10 l of water was passed through a modified moore swabs mms by means of a peristaltic pump as previously described by sbodio et al 2013 2 3 meteorological parameters for each location and sampling day weather data for ambient temperature and precipitation were obtained during the sampling period from the nearby climatic stations at la alberca 37 56 24 24 n 1 8 4 99 w torre pacheco 37 44 51 81 n 0 59 12 02 w and ulea 38 11 28 96 n 1 15 28 53 w located within 10 km of the water sources the climatological database of sistema de informacion agraria de murcia siam was used siam 2015 2 4 cultivation and molecular based e coli quantification in irrigation water samples culture based enumeration of e coli was performed as previously described in castro ibáñez et al 2015 the detection limit was 1 cfu 100 ml the molecular quantification of e coli was performed following the combined use of propidium monoazide pma biotium inc usa and quantitative polymerase chain reaction pma qpcr as previously described in truchado et al 2016b briefly at each sampling point two subsamples of 250 ml were taken from each 2 l and further pooled into one sample n 113 this pool 500 ml was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min the pellets were activated with pma and kept at 20 c until the genomic dna extraction was performed and the supernatant was removed the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water with 10 μm of pma samples were incubated in the dark during 5 min at rt with shaking to allow reagent penetration then samples were exposed to a 500 w halogen light ge lightning cleveland usa for 5 min light for 5 min after pma activation the samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 9000g for 10 min and kept at 20 c until the genomic dna extraction was performed genomic dna was extracted using the master pure tm complete dna and rna purification kit epicenter madison usa following the manufacturer s instructions pma qpcr procedure were identical to that describes in truchado et al 2016a the limit of detection and the recovery of the molecular assay including sample preparation and qpcr analysis were estimated using a three strain cocktail of escherichia coli cect 434 471 and 515 in logarithmic growth phase obtained from the spanish type culture collection cect valencia spain serial dilutions were prepared and 1 ml of the concentration range of 105 100 cfu was spiked in 100 ml of sterile water obtained from one of the water sources used in the study water from a canal and submitted to complete experimental procedure centrifugation pma treatment dna extraction and qpcr the selection of the water was based on the physico chemical properties of the water in this case the water with the highest turbidity 36 28 ntu was selected because a previous study associated turbidity with potential interferences with the photoactivation step when pma was using reducing the efficiency of the treatment van frankenhuyzen et al 2011 bacteria levels were quantified by plating and pma qpcr analysis was performed in triplicates and extraction blanks were also included the limited of detection of experimental procedure was estimated in 77 8 6 0 bacterial cells per 100 ml and the average of recovery was 85 3 9 2 5 pathogenic microorganisms 2 5 1 pre enrichment the modified moore swabs mms obtained after filtering 10 l of water were placed in a stomacher bag containing buffer peptone water 200 ml of 40 bpw scharlau chemie spain and incubated at 37 c for 18 20 h pre enriched samples were supplemented with 30 glycerol and maintained at 20 c until further analysis one ml of these pre enriched samples was enriched in 9 ml of brain heart infusion bhi scharlau chemie broth for 4 h at 35 c to resuscitate injured cells for e coli o157 h7 detection 1 ml of bhi was transferred into 9 ml of trypticase soy broth supplemented with novobiocin 20 mg l tsbn scharlau chemie and incubated overnight at 37 c in the case of shiga toxin producing e coli stec 1 ml of enrichment in bhi was then transferred into 9 ml of tryptone phosphate broth tp oxoid uk and incubated overnight at 42 c for salmonella 1 ml of enrichment in bhi was transferred into 9 ml of tetrathionate broth base hajna supplemented with 1 ml of iodine solution tt scharlau chemie and incubated overnight at 44 c one ml of each overnight enrichment sample was centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min dna extraction of the pellet was performed using a nucleospin tissue macherey nagel germany following manufacture instruction 2 5 2 detection and confirmation of pathogenic microorganisms to detect presence of e coli o157 h7 stec and salmonella spp in water samples a pcr system applied biosystems spain was used for e coli o157 h7 and stec a conventional multiplex pcr assay targeting the five virulence factors stx1 stx2 eae and ehxa plus the o157 h7 specific 93 uida single nucleotide polymorphism was performed son et al 2014 the limit of detection according the sensitivity of pcr multiplex was estimated using dna from escherichia coli o157 h7 cect 4782 dna was serially diluted to produce five average concentrations ranging between 1 05 0 01 cells μl and 1050 95 46 cell μl the lod was determined based on the concentration that demonstrated a positive result at a particular dilution the lod values for each pcr product were 10 5 0 09 cells regardless of whether the amplifications were run individually or in the multiplex format to detect the presence of salmonella specific primers targeting genes inva were tested al moghazy et al 2014 pcr products were separated by electrophoresis in 2 w v agarose gels pronadisa spain at 85 v for 60 min gels were stained with 1 μg ml red dye biotium inc usa and visualized on a uv transilluminator bio rad spain when the five bands in the multiplex pcr were amplified the sample was considered as presumptive e coli o157 h7 son et al 2014 if stx1 or and stx2 as well as eae genes were positive bands the sample was considered as a presumptive stec the presumptive positive samples detected by pcr were cultured and confirmed in selective culture media as previously described holvoet et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 with some modifications briefly positive enrichment samples were streaked onto ibisa oxoid chromagar o157 and chromagar stec media drg international usa for salmonella e coli o157 h7 and stec respectively green colony was picked from ibisa plate broth and confirmed as salmonella via latex oxoid in the case of e coli o157 a single mauve colony was picked from chromagar o157 plate and confirmed by latex confirmation oxoid 2 6 statistical analysis calculation and graphical representation of the median and interquartile range iqr of microbial counts were performed using sigma plot 12 5 systat software inc addilink software scientific s l barcelona e coli levels evaluated by plate count and pma qpcr assay were log10 transformed two samples that had observed zero counts in the culture data and one sample in the pma qpcr data were left censored the two samples with observed zero counts were substituted with 1 cfu 100 ml limit of detection before log10 transformation it was considered that this censoring approach had minimal effect on the results considering the relatively low limit of detection and that just 2 samples were subjected to it the single sample with the observed zero count in the pma qpcr analysis was substituted with 1 cell 100 ml before log10 transformation because the detection limit was 77 8 6 cells 100 ml this approach to censoring had a small effect on the summery statistics by affecting the lowest point in the observed range which was considered acceptable ibm spss statistics 19 and r software were used for statistical analyses except when stated otherwise p values below 0 05 were considered statistically significant shapiro wilk test was performed to assess the normality of the data p 0 05 mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests were used to examine the association between e coli levels and presence of pathogens the spearman correlation coefficient r value was calculated to determine the correlation between e coli levels and water temperature for the proportion of confirmed positive samples of a particular water type a 95 confidence interval ci was calculated using the wilson score method newcombe 1998 a classification tree analysis was used to determine the cut off level of e coli with the smallest misclassification error based on the 1 standard error rule in predicting the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the sample the analysis used gini index as a measure of node impurity and 5 fold cross validation the identified cut off was used to summarize samples into a confusion matrix from which sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values could be computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial quality of surface irrigation water the three tested types of water sources had significantly different levels of e coli established through culture based and culture independent methods fig 1 the highest e coli values where obtained from drainage ditches median 4 03 log cfu 100 ml iqr 3 79 4 51 followed by surface water obtained from canals median 2 87 log cfu 100 ml iqr 2 66 2 97 these levels were above the e coli limits included in the current legislation i e fsma and those recommended by most of the gap guidelines 2 log 100 ml for irrigation water mapama 2015 surface water obtained from water reservoirs showed the lowest e coli levels median 1 08 log cfu 100 ml iqr 0 71 1 27 which in most cases were below 2 log 100 ml fig 1a based on the results obtained water from water reservoirs could represent the lowest risk however available literature suggests caution mostly because the levels of e coli can vary significantly depending on several factors including geographical location and weather conditions forslund et al 2012 jones et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 levels of e coli showed similar trends when measured by the pma qpcr assay and the culture based approach several studies have reported that the use of culture based methods may lead to an underestimation of the e coli levels in water samples when compared to the pma qpcr technique gensberger et al 2014 truchado et al 2016b the discrepancy between the two enumerations techniques have been attributed to the presence of viable but non cultivable vbnc bacteria irrigation water can be exposed to many environmental stresses and treatments that can induce cultivable bacteria into a vbnc state heim et al 2002 a portion of these vbnc may be resuscitated back to cultivable cells during water storage and distribution system thereby presenting a potential risk lin et al 2016 in the present study e coli levels quantified using the pma qpcr assay were similar to those obtained using the culture based methods as previously described the loss in cultivability was most likely due to cell death rather than an inability to form colonies on standard laboratory media an exception was observed in the case of water samples obtained from water reservoirs fig 1 in this case significant differences were observed between the two quantification techniques plate count and pma qpcr which could be explained by the addition of chemical agents to the water reservoirs to avoid algae development which might have an impact on the viability of e coli cells gil et al 2015 therefore the true e coli levels in water reservoir seemed to be higher than those reported by culture methods in cases like this the pma qpcr technique may be a more suitable method for the accurate estimation of e coli loads when compared to traditional cultivation based method 3 2 association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in surface irrigation water the prevalences of enteric foodborne pathogens in the different types of irrigation water are shown in table 1 among the tested water samples 73 84 113 were pcr positive for at least one bacterial pathogen e g salmonella spp e coli o157 h7 stec however only 49 55 113 of samples were confirmed by selective media and subsequent latex agglutination test where applicable similar results have been shown in previous studies screening water samples which are probably due to the presence of a wide range of native competing microbiota on selective agar delbeke et al 2015 based on the confirmed results salmonella was present in 43 of samples 49 113 followed by e coli o157 h7 12 14 113 and non o157 h7 stec strains 11 12 113 in agreement with the obtained results several microbiological surveys have also reported a high salmonella spp prevalence in irrigation water micallef et al 2012 in fact surface water has been reported as a major reservoir for salmonella spp micallef et al 2012 jones et al 2014 e coli o157 h7 and non o157 h7 stec strains have also been isolated from surface water used for irrigation johnson et al 2003 wright 1989 reported that a higher prevalence of salmonella when compared to that of e coli o157 h7 and non o157 h7 stec may be explained by better salmonella spp persistence in surface water sources when compared with persistence of other pathogenic enteric bacteria significant differences were observed among the prevalences of the tested foodborne pathogens in the different water sources the highest prevalence of foodborne pathogens was found in surface water obtained from drainage ditches and canals 70 30 43 and 70 21 30 respectively followed by water reservoirs 10 4 40 the low presence of pathogens in water reservoirs might be due to the addition of potassium permanganate 2 mg l kmno4 as a strategy to control algae development castro ibáñez et al 2015 potassium permanganate has been described as a strong oxidizing agent highly toxic for bacteria tucker and boyd 1977 conversely the high prevalence of foodborne pathogens in surface water obtained from drainage ditches and canals might be the result of direct discharge of waste from agricultural runoff and or untreated human sewage wild life livestock and humans have been identified as the major sources of water contamination with salmonella and e coli and could be a valid explanation for the high prevalence observed in this study navarro gonzalez et al 2012 based on the present results the use of irrigation water obtained from representative drainage ditches and canals represents a high risk of produce contamination with foodborne pathogens as previously indicated at certain times of the year these water sources can be mixed with reclaimed water coming from wastewater treatment plants additionally in the case of water from drainage ditches bordering farmlands and urban areas some old houses located near by these water sources may not have a wastewater discharge system in place representing a potential source of contamination all this can contribute to the high contamination found in these water samples recently several studies have identified e coli concentrations as a good indicator of the presence of foodborne pathogen in irrigation water payment and locas 2011 holvoet et al 2014 truchado et al 2016b in order to establish the potential association between e coli levels in irrigation water and the presence of enteric foodborne pathogens mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests were used our results are in agreement with previously published studies showing that e coli levels higher than 2 0 2 5 log cfu 100 ml were associated with a higher prevalence of foodborne pathogens fig 2 ceuppens et al 2015 in heavily polluted waters such as untreated waste waters a better correlation between indicator organisms and pathogens is generally observed but with other water qualities and environments this correlation can become erratic and biologically improbable payment and locas 2011 specifically for the evaluated water sources the e coli level of 2 35 log cfu 100 ml was identified as a cut off with the smallest misclassification error in the classification tree analysis this cut off was able to correctly predict positive and negative samples with 93 sensitivity and 66 specificity respectively the positive and negative predictive values were 74 and 90 respectively thus for the samples with levels of e coli under 2 35 log cfu 100 ml i e 2 24 cfu 100 ml there was a 90 probability that the samples were not contaminated with pathogenic microorganism on the other hand almost three quarters of samples contaminated with e coli at levels above 2 24 cfu 100 ml were also contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms a different cut off would have a different predictive ability for example lowering the cut off to 2 10 log cfu 100 ml slightly increased the sensitivity 95 and the negative predictive value 91 but at a cost of a decrease in the specificity 54 and positive predictive value 68 thus as expected a lower cut off would increase the probability of detecting water contaminated with pathogens but the number of false positives would increase as well some authors have proposed the quantification of vbnc e coli as a more suitable indicator of the presence of enteric pathogens ferguson et al 2013 to validate this hypothesis we evaluated the correlation between the e coli levels from both plate count and pma qpcr methods and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the water reservoirs over the study period of one year fig 3 the results showed no significant differences between the two quantification techniques plate count and pma qpcr and thus did not corroborate the proposed hypothesis 3 3 establishment of a sampling program in the present study the microbiological quality of irrigation water from three sources of surface water was evaluated over a period of one year and data were compiled and juxtaposed to weather factors results showed that there was no correlation between e coli levels in irrigation water and uv radiation nor rainfall data not shown however it should be noted that this result could have been affected by the low rainfall during the period of the study in agreement with the results obtained other studies did not find a positive correlation between e coli and precipitation jones et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 a positive relationship was observed between water temperature c and e coli levels depending on the water source pearson rank p 0 01 fig 4 water samples from drainage ditches r 0 608 p 0 01 fig 4a and water reservoirs r 0 453 p 0 01 fig 4b showed a moderate but significant correlation between water temperature and e coli levels this positive correlation between e coli and outside temperature in irrigation water was previously reported by others authors holvoet et al 2014 additionally a correlation was observed between water temperature and outside temperature r 0 739 p 0 01 these results suggest that fecal indicator concentrations may increase as the temperature increase which can be associated with a higher probability of finding foodborne pathogens this data could be of interest for growers as they could modify their sampling programs accordingly investing more resources in monitoring of irrigation water during those months of higher temperatures on the other hand there was no correlation between water temperature and e coli levels in water samples taken from the canal fig 4c one reason for this finding can be the location selected for sampling the canal along the canal there were discharges from a nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp having a continuous discharge from the wwtp the microbiological quality of the water was more homogeneous and independent of the outside temperature therefore the selection of the sampling location could probably buffer the impact of water temperature on the e coli levels in this water source regarding the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of fresh produce spanish legislation specifies permissible e coli levels according to crop and mode of water application real decreto 1620 2007 2007 in those cases where a direct contact of reclaimed water with produce occurs and the product is consumed as raw the maximum authorized level for e coli is 102 cfu 100 ml in the present study levels of e coli were in most of the cases above 102 cfu 100 ml which restricts its use to those cases in which the irrigation water does not come into direct contact with the edible part of the product there are some applications that can be used by growers to evaluate the microbial water quality profile mwqp of the irrigation water source to avoid the complexity of establishing the gm and stv values for that purpose we selected an excel spreadsheet developed by western center for produce safety at university of california davis wcfs 2016 data obtained from this excel tool showed that only irrigation water stored in reservoirs complied with the fsma established microbiological e coli levels table 2 a tool like this is easy to use and gives very important information to growers who based on the results obtained might decide to implement mitigation options that allow microbial die off before harvest 4 conclusions the microbiological quality of surface irrigation water in terms of e coli levels depends on several factors including water source climate and in some cases on the quantification methodology selected to evaluate the indicator microorganisms surface water has been confirmed as a risky water source for irrigation but significant differences were observed among the different types of surface water evaluated in this study this information should be taken into account to avoid grouping together all the surface water sources when assurance schemes are elaborated based on the results obtained e coli levels higher than 2 35 log cfu 100 ml were able to predictive the presence of pathogens using cultivable techniques caution should be taken into account because samples positive for the presence of pathogenic bacteria were occasionally isolated from water samples with e coli levels below 1 0 log cfu 100 ml both quantification techniques plate count and pma qpcr can be used to evaluate the concentration of e coli in surface water except to water sources where chemical are used to avoid the algae formation in this case the use of conventional cultivation techniques might lead to an underestimation of the e coli population present in irrigation water acknowledgements authors are thankful for the financial support from the center for produce safety grant agreement projects 2015 374 and 2017 01 and the

19878,to establish the association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in irrigation water escherichia coli was enumerated using two quantification methods plate counts and pma qpcr and presence absence of pathogenic microorganisms including five strains from the shiga toxigenic e coli o157 h7 o26 o103 o111 and o145 and salmonella spp were evaluated the results confirmed that surface water can be considered a microbial hazard when used for irrigation the levels of viable e coli were very similar to those of cultivable e coli except for irrigation water obtained from water reservoirs comparison between the e coli counts in samples positive and negative for the presence of pathogenic bacteria for the evaluated water sources identified e coli level of 2 35 log cfu 100 ml as a cut off able to correctly predict positive and negative samples with 93 sensitivity and 66 specificity respectively thus for the samples with levels of e coli under 2 35 log cfu 100 ml e g 2 24 log cfu 100 ml there was a 90 probability that the samples were not contaminated with pathogenic microorganism in locations with similar prevalence e coli levels in irrigation water were affected by the ambient temperature confirming that water source and climate conditions should be taken into account by growers when designing a sampling program and the frequency of the monitoring to make a better and more efficient use of their resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords indicator microorganisms agricultural water viable but non cultivable bacteria pma qpcr sampling program microbiological risk fresh produce 1 introduction agricultural water has been identified as one of the most important risk factors for fresh produce contamination with food borne pathogens during primary production efsa 2014 water sources used for irrigation are very diverse and usually characterized by different microbiological quality pachepsky et al 2011 classification of water sources based on their potential microbial contamination can be performed considering the origin of the water and the distribution systems based on this and the final uses of the water reclaimed and surface water have been categorized as the riskiest water sources pachepsky et al 2011 this is particularly relevant in water scarce areas where intensive cropping is practiced and surface water is the main source of water for irrigation this is the case in different areas in us i e california and the south of europe i e south east of spain however in these areas growers generally have access to different types of surface water including water reservoirs canals and drainage diches information concerning the microbial quality of different surface water types is still scarce the microbiological quality of irrigation water is affected by environmental factors of which weather conditions are the most important wilkes et al 2009 pachepsky et al 2011 holvoet et al 2014 recently published studies have indicated a potential association between irrigation water and the microbiological quality of fresh produce decol et al 2017 ceuppens et al 2015 establishment of microbial sampling programs for irrigation water has been purposed as a good strategy to reduce fresh produce contamination uyttendaele et al 2015 in order to develop a sampling program growers should be assisted in how the data should be collected including when where and how to perform sampling sampling programs should be based on guidelines and legislation where microbial requirements are established such as the codex alimentarius us food and drug administration s food safety modernization act fsma as well as several guidelines on good agricultural practices gap and quality assurance standards allende and monaghan 2015 specifically the new produce safety rule established under fsma has elaborated sampling programs based on data collection on e coli as an indicator of fecal contamination and potential presence of pathogens fda 2014 the rule requires growers to test and evaluate the microbial quality of their agricultural water by creating a water quality profile wqp that provides a characterization of risk based on two calculated values geometric mean gm and the statistical threshold value st fda 2014 characterization of water source via a water quality profile would entail taking 20 samples over a two year period as close to harvest as is practicable one reason for this request might be the fact that several factors affect the microbiological quality of irrigation water including weather factors i e precipitation geographical location i e presence of wild and domestic animals and seasonality i e water temperature allende and monaghan 2015 if the e coli levels exceed the gm and st criteria growers should discontinue use of that water source or apply a mitigation strategy to reduce the microbial levels before resuming the use of water sampling programs must therefore be designed to meet the specific objectives for which the data are collected and should determine the best sampling location the sampling frequency and the details of the sampling procedures harter 2008 additionally a direct correlation between the levels of any indicator and enteric pathogens in water are random site specific or time specific ashbolt et al 2001 payment and locas 2011 traditionally cultivation techniques have been commonly used to enumerate e coli in irrigation water holvoet et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 however this methodology may not represent the most suitable method for predicting the presence of bacterial pathogens ferguson et al 2013 reported that a qpcr based e coli assay was the best method for predicting the presence of bacterial pathogens in water samples it could be attributed to the presence of viable but non cultivable vbnc bacteria in environmental samples unlike normal cells that are culturable on suitable media and develop into colonies vbnc cells are living cells that have lost the ability to grow on routine media li et al 2014 in a later study truchado et al 2016a have demonstrated that both cultivable and vbnc e coli are accurate predictors of the presence of pathogenic bacteria it can be hypothesized that environmental factors might have a different impact in different irrigation water sources affecting survival of fecal indicator bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms this information however is critical to establish the water quality profile of a water source therefore the aims of this study were i to establish the association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in three types of surface water and ii to give insights on how a water sampling program should be established 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design microbial collection by systematic sampling of irrigation water was performed at three different water sources including 1 water from drainage ditches bordering farmlands and urban areas 2 water reservoirs and 3 canal water from a river transfer all these water sources correspond to surface water and have been selected because they are the three main water sources used for crop irrigation in the south east area of spain at certain times of the year these water sources can be mixed with reclaimed water coming from wastewater treatment plants and in the case of water from drainage ditches bordering farmlands and urban areas some old houses located near by these water sources may not have a wastewater discharge system in place representing a potential source of contamination 2 2 sample collection three representative locations of the three selected water sources were selected and sampled from january until december 2015 water samples were weekly collected in duplicate n 226 two samples of 2 l each were collected using sterile polypropylene plastic bottles water temperature was measured in each water source samples were transported to the laboratory 30 min approx and stored at 4 c for 16 h maximum before processing additionally at each sampling point 10 l of water was passed through a modified moore swabs mms by means of a peristaltic pump as previously described by sbodio et al 2013 2 3 meteorological parameters for each location and sampling day weather data for ambient temperature and precipitation were obtained during the sampling period from the nearby climatic stations at la alberca 37 56 24 24 n 1 8 4 99 w torre pacheco 37 44 51 81 n 0 59 12 02 w and ulea 38 11 28 96 n 1 15 28 53 w located within 10 km of the water sources the climatological database of sistema de informacion agraria de murcia siam was used siam 2015 2 4 cultivation and molecular based e coli quantification in irrigation water samples culture based enumeration of e coli was performed as previously described in castro ibáñez et al 2015 the detection limit was 1 cfu 100 ml the molecular quantification of e coli was performed following the combined use of propidium monoazide pma biotium inc usa and quantitative polymerase chain reaction pma qpcr as previously described in truchado et al 2016b briefly at each sampling point two subsamples of 250 ml were taken from each 2 l and further pooled into one sample n 113 this pool 500 ml was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min the pellets were activated with pma and kept at 20 c until the genomic dna extraction was performed and the supernatant was removed the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water with 10 μm of pma samples were incubated in the dark during 5 min at rt with shaking to allow reagent penetration then samples were exposed to a 500 w halogen light ge lightning cleveland usa for 5 min light for 5 min after pma activation the samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 9000g for 10 min and kept at 20 c until the genomic dna extraction was performed genomic dna was extracted using the master pure tm complete dna and rna purification kit epicenter madison usa following the manufacturer s instructions pma qpcr procedure were identical to that describes in truchado et al 2016a the limit of detection and the recovery of the molecular assay including sample preparation and qpcr analysis were estimated using a three strain cocktail of escherichia coli cect 434 471 and 515 in logarithmic growth phase obtained from the spanish type culture collection cect valencia spain serial dilutions were prepared and 1 ml of the concentration range of 105 100 cfu was spiked in 100 ml of sterile water obtained from one of the water sources used in the study water from a canal and submitted to complete experimental procedure centrifugation pma treatment dna extraction and qpcr the selection of the water was based on the physico chemical properties of the water in this case the water with the highest turbidity 36 28 ntu was selected because a previous study associated turbidity with potential interferences with the photoactivation step when pma was using reducing the efficiency of the treatment van frankenhuyzen et al 2011 bacteria levels were quantified by plating and pma qpcr analysis was performed in triplicates and extraction blanks were also included the limited of detection of experimental procedure was estimated in 77 8 6 0 bacterial cells per 100 ml and the average of recovery was 85 3 9 2 5 pathogenic microorganisms 2 5 1 pre enrichment the modified moore swabs mms obtained after filtering 10 l of water were placed in a stomacher bag containing buffer peptone water 200 ml of 40 bpw scharlau chemie spain and incubated at 37 c for 18 20 h pre enriched samples were supplemented with 30 glycerol and maintained at 20 c until further analysis one ml of these pre enriched samples was enriched in 9 ml of brain heart infusion bhi scharlau chemie broth for 4 h at 35 c to resuscitate injured cells for e coli o157 h7 detection 1 ml of bhi was transferred into 9 ml of trypticase soy broth supplemented with novobiocin 20 mg l tsbn scharlau chemie and incubated overnight at 37 c in the case of shiga toxin producing e coli stec 1 ml of enrichment in bhi was then transferred into 9 ml of tryptone phosphate broth tp oxoid uk and incubated overnight at 42 c for salmonella 1 ml of enrichment in bhi was transferred into 9 ml of tetrathionate broth base hajna supplemented with 1 ml of iodine solution tt scharlau chemie and incubated overnight at 44 c one ml of each overnight enrichment sample was centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min dna extraction of the pellet was performed using a nucleospin tissue macherey nagel germany following manufacture instruction 2 5 2 detection and confirmation of pathogenic microorganisms to detect presence of e coli o157 h7 stec and salmonella spp in water samples a pcr system applied biosystems spain was used for e coli o157 h7 and stec a conventional multiplex pcr assay targeting the five virulence factors stx1 stx2 eae and ehxa plus the o157 h7 specific 93 uida single nucleotide polymorphism was performed son et al 2014 the limit of detection according the sensitivity of pcr multiplex was estimated using dna from escherichia coli o157 h7 cect 4782 dna was serially diluted to produce five average concentrations ranging between 1 05 0 01 cells μl and 1050 95 46 cell μl the lod was determined based on the concentration that demonstrated a positive result at a particular dilution the lod values for each pcr product were 10 5 0 09 cells regardless of whether the amplifications were run individually or in the multiplex format to detect the presence of salmonella specific primers targeting genes inva were tested al moghazy et al 2014 pcr products were separated by electrophoresis in 2 w v agarose gels pronadisa spain at 85 v for 60 min gels were stained with 1 μg ml red dye biotium inc usa and visualized on a uv transilluminator bio rad spain when the five bands in the multiplex pcr were amplified the sample was considered as presumptive e coli o157 h7 son et al 2014 if stx1 or and stx2 as well as eae genes were positive bands the sample was considered as a presumptive stec the presumptive positive samples detected by pcr were cultured and confirmed in selective culture media as previously described holvoet et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 with some modifications briefly positive enrichment samples were streaked onto ibisa oxoid chromagar o157 and chromagar stec media drg international usa for salmonella e coli o157 h7 and stec respectively green colony was picked from ibisa plate broth and confirmed as salmonella via latex oxoid in the case of e coli o157 a single mauve colony was picked from chromagar o157 plate and confirmed by latex confirmation oxoid 2 6 statistical analysis calculation and graphical representation of the median and interquartile range iqr of microbial counts were performed using sigma plot 12 5 systat software inc addilink software scientific s l barcelona e coli levels evaluated by plate count and pma qpcr assay were log10 transformed two samples that had observed zero counts in the culture data and one sample in the pma qpcr data were left censored the two samples with observed zero counts were substituted with 1 cfu 100 ml limit of detection before log10 transformation it was considered that this censoring approach had minimal effect on the results considering the relatively low limit of detection and that just 2 samples were subjected to it the single sample with the observed zero count in the pma qpcr analysis was substituted with 1 cell 100 ml before log10 transformation because the detection limit was 77 8 6 cells 100 ml this approach to censoring had a small effect on the summery statistics by affecting the lowest point in the observed range which was considered acceptable ibm spss statistics 19 and r software were used for statistical analyses except when stated otherwise p values below 0 05 were considered statistically significant shapiro wilk test was performed to assess the normality of the data p 0 05 mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests were used to examine the association between e coli levels and presence of pathogens the spearman correlation coefficient r value was calculated to determine the correlation between e coli levels and water temperature for the proportion of confirmed positive samples of a particular water type a 95 confidence interval ci was calculated using the wilson score method newcombe 1998 a classification tree analysis was used to determine the cut off level of e coli with the smallest misclassification error based on the 1 standard error rule in predicting the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the sample the analysis used gini index as a measure of node impurity and 5 fold cross validation the identified cut off was used to summarize samples into a confusion matrix from which sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values could be computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial quality of surface irrigation water the three tested types of water sources had significantly different levels of e coli established through culture based and culture independent methods fig 1 the highest e coli values where obtained from drainage ditches median 4 03 log cfu 100 ml iqr 3 79 4 51 followed by surface water obtained from canals median 2 87 log cfu 100 ml iqr 2 66 2 97 these levels were above the e coli limits included in the current legislation i e fsma and those recommended by most of the gap guidelines 2 log 100 ml for irrigation water mapama 2015 surface water obtained from water reservoirs showed the lowest e coli levels median 1 08 log cfu 100 ml iqr 0 71 1 27 which in most cases were below 2 log 100 ml fig 1a based on the results obtained water from water reservoirs could represent the lowest risk however available literature suggests caution mostly because the levels of e coli can vary significantly depending on several factors including geographical location and weather conditions forslund et al 2012 jones et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 levels of e coli showed similar trends when measured by the pma qpcr assay and the culture based approach several studies have reported that the use of culture based methods may lead to an underestimation of the e coli levels in water samples when compared to the pma qpcr technique gensberger et al 2014 truchado et al 2016b the discrepancy between the two enumerations techniques have been attributed to the presence of viable but non cultivable vbnc bacteria irrigation water can be exposed to many environmental stresses and treatments that can induce cultivable bacteria into a vbnc state heim et al 2002 a portion of these vbnc may be resuscitated back to cultivable cells during water storage and distribution system thereby presenting a potential risk lin et al 2016 in the present study e coli levels quantified using the pma qpcr assay were similar to those obtained using the culture based methods as previously described the loss in cultivability was most likely due to cell death rather than an inability to form colonies on standard laboratory media an exception was observed in the case of water samples obtained from water reservoirs fig 1 in this case significant differences were observed between the two quantification techniques plate count and pma qpcr which could be explained by the addition of chemical agents to the water reservoirs to avoid algae development which might have an impact on the viability of e coli cells gil et al 2015 therefore the true e coli levels in water reservoir seemed to be higher than those reported by culture methods in cases like this the pma qpcr technique may be a more suitable method for the accurate estimation of e coli loads when compared to traditional cultivation based method 3 2 association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in surface irrigation water the prevalences of enteric foodborne pathogens in the different types of irrigation water are shown in table 1 among the tested water samples 73 84 113 were pcr positive for at least one bacterial pathogen e g salmonella spp e coli o157 h7 stec however only 49 55 113 of samples were confirmed by selective media and subsequent latex agglutination test where applicable similar results have been shown in previous studies screening water samples which are probably due to the presence of a wide range of native competing microbiota on selective agar delbeke et al 2015 based on the confirmed results salmonella was present in 43 of samples 49 113 followed by e coli o157 h7 12 14 113 and non o157 h7 stec strains 11 12 113 in agreement with the obtained results several microbiological surveys have also reported a high salmonella spp prevalence in irrigation water micallef et al 2012 in fact surface water has been reported as a major reservoir for salmonella spp micallef et al 2012 jones et al 2014 e coli o157 h7 and non o157 h7 stec strains have also been isolated from surface water used for irrigation johnson et al 2003 wright 1989 reported that a higher prevalence of salmonella when compared to that of e coli o157 h7 and non o157 h7 stec may be explained by better salmonella spp persistence in surface water sources when compared with persistence of other pathogenic enteric bacteria significant differences were observed among the prevalences of the tested foodborne pathogens in the different water sources the highest prevalence of foodborne pathogens was found in surface water obtained from drainage ditches and canals 70 30 43 and 70 21 30 respectively followed by water reservoirs 10 4 40 the low presence of pathogens in water reservoirs might be due to the addition of potassium permanganate 2 mg l kmno4 as a strategy to control algae development castro ibáñez et al 2015 potassium permanganate has been described as a strong oxidizing agent highly toxic for bacteria tucker and boyd 1977 conversely the high prevalence of foodborne pathogens in surface water obtained from drainage ditches and canals might be the result of direct discharge of waste from agricultural runoff and or untreated human sewage wild life livestock and humans have been identified as the major sources of water contamination with salmonella and e coli and could be a valid explanation for the high prevalence observed in this study navarro gonzalez et al 2012 based on the present results the use of irrigation water obtained from representative drainage ditches and canals represents a high risk of produce contamination with foodborne pathogens as previously indicated at certain times of the year these water sources can be mixed with reclaimed water coming from wastewater treatment plants additionally in the case of water from drainage ditches bordering farmlands and urban areas some old houses located near by these water sources may not have a wastewater discharge system in place representing a potential source of contamination all this can contribute to the high contamination found in these water samples recently several studies have identified e coli concentrations as a good indicator of the presence of foodborne pathogen in irrigation water payment and locas 2011 holvoet et al 2014 truchado et al 2016b in order to establish the potential association between e coli levels in irrigation water and the presence of enteric foodborne pathogens mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests were used our results are in agreement with previously published studies showing that e coli levels higher than 2 0 2 5 log cfu 100 ml were associated with a higher prevalence of foodborne pathogens fig 2 ceuppens et al 2015 in heavily polluted waters such as untreated waste waters a better correlation between indicator organisms and pathogens is generally observed but with other water qualities and environments this correlation can become erratic and biologically improbable payment and locas 2011 specifically for the evaluated water sources the e coli level of 2 35 log cfu 100 ml was identified as a cut off with the smallest misclassification error in the classification tree analysis this cut off was able to correctly predict positive and negative samples with 93 sensitivity and 66 specificity respectively the positive and negative predictive values were 74 and 90 respectively thus for the samples with levels of e coli under 2 35 log cfu 100 ml i e 2 24 cfu 100 ml there was a 90 probability that the samples were not contaminated with pathogenic microorganism on the other hand almost three quarters of samples contaminated with e coli at levels above 2 24 cfu 100 ml were also contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms a different cut off would have a different predictive ability for example lowering the cut off to 2 10 log cfu 100 ml slightly increased the sensitivity 95 and the negative predictive value 91 but at a cost of a decrease in the specificity 54 and positive predictive value 68 thus as expected a lower cut off would increase the probability of detecting water contaminated with pathogens but the number of false positives would increase as well some authors have proposed the quantification of vbnc e coli as a more suitable indicator of the presence of enteric pathogens ferguson et al 2013 to validate this hypothesis we evaluated the correlation between the e coli levels from both plate count and pma qpcr methods and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the water reservoirs over the study period of one year fig 3 the results showed no significant differences between the two quantification techniques plate count and pma qpcr and thus did not corroborate the proposed hypothesis 3 3 establishment of a sampling program in the present study the microbiological quality of irrigation water from three sources of surface water was evaluated over a period of one year and data were compiled and juxtaposed to weather factors results showed that there was no correlation between e coli levels in irrigation water and uv radiation nor rainfall data not shown however it should be noted that this result could have been affected by the low rainfall during the period of the study in agreement with the results obtained other studies did not find a positive correlation between e coli and precipitation jones et al 2014 castro ibáñez et al 2015 a positive relationship was observed between water temperature c and e coli levels depending on the water source pearson rank p 0 01 fig 4 water samples from drainage ditches r 0 608 p 0 01 fig 4a and water reservoirs r 0 453 p 0 01 fig 4b showed a moderate but significant correlation between water temperature and e coli levels this positive correlation between e coli and outside temperature in irrigation water was previously reported by others authors holvoet et al 2014 additionally a correlation was observed between water temperature and outside temperature r 0 739 p 0 01 these results suggest that fecal indicator concentrations may increase as the temperature increase which can be associated with a higher probability of finding foodborne pathogens this data could be of interest for growers as they could modify their sampling programs accordingly investing more resources in monitoring of irrigation water during those months of higher temperatures on the other hand there was no correlation between water temperature and e coli levels in water samples taken from the canal fig 4c one reason for this finding can be the location selected for sampling the canal along the canal there were discharges from a nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp having a continuous discharge from the wwtp the microbiological quality of the water was more homogeneous and independent of the outside temperature therefore the selection of the sampling location could probably buffer the impact of water temperature on the e coli levels in this water source regarding the use of reclaimed water for irrigation of fresh produce spanish legislation specifies permissible e coli levels according to crop and mode of water application real decreto 1620 2007 2007 in those cases where a direct contact of reclaimed water with produce occurs and the product is consumed as raw the maximum authorized level for e coli is 102 cfu 100 ml in the present study levels of e coli were in most of the cases above 102 cfu 100 ml which restricts its use to those cases in which the irrigation water does not come into direct contact with the edible part of the product there are some applications that can be used by growers to evaluate the microbial water quality profile mwqp of the irrigation water source to avoid the complexity of establishing the gm and stv values for that purpose we selected an excel spreadsheet developed by western center for produce safety at university of california davis wcfs 2016 data obtained from this excel tool showed that only irrigation water stored in reservoirs complied with the fsma established microbiological e coli levels table 2 a tool like this is easy to use and gives very important information to growers who based on the results obtained might decide to implement mitigation options that allow microbial die off before harvest 4 conclusions the microbiological quality of surface irrigation water in terms of e coli levels depends on several factors including water source climate and in some cases on the quantification methodology selected to evaluate the indicator microorganisms surface water has been confirmed as a risky water source for irrigation but significant differences were observed among the different types of surface water evaluated in this study this information should be taken into account to avoid grouping together all the surface water sources when assurance schemes are elaborated based on the results obtained e coli levels higher than 2 35 log cfu 100 ml were able to predictive the presence of pathogens using cultivable techniques caution should be taken into account because samples positive for the presence of pathogenic bacteria were occasionally isolated from water samples with e coli levels below 1 0 log cfu 100 ml both quantification techniques plate count and pma qpcr can be used to evaluate the concentration of e coli in surface water except to water sources where chemical are used to avoid the algae formation in this case the use of conventional cultivation techniques might lead to an underestimation of the

19879,treatment of drinking water decreases human health risks by reducing pollutants but the required materials chemicals and energy emit pollutants and increase health risks we explored human carcinogenic and non carcinogenic disease tradeoffs of water treatment by comparing pollutant dose response curves against life cycle burden using usetox methodology an illustrative wellhead sorbent groundwater treatment system removing hexavalent chromium or pentavalent arsenic serving 3200 people was studied reducing pollutant concentrations in drinking water from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 avoided 37 potential cancer cases and 64 potential non cancer disease cases human carcinogenicity embedded in treatment was 0 2 5 3 cases and non carcinogenic toxicity was 0 2 14 3 cases depending on

contributed 90 of the toxicity impacts for treatment options requiring ph control in scenarios where benefits exceeded burdens tradeoffs still existed benefits are experienced by a local population but burdens are born externally where the materials and energy are produced thus exporting the health risks even when burdens clearly exceeded benefits cost considerations may still drive selecting a detrimental treatment level or technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment tradeoffs life cycle assessment hexavalent chromium arsenic 1 introduction drinking water treatment has saved an untold number of lives it represents a hallmark of improving quality of life in countries across the world drinking water filtration and chlorination are the most important public health interventions of the 20th century cutler and miller 2004 and continued treatment of major contaminants that pose acute or chronic health risks is essential however as science is able to detect and treat increasing numbers of water constituents at increasingly lower concentrations it is possible that diminishing returns in human health improvement could be approached and tradeoffs stemming from the burden of production should be considered similar to any processed product treating drinking water requires materials and energy the production of which exposes workers to hazards and emits pollutants with deleterious health effects while the population consuming the treated water directly enjoys the health benefits of reduced pollutants in drinking water an external population bears much of the health burden of producing the treated water the advent of life cycle assessment lca has brought approaches for examining environmental and social tradeoffs the focus of most lcas concerning water has been the embedded energy used in water supply pumping providing water from surface water sources requires 0 1 1 5 kw h m 3 arpke and hutzler 2006 crettaz et al 1999 stokes and

plappally and lienhard 2012 racoviceanu et al 2007 stokes and horvath 2006 the energy and its associated impacts related to water treatment can be overlooked however water supply and pumping energy is

necessary to achieve compliance with recent and potential future regulation of two representative inorganic pollutants common in groundwater i e chromium and arsenic while treatment reduces health risk to the population drinking the water the burden of providing treatment potentially causes indirect human carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health effects in understanding these exported risks we focused on human health benefit of treating water to regulatory limits i e reducing exposure compared against increased exposure burden from industrial chemicals required to fabricate and operate the treatment system although potential ecosystem effects undoubtedly occur this study focused only on the human toxicity effects to maintain direct comparisons of benefits and burdens the present study is unique because it directly compares the human toxicity burden embedded in a number of water treatment processes to the human health benefit they provide the goal of this study was to explore human health tradeoffs of treating water to regulatory limits for as v and cr vi it aimed to 1 compare the magnitude of health benefits against embedded burdens 2 study how these tradeoffs change with varying treatment levels and 3 identify what processes or practices may mitigate the risks this study provides retrospective evaluation of the overall human health impacts of as vi regulation and anticipatory evaluation for potential cr vi regulation human toxicity impacts stemming from drinking water treatment in this system were assessed in three steps first lca was used to estimate risks

established a 10 μg l 1 maximum guideline who 2011 in 2006 the environmental protection agency epa reduced the as v regulation from 50 to 10 μg l 1 because of growing toxicological evidence and many treatment systems were installed to comply with the new regulatory requirements as v in this study serves as a retrospective evaluation of the prior regulation s overall human health impact epa regulation for total chromium in drinking water is currently 100 μg l 1 but emerging toxicological evidence about cr vi advocates for lower limits california already more rigidly regulates cr vi at 10 μg l 1 california code of regulations 2014 and other states often follow california s example and adopt more stringent regulation this study enables possible future regulation to consider the toxicity burdens embedded in cr vi treatment cr vi is considered a human carcinogen via inhalation exposure usepa 1998 and recent toxicological studies document carcinogenic effects in rodents ingesting high doses of cr vi usepa 2010a non cancer gastrointestinal effects from chronic oral exposure include ulcers diarrhea and vomiting usepa 2010a recent epa monitoring shows 4 of groundwater systems exceed 10 μg l 1 of cr vi usepa 2015b and levels up to 57 or 97 μg l 1 have been observed usepa 2015b frey et al 2004 the most common as v wellhead treatment technique is sorption onto metal oxides mo including ferric oxide hydroxide and activated alumina choong et al 2007 these media demonstrate a high sorption capacity ranging from 280 3900 μg g 1 bang et al 2011 lipps et al 2010 speitel jr et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2005 even at low contaminant concentrations they do not require pretreatment but sorption capacity increases at depressed ph choong et al 2007 various treatment technologies are being piloted and constructed to achieve low cr vi concentrations weak base anion exchange wbax resin exhibits very high affinity and removal capacities ranging from 5300 5600 μg g 1 mcguire et al 2007 najm et al 2014 however achieving such high capacities often requires acidifying the influent water to ph 6 brandhuber et al 2004 mcguire et al 2007 najm et al 2014 by infusing acids or carbon dioxide najm et al 2014 both mo and wbax sorbents are generally single use requiring disposal after exhaustion in contrast strong base anion exchange sbax resin is another common cr vi treatment option that does not require acidification but shows much lower affinity sbax capacity ranges from 110 2800 μg g 1 brandhuber et al 2004 mcguire et al 2007 najm et al 2014 and is hindered by nitrate and sulfate levels sbax can be regenerated using strong salt solution for multiple reuses najm et al 2014 as v and cr vi can also be treated by coagulation membrane filtration or precipitation but those processes are operationally difficult in a wellhead situation and more expensive for small systems where specialized operators and solid waste handling may be unavailable najm et al 2014 2 methodology 2 1 life cycle assessment the system boundary is depicted in fig 1 it included production use and disposal of materials and energy required for wellhead treatment to comply with as v or cr vi regulation including sorbent energy to pump water through the packed bed chemicals to adjust ph or regenerate the sorbent energy to transport the sorbents and chemicals to the site and storage tanks for the sorbents and chemicals the system boundary includes production and transport of all energy and materials but excludes on site infrastructure construction which impacts are expected to be small against the long term operation raluy et al 2005 stokes and horvath 2006 it excluded energy and infrastructure associated with water supply or distribution and chemicals required for disinfection which are required independently of meeting cr vi or as v regulations the functional unit was 93 million m3 25 billion gallons of water treated to an acceptable quality over 70 years this could represent a small system serving 3200 people with a high demand of 1100 l day 1 300 gal day 1 ranging to a larger system serving 10 000 people with low demand of 360 l day 1 96 gal day 1 this study will assume the former since it is consistent with average single well population and per capita demand in southern california cvwd 2016 where wellhead arsenic and chromium treatment is common because results scale linearly with the functional unit using the high demand means health burdens will be high compared to systems with lower demand that use less resources to benefit more people the total flow rate was 2500 l min 1 670 gal min 1 0 96 million gal day 1 all withdrawn water was treated to meet quality goals although human consumption averages only 2 l day 1 unless stated otherwise cr vi or as v influent concentration was assumed to be 20 μg l 1 this is a plausible groundwater concentration that would require treatment to meet a regulatory limit of 10 μg l 1 which is the current who recommendation and epa maximum contaminant level mcl for as v and the current cr vi mcl in california contaminants were considered to occur independently and not coexisting in the source water other assumed influent water quality parameters were representative of groundwaters in southern california including ph 8 200 mg l 1 as caco3 alkalinity 5 mg l 1 nitrate n and 33 mg l 1 sulfate whenever a regulatory limit was to be met it was assumed that the system would treat to 80 of the limit i e 8 μg l 1 it is standard practice for systems to target a lower concentration to ensure continuous compliance and allow for fluctuations in process efficiency and water quality this has the effect of incurring a slightly higher health and environmental impact to provide treatment any treatment goal was met by treating portion of the total flow and bypassing a portion so the blended final quality met the goal which is a common cost saving procedure further details are in supporting information si this study considered three treatment scenarios with different target pollutant and sorbent these scenarios are defined in table 1 sub scenarios were also considered with different ph control methods these sub scenarios are employed to mitigate scenario uncertainty because ph control chemicals are later found to be critical drivers of final results the foreground inventory quantities of materials and energy directly required to produce the functional unit for each of the three scenarios was developed using design assumptions detailed in si and following an approach developed for a cr vi treatment cost estimate najm et al 2014 it includes production use and disposal of sorbent mass based on published capacity oversea and overland transport of the sorbent energy to overcome packed bed headloss chemicals to reduce the ph to 6 before treatment and raise to 8 after treatment and overland transport of the ph control chemicals background life cycle inventory data e g coal combustion in acid production styrene for polymeric resin production and calcite for lime production were determined from the ecoinvent swiss center for life cycle inventories 2010 database and data uncertainty was explored as described below 2 1 1 impact assessment impact assessment converted the inventory into human toxicity midpoints that could be added and compared following standard lca procedures characterization factors from usetox hauschild et al 2008 rosenbaum et al 2008 converted quantities of common products and processes into embedded human toxicity impacts in units of cases the combined recommended plus interim data were used over just the recommended data also known as consensus data because it includes the characterization of metals in the inventory to more fully capture the human toxicity impacts of all life cycle inventory these characterization factors were obtained through the ecoinvent v2 2 website swiss center for life cycle inventories 2010 all calculations were carried out in a spreadsheet human toxicity estimates include impacts from the emission of toxic substances into the environment accounting for fate exposure and effect rosenbaum et al 2008 they do not include health impacts from other pathways such as particulate matter formation or photochemical oxidation furthermore environmental impacts such as ocean acidification and climate change are outside the scope of this study these other health impact pathways and environmental impacts are undoubtedly occurring in the life cycle of drinking water treatment and it is recommended that future studies investigate them the si contains a parallel human toxicity impact assessment using epa traci usepa 2014 units in terms of benzene or toluene equivalents discussion of matching characterization factors to the inventory and developing custom characterization factors to explore inventory uncertainty 2 1 2 uncertainty and sensitivity uncertainty in the lca model included data uncertainty in inventory and impact assessment for example data uncertainty arose from the assumed per capita water demand that was high compared to most systems therefore increasing the included inventory model uncertainty arose from variations in treatment system design constraints which was inherent to modeling a theoretical system meant to represent a general class of treatment in lieu of a single specific operational system further model uncertainty came with calculation limitations that assume linear responses another source of uncertainty was reliance on a published database in lieu of direct observations furthermore the referenced database was recently updated from version 2 to version 3 and characterization factors that included both recommended and interim data were used instead of only recommended data to include metals characterization uncertainty was addressed in three ways first a sensitivity analysis was developed to explore which inputs and assumptions influenced the final results and to what degree the sensitivity analysis illustrated the variability in the results identified critical treatment choices and allowed results to be adapted for various water quality situations for example inventory sensitivity was explored by observing the change in final impacts due to varying the assumed influent water quality and treatment target second a scenario analysis was conducted to focus on the inputs deemed to have the largest sensitivity for example because ph control chemicals were the largest contributors to results multiple ph control scenarios were analyzed third inventory uncertainty was mitigated by qualitatively assessing data reliability and using empirical relationships to determine data distribution instead of relying on published point values this meant to estimate the error pursuant to the parameter and model uncertainty discussed in the previous paragraph it revealed that characterization factors could have a squared geometric standard deviation gsd2 of one to three results could therefore vary by a factor of 2 3 within a 95 confidence interval 2 2 health benefits of treating drinking water dose response relationships were used to project the human health benefit of lowering the drinking water pollutant concentration changes in pollutant exposure could be directly converted to estimated health impact cases then compared to the embedded human toxicity burden from the lca results human adult cancer and non cancer cases associated with chronic ingestion of different concentrations of as v and cr vi in drinking water were estimated under usetox methodology in terms of cases by the human health effect factor from the inorganics database 1 00 hauschild et al 2008 cancer and non cancer cases were estimated separately the human health benefit from treating drinking water was defined as the number of disease cases expected at the influent concentration minus the number of cases expected at the mcl the calculated health effects were interpreted as maximum potentials i e worst case scenario in each case uncertainty in the underlying data spanned one to two orders of magnitude rosenbaum et al 2008 and results were similarly interpreted dose response relationships were linear and derived according to standard methods described in si parallel analysis using epa iris usepa 2015a methodology is also in si 3 results results depicting the shifting human health impacts due to drinking water treatment are presented by 1 estimating human health risks embedded in drinking water treatment scenarios from life cycle assessment 2 assessing treated drinking water benefits developed through dose response curves and 3 comparing burdens and benefits 3 1 human health burden embedded in treating water fig 2 shows the life cycle human toxicity impacts embedded in treating water from 20 μg l 1 cr vi or as v to meet a potential 10 μg l 1 regulatory limit by treating to 8 μg l 1 si tables 2 7 show the detailed inventory required to treat drinking water the associated characterization factors and equivalent human toxicity impacts for each scenario carcinogenicity was between 0 2 and 5 3 cases and non cancer toxicity ranged from 0 2 to 14 3 cases in all treatment scenarios treating cr vi by sbax scenario 2 had the lowest impacts in all categories treating cr vi by wbax with sulfuric acid and lime scenario 1b had the highest carcinogenicity potential treating as v by mo with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide scenario 3a had the highest impacts for non cancer toxicity treatment of cr vi by sbax had significantly lower human toxicity impacts than treatment by wbax sbax treatment impacts were only 1 7 of those from wbax depending on ph control strategy this difference is larger than the expected uncertainty of a factor of 2 3 for the 95 confidence interval and is deemed significant for cr vi treatment by wbax with ph control strategies carbon dioxide with air stripping exhibited the lowest human toxicity impacts by a factor of 1 5 sulfuric acid with lime had the highest carcinogenicity potential and hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide had the highest non carcinogenic toxicity potential for as v treatment adding ph control to the mo treatment system increased sorbent capacity by a factor of 1 5 but it also increased the human toxicity impacts by a factor of 7 13 depending on category 3 1 1 critical contributions to impacts impacts associated with individual life cycle processes were analyzed to identify the largest contributors to the total impacts associated with each scenario results were also grouped by treatment process sorption acidification neutralization regeneration or headloss pumping and illustrated by striping within each bar in fig 2 the production of ph control chemicals dominated human health impacts for scenarios that include them hydrochloric acid contributed 46 52 of the total impacts for scenario 1a and sodium hydroxide contributed 42 53 for scenario 1b lime was responsible for 46 66 of the impacts and sulfuric acid contributed 31 50 for scenario 1c 56 69 of the impacts stemmed from carbon dioxide production electricity generation for neutralization by the blower and the re pressurization pump then accounted for 24 38 of the impacts for scenario 3a acid and caustic productions contributed 44 49 and 40 51 respectively the sorption process and headloss pumping contributed less than 7 of the impacts in the wbax sub scenarios in scenario 2 sbax cr vi treatment energy production for pumping to overcome packed bed headloss contributed 39 61 of the total human toxicity impact production of salt for regeneration contributed 34 51 and the sorption process contributions were 5 10 in scenario 3b treating as v by mo without ph control impacts from sorption comprised 73 93 of the total headloss pumping contributed the remaining 7 27 of impacts the use of ph control chemicals had high embedded health risks largely due to emissions during production hcl production combusts coal and emits volatilized chlorinated organic compounds usepa 1995 sulfuric acid production releases airborne sulfur dioxide usepa 1995 lime produces particulate matter and combustion gasses like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide usepa 1995 because most emissions associated with ph control chemical production are airborne the exposed parties are likely workers at the production facilities and downwind neighbors practices to mitigate human health risks embedded in water treatment therefore also include reducing worker inhalation and improving plant air emission standards for the chemical production facilities 3 1 2 model sensitivity si fig 2 shows sensitivity relationships the model showed the greatest sensitivity to ph control method which is why sub scenarios for each method were explored when treating cr vi by wbax acidification by sulfuric acid instead of hydrochloric acid reduced the life cycle non carcinogenic toxicity impacts by 30 and increased carcinogenicity by 3 acidification by carbon dioxide decreased health impacts by 4 32 compared to hydrochloric acid neutralization by lime instead of sodium hydroxide increased embedded carcinogenicity by 73 and reduced non cancer toxicity by 38 neutralization by air stripping reduced toxicity impacts in all scenarios by 11 48 the effect of changing ph control chemicals was not specifically explored in the as v removal by mo scenario because similar effects were expected as the changes observed in treating cr vi by wbax the model had high sensitivity to the choice of using ecoinvent 2 interim recommended over ecoinvent 2 recommended or ecoinvent 3 recommended data for characterization factors when using ecoinvent 2 recommended data carcinogenic impacts reduced by 25 85 and non carcinogenic impacts reduced by 1 40 compared to using ecoinvent 2 interim recommended data when using ecoinvent 3 recommended data instead of ecoinvent 2 interim recommended data the final life cycle cancer and non cancer burdens of treating the functional unit reduced 93 99 for scenarios that include ph control chemicals 1a 1b and 3a and decreased by 7 64 for the other scenarios this is because the interim data includes the characterization of metals that are associated with very high impacts due to indefinite lifetimes and uncertain fate rosenbaum et al 2008 for example arsenic lead mercury and zinc emitted in the life cycle of sodium hydroxide account for 99 its impact by the interim data this indicates that controlling emissions of metals in the production of ph control chemicals has high capacity to reduce the life cycle cancer and non cancer impact of wellhead drinking water treatment the assumed influent pollutant level highly affected the human health impacts embedded in treatment processes because it changed the fraction of water requiring treatment if the influent level was reduced to 15 μg l 1 the number of embedded health cases reduced by 19 22 if reduced to 10 μg l 1 still requiring some treatment to meet the goal of 8 μg l 1 and ensure continual compliance the embedded cases reduced by 59 66 if the influent level was raised to 30 μg l 1 cases increased by 18 25 the potential effluent mcl strongly influenced the impacts of treatment processes for all scenarios a low potential mcl i e requiring more treatment of 5 μg l 1 increased the toxicity cases by 27 33 a very low potential mcl of 1 μg l 1 increased cases by 43 58 a high potential mcl i e requiring less treatment of 15 μg l 1 decreased the embedded cases by 27 33 a very high potential mcl of 20 μg l 1 which would still require some treatment to reach the goal of 16 μg l 1 decreased the embedded cases by 49 67 the range of studied potential mcls 20 μg l 1 to 1 μg l 1 embedded 6 27 total disease cases for treating cr vi by wbax 0 1 0 6 cases for treating cr vi by sbax and 6 28 cases for treating as v by mo water alkalinity and the nitrate sulfate levels strongly influenced results high influent levels of these parameters could result in prohibitively high human toxicity impacts due to increased demand for ph control or increased competition for sorption sites other inputs like the assumed sorbent capacity and a custom characterization factor for anion exchange resin had little effect on results because sorbent impacts were small compared to ph control chemicals further detail is in the si 3 2 health benefits of reducing pollutant concentrations in drinking water dose response relationships estimated the potential human health benefit of changing the pollutant concentration in drinking water for 3200 people fig 3 shows these relationships for usetox data si fig 3 shows them for epa iris data and si table 8 includes the equations and coefficients to calculate human health risk from drinking water containing any level of cr vi or as v for any size population for both methodologies calculated responses are mean values and 95 confidence intervals are one to two orders of magnitude above and below the mean reducing as v concentration in drinking water from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 changed the potential cancer cases in the exposed population from 2 to 1 cases a reduction of 1 case out of 3200 people the number of potential non cancer disease cases changed from 127 to 63 cases a reduction of 64 cases treatment of as v produced relatively large non cancer benefits reducing cr vi from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 changed the potential cancer cases from 74 to 37 cases indicating that treatment saved 37 cancer cases zero non cancer cases were expected at these exposures and therefore none were saved by treatment treatment of cr vi produced relatively large cancer benefits 3 3 comparing benefits to burdens by reducing the contaminant level in drinking water fewer disease cases occurred and thus increased the health benefit for the served population however increasing treatment also increased the embedded health burden for the external population fig 4 shows this tradeoff for a range of possible cr vi treatment levels and fig 5 shows the tradeoff for as v corresponding figures using epa methodology are found in si figs 4 and 5 these figures assume 20 μg l 1 pollutant in the influent and the treatment level increases i e proposed mcl decreases along the x axis in each case results are shown for cancer effects and non cancer effects separately but both impacts would occur simultaneously benefits and burdens both show linear responses to degree of treatment health benefits were calculated by the difference in disease cases expected at the influent level and the proposed mcl while treatment burdens were the impacts required to treat from the influent level to 80 of the potential mcl to ensure compliance all results were reported with 95 confidence spanning an order of magnitude above and below fig 4a indicates that cancer benefit when removing cr vi from drinking water was an order of magnitude higher than cancer burden for implementing the treatment processes at nearly all potential mcls but fig 4b indicates that non cancer burden was an order of magnitude higher than non cancer benefit at all mcls for example treating cr vi from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 prevents 37 cancer cases and 0 1 non cancer disease cases however the impact of treatment from the added facilities caused 3 to 5 cancer cases and 3 to 14 non cancer disease cases if treating by wbax depending on ph control method or 0 2 cancer cases plus 0 2 non cancer disease cases if treating by sbax for as v treatment fig 5 shows cancer burden using usetox methodology was higher than benefit if ph control was used without ph control an mcl of 20 μg l 1 would have a higher cancer burden than benefit but the cancer benefit increased faster relative to the burden such that a break even point existed between 15 and 20 μg l 1 and lower proposed mcls had benefit higher than the burden the non cancer benefit was very large compared to the cancer benefit and was higher than the non cancer burden at nearly all concentrations for example treating as v from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 avoided 1 cancer case and 63 non cancer disease cases this caused 3 cancer cases and 14 non cancer disease cases if treating by mo with ph control or 0 4 cancer cases and 1 non cancer disease case if treating by mo without ph control 4 discussion quantitatively comparing the benefits of a population consuming treated water to the burdens embedded in providing that treatment can seemingly make one outweigh the other however the implications of tradeoffs involved are more far reaching than a simple ratio 4 1 net benefits export disease treating cr vi saved more cancer cases than non cancer cases it caused fig 4 the benefit ratio number of disease cases saved over the number of cases caused with values over 1 indicating net benefit ranged from 2 to 12 for wbax and was 185 for sbax this indicates that treatment had a net global human health benefit however consideration should also be given to the fact that those benefiting are geospatially separate from those being burdened water treatment benefits are realized directly by the population being served by the water treatment system e g the residents of palm springs the avoided disease cases would have been dispersed throughout a large population comparatively the embedded burdens are borne by populations in geographically separate locations from those benefiting these health risks are passed to workers at the material or energy production plants and neighbors influenced by plant emissions e g acid or caustic production in los angeles or houston installing treatment to meet regulations at any level therefore relocates cancer and non cancer disease risk it is transferred from a large population with disperse disease risk and concentrated to a smaller sub population with direct exposure now carrying a disproportionate share of health risk detailed epidemiological study to prove this has happened was outside the scope of this study but these life cycle indicators illustrate previously unconsidered secondary effects these effects present an ethical dilemma for regulators deciding on drinking water regulations on a national scale the detriments involved with producing extra materials and energy for treatment must be weighed against the benefits gained by treating water current regulation methodology considers cost of treatment but not the human health burden as v treatment indicated a benefit ratio of 3 60 fig 5 however a significant shift in the type of potential disease occurred through treatment reducing as v concentrations prevented many potential non cancer cases but caused some cancer cases the legislation regulating as v in 2006 may therefore have had the net effect of reducing the total number of disease cases but with the side effect of increasing indirect cancer incidence the number of cases says nothing of lethality but society likely values cancer and non cancer cases differently some people may even prefer to prevent any cancer occurrence even if it means incurring non cancer disease by not treating water 4 2 cost and familiarity drives incurring net burden in some cases the burden of treatment clearly outweighs the benefit from an overall human toxicity perspective it might seem clear that treatment should not be implemented however it might be employed anyway for two reasons cost savings or familiarity first treatment with net health burden may be implemented for cost savings for example the embedded cancer in as v treatment using mo with ph control scenario 3a is much higher than the health benefit fig 5a and si fig 5a this indicates that avoiding ph control scenario 3b is the superior choice however media replacement is often responsible for more than 90 of the operational cost of an as v wellhead sorbent system lipps et al 2010 initiating ph control maximizes sorbent capacity and reduces replacement costs comparing cr vi ph control scenarios also illustrates tradeoffs between cost and overall health benefit using co2 with air stripping scenario 1c nearly always had lower human toxicity impact than using acid or caustic fig 4 and si fig 4 however hcl with naoh is cheaper than co2 with air stripping for systems smaller than 3800 l min 1 najm et al 2014 additionally the environmental impacts of the chemicals are three to seven times higher j choe et al 2015 counter intuitively results in these cases showed that system cost and life cycle human toxicity are inversely related in either example decision makers are forced to choose between lowering cost and lowering overall health risk second familiarity may drive selecting treatment with net health burden for example cr vi treatment has very little non cancer benefit compared to the caused burden fig 4b and si fig 4 this presents an ethical dilemma on a local scale decision makers could see that benefits of increased water treatment are realized locally by neighbors friends and voting constituents while detriments incurred from imposing treatment are real they are likely exported to unknown factory workers located far away it may be improbable that the local populous would be willing to forgo treatment and therefore incur a few more disease cases locally in order to save even more cases for unknown population groups elsewhere in the world 5 conclusions current drinking water contaminant regulations do not consider embedded life cycle health risks imposing regulatory limits will reduce some number of health cases from drinking contaminated water but will also cause a non trivial health burden caused by producing materials and energy required for additional treatment to meet the regulation the degree of this burden depends on treatment technology choices and level of required treatment for example water treatment technologies that do not incorporate ph control are likely to have significantly less embedded human toxicity burden than those that do additionally the populace experiencing the benefits likely is not the same as the one carrying the detriments because the materials and energy are not typically produced in the same location where the treated water is consumed installing treatment to meet regulations at any level therefore exports cancer and non cancer disease risk it is transferred from a large population with a disperse disease risk to a concentrated sub population with direct exposure furthermore additional treatment may shift the type of disease expression between cancer and non cancer evaluating prior as v in drinking water regulations suggests a net effect of reducing the total number of disease cases but with the side effect of increasing the indirect incidence of cancer cases fig 5 now the regulation for total cr and cr vi is under review and this study informs considerations beyond only cost occurrence and direct toxicity results suggest that low mcls have high cancer benefit relative to cancer burden fig 4a but also have high non cancer disease burden with very little non cancer disease benefit unfortunately stakeholders may be incentivized to choose treatment options that produce a net health detriment one reason could be due to cost savings for example adding ph control would increase sorbent capacity and reduce replacement costs but would increase embedded health risks another reason is familiarity the exported risks leave local geopolitical boundaries but treatment decisions are made locally and would favor friends and neighbors over far away strangers therefore regional or national policies must be responsible for considering the life cycle burden against the benefit such policies may address the allowable level of contaminant in drinking water acceptable treatment strategies workplace exposures in chemical production facilities and airborne emission

19879,treatment of drinking water decreases human health risks by reducing pollutants but the required materials chemicals and energy emit pollutants and increase health risks we explored human carcinogenic and non carcinogenic disease tradeoffs of water treatment by comparing pollutant dose response curves against life cycle burden using usetox methodology an illustrative wellhead sorbent groundwater treatment system removing hexavalent chromium or pentavalent arsenic serving 3200 people was studied reducing pollutant concentrations in drinking water from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 avoided 37 potential cancer cases and 64 potential non cancer disease cases human carcinogenicity embedded in treatment was 0 2 5 3 cases and non carcinogenic toxicity was 0 2 14 3 cases depending on technology and degree of treatment embedded toxicity impacts from treating cr vi using strong base anion exchange were 10 of those from using weak base anion exchange acidification and neutralization contributed 90 of the toxicity impacts for treatment options requiring ph control in scenarios where benefits exceeded burdens tradeoffs still existed benefits are experienced by a local population but burdens are born externally where the materials and energy are produced thus exporting the health risks even when burdens clearly exceeded benefits cost considerations may still drive selecting a detrimental treatment level or technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment tradeoffs life cycle assessment hexavalent chromium arsenic 1 introduction drinking water treatment has saved an untold number of lives it represents a hallmark of improving quality of life in countries across the world drinking water filtration and chlorination are the most important public health interventions of the 20th century cutler and miller 2004 and continued treatment of major contaminants that pose acute or chronic health risks is essential however as science is able to detect and treat increasing numbers of water constituents at increasingly lower concentrations it is possible that diminishing returns in human health improvement could be approached and tradeoffs stemming from the burden of production should be considered similar to any processed product treating drinking water requires materials and energy the production of which exposes workers to hazards and emits pollutants with deleterious health effects while the population consuming the treated water directly enjoys the health benefits of reduced pollutants in drinking water an external population bears much of the health burden of producing the treated water the advent of life cycle assessment lca has brought approaches for examining environmental and social tradeoffs the focus of most lcas concerning water has been the embedded energy used in water supply pumping providing water from surface water sources requires 0 1 1 5 kw h m 3 arpke and hutzler 2006 crettaz et al 1999 stokes and horvath 2011 and often less from groundwater sources plappally and lienhard 2012 because on site or distribution pumping often dominates the energy balance with 56 94 of the demands amores et al 2013 plappally and lienhard 2012 racoviceanu et al 2007 stokes and horvath 2006 the energy and its associated impacts related to water treatment can be overlooked however water supply and pumping energy is needed regardless of water quality so evaluating the impacts from individual treatment processes is warranted loubet et al 2014 life cycle inventory databases for certain processes are available ahmadi and tiruta barna 2015 mery et al 2013 while other studies found that chlorination demands 0 00002 0 003 kw h m 3 of produced water burton 1996 kroschwitz 1995 and use of coagulants such as alum or polymers demand 0 4 0 7 kw h m 3 kroschwitz 1995 tripathi 2007 even these studies on embedded energy stop short of assessing impacts associated with these processes only infrequent studies compare human health risk to environmental impacts in water treatment including nanofiltration ribera et al 2014 ion exchange choe et al 2013 and nanocomposite sorbents gifford et al 2016 or human health risk embedded in products intended to improve human health gilbertson et al 2014 in this study we examined the health effects of the built infrastructure chemicals materials and operational activities necessary to achieve compliance with recent and potential future regulation of two representative inorganic pollutants common in groundwater i e chromium and arsenic while treatment reduces health risk to the population drinking the water the burden of providing treatment potentially causes indirect human carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health effects in understanding these exported risks we focused on human health benefit of treating water to regulatory limits i e reducing exposure compared against increased exposure burden from industrial chemicals required to fabricate and operate the treatment system although potential ecosystem effects undoubtedly occur this study focused only on the human toxicity effects to maintain direct comparisons of benefits and burdens the present study is unique because it directly compares the human toxicity burden embedded in a number of water treatment processes to the human health benefit they provide the goal of this study was to explore human health tradeoffs of treating water to regulatory limits for as v and cr vi it aimed to 1 compare the magnitude of health benefits against embedded burdens 2 study how these tradeoffs change with varying treatment levels and 3 identify what processes or practices may mitigate the risks this study provides retrospective evaluation of the overall human health impacts of as vi regulation and anticipatory evaluation for potential cr vi regulation human toxicity impacts stemming from drinking water treatment in this system were assessed in three steps first lca was used to estimate risks embedded in the production use and disposal of materials needed to treat drinking water second benefits of treating drinking water were estimated using dose response curves third the burdens and benefits were compared these comparisons were conducted using usetox methodologies to describe human health impacts a hypothetical groundwater system producing 2500 l min 1 670 gal min 1 with well head treatment for 20 μg l 1 of either as v or cr vi influent was selected for this study the 2006 arsenic regulations heavily impacted small groundwater systems like this which previously may have only provided chlorine disinfection impellitteri et al 2007 additionally this would be a typical system size to use wellhead treatment for a single pollutant examples of such a system are found in southern california usa which each produce on average 3800 l min 1 1000 gal min 1 and serve 3200 people cvwd 2016 as v and cr vi are common in groundwater there wellhead treatment is a viable option for a single inorganic pollutant and california more rigidly regulates cr vi at 10 μg l 1 california code of regulations 2014 although the hypothetical system and contaminants were developed in a paradigm of the southwestern united states the findings were intended to apply globally 1 1 background on pollutants of concern pentavalent arsenic as v and hexavalent chromium cr vi were selected as model pollutants due to recent regulatory concerns common occurrence in groundwater and treatment viability with wellhead sorbent systems vast epidemiological evidence connects as v drinking water intake to bladder liver and prostate cancer usepa 2010b non cancer effects from chronic exposure include hyperpigmentation keratosis liver fibrosis and lung disease choong et al 2007 in the united states 12 of groundwater sources contain greater than 20 μg l 1 arsenic usepa 2010b in 2003 the world health organization who performed expanded risk assessment on as v in drinking water and established a 10 μg l 1 maximum guideline who 2011 in 2006 the environmental protection agency epa reduced the as v regulation from 50 to 10 μg l 1 because of growing toxicological evidence and many treatment systems were installed to comply with the new regulatory requirements as v in this study serves as a retrospective evaluation of the prior regulation s overall human health impact epa regulation for total chromium in drinking water is currently 100 μg l 1 but emerging toxicological evidence about cr vi advocates for lower limits california already more rigidly regulates cr vi at 10 μg l 1 california code of regulations 2014 and other states often follow california s example and adopt more stringent regulation this study enables possible future regulation to consider the toxicity burdens embedded in cr vi treatment cr vi is considered a human carcinogen via inhalation exposure usepa 1998 and recent toxicological studies document carcinogenic effects in rodents ingesting high doses of cr vi usepa 2010a non cancer gastrointestinal effects from chronic oral exposure include ulcers diarrhea and vomiting usepa 2010a recent epa monitoring shows 4 of groundwater systems exceed 10 μg l 1 of cr vi usepa 2015b and levels up to 57 or 97 μg l 1 have been observed usepa 2015b frey et al 2004 the most common as v wellhead treatment technique is sorption onto metal oxides mo including ferric oxide hydroxide and activated alumina choong et al 2007 these media demonstrate a high sorption capacity ranging from 280 3900 μg g 1 bang et al 2011 lipps et al 2010 speitel jr et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2005 even at low contaminant concentrations they do not require pretreatment but sorption capacity increases at depressed ph choong et al 2007 various treatment technologies are being piloted and constructed to achieve low cr vi concentrations weak base anion exchange wbax resin exhibits very high affinity and removal capacities ranging from 5300 5600 μg g 1 mcguire et al 2007 najm et al 2014 however achieving such high capacities often requires acidifying the influent water to ph 6 brandhuber et al 2004 mcguire et al 2007 najm et al 2014 by infusing acids or carbon dioxide najm et al 2014 both mo and wbax sorbents are generally single use requiring disposal after exhaustion in contrast strong base anion exchange sbax resin is another common cr vi treatment option that does not require acidification but shows much lower affinity sbax capacity ranges from 110 2800 μg g 1 brandhuber et al 2004 mcguire et al 2007 najm et al 2014 and is hindered by nitrate and sulfate levels sbax can be regenerated using strong salt solution for multiple reuses najm et al 2014 as v and cr vi can also be treated by coagulation membrane filtration or precipitation but those processes are operationally difficult in a wellhead situation and more expensive for small systems where specialized operators and solid waste handling may be unavailable najm et al 2014 2 methodology 2 1 life cycle assessment the system boundary is depicted in fig 1 it included production use and disposal of materials and energy required for wellhead treatment to comply with as v or cr vi regulation including sorbent energy to pump water through the packed bed chemicals to adjust ph or regenerate the sorbent energy to transport the sorbents and chemicals to the site and storage tanks for the sorbents and chemicals the system boundary includes production and transport of all energy and materials but excludes on site infrastructure construction which impacts are expected to be small against the long term operation raluy et al 2005 stokes and horvath 2006 it excluded energy and infrastructure associated with water supply or distribution and chemicals required for disinfection which are required independently of meeting cr vi or as v regulations the functional unit was 93 million m3 25 billion gallons of water treated to an acceptable quality over 70 years this could represent a small system serving 3200 people with a high demand of 1100 l day 1 300 gal day 1 ranging to a larger system serving 10 000 people with low demand of 360 l day 1 96 gal day 1 this study will assume the former since it is consistent with average single well population and per capita demand in southern california cvwd 2016 where wellhead arsenic and chromium treatment is common because results scale linearly with the functional unit using the high demand means health burdens will be high compared to systems with lower demand that use less resources to benefit more people the total flow rate was 2500 l min 1 670 gal min 1 0 96 million gal day 1 all withdrawn water was treated to meet quality goals although human consumption averages only 2 l day 1 unless stated otherwise cr vi or as v influent concentration was assumed to be 20 μg l 1 this is a plausible groundwater concentration that would require treatment to meet a regulatory limit of 10 μg l 1 which is the current who recommendation and epa maximum contaminant level mcl for as v and the current cr vi mcl in california contaminants were considered to occur independently and not coexisting in the source water other assumed influent water quality parameters were representative of groundwaters in southern california including ph 8 200 mg l 1 as caco3 alkalinity 5 mg l 1 nitrate n and 33 mg l 1 sulfate whenever a regulatory limit was to be met it was assumed that the system would treat to 80 of the limit i e 8 μg l 1 it is standard practice for systems to target a lower concentration to ensure continuous compliance and allow for fluctuations in process efficiency and water quality this has the effect of incurring a slightly higher health and environmental impact to provide treatment any treatment goal was met by treating portion of the total flow and bypassing a portion so the blended final quality met the goal which is a common cost saving procedure further details are in supporting information si this study considered three treatment scenarios with different target pollutant and sorbent these scenarios are defined in table 1 sub scenarios were also considered with different ph control methods these sub scenarios are employed to mitigate scenario uncertainty because ph control chemicals are later found to be critical drivers of final results the foreground inventory quantities of materials and energy directly required to produce the functional unit for each of the three scenarios was developed using design assumptions detailed in si and following an approach developed for a cr vi treatment cost estimate najm et al 2014 it includes production use and disposal of sorbent mass based on published capacity oversea and overland transport of the sorbent energy to overcome packed bed headloss chemicals to reduce the ph to 6 before treatment and raise to 8 after treatment and overland transport of the ph control chemicals background life cycle inventory data e g coal combustion in acid production styrene for polymeric resin production and calcite for lime production were determined from the ecoinvent swiss center for life cycle inventories 2010 database and data uncertainty was explored as described below 2 1 1 impact assessment impact assessment converted the inventory into human toxicity midpoints that could be added and compared following standard lca procedures characterization factors from usetox hauschild et al 2008 rosenbaum et al 2008 converted quantities of common products and processes into embedded human toxicity impacts in units of cases the combined recommended plus interim data were used over just the recommended data also known as consensus data because it includes the characterization of metals in the inventory to more fully capture the human toxicity impacts of all life cycle inventory these characterization factors were obtained through the ecoinvent v2 2 website swiss center for life cycle inventories 2010 all calculations were carried out in a spreadsheet human toxicity estimates include impacts from the emission of toxic substances into the environment accounting for fate exposure and effect rosenbaum et al 2008 they do not include health impacts from other pathways such as particulate matter formation or photochemical oxidation furthermore environmental impacts such as ocean acidification and climate change are outside the scope of this study these other health impact pathways and environmental impacts are undoubtedly occurring in the life cycle of drinking water treatment and it is recommended that future studies investigate them the si contains a parallel human toxicity impact assessment using epa traci usepa 2014 units in terms of benzene or toluene equivalents discussion of matching characterization factors to the inventory and developing custom characterization factors to explore inventory uncertainty 2 1 2 uncertainty and sensitivity uncertainty in the lca model included data uncertainty in inventory and impact assessment for example data uncertainty arose from the assumed per capita water demand that was high compared to most systems therefore increasing the included inventory model uncertainty arose from variations in treatment system design constraints which was inherent to modeling a theoretical system meant to represent a general class of treatment in lieu of a single specific operational system further model uncertainty came with calculation limitations that assume linear responses another source of uncertainty was reliance on a published database in lieu of direct observations furthermore the referenced database was recently updated from version 2 to version 3 and characterization factors that included both recommended and interim data were used instead of only recommended data to include metals characterization uncertainty was addressed in three ways first a sensitivity analysis was developed to explore which inputs and assumptions influenced the final results and to what degree the sensitivity analysis illustrated the variability in the results identified critical treatment choices and allowed results to be adapted for various water quality situations for example inventory sensitivity was explored by observing the change in final impacts due to varying the assumed influent water quality and treatment target second a scenario analysis was conducted to focus on the inputs deemed to have the largest sensitivity for example because ph control chemicals were the largest contributors to results multiple ph control scenarios were analyzed third inventory uncertainty was mitigated by qualitatively assessing data reliability and using empirical relationships to determine data distribution instead of relying on published point values this meant to estimate the error pursuant to the parameter and model uncertainty discussed in the previous paragraph it revealed that characterization factors could have a squared geometric standard deviation gsd2 of one to three results could therefore vary by a factor of 2 3 within a 95 confidence interval 2 2 health benefits of treating drinking water dose response relationships were used to project the human health benefit of lowering the drinking water pollutant concentration changes in pollutant exposure could be directly converted to estimated health impact cases then compared to the embedded human toxicity burden from the lca results human adult cancer and non cancer cases associated with chronic ingestion of different concentrations of as v and cr vi in drinking water were estimated under usetox methodology in terms of cases by the human health effect factor from the inorganics database 1 00 hauschild et al 2008 cancer and non cancer cases were estimated separately the human health benefit from treating drinking water was defined as the number of disease cases expected at the influent concentration minus the number of cases expected at the mcl the calculated health effects were interpreted as maximum potentials i e worst case scenario in each case uncertainty in the underlying data spanned one to two orders of magnitude rosenbaum et al 2008 and results were similarly interpreted dose response relationships were linear and derived according to standard methods described in si parallel analysis using epa iris usepa 2015a methodology is also in si 3 results results depicting the shifting human health impacts due to drinking water treatment are presented by 1 estimating human health risks embedded in drinking water treatment scenarios from life cycle assessment 2 assessing treated drinking water benefits developed through dose response curves and 3 comparing burdens and benefits 3 1 human health burden embedded in treating water fig 2 shows the life cycle human toxicity impacts embedded in treating water from 20 μg l 1 cr vi or as v to meet a potential 10 μg l 1 regulatory limit by treating to 8 μg l 1 si tables 2 7 show the detailed inventory required to treat drinking water the associated characterization factors and equivalent human toxicity impacts for each scenario carcinogenicity was between 0 2 and 5 3 cases and non cancer toxicity ranged from 0 2 to 14 3 cases in all treatment scenarios treating cr vi by sbax scenario 2 had the lowest impacts in all categories treating cr vi by wbax with sulfuric acid and lime scenario 1b had the highest carcinogenicity potential treating as v by mo with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide scenario 3a had the highest impacts for non cancer toxicity treatment of cr vi by sbax had significantly lower human toxicity impacts than treatment by wbax sbax treatment impacts were only 1 7 of those from wbax depending on ph control strategy this difference is larger than the expected uncertainty of a factor of 2 3 for the 95 confidence interval and is deemed significant for cr vi treatment by wbax with ph control strategies carbon dioxide with air stripping exhibited the lowest human toxicity impacts by a factor of 1 5 sulfuric acid with lime had the highest carcinogenicity potential and hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide had the highest non carcinogenic toxicity potential for as v treatment adding ph control to the mo treatment system increased sorbent capacity by a factor of 1 5 but it also increased the human toxicity impacts by a factor of 7 13 depending on category 3 1 1 critical contributions to impacts impacts associated with individual life cycle processes were analyzed to identify the largest contributors to the total impacts associated with each scenario results were also grouped by treatment process sorption acidification neutralization regeneration or headloss pumping and illustrated by striping within each bar in fig 2 the production of ph control chemicals dominated human health impacts for scenarios that include them hydrochloric acid contributed 46 52 of the total impacts for scenario 1a and sodium hydroxide contributed 42 53 for scenario 1b lime was responsible for 46 66 of the impacts and sulfuric acid contributed 31 50 for scenario 1c 56 69 of the impacts stemmed from carbon dioxide production electricity generation for neutralization by the blower and the re pressurization pump then accounted for 24 38 of the impacts for scenario 3a acid and caustic productions contributed 44 49 and 40 51 respectively the sorption process and headloss pumping contributed less than 7 of the impacts in the wbax sub scenarios in scenario 2 sbax cr vi treatment energy production for pumping to overcome packed bed headloss contributed 39 61 of the total human toxicity impact production of salt for regeneration contributed 34 51 and the sorption process contributions were 5 10 in scenario 3b treating as v by mo without ph control impacts from sorption comprised 73 93 of the total headloss pumping contributed the remaining 7 27 of impacts the use of ph control chemicals had high embedded health risks largely due to emissions during production hcl production combusts coal and emits volatilized chlorinated organic compounds usepa 1995 sulfuric acid production releases airborne sulfur dioxide usepa 1995 lime produces particulate matter and combustion gasses like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide usepa 1995 because most emissions associated with ph control chemical production are airborne the exposed parties are likely workers at the production facilities and downwind neighbors practices to mitigate human health risks embedded in water treatment therefore also include reducing worker inhalation and improving plant air emission standards for the chemical production facilities 3 1 2 model sensitivity si fig 2 shows sensitivity relationships the model showed the greatest sensitivity to ph control method which is why sub scenarios for each method were explored when treating cr vi by wbax acidification by sulfuric acid instead of hydrochloric acid reduced the life cycle non carcinogenic toxicity impacts by 30 and increased carcinogenicity by 3 acidification by carbon dioxide decreased health impacts by 4 32 compared to hydrochloric acid neutralization by lime instead of sodium hydroxide increased embedded carcinogenicity by 73 and reduced non cancer toxicity by 38 neutralization by air stripping reduced toxicity impacts in all scenarios by 11 48 the effect of changing ph control chemicals was not specifically explored in the as v removal by mo scenario because similar effects were expected as the changes observed in treating cr vi by wbax the model had high sensitivity to the choice of using ecoinvent 2 interim recommended over ecoinvent 2 recommended or ecoinvent 3 recommended data for characterization factors when using ecoinvent 2 recommended data carcinogenic impacts reduced by 25 85 and non carcinogenic impacts reduced by 1 40 compared to using ecoinvent 2 interim recommended data when using ecoinvent 3 recommended data instead of ecoinvent 2 interim recommended data the final life cycle cancer and non cancer burdens of treating the functional unit reduced 93 99 for scenarios that include ph control chemicals 1a 1b and 3a and decreased by 7 64 for the other scenarios this is because the interim data includes the characterization of metals that are associated with very high impacts due to indefinite lifetimes and uncertain fate rosenbaum et al 2008 for example arsenic lead mercury and zinc emitted in the life cycle of sodium hydroxide account for 99 its impact by the interim data this indicates that controlling emissions of metals in the production of ph control chemicals has high capacity to reduce the life cycle cancer and non cancer impact of wellhead drinking water treatment the assumed influent pollutant level highly affected the human health impacts embedded in treatment processes because it changed the fraction of water requiring treatment if the influent level was reduced to 15 μg l 1 the number of embedded health cases reduced by 19 22 if reduced to 10 μg l 1 still requiring some treatment to meet the goal of 8 μg l 1 and ensure continual compliance the embedded cases reduced by 59 66 if the influent level was raised to 30 μg l 1 cases increased by 18 25 the potential effluent mcl strongly influenced the impacts of treatment processes for all scenarios a low potential mcl i e requiring more treatment of 5 μg l 1 increased the toxicity cases by 27 33 a very low potential mcl of 1 μg l 1 increased cases by 43 58 a high potential mcl i e requiring less treatment of 15 μg l 1 decreased the embedded cases by 27 33 a very high potential mcl of 20 μg l 1 which would still require some treatment to reach the goal of 16 μg l 1 decreased the embedded cases by 49 67 the range of studied potential mcls 20 μg l 1 to 1 μg l 1 embedded 6 27 total disease cases for treating cr vi by wbax 0 1 0 6 cases for treating cr vi by sbax and 6 28 cases for treating as v by mo water alkalinity and the nitrate sulfate levels strongly influenced results high influent levels of these parameters could result in prohibitively high human toxicity impacts due to increased demand for ph control or increased competition for sorption sites other inputs like the assumed sorbent capacity and a custom characterization factor for anion exchange resin had little effect on results because sorbent impacts were small compared to ph control chemicals further detail is in the si 3 2 health benefits of reducing pollutant concentrations in drinking water dose response relationships estimated the potential human health benefit of changing the pollutant concentration in drinking water for 3200 people fig 3 shows these relationships for usetox data si fig 3 shows them for epa iris data and si table 8 includes the equations and coefficients to calculate human health risk from drinking water containing any level of cr vi or as v for any size population for both methodologies calculated responses are mean values and 95 confidence intervals are one to two orders of magnitude above and below the mean reducing as v concentration in drinking water from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 changed the potential cancer cases in the exposed population from 2 to 1 cases a reduction of 1 case out of 3200 people the number of potential non cancer disease cases changed from 127 to 63 cases a reduction of 64 cases treatment of as v produced relatively large non cancer benefits reducing cr vi from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 changed the potential cancer cases from 74 to 37 cases indicating that treatment saved 37 cancer cases zero non cancer cases were expected at these exposures and therefore none were saved by treatment treatment of cr vi produced relatively large cancer benefits 3 3 comparing benefits to burdens by reducing the contaminant level in drinking water fewer disease cases occurred and thus increased the health benefit for the served population however increasing treatment also increased the embedded health burden for the external population fig 4 shows this tradeoff for a range of possible cr vi treatment levels and fig 5 shows the tradeoff for as v corresponding figures using epa methodology are found in si figs 4 and 5 these figures assume 20 μg l 1 pollutant in the influent and the treatment level increases i e proposed mcl decreases along the x axis in each case results are shown for cancer effects and non cancer effects separately but both impacts would occur simultaneously benefits and burdens both show linear responses to degree of treatment health benefits were calculated by the difference in disease cases expected at the influent level and the proposed mcl while treatment burdens were the impacts required to treat from the influent level to 80 of the potential mcl to ensure compliance all results were reported with 95 confidence spanning an order of magnitude above and below fig 4a indicates that cancer benefit when removing cr vi from drinking water was an order of magnitude higher than cancer burden for implementing the treatment processes at nearly all potential mcls but fig 4b indicates that non cancer burden was an order of magnitude higher than non cancer benefit at all mcls for example treating cr vi from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 prevents 37 cancer cases and 0 1 non cancer disease cases however the impact of treatment from the added facilities caused 3 to 5 cancer cases and 3 to 14 non cancer disease cases if treating by wbax depending on ph control method or 0 2 cancer cases plus 0 2 non cancer disease cases if treating by sbax for as v treatment fig 5 shows cancer burden using usetox methodology was higher than benefit if ph control was used without ph control an mcl of 20 μg l 1 would have a higher cancer burden than benefit but the cancer benefit increased faster relative to the burden such that a break even point existed between 15 and 20 μg l 1 and lower proposed mcls had benefit higher than the burden the non cancer benefit was very large compared to the cancer benefit and was higher than the non cancer burden at nearly all concentrations for example treating as v from 20 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 avoided 1 cancer case and 63 non cancer disease cases this caused 3 cancer cases and 14 non cancer disease cases if treating by mo with ph control or 0 4 cancer cases and 1 non cancer disease case if treating by mo without ph control 4 discussion quantitatively comparing the benefits of a population consuming treated water to the burdens embedded in providing that treatment can seemingly make one outweigh the other however the implications of tradeoffs involved are more far reaching than a simple ratio 4 1 net benefits export disease treating cr vi saved more cancer cases than non cancer cases it caused fig 4 the benefit ratio number of disease cases saved over the number of cases caused with values over 1 indicating net benefit ranged from 2 to 12 for wbax and was 185 for sbax this indicates that treatment had a net global human health benefit however consideration should also be given to the fact that those benefiting are geospatially separate from those being burdened water treatment benefits are realized directly by the population being served by the water treatment system e g the residents of palm springs the avoided disease cases would have been dispersed throughout a large population comparatively the embedded burdens are borne by populations in geographically separate locations from those benefiting these health risks are passed to workers at the material or energy production plants and neighbors influenced by plant emissions e g acid or caustic production in los angeles or houston installing treatment to meet regulations at any level therefore relocates cancer and non cancer disease risk it is transferred from a large population with disperse disease risk and concentrated to a smaller sub population with direct exposure now carrying a disproportionate share of health risk detailed epidemiological study to prove this has happened was outside the scope of this study but these life cycle indicators illustrate previously unconsidered secondary effects these effects present an ethical dilemma for regulators deciding on drinking water regulations on a national scale the detriments involved with producing extra materials and energy for treatment must be weighed against the benefits gained by treating water current regulation methodology considers cost of treatment but not the human health burden as v treatment indicated a benefit ratio of 3 60 fig 5 however a significant shift in the type of potential disease occurred through treatment reducing as v concentrations prevented many potential non cancer cases but caused some cancer cases the legislation regulating as v in 2006 may therefore have had the net effect of reducing the total number of disease cases but with the side effect of increasing indirect cancer incidence the number of cases says nothing of lethality but society likely values cancer and non cancer cases differently some people may even prefer to prevent any cancer occurrence even if it means incurring non cancer disease by not treating water 4 2 cost and familiarity drives incurring net burden in some cases the burden of treatment clearly outweighs the benefit from an overall human toxicity perspective it might seem clear that treatment should not be implemented however it might be employed anyway for two reasons cost savings or familiarity first treatment with net health burden may be implemented for cost savings for example the embedded cancer in as v treatment using mo with ph control scenario 3a is much higher than the health benefit fig 5a and si fig 5a this indicates that avoiding ph control scenario 3b is the superior choice however media replacement is often responsible for more than 90 of the operational cost of an as v wellhead sorbent system lipps et al 2010 initiating ph control maximizes sorbent capacity and reduces replacement costs comparing cr vi ph control scenarios also illustrates tradeoffs between cost and overall health benefit using co2 with air stripping scenario 1c nearly always had lower human toxicity impact than using acid or caustic fig 4 and si fig 4 however hcl with naoh is cheaper than co2 with air stripping for systems smaller than 3800 l min 1 najm et al 2014 additionally the environmental impacts of the chemicals are three to seven times higher j choe et al 2015 counter intuitively results in these cases showed that system cost and life cycle human toxicity are inversely related in either example decision makers are forced to choose between lowering cost and lowering overall health risk second familiarity may drive selecting treatment with net health burden for example cr vi treatment has very little non cancer benefit compared to the caused burden fig 4b and si fig 4 this presents an ethical dilemma on a local scale decision makers could see that benefits of increased water treatment are realized locally by neighbors friends and voting constituents while detriments incurred from imposing treatment are real they are likely exported to unknown factory workers located far away it may be improbable that the local populous would be willing to forgo treatment and therefore incur a few more disease cases locally in order to save even more cases for unknown population groups elsewhere in the world 5 conclusions current drinking water contaminant regulations do not consider embedded life cycle health risks imposing regulatory limits will reduce some number of health cases from drinking contaminated water but will also cause a non trivial health burden caused by producing materials and energy required for additional treatment to meet the regulation the degree of this burden depends on treatment technology choices and level of required treatment for example water treatment technologies that do not incorporate ph control are likely to have significantly less embedded human toxicity burden than those that do additionally the populace experiencing the benefits likely is not the same as the one carrying the detriments because the materials and energy are not typically produced in the same location where the treated water is consumed installing treatment to meet regulations at any level therefore exports cancer and non cancer disease risk it is transferred from a large population with a disperse disease risk to a concentrated sub population with direct exposure furthermore additional treatment may shift the type of disease expression between cancer and non cancer evaluating prior as v in drinking water regulations suggests a net effect of reducing the total number of disease cases but with the side effect of increasing the indirect incidence of cancer cases fig 5 now the regulation for total cr and cr vi is under review and this study informs considerations beyond only cost occurrence and direct toxicity results suggest that low mcls have high cancer benefit relative to cancer burden fig 4a but also have high non cancer disease burden with very little non cancer disease benefit unfortunately stakeholders may be incentivized to choose treatment options that produce a net health detriment one reason could be due to cost savings for example adding ph control would increase sorbent capacity and reduce replacement costs but would increase embedded health risks another reason is familiarity the exported risks leave local geopolitical boundaries but treatment decisions are made locally and would favor friends and neighbors over far away strangers therefore regional or national policies must be responsible for considering the life cycle burden against the benefit such policies may address the allowable level of contaminant in drinking water acceptable treatment strategies workplace exposures in chemical production facilities and airborne emission standards balancing these tradeoffs queries values such as who should bear the health risk what type of disease should be incurred and how much money one s health is worth acknowledgments funding was
