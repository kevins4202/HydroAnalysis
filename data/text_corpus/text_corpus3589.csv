17945,the curve number cn method developed by the united states department of agriculture usda in 1954 is the most common adopted method to estimate surface runoff for years applicability of the cn method is a conundrum when implementing to other countries specifically countries with more complex natural environment may require more dedicated adjustments therefore the current cn look up table provided by usda might not be appropriate and could be questionable to be applied directly to regions elsewhere some studies have been conducted to modify cn values according to specified natural characteristics in scattered regions of mainland china however an integral and representative work is still not available to address potential concerns in general matters in this study a large set of rainfall runoff monitoring data were collected to adjust cn values in 55 study sites across china the results showed that the revised cn values are largely different from cn look up table provided by usda which would lead to huge errors in runoff estimation in this study the revised cn dubbed cn china provides better reference guidelines that are suitable for most natural conditions in china in

of these methods are very limited because they require many parameters and detailed soil attribute data that are difficult to acquire in 1949 mockus proposed a framework to predict runoff based on

conservation service nrcs proposed cn method in 1954 according to this framework boughton 1989 hawkins et al 2019 which was published in the national engineering handbook usda 1954 in order to meet the design needs of the watershed protection and flood prevention act public law 83 566 hawkins et al 2019 the cn method has been widely used since then the conceptual and empirical cn method is simple with only one parameter cn making it the most widely used method for calculating runoff based on rainfall events d asaro et al 2014 garen and moore 2005 gaume et al 2004 lal et al 2019 wilson et al 2017 besides the cn method has been widely adopted in many hydrological models hawkins et al 2019 soulis et al 2017 the cn method will be performed well if model users obtain cn values from measured rainfall runoff data when available lal et al 2017 cn parameters reflect the effect of soil infiltration capacity ponce and hawkins 1996 zoure et al 2019 key impact factors of cn include soil

values have been derived experimentally from rainfall runoff events measurement over a wide range of geographic soil and land management conditions based on the monitoring data of 150 watersheds in the u s scientists organized a cn look up table usda 1954 which is widely used around the world subsequently hawkins found that the runoff calculated by this method was very sensitive to cn values even more than rainfall depth hawkins 1975 previous study has shown that a variation of 10 of cn value leads to a variation from 45 to 55 runoff boughton 1989 therefore the accuracy of the cn value plays a crucial role in the estimation of runoff various applications and modifications of cn method have been implemented in china including finding the local initial abstraction ia and cn values based on rainfall runoff monitoring data fu et al 2011 jiao et al 2015 shi et al 2009 the effects of different soil land use slope on cn values dong et al 2015 huang et al 2007 huang et al 2006 relationship between cn value and the rainfall depth under long term sequence and using remote sensing to study the spatial heterogeneity of cn values chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 there is a common conundrum that scientists could not find the corresponding cn values from cn look up table the primary reasons are the complexity and interactions among land use type soil infiltration capacity and climate characteristics which could result in an enormous error between cn from look up table and reality for instance nearly 70 of the rainfall in the u s will seep into the soil while farmlands are fragmented and densely drained in china infiltration rate is low due to the dense surface irrigation and drainage system he et al 2001 in addition topographic variations in china are substantially more complicated than in the u s therefore parameters are being over calibrated in order to achieve better simulation performance especially when users adopt cn values from look up table to hydrological models the embedded uncertainty with potentially large errors in surface runoff estimation is going to affect the corresponding scientific credibility in the following analytical processes such as the simulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in watershed scale yen et al 2014 thus a national scale research is urgently needed to alleviate the tremendous differences in cn value and the corresponding predominant controlling factors the primary goal of this study was to adjust cn values based on the monitored rainfall runoff data in china in order to provide revised cn values that can be better representative to reflect actual hydrological conditions in china three objectives were defined to i calculate cn values using the monitored rainfall runoff data under different climate soil land use and slope conditions across mainland china contiguous china ii compare cn values obtained from cn look up table with the calculated cn values under corresponding field conditions soil land use and slope and iii identify the key factors differentiating cn values under chinese field conditions from those obtained by nrcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of scs cn method the cn method was developed by usda in 1950s originally intended for estimating the depth of surface runoff in an ungauged small catchment and later implemented also to non agricultural watersheds with other extended applications boughton 1989 hawkins et al 2019 ponce and hawkins 1996 the simple structure approach relies on the parameter cn a lumped expression of a watershed potential hydrologic response the cn method is based on a water balance function eq 1 and two fundamental hypotheses eq 1 shows the rainfall depth equals to the summery of ia cumulative infiltration f and direct runoff q the first hypothesis is that the ratio of direct runoff to the maximum potential runoff is equal to the ratio of the amount of actual infiltration to the potential maximum retention eq 2 the second hypothesis states that the amount of initial abstraction is some fraction of the potential maximum retention eq 3 mishra and singh 1999 the method has interpreted empirical relationships between initial abstraction ia and potential maximum retention or infiltration s through extensive rainfall runoff experimental data ia 0 2s functions for s eq 4 and cn eq 5 are as follow 1 p i a f q 2 q p i a f s 3 i a λ s 4 s 5 p 2 q 4 q 2 5 pq 1 2 5 cn 25400 s 254 where p rainfall depth mm ia initial abstraction of the rainfall mm f cumulative infiltration excluding ia mm q runoff depth mm s potential maximum retention or infiltration mm and λ is the initial abstraction coefficient empirically λ is treated as a constant 0 2 the relationship between ia and s is ia λs c n curve number which is a dimensionless parameter with the range from 0 to 100 and the higher the c n value the greater the potential of surface runoff the scs model has no strict physical theory and its runoff calculation formula is summarized by measured data from more than 150 small watersheds in the u s it reflects the empirical law of rainfall runoff events the key to affect the accuracy of results is whether the parameter cn value can accurately reflect the watershed characteristics the range of cn values is 0 100 in this study spatial variable cn values are calculated into a single value to represent the average condition of study sites the arithmetic means is used to determine the cn value when cn values are calculated from real storm data as outlined in the preceding section a secondary relationship always happened between decreased cn and increased rainfall depth and finally cn approach a constant hawkins 1993 there are many methods to determine cn values from observed rainfall runoff data while no agreement has been settled because no one method shows outstanding advantage lal et al 2017 in addition the fact that we use mean cn value otherwise asymptotic cn value is the lack of abundant rainfall runoff data at each study site what s more frequency matching is used to calculate the chosen return period runoff from the same return period rainfall depth hawkins 1993 the rainfall and runoff depths are collected separately and then arranged on a rank order to produce rainfall runoff pairs during equal return periods hawkins et al 2009 in this work we used the actual rainfall runoff events data to calculate cn values other than the rank order data because we don t have enough rainfall runoff events in some study sites to match rainfall runoff data in the same return period therefore no obvious difference identified between the two forms of rainfall runoff data 2 2 data collection in this study rainfall runoff monitoring data were collected from 31 monitoring plots and 24 watersheds to calculate the cn value these sites located in 21 provinces in china the distribution of all study sites is shown in fig 1 total 55 sites were selected depending on available monitoring rainfall runoff event data the land use soil and plant type slope and other attributes for these sites are showed in table 1 in addition the detailed data sources for each study site are showed in supplementary material table s2 the soil and land use data are derived from soil surveys conducted by soil testing and formula fertilization program while the slope and climatic data are collected from literature review the rainfall runoff data used to determine cn values were collected from literature and chinese ecosystem research network cern the time scale of rainfall runoff data is the day 2 3 validation of the revised cn in order to verify whether cn values calculated based on the monitored data can well simulate the runoff in the study area four research sites were selected with abundant data and divided the rainfall event into two parts the first part was used to determine cn values and the second part was used to verify the validity of the cn value by using the calculated cn value to estimate the runoff depth and compare with the measured runoff depth the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used to evaluate the performance of the method the nse was used as indices of the agreement between the calculated and observed values of runoff depth perfect fit when nse equals to 1 and the worse value of nse is when the nash coefficient is above 0 6 the calculated values were deemed qualified 6 nse 1 i 1 n q 0 q c i 2 i 1 n q 0 q 0 i 2 where qo observed runoff depth qc calculated runoff depth 2 4 cn values obtained from the table cn

testing and formula fertilization program the equation for calculating ks is as follows 7 k s 0 056c 0 016s 0 231 o m 0 693 where c is the percentage of clay content in soil s is the percentage of sand in soil and o m is the percentage of organic matter in soil 3 results 3 1 relationships between rainfall and runoff events there is a linear correlation between rainfall and runoff data from 401 events fig 2 distribution of scatters in the graph is highly concentrated slope of the trend line in the graph reflects the runoff coefficient which is around 0 62 the intercept represents the minimum rainfall that produces runoff which is 20 94 mm it was found that the scs cn model has better simulation effect on study areas with runoff coefficient greater than 0 5 than areas with runoff coefficient less than 0 5 peng and you 2006 in different study areas with same rainfall depth the amount of runoff produced was substantially different in the same study area the same amount of rainfall at different times or seasons also had a large difference in runoff generation these two phenomena indicated that influencing factors of the cn value are complex interactions in external natural geographical conditions will cause the difference in regional runoff generation ability while the internal seasonal variation and rainfall duration will also cause the difference in the runoff relationships between cn values and runoff depth are shown in fig 3 under different rainfall depths according to the scs cn method larger cn values may generate greater runoff under the same rainfall event however small rainfall events can still generate runoff by proper amount of initial abstraction and the soil infiltration ability it indicates the research area has a strong ability to produce runoff therefore the corresponding cn value could be large 3 2 comparison of calculated and table cn entries cn values cn values of the 55 study sites were calculated from the measured data of rainfall and runoff events and the average cn value of different events in the same study area represents the cn parameters of this site the calculated cn values have showed clear differences compared to the cn values obtained from the table cn entries usda 1954 for the study area fig 4 supplementary materials table s1 results revealed that the calculated cn value ranges 12 80 97 45 while the looked up table indicates as 36 91 the difference between calculated and looked up values ranges between 40 41 34 08 comparisons of average value and error at each point indicated that the cn value acquired by table cn entries have reduced its variation it could be substantially different by regions which largely ignores the study area characteristics moreover the cn table cn entries provided by usda scs were summarized from a limited set of watershed observations bartlett et al 2016 ogden et al 2017 thus these differences have supported our doubts on the applicability of the existing table cn entries in china and for the areas with different characteristics in different regions the existing looked up table for cn is not suitable for runoff estimation the blue line represents the calculated value of the monitoring point cn and the orange line represents the cn value obtained by the existing look up the table fig 4 it can be found that cn value based on the measured data has a large variation range differences between the monitoring points can be clearly found while the orange line has a small fluctuation range floating between 50 80 in literature it is nearly impossible to see that the cn value is less than 30 under actual environmental conditions and the range of variation is between 30 100 here some study sites with cn values more than 80 and some are less than 30 after repeated inspections of the data the occurrence of extreme cn values is because of the different forest type and local characters 3 3 model performance the purpose of validation conducted in the study was to ensure the driven results are reasonable in scientific measures one should keep in mind that the derived results could be biased by changing validation standard yen et al 2016 in this study 0 6 is the value of nse set to be the statistical guideline of satisfactory to figure out the reliability of cn method the simulated runoff was compared with observed runoff depths for this purpose four sites with large set of rainfall runoff data were selected to validate the performance of this model the freedom of rainfall runoff events to validate the accuracy of cn parameters of these four sites is 7 14 8 and 14 respectively the nse results are 0 98 0 76 0 86 and 0 84 respectively far more than 0 6 which indicates that the cn method is accurate enough to simulate runoff depth fig 5 4 discussions 4 1 differences of cn values between the united states and china studies have shown that soil moisture contents hydrological processes infiltration and other losses through rainfall have significant spatial and temporal variability ponce and hawkins 1996 tramblay et al 2010 wang 2018 zeng et al 2017 it indicated that the forestland has lowest runoff production capacity and the paddy field has highest choi et al 2019 other researchers also found that the land use types with high cn values are mainly urban area farmland and water bodies and the low cn values are in forests orchards shrubs and grasslands choi et al 2019 egodawatta et al 2007 li et al 2018 soulis et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 this might be associated with less vegetation cover in urban area farmland and water bodies compared to forests although cn method may introduce large uncertainty in runoff estimation of paddy field many scholars still treat paddy filed as one kind of land use type with low infiltration capacity in order to estimate runoff depth easily the main character of curve number method is its base on accumulated experience in use mainly in the u s there are many weaknesses and limitations when the original cn values were applied in china boughton 1989 furthermore some watersheds performed quite differently from the basic cn runoff response patterns leading to great differences between model and the actual processes the major weakness and utmost potential source of error is the sensitivity of estimated runoff in the selection of the curve number 4 2 impact factors of the revised cn failure to evaluate the size of regional scale might affect the corresponding error between actual runoff and cn parameters simulated runoff by summarizing the previous studies it was found that this model is suitable for the study of small and medium scale watersheds with an area of about 0 25 1000 km2 even the cn method was appropriate still the dominant behavior of cn value s response to rainfall depth is important to calculate the runoff depth muche et al 2019 soulis et al 2009 results indicated a decrease in cn value with increase in rainfall but stable at high rainfall intensity fig 6 it indicates that the rainfall depth is the primary factor to determine the cn value and the asymptotic constant value is the best way to identify cn parameters for a watershed and other studies have showed that cn values calculated from measured rainfall runoff data vary systematically with the rainfall depth the determination of a single asymptotic cn value observed for very high rainfall depths to characterize the watershed s runoff response soulis and valiantzas 2012 standard behavior of cn response for the rainfall runoff relationship found in our study with a distinct bias for high cn at lower rainfall depths indicates that rainfall is another key factor in determining cn rainfall duration could be an important phenomenon to increase soil water content which will be at maximum after certain rainfall period thorndahl and willems 2008 after attaining maximum soil water contents cn values will be increased nearly up to 100 indicating runoff generation capacity is also increased as the previous soil moisture condition amc has a great influence on the results lal et al 2019 the study sites with detailed monitoring data can be more reliable for same test sites runoff coefficient is different under different rain intensity therefore cn value as the parameter of regional runoff needs to be able to represent the runoff property of the region which needs to be calculated long term monitoring of rainfall in different seasons and intensity can reflect the overall situation of the area yeh et al 2018 curve number varies spatially with the change in land use type soil type and soil humidity in the early stage ross et al 2018 urban land and water bodies have higher cn value compared to forests mountains and hills yang and toor 2017 the effect of soil properties on cn is divided into four categories according to the permeability of soil american soil experts initially based on more than 14 000 soil data classified soils with similar runoff generation capacity called the hydrological soil group hsg ross et al 2018 stewart et al 2012 the runoff generation capacities from low to high are divided into four categories a b c and d detailed classification criteria showed in the us national engineering handbook 1972 usda 1972 4 3 shortcomings and future perspectives the main limitation of our study is the ignorance of antecedent moisture condition amc because the rainfall runoff event data we used did not have the rainfall data of the days before the event occurred it was impossible to know the soil moisture conditions in the early stage of the event another limitation is the number of rainfall runoff events is still not large enough to reflect the more detailed hydrological conditions for some study sites in this study we have tried our best to collect more data in order to cover more regions of china and collect more rainfall runoff events to calculate accurate results the runoff calculated by the scs cn method is known to be sensitive to cn values which is the largest potential source of error low frequency and poor resolution of monitoring data will result in poor estimation of runoff even with years of data available for calibration of the curve numbers substantial errors may still occur boughton 1989 obviously we are getting more and more accurate and high resolution rainfall data through advanced observation devices thus a strong runoff estimation method is urgently needed while it is very difficult to establish the mechanism equation of rainfall and runoff because infiltration capacity is affected by many factors such as soil properties vegetation coverage land use type climate etc fortunately we have such a simple empirical method to estimate runoff and meet the needs of massive simulations there are several studies mapping the global cn values based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis harmonized world soil database hwsd and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data sets lin et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 those methods are efficient to produce high resolution cn values while the huge error will be introduced by the original cn lookup table which may not suitable for other countries our work is going to be very useful to resolve this issue with relatively minor effort and future research should focus on the establishment of a dynamic runoff estimation model the input data of the model should include meteorological topographical soil type land use and vegetation cover data sets for ungauged watersheds cn parameters are usually estimated by well known handbook tables usda 1972 according to the hydrologic soil group hsg land use surface condition and antecedent moisture condition amc in the presence of variable conditions soil type land cover and land use within the basin an area weighted average cn is often used according to our results it is urgently needed a cn handbook table for different regions which can be established based on local rainfall runoff monitoring network data 5 conclusion the curve number approach is an effective simple and widely used method to estimate surface runoff volume the revised cn values calculated by using monitoring data from 55 sites in china are considerably different from the cn values acquired from us based cn value lookup table it has been shown that the monitoring data can provide valuable information to calculate the cn value in this study the modified cn values cn china derived from the actual rainfall runoff data play an important role and a very useful reference in future runoff estimation the results of this study provide new insight into the establishment of the cn table that is more suitable for china and possibly many other countries around the world one can take advantage of the given work to incorporate more details of the curve number approach to further improve the corresponding accuracy and applicability declaration of

with abundant data and divided the rainfall event into two parts the first part was used to determine cn values and the second part was used to verify the validity of the cn value by using the calculated cn value to estimate the runoff depth and compare with the measured runoff depth the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used to evaluate the performance of the method the nse was used as indices of the agreement between the calculated and observed values of runoff depth perfect fit when nse equals to 1 and the worse value of nse is when the nash coefficient is above 0 6 the calculated values were deemed qualified 6 nse 1 i 1 n q 0 q c i 2 i 1 n q 0 q 0 i 2 where qo observed runoff depth qc calculated runoff depth 2 4 cn values obtained from the table cn

sand in soil and o m is the percentage of organic matter in soil 3 results 3 1 relationships between rainfall and runoff events there is a linear correlation between rainfall and runoff data from 401 events fig 2 distribution of scatters in the graph is highly concentrated slope of the trend line in the graph reflects the runoff coefficient which is around 0 62 the intercept represents the minimum rainfall that produces runoff which is 20 94 mm it was found that the scs cn model has better simulation effect on study areas with runoff coefficient greater than 0 5 than areas with runoff coefficient less than 0 5 peng and you 2006 in different study areas with same rainfall depth the amount of runoff produced was substantially different in the same study area the same amount of rainfall at different times or seasons also had a large difference in runoff generation these two phenomena indicated that influencing factors of the cn value are complex interactions in external natural geographical conditions will cause the difference in regional runoff generation ability while the internal seasonal variation and rainfall duration will also cause the difference in the runoff relationships between cn values and runoff depth are shown in fig 3 under different rainfall depths according to the scs cn method larger cn values may generate greater runoff under the same rainfall event however small rainfall events can still generate runoff by proper amount of initial abstraction and the soil infiltration ability it indicates the research area has a strong ability to produce runoff therefore the corresponding cn value could be large 3 2 comparison of calculated and table cn entries cn values cn values of the 55 study sites were calculated from the measured data of rainfall and runoff events and the average cn value of different events in the same study area represents the cn parameters of this site the calculated cn values have showed clear differences compared to the cn values obtained from the table cn entries usda 1954 for the study area fig 4 supplementary materials table s1 results revealed that the calculated cn value ranges 12 80 97 45 while the looked up table indicates as 36 91 the difference between calculated and looked up values ranges between 40 41 34 08 comparisons of average value and error at each point indicated that the cn value acquired by table cn entries have reduced its variation it could be substantially different by regions which largely ignores the study area characteristics moreover the cn table cn entries provided by usda scs were summarized from a limited set of watershed observations bartlett et al 2016 ogden et al 2017 thus these differences have supported our doubts on the applicability of the existing table cn entries in china and for the areas with different characteristics in different regions the existing looked up table for cn is not suitable for runoff estimation the blue line represents the calculated value of the monitoring point cn and the orange line represents the cn value obtained by the existing look up the table fig 4 it can be found that cn value based on the measured data has a large variation range differences between the monitoring points can be clearly found while the orange line has a small fluctuation range floating between 50 80 in literature it is nearly impossible to see that the cn value is less than 30 under actual environmental conditions and the range of variation is between 30 100 here some study sites with cn values more than 80 and some are less than 30 after repeated inspections of the data the occurrence of extreme cn values is because of the different forest type and local characters 3 3 model performance the purpose of validation conducted in the study was to ensure the driven results are reasonable in scientific measures one should keep in mind that the derived results could be biased by changing validation standard yen et al 2016 in this study 0 6 is the value of nse set to be the statistical guideline of satisfactory to figure out the reliability of cn method the simulated runoff was compared with observed runoff depths for this purpose four sites with large set of rainfall runoff data were selected to validate the performance of this model the freedom of rainfall runoff events to validate the accuracy of cn parameters of these four sites is 7 14 8 and 14 respectively the nse results are 0 98 0 76 0 86 and 0 84 respectively far more than 0 6 which indicates that the cn method is accurate enough to simulate runoff depth fig 5 4 discussions 4 1 differences of cn values between the united states and china studies have shown that soil moisture contents hydrological processes infiltration and other losses through rainfall have significant spatial and temporal variability ponce and hawkins 1996 tramblay et al 2010 wang 2018 zeng et al 2017 it indicated that the forestland has lowest runoff production capacity and the paddy field has highest choi et al 2019 other researchers also found that the land use types with high cn values are mainly urban area farmland and water bodies and the low cn values are in forests orchards shrubs and grasslands choi et al 2019 egodawatta et al 2007 li et al 2018 soulis et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 this might be associated with less vegetation cover in urban area farmland and water bodies compared to forests although cn method may introduce large uncertainty in runoff estimation of paddy field many scholars still treat paddy filed as one kind of land use type with low infiltration capacity in order to estimate runoff depth easily the main character of curve number method is its base on accumulated experience in use mainly in the u s there are many weaknesses and limitations when the original cn values were applied in china boughton 1989 furthermore some watersheds performed quite differently from the basic cn runoff response patterns leading to great differences between model and the actual processes the major weakness and utmost potential source of error is the sensitivity of estimated runoff in the selection of the curve number 4 2 impact factors of the revised cn failure to evaluate the size of regional scale might affect the corresponding error between actual runoff and cn parameters simulated runoff by summarizing the previous studies it was found that this model is suitable for the study of small and medium scale watersheds with an area of about 0 25 1000 km2 even the cn method was appropriate still the dominant behavior of cn value s response to rainfall depth is important to calculate the runoff depth muche et al 2019 soulis et al 2009 results indicated a decrease in cn value with increase in rainfall but stable at high rainfall intensity fig 6 it indicates that the rainfall depth is the primary factor to determine the cn value and the asymptotic constant value is the best way to identify cn parameters for a watershed and other studies have showed that cn values calculated from measured rainfall runoff data vary systematically with the rainfall depth the determination of a single asymptotic cn value observed for very high rainfall depths to characterize the watershed s runoff response soulis and valiantzas 2012 standard behavior of cn response for the rainfall runoff relationship found in our study with a distinct bias for high cn at lower rainfall depths indicates that rainfall is another key factor in determining cn rainfall duration could be an important phenomenon to increase soil water content which will be at maximum after certain rainfall period thorndahl and willems 2008 after attaining maximum soil water contents cn values will be increased nearly up to 100 indicating runoff generation capacity is also increased as the previous soil moisture condition amc has a great influence on the results lal et al 2019 the study sites with detailed monitoring data can be more reliable for same test sites runoff coefficient is different under different rain intensity therefore cn value as the parameter of regional runoff needs to be able to represent the runoff property of the region which needs to be calculated long term monitoring of rainfall in different seasons and intensity can reflect the overall situation of the area yeh et al 2018 curve number varies spatially with the change in land use type soil type and soil humidity in the early stage ross et al 2018 urban land and water bodies have higher cn value compared to forests mountains and hills yang and toor 2017 the effect of soil properties on cn is divided into four categories according to the permeability of soil american soil experts initially based on more than 14 000 soil data classified soils with similar runoff generation capacity called the hydrological soil group hsg ross et al 2018 stewart et al 2012 the runoff generation capacities from low to high are divided into four categories a b c and d detailed classification criteria showed in the us national engineering handbook 1972 usda 1972 4 3 shortcomings and future perspectives the main limitation of our study is the ignorance of antecedent moisture condition amc because the rainfall runoff event data we used did not have the rainfall data of the days before the event occurred it was impossible to know the soil moisture conditions in the early stage of the event another limitation is the number of rainfall runoff events is still not large enough to reflect the more detailed hydrological conditions for some study sites in this study we have tried our best to collect more data in order to cover more regions of china and collect more rainfall runoff events to calculate accurate results the runoff calculated by the scs cn method is known to be sensitive to cn values which is the largest potential source of error low frequency and poor resolution of monitoring data will result in poor estimation of runoff even with years of data available for calibration of the curve numbers substantial errors may still occur boughton 1989 obviously we are getting more and more accurate and high resolution rainfall data through advanced observation devices thus a strong runoff estimation method is urgently needed while it is very difficult to establish the mechanism equation of rainfall and runoff because infiltration capacity is affected by many factors such as soil properties vegetation coverage land use type climate etc fortunately we have such a simple empirical method to estimate runoff and meet the needs of massive simulations there are several studies mapping the global cn values based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis harmonized world soil database hwsd and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data sets lin et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 those methods are efficient to produce high resolution cn values while the huge error will be introduced by the original cn lookup table which may not suitable for other countries our work is going to be very useful to resolve this issue with relatively minor effort and future research should focus on the establishment of a dynamic runoff estimation model the input data of the model should include meteorological topographical soil type land use and vegetation cover data sets for ungauged watersheds cn parameters are usually estimated by well known handbook tables usda 1972 according to the hydrologic soil group hsg land use surface condition and antecedent moisture condition amc in the presence of variable conditions soil type land cover and land use within the basin an area weighted average cn is often used according to our results it is urgently needed a cn handbook table for different regions which can be established based on local rainfall runoff monitoring network data 5 conclusion the curve number approach is an effective simple and widely used method to estimate surface runoff volume the revised cn values calculated by using monitoring data from 55 sites in china are considerably different from the cn values acquired from us based cn value lookup table it has been shown that the monitoring data can provide valuable information to calculate the cn value in this study the modified cn values cn china derived from the actual rainfall runoff data play an important role and a very useful reference in future runoff estimation the results of this study provide new insight into the establishment of the cn table that is more suitable for china and possibly many other countries around the world one can take advantage of the given work to incorporate more details of the curve number approach to further improve the corresponding accuracy and applicability declaration of

17946,the pharmaceutical torasemide is an important loop diuretic and was 2017 one of the ten most prescribed drugs in germany despite its detection in different compartments of the urban water cycle including drinking water no studies were so far performed to elucidate its fate in the environment and the occurrence of transformation products tps therefore we investigated the phototransformation microbial degradation transformation with human liver microsomes and anodic oxidation of torasemide to obtain good coverage of environmentally relevant degradation products overall sixteen products were identified covering the following reaction mechanisms aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation including further oxidation to carboxylic acids and quinone imines amide cleavage n dealkylation n dearylation and sulfonamide hydrolysis to sulfonic acids especially the formation of quinone imines could be of concern as they are highly reactive electrophiles torasemide itself was observed in all investigated wastewater treatment plant wwtp samples and wastewater impacted surface waters the maximum detected concentration was about 350 ng l 1 only three of the sixteen transformation products were generally observed in at least one of the samples and the most frequently detected tps were the human metabolites hydroxytorasemide tp 364a and carboxytorasemide tp 378a the complete removal of tp 364a during wastewater treatment was in agreement with the results of microbial degradation experiments tp 364a was most likely transformed into tp 378a which was microbially less degraded in lab experiments based on estimated concentrations tp 378a could reach about 1 μg l 1 in the investigated wastewater matrices graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging pollutants electrochemical degradation photodegradation microbial degradation transformation products high resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction pharmaceuticals are generally considered an important group of anthropogenic micropollutants in aquatic environments as they are designed to cause effects and often exhibit a rather high stability after excretion from the human body or due to improper disposal pharmaceuticals typically end up in sewer systems however many micropollutants are only insufficiently removed from sewage in wastewater treatment plants wwtps margot et al 2015 and therefore introduced by these point sources into the environment selected pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine were already frequently detected in european surface waters loos et al 2009 and low concentrations of human drugs could be sporadically observed in ground water loos et al 2010 or even tap water jones et al 2005 torasemide or torsemide is an important loop diuretic for the treatment of hypertension and edema the compounds prescriptions increased continuously over the last decade in germany from almost 546 million defined daily doses ddds in 2008 schwabe and paffrath 2009 to 876 million ddds in 2017 schwabe et al 2018 in 2017 torasemide was also one of the ten most prescribed drugs in germany schwabe et al 2018 with a prescribed amount of about 13 tons4 4 the amount of torasemide was estimated based on the prescribed ddds in 2017 and the information from the who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology that one ddd is equivalent to 15 mg who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology december 13th 2018 for that year generally the compounds gain in popularity can be linked to studies suggesting improved pharmacokinetics and further potential benefits of torasemide compared to other loop diuretics like furosemide herchuelz et al 1988 buggey et al 2015 several studies have already shown the presence of torasemide in the urban water cycle even if is subjected to an extensive human phase i metabolism and only 20 of the drug are excreted unchanged via urine by healthy patients knauf and mutschler 1998 measured concentrations varied from about 10 to 195 ng l 1 for samples taken from wwtps or surface waters receiving treated wastewater gros et al 2012 gurke et al 2015 singer et al 2016 ternes et al 2019 torasemide was already included in a special monitoring programme of the icpr and showed high loads in river rhine international commission for the protection of the rhine icpr 2019 in addition the presence of this drug was proven in groundwater from a former wastewater infiltration site wode et al 2015 and trace amounts i e 1 ng l 1 were even detected in drinking water gros et al 2012 the most important human transformation products are formed by aliphatic hydroxylation tp 364a tp structures in the results section and subsequent oxidation of the intermediate tp 364a into a carboxylic acid tp 378a these two metabolites actually account for more than 50 of an administered torasemide dose that can be recovered in urine patients while less than 2 of torasemide are excreted via urine as the aromatic hydroxylation product tp 364b knauf and mutschler 1998 a recent study putatively identified carboxy torasemide in environmental samples by suspect screening ternes et al 2019 the authors reported that higher signal intensities were observed for carboxytorasemide compared to torasemide itself which is in agreement with the excreted amounts of torasemide and its metabolites in contrast hydroxytorasemide tp 364a another abundant metabolite could not be detected above the limit of quantification even in samples from a wwtp with the highest torasemide concentrations measured ternes et al 2019 currently there is no information available about the fate of torasemide once released into wastewater and ultimately into the environment therefore the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview on the possible formation of biotic and abiotic transformation products and their occurrence in wwtps and surface waters 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals optima lc ms grade acetic acid hac acetonitrile acn ammonium acetate

taken from the effluents of 22 different wastewater treatment plants e1 e22 and six surface waters in the federal state of baden württemberg germany three of the samples were taken from rivers impacted with treated wastewater r1 r2 and r7 and three additional samples were taken from rivers not influenced by wwtp effluents r3 r5 and r6 details about the sampling locations are provided in the supporting information of lege et al 2017 lc esi qqq mass spectrometry was applied for the quantification of torasemide in these samples method details are summarized in section 2 7 of this publication retrospective analysis of high resolution mass spectrometric hrms data of samples taken from wwtps and wastewater impacted rivers was performed additionally to evaluate the occurrence of here identified transformation products of torasemide in the environment the grab samples taken from effluents of the wwtps e1 e22 in 2015 were investigated for this purpose as well as additional samples that were taken from the plant e21 in april 2016 at wwtp e21 24 h flow proportional composite samples were taken from the influent and effluent over the duration of five days the river ammer

degradation of torasemide was performed in a 12 ml peek cell using a boron doped diamond electrode bdd diachem with a 10 μm diamond layer on niobium substrate from condias germany as working electrode the experiment was performed at about 22 c and an active electrode area of about 3 2 cm2 the counter electrode was an 8 mm 4 mm platinum mesh sigma aldrich usa a ag agcl electrode 3m basi usa served as reference degradation experiments were performed with 20 mm nh4fa solutions containing 10 mg l 1 torasemide adjusted either to ph 3 or ph 7 with formic acid and ammonium hydroxide the working electrode and the counter electrode were immersed in two different compartments of the peek cell which were separated by a vycor porous glass frit adequate mixing of the solution in the oxidizing compartment i e with the working electrode was achieved by gentle magnetic stirring 300 rpm experiments were performed in triplicates at different ph values control samples were taken from the oxidizing compartment of the cell before and treated samples after the application of 1 5 v vs ag agcl with an autolab pgstat101 potentiostat metrohm germany for 10 min the samples were directly transferred to hplc brown glass vials and either kept unmodified diluted with tap water as control for the addition of reduced glutathione gsh or spiked with a freshly prepared aqueous solution of gsh at a final concentration of 10 mg l 1 the vials were sealed with teflon lined caps and stored at 8 c analysis was performed with lc hrms within 48 h after the electrochemical degradation the bdd electrode was cleaned electrochemically in ph adjusted ammonium formate buffer without torasemide for this cleaning 150 square wave pulses between 2 v and 2 v vs ag agcl were alternately applied for 1

liver microsomal incubations a mixture of microsomal protein and torasemide dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer prepared from kh2po4 and k2hpo4 and adjusted to ph 7 4 with 1 m phosphoric acid was pre incubated for 2 min at 37 c after the addition of nadph the mixture was further incubated for 60 min at 37 c every 10 min tubes were taken briefly out of the water bath and shaken manually the total

which was air conditioned to 22 c the reactors were continuously stirred with magnetic stirrers and aerated with aquarium pumps to guarantee aerobic conditions evaporative water loss was balanced by refilling the flasks to their initial weight minus the previously taken sample volume this was always performed before new 2 ml samples were withdrawn sampling started 10 min after the addition of torasemide and was performed subsequently on a daily basis the samples were filtered through cellulose acetate syringe filters 0 45 μm pore size agilent technologies and stored frozen at 20 c samples

products were extracted from the feature list based on the chemometric software package mass profiler professional mpp version 14 9 1 agilent technologies usa only compounds with a coefficient of variation 25 for their intensities over all replicates were considered for subsequent filtration based on a volcano plot here a moderated t test including the benjamini hochberg procedure to decrease the false positive rate for multiple testing and a fold change fc analysis are combined comparing experimental samples with their respective blanks the p value cut off p 0 02 was chosen so that the number of features expected by chance a value calculated by mpp is close to zero peaks were only considered as putative transformation products if signal intensities were at least two times higher than in the control samples the features left after filtration with the mpp software were imported into the masshunter qualitative analysis software version b 07 00 agilent technologies usa where molecular formulas were assigned to them based on accurate masses and the observed isotope pattern shifts in the elemental composition between a putative transformation product and torasemide itself were compared to those listed for typical phase i reactions holcapek et al 2008 additionally literature was reviewed for transformation process already reported for other drugs e g for anodic oxidation and in silico prediction of putative microbial degradation products of torasemide was performed with the eawag pathway prediction system eawag pps http eawag bbd ethz ch predict accessed on november 24th 2019 product ion spectra from collision induced dissociation were comprehensively interpreted when available to support or reject the proposed analyte structure especially in comparison to the fragmentation pathway of the parent compound torasemide and its forced degradation products kurmi et al 2017 the level of confidence for the compound identification was generally expressed in levels 1 to 5 according to schymanski et al 2014 where level 1 corresponds to structures confirmed with reference standards and level 2 to probable structures with a library match or additional diagnostic evidence tentative candidates are communicated as level 3 and the lowest confidence is assigned to unequivocal molecular formulas level 4 or accurate mass detected level 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic and biotic degradation of torasemide different degradation experiments were performed to obtain the best coverage of potential environmentally relevant transformation products tps of torasemide incubations with liver microsomes should mimic the human phase i metabolism while photolysis and microbial degradation experiments were performed to investigate the fate of this compound once released to wastewater and surface waters putative enzymatic reactions were additionally simulated by anodic oxidation johansson et al 2007 trapping experiments with reduced glutathione were performed to reveal reactive tps the identification process of the products as well as a discussion of their formation and potential toxicity in the context of available literature is summarized in the following subchapters 3 1 1 identification of transformation products post acquisition data evaluation using suspect and non target screening approaches revealed the formation of overall sixteen different transformation products by the investigated degradation processes torasemide and most tps can be generally detected in the positive and negative ionization mode and ms ms spectra were usually recorded for both esi modes to facilitate the structure elucidation analyte identification was based on the initial assignment of the most plausible structures to unequivocal molecular formulas applying biotransformation rules from in silico tools or transformation mechanisms previously reported in literature furthermore product ion spectra from collision induced dissociation were comprehensively interpreted especially in comparison to the fragmentation pathway of the parent compound torasemide kurmi et al 2017 the complete identification procedure is exemplarily demonstrated below for the product tp 378a the unequivocal molecular formula of c16h18n4o5s was assigned with a mass error of about 0 2 ppm to the transformation product tp 378a which was only observed during biodegradation with activated sludge in silico prediction of microbial transformation with the eawag pps suggested 13 putative structures which would explain the formal loss of two hydrogen atoms and the addition of two oxygen atoms compared to the parent compound however transformation processes modifying the isopropyl group 8 out of 13 products could be rejected based on ms ms information fig 1 a as the two dominant product ions m z 294 and m z 320 were generated through the loss of the unmodified n isopropylformamide and isopropylamine moieties respectively fig 1b the remaining in silico products were all formed via oxidation of the methyl moiety of the tolyl group to an aldehyde but involved either an additional aromatic hydroxylation or the subsequent oxidation of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid the latter species was already reported as the major human metabolite knauf and mutschler 1998 and was here the only structure where the most abundant product ions agreed with the previously reported dissociation pathway of torasemide fig 1b similar to the positive ionization mode the loss of n isopropylformamide from the parent ion was also observed as a dominant fragmentation process in the esi mode fig s 16b in the supporting information the resulting product ion with m z 292 c12h10n3o4s fragmented further into m z 248 c11h10n3o4s via the neutral loss of co2 a characteristic process for carboxylic acids holcapek et al 2010 simple retention time models based on predicted logd values were already applied in the context of compound identification stanstrup et al 2013 and this relationship was also qualitatively assessed here the retention times and calculated logd values of tp 378a torasemide and hydroxytorasemide correlated well calculated for ph 4 with the partitioning plugin in marvinsketch from chemaxon version 6 3 1 hydroxytorasemide tp 364a rt 5 98 min logd 0 33 tp 378a rt 6 22 min logd 0 69 torasemide rt 7 99 min logd 1 61 sufficient diagnostic evidence based on ms ms information and the elution behavior was therefore collected to support the identification of tp 378a as the previously reported human metabolite with confidence level 2 available ms ms spectra of additional products are documented in chapter s1 of the supporting information table 1 summarizes all products along with their retention times monoisotopic mass of the protonated species the observed mass error and the chemical formulae furthermore the confidence level according to schymanski et al 2014 as well as the degradation experiments for which the respective tps were observed are shown here proposed analyte structures for tps with a confidence level of 1 and 2 are shown in fig 2 reference standards were not available for the quantification of most tps and it was therefore not possible to obtain complete mass balances for the degradation experiments although the investigation of multiple degradation processes suggests generally a good coverage of the most important transformation products neither the formation of additional minor tps nor a mineralization can be completely ruled out 3 1 2 incubation with hlms when incubated with hlms for 60 min in the presence of nadph torasemide concentrations decreased by 23 and 33 for initial drug concentrations of 10 μm and 1 μm respectively fig 3 concentration changes were generally not observed in control samples without the cofactor the degradation of torasemide was accompanied with the formation of tp 364a tp 364b and tp 306 the highest relative tp abundance was observed for the lowest dose of 1 μm torasemide a concentration depended inhibition of the enzymatic process by the substrate was therefore assumed tp 364a was by far the most abundant tp and appeared at a relative peak area of up to 11 of torasemide fig 3 tp 364b and tp 306 were with 6 and 3 of tp 364a much less abundant these findings agreed only partially with the reported product spectrum for human metabolism barroso et al 2001 with torasemide carboxylic acid tp 378a as the main metabolite the hydroxylated tolyl species tp 364a found in the hlm experiments can be considered as a precursor of the human metabolite the tps 306 and 364b formed by n dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation respectively play only a negligible role in the excretion of torasemide reasons for incomplete oxidation by hlm could be a limitation of the cofactor nadph and a different function of cytochrome p450 isoforms in the hlms for example it is known that the formation of tp 364a is catalyzed predominantly by cyp2c9 miners et al 1995 3 1 3 anodic oxidation and identification of reactive metabolites the successful mimicry of phase i metabolism by electrochemical techniques was already demonstrated before johansson et al 2007 and investigated here as well for the simulation of putative enzymatic transformation processes independent of the ph about 10 of the initial torasemide concentration was degraded applying a potential of 1 5 v vs ag agcl for 10 min data not shown ec treatment of torasemide produced 12 tps the most abundant tps are the aromatic hydroxylation product tp 364b and its oxidation product tp 362 quinone imine and the n dearylation product tp 258 loss of the tolyl moiety electrochemical formation of transformation products was generally favored at a neutral ph except for tp 258 in which case the product yield was increased almost 40 fold under acidic conditions data not shown the minor human metabolite 4 hydroxytorasemide tp 364b was the third most abundant degradation product after anodic oxidation of torasemide and accumulated to a relative amount of 68 aromatic hydroxylation via electrochemical degradation was already reported for other molecules before johansson et al 2007 and the presence of electron donating substituents here the methyl group of the tolyl moiety is generally considered beneficial for this process in addition to tp 364b another isobaric species tp 364c of significantly lower abundance 6 was detected after electrochemical degradation of torasemide eluting at a retention time of about 7 5 min n oxide formation was already demonstrated for torasemide in the presence of hydrogen peroxide kurmi et al 2017 however n oxides elute typically later than their respective parent compound merel et al 2017 a principle which held true also for torasemide on a reversed phase column kurmi et al 2017 due to an earlier elution of tp 364c compared to its parent molecule the putative identification of this analyte as n oxide was rejected aromatic hydroxylation was therefore left here as well as the most plausible mechanism of formation for this product in contrast to incubations with liver microsomes the hydroxylation of the methyl group generating tp 364a was not observed during anodic oxidation this is generally owed to the high oxidation potential of hydrocarbons preventing a direct electrochemical oxidation of aliphatic carbons jurva et al 2003 this mechanism could however be simulated in principle by ec fenton systems involving reactive hydroxyl radicals johansson et al 2007 but a similar setup was not evaluated here the quinone imine tp 362 a dehydrogenation product of tp 364b was the most abundant transformation product observed after electrochemical degradation of torasemide this product is of specific importance since the electrophilic compound is highly reactive and can directly react with a wide range of cell nucleophiles e g dna or proteins or can generate reactive oxygen species through redox cycling klopčič and dolenc 2019 deleterious effects like hepatotoxicity were associated with the formation of these reactive metabolites and were responsible for example for the market withdrawal of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine naisbitt et al 1998 also the anodic oxidation of paracetamol led to the formation of n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi nematollahi et al 2009 the identification of reactive tps is often performed by trapping with nucleophiles and especially the reaction with reduced glutathione gsh has been applied in the context of an electrochemical simulation of phase i metabolism madsen et al 2007 when gsh was added to the torasemide solution after anodic oxidation at ph 7 the concentration of the tp 362 decreased by more than 99 and three isobaric gsh conjugates with an elemental composition of c26h35n7o10s2 tp 363 c16h18n4o4s plus one gsh c10h17n3o6s could be observed fig 4 the gsh conjugates of tp 362 eluted between 5 6 min and 5 9 min and the maximum observed mass error for the most abundant ionic species m 2h 2 m z 335 6016 was 1 2 ppm the results strongly support the proposed structure of tp 362 as quinone imine and its reactive nature after ec degradation of torasemide also tp 278 tp 320 and tp 378b were revealed as reactive metabolites based on their reaction with glutathione s1 of the supporting information while tp 378b is potentially a hydroxylated species of tp 362 the products tp 320 and tp 278 could be formed from tp 362 via n dealkylation loss of the isopropyl group and sulfonamide hydrolysis to a sulfonic acid respectively in general n dealkylation was reported for the electrochemical transformation of other molecules before johansson et al 2007 while the formation of sulfonic acids from sulfonamides was specifically demonstrated for bdd electrodes fabiańska et al 2014 the hydrogenated species of both tps i e tp 280 and tp 322 were also detected after anodic oxidation but with relative abundances about half of their quinone imine precursors generally activation by hydroxylation and further dehydrogenation seemed to be required before dealkylation could take place as this degradation mechanism was only observed for tp 364b leading to tp 322 and tp 362 leading to tp 320 the direct n dealkylation of torasemide itself leading towards tp 306 could not be mimicked electrochemically in contrast sulfonamide hydrolysis to a sulfonic acid took place for torasemide itself leading towards the formation of tp 264 the additional cleavage product for all sulfonamide hydrolysis reactions which is here isopropylurea tp 102 was observed after anodic oxidation as well and this compound accumulated to a relative abundance of 17 the second most abundant product tp 258 was formed via n dearylation cleaving of the tolyl group due to the loss of this moiety it was however not possible to elucidate if an activation similar to the hydroxylation in case of n dealkylation was required prior to the n dearylation taking place subsequent degradation of tp 258 via amide cleavage at the urea moiety led to the formation of the primary sulfonamide tp 173 which was detected with a relative abundance of 5 3 1 4 microbial degradation with activated sludge an improved understanding of torasemide tps formed during conventional wastewater treatment was expected from aerobic biodegradation experiments the time courses of relative concentrations for the parent compound and putative tp s are shown in fig 5 the spiked torasemide concentration remained constant over the first three days fig 5a indicating that sorption onto sludge and abiotic hydrolysis can be ruled out under the given experimental conditions this hypothesis was also supported by control samples with torasemide spiked to water as the initial and final torasemide concentrations did not differ here fig 5a an initial lag phase was observed prior to the initiation of torasemide degradation which occurred three to seven days into the experiment an acclimation of the microbial community or a suppressed degradation of torasemide due to competition with more readily degradable nutrients are potential explanations for the observed lag phase once biodegradation began the torasemide concentration dropped on average to 88 of the initially spiked amount after one week and decreased continuously to 59 within two additional weeks fig 5a the decrease in the torasemide concentration was generally related to the formation of six metabolites most tps were detected after the initial lag phase and in case of the carboxylic acid tp 378a the concentration increased steadily over the complete experimental duration assuming comparable ionization efficiencies this product was the most abundant tp exceeding the other metabolites more than 5 fold and about 5 of the initially spiked torasemide was finally recovered as tp 378a fig 5b tp 378a is already known as the main human metabolite torasemide carboxylic acid knauf and mutschler 1998 it is noteworthy that tp 364a the main degradation product with hlms section 3 1 2 and the reported intermediate of tp 378a was not detected during the microbial degradation study it was therefore assumed that microorganisms oxidizing torasemide to tp 378a either do not release the intermediate tp 364a or that the transformation of tp 364a occurs so fast that it does not accumulate to significant amounts in the medium similar to tp 378a the concentrations of tp 173 and tp 258 were also steadily increasing until the end of the experiment but in contrast to all other products they were only detected in samples taken after 14 days the reactions leading to their formation e g a n dearylation in case of tp 258 might require a previous activation of torasemide and it is very likely that these compounds are secondary metabolites the stagnant tp 306 or decreasing tp 362 and tp 364b concentrations of some metabolites towards the end of the experiment could generally support this hypothesis fig 5c except for tp 306 and tp 378a all additional metabolites were also generated by anodic oxidation of torasemide 3 1 5 direct and indirect photodegradation photodegradation of torasemide by natural sunlight was studied in deionized water direct photolysis and in surface water indirect photodegradation over seven days generally there was no direct photodegradation observed for torasemide within this time frame fig 6 a although this compound shows a uv vis absorption spectrum similar to diclofenac fig s 18 in supporting information diclofenac is known for its rapid and direct degradation salgado et al 2013 and was almost completely removed within one day under the same conditions fig 6b compared to torasemide diclofenac contains however two photolabile c cl bonds where direct photolysis is suggested to start poiger et al 2001 as torasemide does not undergo direct photolysis this process is not influencing the fate of this compound in the environment and does not lead to a formation of degradation products in contrast indirect photodegradation in surface water removed torasemide by 77 within one week while no degradation was observed in dark controls fig 7 a it produced four tps mainly the aromatic hydroxylation tp 364b and its oxidation product tp 362 quinone imine tp 393 nitro toresamide and tp 258 tp 364b and tp 362 were already detected in samples taken after 24 h and their concentrations increased steadily until the third or fourth day respectively fig 7b towards the end of the experiment the concentrations decreased slightly suggesting subsequent transformation the tp 258 which was putatively formed by n dearylation of torasemide was detected the first time after about two days and its concentration increased until the end of the field study assuming similar ionization efficiencies tp 258 was the least abundant phototransformation product of torasemide in contrast to these three products which were already observed after anodic oxidation or during microbial degradation tp 393 was solely observed for indirect photodegradation the elemental composition of this analyte points towards a nitration of torasemide a phototransformation process already reported for the herbicide monuron nélieu et al 2008 generally the mechanism could be induced by nitrite or nitrate in the presence of oxygen but the water analysis supports the route via nitrate while about 30 mg l 1 of nitrate were detected in the surface water utilized for the field study nitrite was not detected detailed analysis results in the supporting information of lege et al 2019 the general importance of nitrate for the indirect photodegradation under these conditions was also highlighted in the context of denatonium lege et al 2019 nitrate is known as a photosensitizing species that influences the formation of reactive oxygen species in aquatic environments gligorovski et al 2015 and can therefore ultimately impact the fate of organic micropollutants in the environment wang et al 2017 3 2 occurrence of torasemide and its tps in aqueous samples in 2015 grab samples were taken from 22 effluents of wwtps and three rivers in baden württemberg germany and torasemide concentrations were determined by target analysis with lc esi qqq mass spectrometry torasemide was detected in rivers downstream of wwtps in the range from 34 ng l 1 to 67 ng l 1 fig 8 concentrations in the wwtp effluents were between 31 ng l 1 and 348 ng l 1 with a median concentration of 181 ng l 1 and hence in the same range as previously reported gros et al 2012 gurke et al 2015 singer et al 2016 ternes et al 2019 high concentration variability between different wwtp effluents was also observed before and the authors of previous studies generally suggested differences in micropollutant removal efficiency or differences in the wastewater composition e g by dilution with industrial wastewater as potential reasons singer et al 2016 in addition to the quantification of the parent compound torasemide itself retrospective suspect screening was also performed for samples analyzed with high resolution mass spectrometry lc esi qtof ms to shed light on the occurrence of its transformation products signal intensities of torasemide in influent and effluent samples of plant e21 did not reveal a considerable removal of torasemide during wastewater treatment fig s19 in supporting information heavy rainfall during the sampling campaign was causing highly variable flow conditions which are known as important source of errors and inconsistencies in estimated removal rates in wwtps majewsky et al 2011 signal intensities were also not corrected for matrix effects on quantification overall only three of the sixteen putatively identified tps were detected in at least one of the wwtp or surface water samples table 2 the tp 258 the product generated by n dearylation was generally the least frequently detected torasemide product and it was present only in a single wwtp effluent sample the human metabolite hydroxytorasemide tp 364a seemed to be of similar low environmental relevance although it was detected in all influent samples of the treatment plant e21 this metabolite was completely removed during wastewater treatment in this plant this observation was in agreement with the microbial degradation experiments performed for torasemide using activated sludge while the final product carboxytorasemide tp 378a accumulated over time the precursor tp 364a was never detected in these experiments which suggests a high biodegradability chapter 3 1 4 the fact that this compound was observed in one of the additional 22 analyzed effluent samples might be related to differences in the microbial community or the present nutrient conditions the here suggested low persistence of the human metabolite tp 364a generally agrees with previous findings by ternes et al who did not detect this analyte in any of their investigated surface water or wwtp effluent samples ternes et al 2019 these authors already identified carboxytorasemide tp 378a putatively in their samples and reported higher peak areas for this metabolite compared to torasemide itself the same trend was also observed in our data and the average ratio of the signal intensities for tp 378a compared to torasemide were about 3 4 2 5 and 1 9 for the five wwtp influent samples all 27 wwtp effluent samples combined and the seven surface water samples respectively table 2 the increase in the signal ratios for the metabolite compared to the parent compound during wastewater treatment in the plant e21 support the biodegradation of tp 364a and potentially torasemide itself leading towards the generation of carboxytorasemide as already suggested by the microbial degradation experiments tp 378a seemed to be more persistent and it is therefore not surprising that it was detected in all samples taken from wwtps and wastewater impacted surface waters assuming similar ionization efficiencies for tp 378a and torasemide an estimated concentration level at about 1 μg l 1 of carboxytorasemide could be postulated in wwtp effluents 4 conclusions overall sixteen biotic and abiotic degradation products of the loop diuretic torasemide were identified in this study the presence of these tps and their parent compound was investigated in wastewater treatment plants and receiving surface waters to shed more light on the occurrence and the potential fate of these analytes in the environment generally the following conclusions were drawn by us torasemide is susceptible to microbial degradation and indirect photodegradation biotransformation and indirect photodegradation produced the quinone imine tp 362 a reactive intermediate which can directly react with a wide range of cell nucleophiles e g dna or proteins and is therefore of toxicological relevance the human metabolite tp 364a is not environmentally relevant as it is usually removed by microbial degradation during wastewater treatment the metabolite carboxytorasemide tp 378a in contrast exhibits an increased persistence and is frequently detected in treated wastewater and surface waters rough concentration estimates for tp 378a suggest amounts up to 1 μg l 1 in treated wastewater additional measurements are however required using reference standards for accurate quantification declaration of competing interest the

17946,the pharmaceutical torasemide is an important loop diuretic and was 2017 one of the ten most prescribed drugs in germany despite its detection in different compartments of the urban water cycle including drinking water no studies were so far performed to elucidate its fate in the environment and the occurrence of transformation products tps therefore we investigated the phototransformation microbial degradation transformation with human liver microsomes and anodic oxidation of torasemide to obtain good coverage of environmentally relevant degradation products overall sixteen products were identified covering the following reaction mechanisms aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation including further oxidation to carboxylic acids and quinone imines amide cleavage n dealkylation n dearylation and sulfonamide hydrolysis to sulfonic acids especially the formation of quinone imines could be of concern as they are highly reactive electrophiles torasemide itself was observed in all investigated wastewater treatment plant wwtp samples and wastewater impacted surface waters the maximum detected concentration was about 350 ng l 1 only three of the sixteen transformation products were generally observed in at least one of the samples and the most frequently detected tps were the human metabolites hydroxytorasemide tp 364a and carboxytorasemide tp 378a the complete removal of tp 364a during wastewater treatment was in agreement with the results of microbial degradation experiments tp 364a was most likely transformed into tp 378a which was microbially less degraded in lab experiments based on estimated concentrations tp 378a could reach about 1 μg l 1 in the investigated wastewater matrices graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging pollutants electrochemical degradation photodegradation microbial degradation transformation products high resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction pharmaceuticals are generally considered an important group of anthropogenic micropollutants in aquatic environments as they are designed to cause effects and often exhibit a rather high stability after excretion from the human body or due to improper disposal pharmaceuticals typically end up in sewer systems however many micropollutants are only insufficiently removed from sewage in wastewater treatment plants wwtps margot et al 2015 and therefore introduced by these point sources into the environment selected pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine were already frequently detected in european surface waters loos et al 2009 and low concentrations of human drugs could be sporadically observed in ground water loos et al 2010 or even tap water jones et al 2005 torasemide or torsemide is an important loop diuretic for the treatment of hypertension and edema the compounds prescriptions increased continuously over the last decade in germany from almost 546 million defined daily doses ddds in 2008 schwabe and paffrath 2009 to 876 million ddds in 2017 schwabe et al 2018 in 2017 torasemide was also one of the ten most prescribed drugs in germany schwabe et al 2018 with a prescribed amount of about 13 tons4 4 the amount of torasemide was estimated based on the prescribed ddds in 2017 and the information from the who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology that one ddd is equivalent to 15 mg who collaborating centre for drug statistics methodology december 13th 2018 for that year generally the compounds gain in popularity can be linked to studies suggesting improved pharmacokinetics and further potential benefits of torasemide compared to other loop diuretics like furosemide herchuelz et al 1988 buggey et al 2015 several studies have already shown the presence of torasemide in the urban water cycle even if is subjected to an extensive human phase i metabolism and only 20 of the drug are excreted unchanged via urine by healthy patients knauf and mutschler 1998 measured concentrations varied from about 10 to 195 ng l 1 for samples taken from wwtps or surface waters receiving treated wastewater gros et al 2012 gurke et al 2015 singer et al 2016 ternes et al 2019 torasemide was already included in a special monitoring programme of the icpr and showed high loads in river rhine international commission for the protection of the rhine icpr 2019 in addition the presence of this drug was proven in groundwater from a former wastewater infiltration site wode et al 2015 and trace amounts i e 1 ng l 1 were even detected in drinking water gros et al 2012 the most important human transformation products are formed by aliphatic hydroxylation tp 364a tp structures in the results section and subsequent oxidation of the intermediate tp 364a into a carboxylic acid tp 378a these two metabolites actually account for more than 50 of an administered torasemide dose that can be recovered in urine patients while less than 2 of torasemide are excreted via urine as the aromatic hydroxylation product tp 364b knauf and mutschler 1998 a recent study putatively identified carboxy torasemide in environmental samples by suspect screening ternes et al 2019 the authors reported that higher signal intensities were observed for carboxytorasemide compared to torasemide itself which is in agreement with the excreted amounts of torasemide and its metabolites in contrast hydroxytorasemide tp 364a another abundant metabolite could not be detected above the limit of quantification even in samples from a wwtp with the highest torasemide concentrations measured ternes et al 2019 currently there is no information available about the fate of torasemide once released into wastewater and ultimately into the environment therefore the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview on the possible formation of biotic and abiotic transformation products and their occurrence in wwtps and surface waters 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals optima lc ms grade acetic acid hac acetonitrile acn ammonium acetate

taken from the effluents of 22 different wastewater treatment plants e1 e22 and six surface waters in the federal state of baden württemberg germany three of the samples were taken from rivers impacted with treated wastewater r1 r2 and r7 and three additional samples were taken from rivers not influenced by wwtp effluents r3 r5 and r6 details about the sampling locations are provided in the supporting information of lege et al 2017 lc esi qqq mass spectrometry was applied for the quantification of torasemide in these samples method details are summarized in section 2 7 of this publication retrospective analysis of high resolution mass spectrometric hrms data of samples taken from wwtps and wastewater impacted rivers was performed additionally to evaluate the occurrence of here identified transformation products of torasemide in the environment the grab samples taken from effluents of the wwtps e1 e22 in 2015 were investigated for this purpose as well as additional samples that were taken from the plant e21 in april 2016 at wwtp e21 24 h flow proportional composite samples were taken from the influent and effluent over the duration of five days the river ammer

as reference degradation experiments were performed with 20 mm nh4fa solutions containing 10 mg l 1 torasemide adjusted either to ph 3 or ph 7 with formic acid and ammonium hydroxide the working electrode and the counter electrode were immersed in two different compartments of the peek cell which were separated by a vycor porous glass frit adequate mixing of the solution in the oxidizing compartment i e with the working electrode was achieved by gentle magnetic stirring 300 rpm experiments were performed in triplicates at different ph values control samples were taken from the oxidizing compartment of the cell before and treated samples after the application of 1 5 v vs ag agcl with an autolab pgstat101 potentiostat metrohm germany for 10 min the samples were directly transferred to hplc brown glass vials and either kept unmodified diluted with tap water as control for the addition of reduced glutathione gsh or spiked with a freshly prepared aqueous solution of gsh at a final concentration of 10 mg l 1 the vials were sealed with teflon lined caps and stored at 8 c analysis was performed with lc hrms within 48 h after the electrochemical degradation the bdd electrode was cleaned electrochemically in ph adjusted ammonium formate buffer without torasemide for this cleaning 150 square wave pulses between 2 v and 2 v vs ag agcl were alternately applied for 1 s each possible organic deposits on the counter electrode were removed after the last electrochemical experiment of a day by heating up the platinum mesh with a bunsen burner until it is red hot 2 4 photodegradation with natural sunlight solutions for the photodegradation experiment were prepared by adding torasemide to a final concentration of 100 μg l 1 either to lc ms grade water ph 8 4 at 20

concentration of diclofenac was spiked separately to lc ms grade water serving as positive control for direct photodegradation generally 50 ml of the solutions were filled either to 60 ml clear glass vials light exposed samples or to 60 ml amber glass vials wrapped with aluminum foil dark controls all vials were closed with ptfe covered screw caps duplicate samples were generally prepared for each

liver microsomal incubations a mixture of microsomal protein and torasemide dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer prepared from kh2po4 and k2hpo4 and adjusted to ph 7 4 with 1 m phosphoric acid was pre incubated for 2 min at 37 c after the addition of nadph the mixture was further incubated for 60 min at 37 c every 10 min tubes were taken briefly out of the water bath and shaken manually the total

addition of 400 μl ice cold acetonitrile for the precipitation of proteins after centrifugation at 10000 g for 5 min the supernatant was diluted 1 10 v v with tap water and analyzed by lc esi qtof ms all incubations were performed in triplicates and two torasemide concentrations were investigated to identify putative substrate inhibition negative control incubations were carried out without the cofactor nadph and samples for the zero time point were obtained by terminating the reaction immediately after the addition of nadph 2 6 aerobic microbial degradation with sewage sludge the microbial transformation experiment was initiated by adding 544 μg torasemide to 400 g activated sludge in glass flasks giving an initial concentration of about 1 36 μg torasemide per gram aqueous sludge

which was air conditioned to 22 c the reactors were continuously stirred with magnetic stirrers and aerated with aquarium pumps to guarantee aerobic conditions evaporative water loss was balanced by refilling the flasks to their initial weight minus the previously taken sample volume this was always performed before new 2 ml samples were withdrawn sampling started 10 min after the addition of torasemide and was performed subsequently on a daily basis the samples were filtered through cellulose acetate syringe filters 0 45 μm pore size agilent technologies and stored frozen at 20 c samples

to prevent high torasemide concentrations from entering the mass spectrometer the hplc system was connected to a 6550 ifunnel quadrupole time of flight q tof mass spectrometer agilent technologies usa equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source and the dual spray agilent jet stream technology the q tof was operated in the extended dynamic mode 2 ghz for small molecules 1700 m z ms scans

was continuously supplied to the esi source with the second sprayer and used for automatic mass correction the observed mass error was typically 5 ppm and a resolution of 20000 fwhm was achieved for analytes at about m z 1000 nitrogen produced on site with a nitrogen generator from peak scientific germany was used as drying sheath and nebulizing gas while the collision cell was supplied with ultra pure nitrogen 99 999 from westfalen ag germany 2 8 2 data processing and compound identification the initial step of data evaluation was performed with the batch recursive extraction algorithm for small molecules in the masshunter profinder software version b 06 00 agilent technologies usa all information belonging to the same analyte e g ion species and respective isotopologues are gathered over multiple runs and combined in this tool as a single feature generally a retention time window of 0 15 min and a mass window of 10 ppm 2 mda were applied here for feature alignment features that fulfilled abundance height 5000 counts and score target score 80 requirements in all three replicates were finally exported for further statistical analysis putative transformation products were extracted from the feature list based on the chemometric software package mass profiler professional mpp version 14 9 1 agilent technologies usa only compounds with a coefficient of variation 25 for their intensities over all replicates were considered for subsequent filtration based on a volcano plot here a moderated t test including the benjamini hochberg procedure to decrease the false positive rate for multiple testing and a fold change fc analysis are combined comparing experimental samples with their respective blanks the p value cut off p 0 02 was chosen so that the number of features expected by chance a value calculated by mpp is close to zero peaks were only considered as putative transformation products if signal intensities were at least two times higher than in the control samples the features left after filtration with the mpp software were imported into the masshunter qualitative analysis software version b 07 00 agilent technologies usa where molecular formulas were assigned to them based on accurate masses and the observed isotope pattern shifts in the elemental composition between a putative transformation product and torasemide itself were compared to those listed for typical phase i reactions holcapek et al 2008 additionally literature was reviewed for transformation process already reported for other drugs e g for anodic oxidation and in silico prediction of putative microbial degradation products of torasemide was performed with the eawag pathway prediction system eawag pps http eawag bbd ethz ch predict accessed on november 24th 2019 product ion spectra from collision induced dissociation were comprehensively interpreted when available to support or reject the proposed analyte structure especially in comparison to the fragmentation pathway of the parent compound torasemide and its forced degradation products kurmi et al 2017 the level of confidence for the compound identification was generally expressed in levels 1 to 5 according to schymanski et al 2014 where level 1 corresponds to structures confirmed with reference standards and level 2 to probable structures with a library match or additional diagnostic evidence tentative candidates are communicated as level 3 and the lowest confidence is assigned to unequivocal molecular formulas level 4 or accurate mass detected level 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic and biotic degradation of torasemide different degradation experiments were performed to obtain the best coverage of potential environmentally relevant transformation products tps of torasemide incubations with liver microsomes should mimic the human phase i metabolism while photolysis and microbial degradation experiments were performed to investigate the fate of this compound once released to wastewater and surface waters putative enzymatic reactions were additionally simulated by anodic oxidation johansson et al 2007 trapping experiments with reduced glutathione were performed to reveal reactive tps the identification process of the products as well as a discussion of their formation and potential toxicity in the context of available literature is summarized in the following subchapters 3 1 1 identification of transformation products post acquisition data evaluation using suspect and non target screening approaches revealed the formation of overall sixteen different transformation products by the investigated degradation processes torasemide and most tps can be generally detected in the positive and negative ionization mode and ms ms spectra were usually recorded for both esi modes to facilitate the structure elucidation analyte identification was based on the initial assignment of the most plausible structures to unequivocal molecular formulas applying biotransformation rules from in silico tools or transformation mechanisms previously reported in literature furthermore product ion spectra from collision induced dissociation were comprehensively interpreted especially in comparison to the fragmentation pathway of the parent compound torasemide kurmi et al 2017 the complete identification procedure is exemplarily demonstrated below for the product tp 378a the unequivocal molecular formula of c16h18n4o5s was assigned with a mass error of about 0 2 ppm to the transformation product tp 378a which was only observed during biodegradation with activated sludge in silico prediction of microbial transformation with the eawag pps suggested 13 putative structures which would explain the formal loss of two hydrogen atoms and the addition of two oxygen atoms compared to the parent compound however transformation processes modifying the isopropyl group 8 out of 13 products could be rejected based on ms ms information fig 1 a as the two dominant product ions m z 294 and m z 320 were generated through the loss of the unmodified n isopropylformamide and isopropylamine moieties respectively fig 1b the remaining in silico products were all formed via oxidation of the methyl moiety of the tolyl group to an aldehyde but involved either an additional aromatic hydroxylation or the subsequent oxidation of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid the latter species was already reported as the major human metabolite knauf and mutschler 1998 and was here the only structure where the most abundant product ions agreed with the previously reported dissociation pathway of torasemide fig 1b similar to the positive ionization mode the loss of n isopropylformamide from the parent ion was also observed as a dominant fragmentation process in the esi mode fig s 16b in the supporting information the resulting product ion with m z 292 c12h10n3o4s fragmented further into m z 248 c11h10n3o4s via the neutral loss of co2 a characteristic process for carboxylic acids holcapek et al 2010 simple retention time models based on predicted logd values were already applied in the context of compound identification stanstrup et al 2013 and this relationship was also qualitatively assessed here the retention times and calculated logd values of tp 378a torasemide and hydroxytorasemide correlated well calculated for ph 4 with the partitioning plugin in marvinsketch from chemaxon version 6 3 1 hydroxytorasemide tp 364a rt 5 98 min logd 0 33 tp 378a rt 6 22 min logd 0 69 torasemide rt 7 99 min logd 1 61 sufficient diagnostic evidence based on ms ms information and the elution behavior was therefore collected to support the identification of tp 378a as the previously reported human metabolite with confidence level 2 available ms ms spectra of additional products are documented in chapter s1 of the supporting information table 1 summarizes all products along with their retention times monoisotopic mass of the protonated species the observed mass error and the chemical formulae furthermore the confidence level according to schymanski et al 2014 as well as the degradation experiments for which the respective tps were observed are shown here proposed analyte structures for tps with a confidence level of 1 and 2 are shown in fig 2 reference standards were not available for the quantification of most tps and it was therefore not possible to obtain complete mass balances for the degradation experiments although the investigation of multiple degradation processes suggests generally a good coverage of the most important transformation products neither the formation of additional minor tps nor a mineralization can be completely ruled out 3 1 2 incubation with hlms when incubated with hlms for 60 min in the presence of nadph torasemide concentrations decreased by 23 and 33 for initial drug concentrations of 10 μm and 1 μm respectively fig 3 concentration changes were generally not observed in control samples without the cofactor the degradation of torasemide was accompanied with the formation of tp 364a tp 364b and tp 306 the highest relative tp abundance was observed for the lowest dose of 1 μm torasemide a concentration depended inhibition of the enzymatic process by the substrate was therefore assumed tp 364a was by far the most abundant tp and appeared at a relative peak area of up to 11 of torasemide fig 3 tp 364b and tp 306 were with 6 and 3 of tp 364a much less abundant these findings agreed only partially with the reported product spectrum for human metabolism barroso et al 2001 with torasemide carboxylic acid tp 378a as the main metabolite the hydroxylated tolyl species tp 364a found in the hlm experiments can be considered as a precursor of the human metabolite the tps 306 and 364b formed by n dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation respectively play only a negligible role in the excretion of torasemide reasons for incomplete oxidation by hlm could be a limitation of the cofactor nadph and a different function of cytochrome p450 isoforms in the hlms for example it is known that the formation of tp 364a is catalyzed predominantly by cyp2c9 miners et al 1995 3 1 3 anodic oxidation and identification of reactive metabolites the successful mimicry of phase i metabolism by electrochemical techniques was already demonstrated before johansson et al 2007 and investigated here as well for the simulation of putative enzymatic transformation processes independent of the ph about 10 of the initial torasemide concentration was degraded applying a potential of 1 5 v vs ag agcl for 10 min data not shown ec treatment of torasemide produced 12 tps the most abundant tps are the aromatic hydroxylation product tp 364b and its oxidation product tp 362 quinone imine and the n dearylation product tp 258 loss of the tolyl moiety electrochemical formation of transformation products was generally favored at a neutral ph except for tp 258 in which case the product yield was increased almost 40 fold under acidic conditions data not shown the minor human metabolite 4 hydroxytorasemide tp 364b was the third most abundant degradation product after anodic oxidation of torasemide and accumulated to a relative amount of 68 aromatic hydroxylation via electrochemical degradation was already reported for other molecules before johansson et al 2007 and the presence of electron donating substituents here the methyl group of the tolyl moiety is generally considered beneficial for this process in addition to tp 364b another isobaric species tp 364c of significantly lower abundance 6 was detected after electrochemical degradation of torasemide eluting at a retention time of about 7 5 min n oxide formation was already demonstrated for torasemide in the presence of hydrogen peroxide kurmi et al 2017 however n oxides elute typically later than their respective parent compound merel et al 2017 a principle which held true also for torasemide on a reversed phase column kurmi et al 2017 due to an earlier elution of tp 364c compared to its parent molecule the putative identification of this analyte as n oxide was rejected aromatic hydroxylation was therefore left here as well as the most plausible mechanism of formation for this product in contrast to incubations with liver microsomes the hydroxylation of the methyl group generating tp 364a was not observed during anodic oxidation this is generally owed to the high oxidation potential of hydrocarbons preventing a direct electrochemical oxidation of aliphatic carbons jurva et al 2003 this mechanism could however be simulated in principle by ec fenton systems involving reactive hydroxyl radicals johansson et al 2007 but a similar setup was not evaluated here the quinone imine tp 362 a dehydrogenation product of tp 364b was the most abundant transformation product observed after electrochemical degradation of torasemide this product is of specific importance since the electrophilic compound is highly reactive and can directly react with a wide range of cell nucleophiles e g dna or proteins or can generate reactive oxygen species through redox cycling klopčič and dolenc 2019 deleterious effects like hepatotoxicity were associated with the formation of these reactive metabolites and were responsible for example for the market withdrawal of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine naisbitt et al 1998 also the anodic oxidation of paracetamol led to the formation of n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi nematollahi et al 2009 the identification of reactive tps is often performed by trapping with nucleophiles and especially the reaction with reduced glutathione gsh has been applied in the context of an electrochemical simulation of phase i metabolism madsen et al 2007 when gsh was added to the torasemide solution after anodic oxidation at ph 7 the concentration of the tp 362 decreased by more than 99 and three isobaric gsh conjugates with an elemental composition of c26h35n7o10s2 tp 363 c16h18n4o4s plus one gsh c10h17n3o6s could be observed fig 4 the gsh conjugates of tp 362 eluted between 5 6 min and 5 9 min and the maximum observed mass error for the most abundant ionic species m 2h 2 m z 335 6016 was 1 2 ppm the results strongly support the proposed structure of tp 362 as quinone imine and its reactive nature after ec degradation of torasemide also tp 278 tp 320 and tp 378b were revealed as reactive metabolites based on their reaction with glutathione s1 of the supporting information while tp 378b is potentially a hydroxylated species of tp 362 the products tp 320 and tp 278 could be formed from tp 362 via n dealkylation loss of the isopropyl group and sulfonamide hydrolysis to a sulfonic acid respectively in general n dealkylation was reported for the electrochemical transformation of other molecules before johansson et al 2007 while the formation of sulfonic acids from sulfonamides was specifically demonstrated for bdd electrodes fabiańska et al 2014 the hydrogenated species of both tps i e tp 280 and tp 322 were also detected after anodic oxidation but with relative abundances about half of their quinone imine precursors generally activation by hydroxylation and further dehydrogenation seemed to be required before dealkylation could take place as this degradation mechanism was only observed for tp 364b leading to tp 322 and tp 362 leading to tp 320 the direct n dealkylation of torasemide itself leading towards tp 306 could not be mimicked electrochemically in contrast sulfonamide hydrolysis to a sulfonic acid took place for torasemide itself leading towards the formation of tp 264 the additional cleavage product for all sulfonamide hydrolysis reactions which is here isopropylurea tp 102 was observed after anodic oxidation as well and this compound accumulated to a relative abundance of 17 the second most abundant product tp 258 was formed via n dearylation cleaving of the tolyl group due to the loss of this moiety it was however not possible to elucidate if an activation similar to the hydroxylation in case of n dealkylation was required prior to the n dearylation taking place subsequent degradation of tp 258 via amide cleavage at the urea moiety led to the formation of the primary sulfonamide tp 173 which was detected with a relative abundance of 5 3 1 4 microbial degradation with activated sludge an improved understanding of torasemide tps formed during conventional wastewater treatment was expected from aerobic biodegradation experiments the time courses of relative concentrations for the parent compound and putative tp s are shown in fig 5 the spiked torasemide concentration remained constant over the first three days fig 5a indicating that sorption onto sludge and abiotic hydrolysis can be ruled out under the given experimental conditions this hypothesis was also supported by control samples with torasemide spiked to water as the initial and final torasemide concentrations did not differ here fig 5a an initial lag phase was observed prior to the initiation of torasemide degradation which occurred three to seven days into the experiment an acclimation of the microbial community or a suppressed degradation of torasemide due to competition with more readily degradable nutrients are potential explanations for the observed lag phase once biodegradation began the torasemide concentration dropped on average to 88 of the initially spiked amount after one week and decreased continuously to 59 within two additional weeks fig 5a the decrease in the torasemide concentration was generally related to the formation of six metabolites most tps were detected after the initial lag phase and in case of the carboxylic acid tp 378a the concentration increased steadily over the complete experimental duration assuming comparable ionization efficiencies this product was the most abundant tp exceeding the other metabolites more than 5 fold and about 5 of the initially spiked torasemide was finally recovered as tp 378a fig 5b tp 378a is already known as the main human metabolite torasemide carboxylic acid knauf and mutschler 1998 it is noteworthy that tp 364a the main degradation product with hlms section 3 1 2 and the reported intermediate of tp 378a was not detected during the microbial degradation study it was therefore assumed that microorganisms oxidizing torasemide to tp 378a either do not release the intermediate tp 364a or that the transformation of tp 364a occurs so fast that it does not accumulate to significant amounts in the medium similar to tp 378a the concentrations of tp 173 and tp 258 were also steadily increasing until the end of the experiment but in contrast to all other products they were only detected in samples taken after 14 days the reactions leading to their formation e g a n dearylation in case of tp 258 might require a previous activation of torasemide and it is very likely that these compounds are secondary metabolites the stagnant tp 306 or decreasing tp 362 and tp 364b concentrations of some metabolites towards the end of the experiment could generally support this hypothesis fig 5c except for tp 306 and tp 378a all additional metabolites were also generated by anodic oxidation of torasemide 3 1 5 direct and indirect photodegradation photodegradation of torasemide by natural sunlight was studied in deionized water direct photolysis and in surface water indirect photodegradation over seven days generally there was no direct photodegradation observed for torasemide within this time frame fig 6 a although this compound shows a uv vis absorption spectrum similar to diclofenac fig s 18 in supporting information diclofenac is known for its rapid and direct degradation salgado et al 2013 and was almost completely removed within one day under the same conditions fig 6b compared to torasemide diclofenac contains however two photolabile c cl bonds where direct photolysis is suggested to start poiger et al 2001 as torasemide does not undergo direct photolysis this process is not influencing the fate of this compound in the environment and does not lead to a formation of degradation products in contrast indirect photodegradation in surface water removed torasemide by 77 within one week while no degradation was observed in dark controls fig 7 a it produced four tps mainly the aromatic hydroxylation tp 364b and its oxidation product tp 362 quinone imine tp 393 nitro toresamide and tp 258 tp 364b and tp 362 were already detected in samples taken after 24 h and their concentrations increased steadily until the third or fourth day respectively fig 7b towards the end of the experiment the concentrations decreased slightly suggesting subsequent transformation the tp 258 which was putatively formed by n dearylation of torasemide was detected the first time after about two days and its concentration increased until the end of the field study assuming similar ionization efficiencies tp 258 was the least abundant phototransformation product of torasemide in contrast to these three products which were already observed after anodic oxidation or during microbial degradation tp 393 was solely observed for indirect photodegradation the elemental composition of this analyte points towards a nitration of torasemide a phototransformation process already reported for the herbicide monuron nélieu et al 2008 generally the mechanism could be induced by nitrite or nitrate in the presence of oxygen but the water analysis supports the route via nitrate while about 30 mg l 1 of nitrate were detected in the surface water utilized for the field study nitrite was not detected detailed analysis results in the supporting information of lege et al 2019 the general importance of nitrate for the indirect photodegradation under these conditions was also highlighted in the context of denatonium lege et al 2019 nitrate is known as a photosensitizing species that influences the formation of reactive oxygen species in aquatic environments gligorovski et al 2015 and can therefore ultimately impact the fate of organic micropollutants in the environment wang et al 2017 3 2 occurrence of torasemide and its tps in aqueous samples in 2015 grab samples were taken from 22 effluents of wwtps and three rivers in baden württemberg germany and torasemide concentrations were determined by target analysis with lc esi qqq mass spectrometry torasemide was detected in rivers downstream of wwtps in the range from 34 ng l 1 to 67 ng l 1 fig 8 concentrations in the wwtp effluents were between 31 ng l 1 and 348 ng l 1 with a median concentration of 181 ng l 1 and hence in the same range as previously reported gros et al 2012 gurke et al 2015 singer et al 2016 ternes et al 2019 high concentration variability between different wwtp effluents was also observed before and the authors of previous studies generally suggested differences in micropollutant removal efficiency or differences in the wastewater composition e g by dilution with industrial wastewater as potential reasons singer et al 2016 in addition to the quantification of the parent compound torasemide itself retrospective suspect screening was also performed for samples analyzed with high resolution mass spectrometry lc esi qtof ms to shed light on the occurrence of its transformation products signal intensities of torasemide in influent and effluent samples of plant e21 did not reveal a considerable removal of torasemide during wastewater treatment fig s19 in supporting information heavy rainfall during the sampling campaign was causing highly variable flow conditions which are known as important source of errors and inconsistencies in estimated removal rates in wwtps majewsky et al 2011 signal intensities were also not corrected for matrix effects on quantification overall only three of the sixteen putatively identified tps were detected in at least one of the wwtp or surface water samples table 2 the tp 258 the product generated by n dearylation was generally the least frequently detected torasemide product and it was present only in a single wwtp effluent sample the human metabolite hydroxytorasemide tp 364a seemed to be of similar low environmental relevance although it was detected in all influent samples of the treatment plant e21 this metabolite was completely removed during wastewater treatment in this plant this observation was in agreement with the microbial degradation experiments performed for torasemide using activated sludge while the final product carboxytorasemide tp 378a accumulated over time the precursor tp 364a was never detected in these experiments which suggests a high biodegradability chapter 3 1 4 the fact that this compound was observed in one of the additional 22 analyzed effluent samples might be related to differences in the microbial community or the present nutrient conditions the here suggested low persistence of the human metabolite tp 364a generally agrees with previous findings by ternes et al who did not detect this analyte in any of their investigated surface water or wwtp effluent samples ternes et al 2019 these authors already identified carboxytorasemide tp 378a putatively in their samples and reported higher peak areas for this metabolite compared to torasemide itself the same trend was also observed in our data and the average ratio of the signal intensities for tp 378a compared to torasemide were about 3 4 2 5 and 1 9 for the five wwtp influent samples all 27 wwtp effluent samples combined and the seven surface water samples respectively table 2 the increase in the signal ratios for the metabolite compared to the parent compound during wastewater treatment in the plant e21 support the biodegradation of tp 364a and potentially torasemide itself leading towards the generation of carboxytorasemide as already suggested by the microbial degradation experiments tp 378a seemed to be more persistent and it is therefore not surprising that it was detected in all samples taken from wwtps and wastewater impacted surface waters assuming similar ionization efficiencies for tp 378a and torasemide an estimated concentration level at about 1 μg l 1 of carboxytorasemide could be postulated in wwtp effluents 4 conclusions overall sixteen biotic and abiotic degradation products of the loop diuretic torasemide were identified in this study the presence of these tps and their parent compound was investigated in wastewater treatment plants and receiving surface waters to shed more light on the occurrence and the potential fate of these analytes in the environment generally the following conclusions were drawn by us torasemide is susceptible to microbial degradation and indirect photodegradation biotransformation and indirect photodegradation produced the quinone imine tp 362 a reactive intermediate which can directly react with a wide range of cell nucleophiles e g dna or proteins and is therefore of toxicological relevance the human metabolite tp 364a is not environmentally relevant as it is usually removed by microbial degradation during wastewater treatment the metabolite carboxytorasemide tp 378a in contrast exhibits an increased persistence and is frequently detected in treated wastewater and surface waters rough concentration estimates for tp 378a suggest amounts up to 1 μg l 1 in treated wastewater additional measurements are however required using reference standards for accurate quantification declaration of competing interest the

17947,the occurrence and distribution of n acyl homoserine lactones ahls in membrane bioreactors mbrs treating wastewater has garnered much attention as they have been shown to play critical role in biofouling there is a need to develop a single method capable of analysing ahls in various wastewater with comparable and reliable performance a novel and robust method was proposed for trace analysis of 11 ahls in wastewater treatment systems treating domestic and industrial wastewater this method utilised solid phase extraction spe to extract ahls from wastewater followed by liquid liquid extraction lle to extract ahls from the spe eluant and used n heptanoyl dl homoserine lactone c7 hsl as an internal standard there was no need to prepare matrix matched calibration curve for accurate quantification of ahls in the liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography lc ms ms analysis the developed method was validated with six different types of domestic and industrial wastewater with regard to ahls recoveries and matrix effects for treated domestic and industrial wastewater the relative recoveries ranged from 75 to 130 and the matrix effects ranged from 89 to 122 this method exhibited remarkable improvement compared with single spe the results also indicated that inclusion of lle after spe could effectively alleviate matrix effects which may be because of the removal of relatively hydrophilic interferences by using dichloromethane to extract ahls from the spe eluant composing of methanol and water the limits of detection of the ahls were all below 5 ng l for the tested wastewater samples the developed method of spe lle with lc ms ms was applied to analyse ahls in four lab scale and one pilot scale wastewater treatment systems wide spectrum of ahls with alkanoyl chains ranging from c4 to c14 were detected with concentrations ranging from 2 7 to 299 2 ng l this method is capable of identifying and quantifying trace levels of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems and can help us better understand the mechanisms of ahl mediated quroum sensing in various wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords ahls membrane bioreactor solid phase extraction liquid liquid extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography matrix effects 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is an integration of a physical separation process i e the membrane into the activated sludge process for solids and liquid separation despite the increasing popularity in its application for both industrial and domestic wastewater treatment in the past decade membrane fouling in mbrs remains a largely unsolved impediment towards greater adoption of this technology membrane fouling in mbrs treating wastewaters is dominated by biofilm formation on the membrane s surface and is a natural process it was proposed that biological methods would sustain any fouling alleviation strategy quorum quenching qq is a method to block the naturally occurring quorum sensing qs process which is a form of bacterial communication between cells in which bacteria secrete and sense specific chemicals n acyl homoserine lactones ahls were found to be the main signalling compound in gram negative bacteria which dominate the bacterial population in biological wastewater treatment systems huang et al 2016 ahl molecules are composed of a hydrophilic lactonized homoserine moiety with a hydrophobic acyl chain that varies between 4 and 18 carbons usually in increments of 2 carbon units churchill and chen 2011 importantly these ahl based qs systems are responsible for biofilm formation swarming motility labbate et al 2004 and the production of microbial by products which provide architectural support for biofilms in mbrs tan et al 2014 the application of qq in mbrs has shown to retard membrane fouling by slowing growth in transmembrane pressures by up to 500 lee et al 2016 detection characterisation and quantification of ahl molecules in the mbrs are essential to achieve the targeted effect from the qq process ma et al 2018 detected four types of ahls between c6 hsl and c12 hsl in aerobic granulation bioreactors and differed depending on environmental condition in contrast ahls of c10 hsl and longer were detected from various mbrs oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 however yu et al 2016b detected only c6 hsl and c8 hsl ahls in their mbrs and the concentrations differed with solids retention time these results indicated that while ahls were universal signalling molecules in gram negative bacteria the composition of ahls was dependent on the bacterial community and environmental conditions of the systems therefore a clear profile of the ahl composition specific to each system must be understood to achieve maximum impact from the qq process as such standardisation of characterisation methods and improvements their detection limits must be achieved to accurately determine the ahl profiles various methods have been used to extract and identify ahls from pure cultures and environmental samples liquid liquid extraction lle brelles mariño and bedmar 2001 and solid phase extraction spe gould et al 2006 were routinely applied to samples to isolate and concentrate ahls such that artefacts from the bacterial supernatants interfering downstream analyses may be reduced or removed bacterial sensors steindler and venturi 2007 were able detect femtomole levels of ahls but require tailor made strains for each ahl molecule and were time consuming in contrast thin layer chromatography shaw et al 1997 was comparatively faster but hampered by the poor resolution high performance liquid chromatography hplc was thus the most commonly used method for characterising and quantifying ahls the further integration of mass spectrometry ms to hplc or gas chromatography gc has been shown to enhance detection sensitivity and the spectrum of ahls detected sun et al 2018 since multiple processes namely extraction and analysis are required for the complete characterisation and quantification of ahls optimization of the entire flow is crucial to develop suitable conditions for accuracy and reproducibility studies to optimise spe with hplc li et al 2006 and spe with lc ms wang et al 2017 have only been recently reported it should be noted that low sample volumes e g 2 ml and 10 ml of spiked samples with high concentrations of ahls i e 8 15 μg l were extracted to evaluate the extraction efficiencies of the developed spe methods in previous studies li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 as such large sample volume e g 50 ml is needed to accurately quantify ahls that are mostly at ng l levels in wastewater to date the study on analysis of ahls using gc ms is very limited one study developed a gc ms method for analysis of n butyryl l homoserine lactone c4 hsl in wastewater through lle in which a high concentration of c4 hsl i e 12 5 mg l was used to evaluate the extraction efficiency bakaraki et al 2016 much understanding is still lacking in the conditions required in the processes involved in spe or lle with gc ms for ahl detection accurate characterisation is further hampered by the low concentration of ahls naturally occurring in environmental samples wang et al 2011 moreover ahls loss due to adsorption by biomass or materials and to biological action was found to be significant tan et al 2015 as such extraction and concentration methods must be properly assessed for subsequent analyses to be conducted a further compounding problem in biological and environmental samples for the analyses with lc ms or gc ms is the matrix effect from environmental samples matrix effect is known to cause detrimental impacts on the analyses in terms of the detection and quantification limits and the accuracy and precision of results trufelli et al 2011 matrix effects can lead to either a suppression or enhancement in response van eeckhaut et al 2009 and is not known how they affect each type of ahls these effects may also be exerted by co eluting components of the extraction processes van eeckhaut et al 2009 for example metabolic by products from bacteria supressed the detection response of long chain ahls such as c12 hsl and c14 hsl morin et al 2003 while morin et al 2003 developed an lc ms method to detect and quantify ahls up to picomolar concentrations in pure bacterial cultures with standard deviations of less than 10 environmental samples such as those from mbrs are known to have lower ahl concentrations and more complex matrices than pure culture samples and few studies have conducted comprehensive analyses on matrix effect the use of internal standards has been proposed to overcome matrix complexity isotopically labelled analogue internal standards were introduced into the samples to compensate for matrix effects vanderford and snyder 2006 however these deuterated ahls are neither readily available nor to the best of our knowledge produced by any commercial companies as such c7 hsl are proposed as the alternative internal standard since bacteria are not reported to produce this ahl feasibility studies must therefore be conducted to determine if c7 hsl is suitable as the internal standard in real wastewater samples these characteristics necessitate in depth studies to develop suitable extraction and analysis methods we conducted a holistic and systematic study to optimise the characterisation and quantification of ahls with further validation of the method from real environmental samples firstly spe and lle processes were optimized to achieve the maximum recoveries of ahls from aqueous sample subsequently the performance of the developed method which combined the optimized sep and lle was evaluated using six types of domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater the feasibility of using c7 hsl as internal standard also was studied finally method was applied to detect the ahls distribution of five wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials seven n acyl lactones and four n 3 oxoacylhomoserine lactones were used in this study synthetic ahls 97 including n butyryl dl homoserine lactone c4 hsl n hexanoyl dl homoserine lactone c6 hsl n 3 oxohexanoyl dl homoserine lactone 3 oxo c6 hsl n heptanoyl dl homoserine lactone c7 hsl n octanoyl

purification systems w3t199162 siemens germany hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridge oasis hlb 6 ml 200 mg was purchased from waters wat106202 milford usa 2 2 solid phase extraction of ahls spe was carried out using hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml to extract ahls from wastewater samples the spe process was modified from the standard spe protocol provided by the manufacturer in brief hlb cartridge was conditioned with methanol 6 ml and acidified ultrapure water ph 2 5 6 ml in sequence then 50 ml of sample spiked with an internal standard i e c7 ahl and loaded onto the cartridge just before the complete elution of the loaded sample under vacuum acidified ultrapure water ph 2 5 6 ml was loaded for washing then the cartridge was dried under vacuum and the ahls were eluted with 5 ml of methanol the spe eluant was reduced to approximately 0 5 ml with centrivap benchtop vacuum concentrator labconco usa the concentrated spe eluant was centrifuged 14000 rpm 5 min to remove any precipitate finally the supernatant was transferred to an amber vial for lc ms ms analysis in our study spe was optimized with respect to the status of hlb cartridge before elution i e wet and dry which was controlled by drying time i e 1 min and 1 h under vacuum this process was carried out using 50 ml of ultrapure water spiked with ahls of 500 ng l n 4 from the optimization process drying time of 1 min was chosen for the extraction of ahls from aqueous samples 2 3 extraction of ahls through spe lle lle of ahls from spe eluant was conducted to further remove co extracted matrix from wastewater this was aiming to eliminate matrix effects in lc ms ms analysis the ahls were extracted through the optimized spe following the above mentioned procedures thereafter the spe eluant was reduced to approximately 1 ml with centrivap concentrator and 0 4 ml of ultrapure water was added to modify the physiochemical properties of spe eluant which will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 1 the mixture was topped up to 1 5 ml with methanol dcm was used to extract ahls from spe eluant by shaking the mixture at 400 rpm for 15 min then the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to form two layers the top layer mainly consisted of methanol and water while the bottom layer mainly consisted of dcm after removing the top layer with a glass pasteur pipette the bottom layer was transferred to a glass tube and its volume was reduced to approximately 0 5 ml with centrivap concentrator the concentrated extract was transferred to a glass shell vial and evaporated to dryness the precipitate was redissolved in 0 5 ml of methanol and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 min the resulting supernatant was used for lc ms ms analysis in this study the lle was optimized by comparing the extraction efficiencies at different dcm volumes briefly 1 5 ml of methanol and water mixture v v 2 1 was spiked with ahls of 5 μg l and the extraction efficiencies were tested using various dcm volumes i e 1 1 5 3 3 5 and 6 ml from the optimization process 3 ml of dcm was chosen and used for further study 2 4 wastewater treatment systems and sample analysis 2 4 1 collection and preservation of wastewater samples the wastewater samples used for method validation were collected from two lab scale aerobic mbr systems one was fed with domestic wastewater dw ae mbr and the other was fed with phenolic wastewater pw ae mbr the detailed operating conditions of the two mbrs are shown in table 2 four samples from the two mbrs were tested to validate the developed spe method including the influent and effluent of dw ae mbr i e inf dw eff dw as well as influent and effluent of pw ae mbr i e inf pw eff pw in addition to the influent and effluent samples the supernatant of mixed liquor in the two mbrs were also used for spe lle evaluation i e mls dw mls pw the distribution of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems was studied using the developed spe lle method including lab scale mbrs lab scale digester and pilot scale mbr specifically lab scale mbrs included one anaerobic mbr treating domestic wastewater dw an mbr and two aerobic mbrs treating domestic wastewater dw ae mbr and phenolic wastewater pw ae mbr respectively the lab scale anaerobic digester was fed with domestic wastewater dw an ds with the mlss concentration of about 18 g l the pilot scale mbr pimbr which treated industrial wastewater was comprised of an anoxic tank aerobic tank and mbr tank after sample collection the suspended solids in wastewater samples were removed through centrifugation 5000 rpm 10 min with glass centrifuge tubes after ph adjustment ph 2 5 with hydrochloric acid the wastewater samples were preserved at 20 c prior to analysis which was conducted within 1 week 2 4 2 sample preparation wastewater sample was thawed at room temperature before extraction for method validation 50 ml of wastewater sample was spiked with ahls and is n 4 ahls 500 ng l is 500 ng l and shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min for sample analysis 50 ml of wastewater samples was spiked with the is n 3 is 500 ng l 2 5 evaluation of performance of spe and spe lle the performances of spe and spe lle were evaluated in terms of absolute recovery ar relative recovery rr absolute matrix effect ame and relative matrix effect rme matrix effect was evaluated by comparing the slopes of calibration curve and matrix matched calibration curve sample matrices were prepared by extracting un spiked wastewater samples through the optimized methods of spe and spe lle external calibration curve was used to estimate ar and ame while internal calibration curve was used to estimate rr and rme 2 6 lc ms ms analysis an agilent 1290 infinity lc coupled with agilent 6490 triple quad ms agilent usa was used to identify and quantify ahls a cortecs uplc c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 6 μ m waters usa was used for separation of ahls at 40 c the mobile phases consisted of water with 0 1 formic acid phase a and methanol with 0 1 formic acid phase b the gradient was as follows 15 b increased to 70 in 5 min 70 95 in 4 min and maintained for another 4 min 95 decreased to 15 in 0 1 min and maintained for 4 min the total run time was 17 min injection volume was 3 μl and flow rate of the mobile phase was 0 3 ml min electrospray ionization esi under positive mode was applied to ionize ahls morin et al 2003 the ms was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode and each ahl was monitored by two mrm transitions table 1 the chromatogram of the 11 types ahls is shown in fig s1 agilent masshunter software was used to process lc ms ms data the limits of detection lods and quantification loqs for ahls were the concentrations in wastewater samples having signal to noise ratios of 3 and 10 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 spe of ahls spe with hlb or c18 cartridges have been applied to extract ahls from aqueous samples hu et al 2016 li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 yu et al 2016b previous studies suggested that hlb cartridge could recover short to long chain ahls while c18 cartridge only showed acceptable performance for medium chain ahls li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 thus hlb is a promising sorbent for the extraction of ahls with a wide range of polarities due to its capability of retaining hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds simultaneously mazzella et al 2007 in this study hlb cartridge was used to extract ahls 3 1 1 drying time for hlb cartridge the effect of drying time for hlb cartridge i e 1 min 1 h on ahls recoveries was studied as shown in fig 1 it was obvious that extended cartridge drying time reduced the recoveries of the ahls especially for long chain ahls i e c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl and c14 hsl the recoveries of these ahls were 96 95 89 78 and 69 with 1 min of drying time while the recoveries were 85 82 75 63 and 51 with 1 h of drying time for short chain ahls i e c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl and medium chain ahls i e c7 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl and c8 hsl the recoveries under both drying times were similar and were in the ranges of 100 104 and 90 96 respectively furthermore the recoveries were found to decrease with an increase in carbon number in the alkanoyl chain regardless of drying time overall as the results showed that the best recoveries of ahls were achieved at 1 min of cartridge drying this condition was used for downstream studies the low recoveries of ahls under prolonged drying time e g 1h might be probably due to possible degradation and adsorption it has been reported that the ahls might be hydrolyzed because hydroxide ion can attack the lactone ring of ahls yates et al 2002 sheng et al 2018 found that the adsorption rate of ahls by soil through electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding positively correlated with the length of alkanoyl side chain and the sorption amount of ahls increased with time it indicated that the prolonged drying time might enhance adsorption of ahls by hlb adsorbent resulting in difficulties to elute ahls especially the long chain ahls these factors may have contributed to the decreased recoveries of ahls with increasing drying time 3 1 2 performance of spe for ultrapure water ahls were extracted from the spiked ultrapure water samples i e with ahls concentration of 500 ng l using spe with hlb cartridge the effect of acidification of aqueous sample on extraction efficiency of spe was also evaluated since acidification prior to analysis is required to prevent hydrolysis of ahls decho et al 2009 in general the optimized spe had good performance in terms of extracting ahls from neutral and acidified ultrapure water with absolute recoveries in the ranges of 46 62 and 53 70 fig 2 a respectively the absolute recoveries of ahls in acidified ultrapure water were slightly higher especially for 3 oxo c6 hsl and 3 oxo c8 hsl the results also indicated the feasibility of using c7 hsl as internal standard to quantify others ahls fig 2b the relative recoveries of the ahls in neutral and acidified ultrapure water were in the ranges of 80 120 and 85 105 respectively and were in the acceptable range of 70 130 zhang et al 2015 therefore the optimized spe method was effective in extracting ahls from ultrapure water and acidification was able to improve absolute recoveries of ahls correlations between the partition coefficients log p and absolute recoveries of ahls in the upw and acidified upw respectively are shown in fig 2c and d it was obvious the absolute recoveries of ahls correlated negatively with the log p values regardless of being in the upw or acidified upw especially when the log p values were higher than 3 this finding was in accordance with a previous study sheng et al 2018 which also showed that with an increase in log p value the recoveries of ahls decreased correspondingly c14 hsl c12 hsl c10 hsl and c8 hsl c7 hsl compared with the upw our result further indicated that the absolute recoveries of ahls were higher and also less affected by the log p values in the acidified upw fig 2c and d it is known that acidification can prevent hydrolysis of ahls which might help to increase the absolute recoveries of ahls during the spe process decho et al 2009 3 1 3 performance of spe for wastewater the property of wastewater is much more complicated compared to ultrapure water and this could adversely affect the extraction efficiencies of ahls and signal response in lc ms ms four wastewater samples spiked with ahls were used to evaluate the performance of the spe method including the influent and effluent of dw ae mbr i e inf dw eff dw and pw ae mbr i e inf pw eff pw the absolute recoveries of ahls in these wastewater samples were noticeably poor with most recoveries lower than 30 fig 3 a table s1 in dw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls were from 2 to 20 for influent and from 5 to 16 for effluent in pw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls were from 1 to 36 for influent and 3 43 for effluent it was noted that the absolute recoveries of ahls in phenolic wastewater were mostly higher than domestic wastewater though the recoveries had higher relative standard deviations rsds due to the wide variation in recoveries of ahls the usage of a single internal standard i e c7 hsl failed to provide acceptable relative recoveries for most of the ahls which were remarkably higher than 150 or lower than 30 fig 3b table s1 however the medium chain ahls had acceptable relative recoveries owing to their similar physiochemical properties as c7 hsl such as c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3 oxo c8 hsl in the four types of wastewater the complex matrix from wastewater might be the possible reason for poor recoveries of ahls as it could adversely affect spe process and lc ms ms analysis as shown in fig 3c and table s2 absolute matrix effects for domestic wastewater ranged from 9 to 78 which were higher than that of phenolic wastewater 4 45 the data indicated signal suppression in lc ms ms analysis due to the presence of interferences besides phenolic wastewater had more severe matrix effects than domestic wastewater it was also noted that the severity of matrix effects decreased with the increasing number of carbon atoms in the alkanoyl side chain of the ahls suggesting a possibility of hydrophilic interferences from the spe extracts the relative matrix effects of several ahls such as c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3 oxo c8 hsl in domestic wastewater as well as c4 hsl and 3 oxo c6 hsl in phenolic wastewater were less severe due to their similarities in chemical properties as the internal standard i e c7 hsl however the relative matrix effects for most ahls were above 150 fig 3d table 2s indicating that the usage of a single internal standard could not eliminate the matric effect therefore the spe extracts needed to be further cleaned up for accurate quantification of ahls in wastewater 3 2 spe lle of ahls 3 2 1 development of lle in this study lle using dcm was performed to extract ahls from the spe eluant aiming to remove interfering matrix in lc ms ms analysis dcm was previously used to extract ahls through lle in various wastewater samples and bacteria cultures medium with success tan et al 2014 yates et al 2002 it was promising to utilise dcm to extract ahls from the spe eluant which consisted of methanol and low amount of water 0 1 ml as dcm is miscible with methanol it was necessary to add water in appropriate volume to separate dcm from methanol during the lle process it was found that two distinct layers could be formed when the mixture of methanol 1 ml and water 0 5 ml was mixed with dcm with volume in the range of 1 6 ml to maintain the proper ratio between methanol and water 0 4 ml of water was added to the concentrated spe eluant 1 ml which contained methanol and approximately 0 1 ml of water following the optimized spe method the spe eluant was then topped up to 1 5 ml with methanol to optimise the modified lle different volumes of dcm i e 1 1 5 3 3 5 and 6 ml were tested for extracting ahls from 1 5 ml of the mixture of methanol and water v v 2 1 spiked with ahls of 2 μg l as shown in fig 4 a short chain ahls had poor recoveries when low volumes of dcm i e 1 0 1 5 ml were used the recoveries increased to more than 60 when dcm volumes were over 3 ml it implied that a larger volume of dcm was necessary to extract the more hydrophilic ahls efficiently from the mixture of methanol and water fig 4b the extraction efficiencies of medium and long chain ahls by the various dcm volumes were mostly comparable especially for long chain ahls whereas the largest volume of dcm i e 6 ml resulted in the lowest recoveries for most ahls fig 4a this could be due to the loss of ahls during a long evaporation period required for the larger volume of dcm the maximum recoveries of ahls were achieved when dcm volumes were 3 0 and 3 5 ml which ranged from 64 to 82 therefore 3 0 ml of dcm was used to extract ahls from spe eluant in this study as the lower volume of dcm would take a shorter time to evaporate and might also extract less interfering matrix 3 2 2 performance of spe lle for ultrapure water ahls were extracted from the spiked ultrapure water i e with ahls concentration of 500 ng l using the spe lle method absolute recoveries and relative recoveries of ahls are shown in fig 5 absolute recoveries of the ahls were in the range of 55 88 the data also showed that the absolute recoveries of unsaturated ahls i e 3 oxo c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl were lower than the corresponding saturated ones which is consistent with earlier study sun et al 2018 this could be attributed to the increased hydrophilicity of unsaturated ahls which might adversely affect the extraction efficiency of ahls through lle in addition it has been reported that the stability of ahls decreased with the introduction of 3 oxo group into the alkanoyl side chain leading to the higher rate of hydrolysis of unsaturated ahls decho et al 2011 in addition the extremely strong adsorption of c14 hsl to the hlb sorbent due to its high hydrophobicity might also explain its lower recovery than 3 oxo c14 hsl the relative recoveries of ahls in ultrapure water were in the range of 81 128 highlighting the feasibility and essentiality of using c7 hsl as internal standard in the spe lle method absolute recoveries of the ahls were in the range of 55 88 which is comparable with the results obtained by li et al 2006 higher recoveries of ahls 82 75 117 75 were obtained by wang et al 2017 which might be attributed to smaller sample volumes e g 2 ml and 10 ml and higher spiked concentrations of ahls i e 8 15 μg l used in evaluating the developed spe method however large sample volume e g 50 ml or 500 ml is usually needed to accurately profile ahls at trace levels in wastewater in our study the excellent performance of spe lle was confirmed by extracting low concentrations of ahls i e 0 5 μg l from large volume of wastewater samples e g 50 ml the results showed that the developed method can be applied to reveal the occurrence and distribution of ahls in various wastewater treatment system 3 2 3 performance of spe lle for wastewater wastewaters from two aerobic mbr systems were spiked with ahls at concentration of 500 ng l and was analyzed by the spe lle method the influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent of the two mbrs were used for spe lle evaluation in terms of absolute recoveries relative recoveries absolute matrix effect and relative matrix effect the absolute recoveries of ahls in wastewater samples are shown in fig 6 and table s3 it depicted that most of ahls had relatively good absolute recoveries which were between 30 and 68 for dw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls in influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent were 21 40 40 67 and 44 62 respectively for pw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls in influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent were 34 58 except for c4 hsl at 7 37 61 and 45 68 respectively in general the recoveries of ahls in influent were lower than supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent for the two mbrs treating domestic wastewater and phenolic wastewater some of the ahls in influent had absolute recoveries below 30 especially for c4 hsl which were 21 and 7 in the two mbrs on the other hand the absolute recoveries of ahls in the supernatant of mixed liquor were comparable with the effluent for the two mbrs this is likely due to the lower organic contents in the supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent compared to the influent for example the chemical oxygen demand cod of effluent was much lower than those in the influent for the two mbrs domestic wastewater 400 mg l in the influent vs 40 mg l in the effluent phenolic wastewater 3000 mg l in the influent vs 100 mg l in the effluent table 2 our data suggested that the complex wastewater matrix hindered the absolute recoveries of ahls however it is worth noting that the spe lle could eliminate interfering wastewater matrix to a greater extent than the spe as suggested by the higher absolute recoveries of ahls using spe lle the relative recoveries of ahls in wastewater samples are shown in fig 6 and table s3 excellent relative recoveries of ahls in supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent were achieved for the two mbrs for dw ae mbr the relative recoveries were 75 120 and 88 120 respectively for pw ae mbr the relative recoveries were 66 108 and 74 129 respectively however for the influent the relative recoveries of several ahls were out of the acceptable range such as c10 hsl 139 and 3 oxo c12 hsl 141 in dw ae mbr as well as c4 hsl 21 3 oxo c6 hsl 150 c12 hsl 167 and 3 oxo c14 165 in pw ae mbr this suggested that the spe lle method was not suitable for the analysis of these ahls in untreated wastewater especially for untreated phenolic wastewater the absolute matrix effects of domestic wastewater and phenolic wastewater were 41 95 and 63 99 respectively indicating signal suppression in lc ms ms analysis fig 7 table s4 the matrix effects for spe lle were much less severe than spe which were from 9 to 78 and 4 45 respectively the relative matrix effects of supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent for most of ahls in the two mbrs were approximately 100 however higher relative matrix effects of ahls were observed in the influent of dw ae mbr e g 138 for both c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and pw ae mbr e g 178 for c4 hsl 200 for 3 oxo c6 hsl the higher relative matrix effects might be one of possible reasons for the poor relative recoveries of some ahls in the untreated domestic and phenolic wastewater nevertheless the results demonstrated that a clean up process i e lle after spe could effectively remove co extracted interferences from domestic and phenolic wastewater the results also suggested that inclusion of c7 hsl as internal standard in spe lle could counteract the matrix effects from treated domestic and phenolic wastewater 3 2 4 method detection limits the lods and loqs for the ahls in the various wastewater samples are shown in table 3 in general the lods were below 5 ng l regardless of the types of wastewater which were comparable with or lower than previous study sun et al 2018 it implied that the method was sensitive to quantify trace concentrations of ahls in various wastewater samples 3 3 occurrence and distribution of ahls in wastewater treatment systems the developed and validated spe lle method was used to explore the occurrence and distribution of ahls in five wastewater treatment systems which include one lab scale anaerobic digester and two lab scale mbrs treating domestic wastewater i e dw an ds dw an mbr dw ae mbr one lab scale mbr treating phenolic wastewater i e pw ae mbr and one pilot scale mbr treating industrial wastewater i e pimbr distinct profiles of ahls were observed in the five wastewater treatment systems fig 8 the highest concentrations of ahls was found in pimbr which was followed by dw an ds dw an mbr dw ae mbr and pw mbr for domestic wastewater treatment systems three ahls i e c4 hsl c6 hsl and c12 hsl were detected in the influent of dw an ds dw an mbr and dw ae mbr with concentrations ranging from 3 9 to 12 7 ng l in treated wastewater five ahls i e c4 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c10 hsl and c12 hsl were detected with concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 43 8 ng l it was found that c6 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c12 hsl were frequently detected but c10 hsl was only detected in mls dw ae while c4 hsl was only detected in inf dw and mls dw ae in the three systems the profiles of ahls in mixed liquor and effluent were different from the ones in influent however the profiles of ahls in mixed liquor and effluent were similar in dw an mbr but not in dw ae mbr for phenolic wastewater treatment system c4 hsl c12 hsl and c14 hsl were detected in the influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent of pw ae mbr these ahls had comparable concentrations 2 7 4 5 ng l and similar profiles for industrial wastewater treatment system four ahls i e c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl were detected in the supernatants of anoxic aerobic and mbr tanks of pimbr with concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 299 2 ng l c6 hsl was only detected in membrane tank of pimbr at a very low concentration of 3 5 ng l similar profiles for the other three ahls were observed in pimbr though concentrations in the aerobic and membrane tanks were lower than anoxic tank the similar distribution and concentrations of ahls between supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent in pw ae mbr suggested the feasibility of using ahl concentrations determined in effluent to study the mechanism of membrane fouling in mbr as recommended by other researchers huang et al 2019 yu et al 2016b it was mentioned that ahls could pass the membrane module in mbr due to their low molecular weights which might result in a similar distribution and concentrations of ahls between supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent however our data also showed that the distribution and concentrations of ahls in effluent were different from supernatant of mixed liquor for aerobic and anaerobic mbr treating domestic wastewater i e dw ae mbr dw an mbr it has been reported that the morphologies of caked layer on membrane surface played an important role on the retention of low molecular compounds 350 da yue et al 2015 which might result in a difference in ahls retention besides qq bacteria in the cake layer may also contribute to the lower concentrations of ahls in effluent compared with mixed liquor therefore in order to better understand ahls distribution in mbr system it is advisable to analyse the ahls in both mixed liquor and effluent it is worth noting that c6 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c10 hsl and c12 hsl were detected universally in mbr wastewater treatment systems kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 yu et al 2016a 2016b 2019 however few studies have reported the occurrence of short chain ahls e g c4 hsl and long chain ahls e g c14 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl for example only c6 hsl and c8 hsl were detected in aerobic mbrs treating domestic wastewater using spe c18 cartridge coupled with lc ms ms yu et al 2016a liu et al 2019 detected c4 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c12 hsl in the permeates of an anaerobic mbr treaing synthetic wastewaer using lle coupled with lc ms ms however the concentration of c4 hsl detected was minimal kim et al 2013 detected 3 oxo c8 hsl and c8 hsl in the biofilm formed on the membrane of an aerobic mbr treating synthetic wastewater using lle coupled with hplc in comparison our data revealed the occurrence of short chain medium chain and long chain ahls in wastewater treatment systems except for c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl besides the difference in types of wastewater as well as treatment systems the spe sorbents might be responsible for varied occurrence and distribution of ahls spe with c18 sorbent has been widely applied to extract ahls from wastewater yu et al 2016b 2019 however previous studies showed that c18 sorbent had poor performance for short and long chain ahls i e c4 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl and c14 hsl by comparing the extraction efficiencies of spe with various sorbents including c18 hlb and others li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 it is known that c18 sorbent has poor retention for hydrophilic compounds than hydrophobic ones however the long chain ahls may not be fully eluted from c18 sorbent due to the strong binding because of their extremely high hydrophobicity in comparison spe with hlb sorbent showed good recoveries of short to long chain ahls because it is capable of extracting both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds from aqueous samples wang et al 2017 in our study the short chain to long chain ahls were detected in the five wastewater treatment systems partly thanks to the usage of hlb sorbent in spe lle 3 4 implications of the developed spe lle method spe and lle have been using widely for extraction of ahls from wastewater though they suffer from severe matrix effects matrix matched calibration curve which is tedious to prepare and prone to error is currently used to overcome this kind of limitation the inclusion of stable isotopically labelled internal standards for analysis of ahls in wastewater is very promising but most of these standards are not commercially available yet the removal of interfering matrix through proper clean up after extraction is also a good way to eliminate matrix effects the developed and validated spe lle employs dcm to extract ahls from spe eluant the ahls are transferred to the bottom layer of dcm but the relatively hydrophilic interferences are retained in the top layer of the mixture of methanol and water the inclusion of c7 hsl as a single internal standard contributes to accurate quantification of ahls by correcting the loss of analyte in sample preparation with this reliable and effective method of spe lle trace levels of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems can be quantified with lc ms ms in addition to mbr treating domestic and industrial wastewater the occurrence of ahls in other wastewater treatment systems has drawn considerable attentions recently including granular sludge system ma et al 2018 tan et al 2014 anammox system tang et al 2015 and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr hu et al 2016 for example a positive relationship between cencentrations of ahls and granulation of sluge has been demonstrated in granular activated sludge system tan et al 2014 the increased activity and growth rate of anammox with the addition of c6 hsl and c8 hsl also has been verified in anammox system tang et al 2015 in addition hu et al 2016 reported thet ahls cencentration were positively correlated with biofim formation and activity in mbbr as such the developed and validated spe lle which can simply and accurately quantify ahls from vairous types of wastewater will provide an effective means to study the mechanisms of ahls mediated quroum sensing qs in various wastewater treatment systems 4 conclusions in this study a novel and robust method was developed and validated to identify and quantify 11 types of ahls in complex wastewater the developed method employed the spe to extract ahls from wastewater and lle to extract ahls from the spe eluant in sequence trace levels of ahls could be quantified accurately using lc ms ms without inclusion of matrix matched calibration curve the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the excess matrices in spe eluant could be greatly removed by utilising lle as a clean up method this made the spe lle method suitable for extracting ahls from real wastewater with reasonable recoveries and limited matrix effects 2 the inclusion of internal standard i e c7 hsl was crucial for accurate quantitative analysis of ahls in wastewater by correcting loss of analyte in sample preparation 3 good recoveries of ahls and limited matrix effects were obtained with the developed method for various types of wastewater especially for treated wastewater however recoveries and matrix effects of some ahls e g c4 hsl c10 hsl were out of acceptable range for untreated wastewater 4 the lods of the 11 ahls were below 5 ng l for the six different types of wastewater indicating the feasibility of the method for trace analysis of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems 5 wide spectrum of ahls were detected in various lab scale and pilot scale wastewater treatment systems including c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c12 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl and c14 hsl with concentrations ranging from 2 7 to 299 2 ng l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17947,the occurrence and distribution of n acyl homoserine lactones ahls in membrane bioreactors mbrs treating wastewater has garnered much attention as they have been shown to play critical role in biofouling there is a need to develop a single method capable of analysing ahls in various wastewater with comparable and reliable performance a novel and robust method was proposed for trace analysis of 11 ahls in wastewater treatment systems treating domestic and industrial wastewater this method utilised solid phase extraction spe to extract ahls from wastewater followed by liquid liquid extraction lle to extract ahls from the spe eluant and used n heptanoyl dl homoserine lactone c7 hsl as an internal standard there was no need to prepare matrix matched calibration curve for accurate quantification of ahls in the liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography lc ms ms analysis the developed method was validated with six different types of domestic and industrial wastewater with regard to ahls recoveries and matrix effects for treated domestic and industrial wastewater the relative recoveries ranged from 75 to 130 and the matrix effects ranged from 89 to 122 this method exhibited remarkable improvement compared with single spe the results also indicated that inclusion of lle after spe could effectively alleviate matrix effects which may be because of the removal of relatively hydrophilic interferences by using dichloromethane to extract ahls from the spe eluant composing of methanol and water the limits of detection of the ahls were all below 5 ng l for the tested wastewater samples the developed method of spe lle with lc ms ms was applied to analyse ahls in four lab scale and one pilot scale wastewater treatment systems wide spectrum of ahls with alkanoyl chains ranging from c4 to c14 were detected with concentrations ranging from 2 7 to 299 2 ng l this method is capable of identifying and quantifying trace levels of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems and can help us better understand the mechanisms of ahl mediated quroum sensing in various wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords ahls membrane bioreactor solid phase extraction liquid liquid extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography matrix effects 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is an integration of a physical separation process i e the membrane into the activated sludge process for solids and liquid separation despite the increasing popularity in its application for both industrial and domestic wastewater treatment in the past decade membrane fouling in mbrs remains a largely unsolved impediment towards greater adoption of this technology membrane fouling in mbrs treating wastewaters is dominated by biofilm formation on the membrane s surface and is a natural process it was proposed that biological methods would sustain any fouling alleviation strategy quorum quenching qq is a method to block the naturally occurring quorum sensing qs process which is a form of bacterial communication between cells in which bacteria secrete and sense specific chemicals n acyl homoserine lactones ahls were found to be the main signalling compound in gram negative bacteria which dominate the bacterial population in biological wastewater treatment systems huang et al 2016 ahl molecules are composed of a hydrophilic lactonized homoserine moiety with a hydrophobic acyl chain that varies between 4 and 18 carbons usually in increments of 2 carbon units churchill and chen 2011 importantly these ahl based qs systems are responsible for biofilm formation swarming motility labbate et al 2004 and the production of microbial by products which provide architectural support for biofilms in mbrs tan et al 2014 the application of qq in mbrs has shown to retard membrane fouling by slowing growth in transmembrane pressures by up to 500 lee et al 2016 detection characterisation and quantification of ahl molecules in the mbrs are essential to achieve the targeted effect from the qq process ma et al 2018 detected four types of ahls between c6 hsl and c12 hsl in aerobic granulation bioreactors and differed depending on environmental condition in contrast ahls of c10 hsl and longer were detected from various mbrs oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 however yu et al 2016b detected only c6 hsl and c8 hsl ahls in their mbrs and the concentrations differed with solids retention time these results indicated that while ahls were universal signalling molecules in gram negative bacteria the composition of ahls was dependent on the bacterial community and environmental conditions of the systems therefore a clear profile of the ahl composition specific to each system must be understood to achieve maximum impact from the qq process as such standardisation of characterisation methods and improvements their detection limits must be achieved to accurately determine the ahl profiles various methods have been used to extract and identify ahls from pure cultures and environmental samples liquid liquid extraction lle brelles mariño and bedmar 2001 and solid phase extraction spe gould et al 2006 were routinely applied to samples to isolate and concentrate ahls such that artefacts from the bacterial supernatants interfering downstream analyses may be reduced or removed bacterial sensors steindler and venturi 2007 were able detect femtomole levels of ahls but require tailor made strains for each ahl molecule and were time consuming in contrast thin layer chromatography shaw et al 1997 was comparatively faster but hampered by the poor resolution high performance liquid chromatography hplc was thus the most commonly used method for characterising and quantifying ahls the further integration of mass spectrometry ms to hplc or gas chromatography gc has been shown to enhance detection sensitivity and the spectrum of ahls detected sun et al 2018 since multiple processes namely extraction and analysis are required for the complete characterisation and quantification of ahls optimization of the entire flow is crucial to develop suitable conditions for accuracy and reproducibility studies to optimise spe with hplc li et al 2006 and spe with lc ms wang et al 2017 have only been recently reported it should be noted that low sample volumes e g 2 ml and 10 ml of spiked samples with high concentrations of ahls i e 8 15 μg l were extracted to evaluate the extraction efficiencies of the developed spe methods in previous studies li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 as such large sample volume e g 50 ml is needed to accurately quantify ahls that are mostly at ng l levels in wastewater to date the study on analysis of ahls using gc ms is very limited one study developed a gc ms method for analysis of n butyryl l homoserine lactone c4 hsl in wastewater through lle in which a high concentration of c4 hsl i e 12 5 mg l was used to evaluate the extraction efficiency bakaraki et al 2016 much understanding is still lacking in the conditions required in the processes involved in spe or lle with gc ms for ahl detection accurate characterisation is further hampered by the low concentration of ahls naturally occurring in environmental samples wang et al 2011 moreover ahls loss due to adsorption by biomass or materials and to biological action was found to be significant tan et al 2015 as such extraction and concentration methods must be properly assessed for subsequent analyses to be conducted a further compounding problem in biological and environmental samples for the analyses with lc ms or gc ms is the matrix effect from environmental samples matrix effect is known to cause detrimental impacts on the analyses in terms of the detection and quantification limits and the accuracy and precision of results trufelli et al 2011 matrix effects can lead to either a suppression or enhancement in response van eeckhaut et al 2009 and is not known how they affect each type of ahls these effects may also be exerted by co eluting components of the extraction processes van eeckhaut et al 2009 for example metabolic by products from bacteria supressed the detection response of long chain ahls such as c12 hsl and c14 hsl morin et al 2003 while morin et al 2003 developed an lc ms method to detect and quantify ahls up to picomolar concentrations in pure bacterial cultures with standard deviations of less than 10 environmental samples such as those from mbrs are known to have lower ahl concentrations and more complex matrices than pure culture samples and few studies have conducted comprehensive analyses on matrix effect the use of internal standards has been proposed to overcome matrix complexity isotopically labelled analogue internal standards were introduced into the samples to compensate for matrix effects vanderford and snyder 2006 however these deuterated ahls are neither readily available nor to the best of our knowledge produced by any commercial companies as such c7 hsl are proposed as the alternative internal standard since bacteria are not reported to produce this ahl feasibility studies must therefore be conducted to determine if c7 hsl is suitable as the internal standard in real wastewater samples these characteristics necessitate in depth studies to develop suitable extraction and analysis methods we conducted a holistic and systematic study to optimise the characterisation and quantification of ahls with further validation of the method from real environmental samples firstly spe and lle processes were optimized to achieve the maximum recoveries of ahls from aqueous sample subsequently the performance of the developed method which combined the optimized sep and lle was evaluated using six types of domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater the feasibility of using c7 hsl as internal standard also was studied finally method was applied to detect the ahls distribution of five wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials seven n acyl lactones and four n 3 oxoacylhomoserine lactones were used in this study synthetic

purification systems w3t199162 siemens germany hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridge oasis hlb 6 ml 200 mg was purchased from waters wat106202 milford usa 2 2 solid phase extraction of ahls spe was carried out using hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml to extract ahls from wastewater samples the spe process was modified from the standard spe protocol provided by the manufacturer in brief hlb cartridge was conditioned with methanol 6 ml and acidified ultrapure water ph 2 5 6 ml in sequence then 50 ml of sample spiked with an internal standard i e c7 ahl and loaded onto the cartridge just before the complete elution of the loaded sample under vacuum acidified ultrapure water ph 2 5 6 ml was loaded for washing then the cartridge was dried under vacuum and the ahls were eluted with 5 ml of methanol the spe eluant was reduced to approximately 0 5 ml with centrivap benchtop vacuum concentrator labconco usa the concentrated spe eluant was centrifuged 14000 rpm 5 min to remove any precipitate finally the supernatant was transferred to an amber vial for lc ms ms analysis in our study spe was optimized with respect to the status of hlb cartridge before elution i e wet and dry which was controlled by drying time i e 1 min and 1 h under vacuum this process was carried out using 50 ml of ultrapure water spiked with ahls of 500 ng l n 4 from the optimization process drying time of 1 min was chosen for the extraction of ahls from aqueous samples 2 3 extraction of ahls through spe lle lle of ahls from spe eluant was conducted to further remove co extracted matrix from wastewater this was aiming to eliminate matrix effects in lc ms ms analysis the ahls were extracted through the optimized spe following the above mentioned procedures thereafter the spe eluant was reduced to approximately 1 ml with centrivap concentrator and 0 4 ml of ultrapure water was added to modify the physiochemical properties of spe eluant which will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 1 the mixture was topped up to 1 5 ml with methanol dcm was used to extract ahls from spe eluant by shaking the mixture at 400 rpm for 15 min then the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to form two layers the top layer mainly consisted of methanol and water while the bottom layer mainly consisted of dcm after removing the top layer with a glass pasteur pipette the bottom layer was transferred to a glass tube and its volume was reduced to approximately 0 5 ml with centrivap concentrator the concentrated extract was transferred to a glass shell vial and evaporated to dryness the precipitate was redissolved in 0 5 ml of methanol and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 min the resulting supernatant was used for lc ms ms analysis in this study the lle was optimized by comparing the extraction efficiencies at different dcm volumes briefly 1 5 ml of methanol and water mixture v v 2 1 was spiked with ahls of 5 μg l and the extraction efficiencies were tested using various dcm volumes i e 1 1 5 3 3 5 and 6 ml from the optimization process 3 ml of dcm was chosen and used for further study 2 4 wastewater treatment systems and sample analysis 2 4 1 collection and preservation of wastewater samples the wastewater samples used for method validation were collected from two lab scale aerobic mbr systems one was fed with domestic wastewater dw ae mbr and the other was fed with phenolic wastewater pw ae mbr the detailed operating conditions of the two mbrs are shown in table 2 four samples from the two mbrs were tested to validate the developed spe method including the influent and effluent of dw ae mbr i e inf dw eff dw as well as influent and effluent of pw ae mbr i e inf pw eff pw in addition to the influent and effluent samples the supernatant of mixed liquor in the two mbrs were also used for spe lle evaluation i e mls dw mls pw the distribution of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems was studied using the developed spe lle method including lab scale mbrs lab scale digester and pilot scale mbr specifically lab scale mbrs included one anaerobic mbr treating domestic wastewater dw an mbr and two aerobic mbrs treating domestic wastewater dw ae mbr and phenolic wastewater pw ae mbr respectively the lab scale anaerobic digester was fed with domestic wastewater dw an ds with the mlss concentration of about 18 g l the pilot scale mbr pimbr which treated industrial wastewater was comprised of an anoxic tank aerobic tank and mbr tank after sample collection the suspended solids in wastewater samples were removed through centrifugation 5000 rpm 10 min with glass centrifuge tubes after ph adjustment ph 2 5 with hydrochloric acid the wastewater samples were preserved at 20 c prior to analysis which was conducted within 1 week 2 4 2 sample

150 rpm for 30 min for sample analysis 50 ml of wastewater samples was spiked with the is n 3 is 500 ng l 2 5 evaluation of performance of spe and spe lle the performances of spe and spe lle were evaluated in terms of absolute recovery ar relative recovery rr absolute matrix effect ame and relative matrix effect rme matrix effect was evaluated by comparing the slopes of calibration curve and matrix matched calibration curve sample matrices were prepared by extracting un spiked wastewater samples through the optimized methods of spe and spe lle external calibration curve was used to estimate ar and ame while internal calibration curve was used to estimate rr and rme 2 6 lc ms ms analysis an agilent 1290 infinity lc coupled with agilent 6490 triple quad ms agilent usa was used to identify and quantify ahls a cortecs uplc c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 6 μ m waters usa was used for separation of ahls at 40 c the mobile phases consisted of water with 0 1 formic acid phase a and methanol with 0 1 formic acid phase b the gradient was as follows 15 b increased to 70 in 5 min 70 95 in 4 min and maintained for another 4 min 95 decreased to 15 in 0 1 min and maintained for 4 min the total run time was 17 min injection volume was 3 μl and flow rate of the mobile phase was 0 3 ml min electrospray ionization esi under positive mode was applied to ionize ahls morin et al 2003 the ms was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode and each ahl was monitored by two mrm transitions table 1 the chromatogram of the 11 types ahls is shown in fig s1 agilent masshunter software was used to process lc ms ms data the limits of detection lods and quantification loqs for ahls were the concentrations in wastewater samples having signal to noise ratios of 3 and 10 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 spe of ahls spe with hlb or c18 cartridges have been applied to extract ahls from aqueous samples hu et al 2016 li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 yu et al 2016b previous studies suggested that hlb cartridge could recover short to long chain ahls while c18 cartridge only showed acceptable performance for medium chain ahls li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 thus hlb is a promising sorbent for the extraction of ahls with a wide range of polarities due to its capability of retaining hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds simultaneously mazzella et al 2007 in this study hlb cartridge was used to extract ahls 3 1 1 drying time for hlb cartridge the effect of drying time for hlb cartridge i e 1 min 1 h on ahls recoveries was studied as shown in fig 1 it was obvious that extended cartridge drying time reduced the recoveries of the ahls especially for long chain ahls i e c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl and c14 hsl the recoveries of these ahls were 96 95 89 78 and 69 with 1 min of drying time while the recoveries were 85 82 75 63 and 51 with 1 h of drying time for short chain ahls i e c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl and medium chain ahls i e c7 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl and c8 hsl the recoveries under both drying times were similar and were in the ranges of 100 104 and 90 96 respectively furthermore the recoveries were found to decrease with an increase in carbon number in the alkanoyl chain regardless of drying time overall as the results showed that the best recoveries of ahls were achieved at 1 min of cartridge drying this condition was used for downstream studies the low recoveries of ahls under prolonged drying time e g 1h might be probably due to possible degradation and adsorption it has been reported that the ahls might be hydrolyzed because hydroxide ion can attack the lactone ring of ahls yates et al 2002 sheng et al 2018 found that the adsorption rate of ahls by soil through electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding positively correlated with the length of alkanoyl side chain and the sorption amount of ahls increased with time it indicated that the prolonged drying time might enhance adsorption of ahls by hlb adsorbent resulting in difficulties to elute ahls especially the long chain ahls these factors may have contributed to the decreased recoveries of ahls with increasing drying time 3 1 2 performance of spe for ultrapure water ahls were extracted from the spiked ultrapure water samples i e with ahls concentration of 500 ng l using spe with hlb cartridge the effect of acidification of aqueous sample on extraction efficiency of spe was also evaluated since acidification prior to analysis is required to prevent hydrolysis of ahls decho et al 2009 in general the optimized spe had good performance in terms of extracting ahls from neutral and acidified ultrapure water with absolute recoveries in the ranges of 46 62 and 53 70 fig 2 a respectively the absolute recoveries of ahls in acidified ultrapure water were slightly higher especially for 3 oxo c6 hsl and 3 oxo c8 hsl the results also indicated the feasibility of using c7 hsl as internal standard to quantify others ahls fig 2b the relative recoveries of the ahls in neutral and acidified ultrapure water were in the ranges of 80 120 and 85 105 respectively and were in the acceptable range of 70 130 zhang et al 2015 therefore the optimized spe method was effective in extracting ahls from ultrapure water and acidification was able to improve absolute recoveries of ahls correlations between the partition coefficients log p and absolute recoveries of ahls in the upw and acidified upw respectively are shown in fig 2c and d it was obvious the absolute recoveries of ahls correlated negatively with the log p values regardless of being in the upw or acidified upw especially when the log p values were higher than 3 this finding was in accordance with a previous study sheng et al 2018 which also showed that with an increase in log p value the recoveries of ahls decreased correspondingly c14 hsl c12 hsl c10 hsl and c8 hsl c7 hsl compared with the upw our result further indicated that the absolute recoveries of ahls were higher and also less affected by the log p values in the acidified upw fig 2c and d it is known that acidification can prevent hydrolysis of ahls which might help to increase the absolute recoveries of ahls during the spe process decho et al 2009 3 1 3 performance of spe for wastewater the property of wastewater is much more complicated compared to ultrapure water and this could adversely affect the extraction efficiencies of ahls and signal response in lc ms ms four wastewater samples spiked with ahls were used to evaluate the performance of the spe method including the influent and effluent of dw ae mbr i e inf dw eff dw and pw ae mbr i e inf pw eff pw the absolute recoveries of ahls in these wastewater samples were noticeably poor with most recoveries lower than 30 fig 3 a table s1 in dw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls were from 2 to 20 for influent and from 5 to 16 for effluent in pw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls were from 1 to 36 for influent and 3 43 for effluent it was noted that the absolute recoveries of ahls in phenolic wastewater were mostly higher than domestic wastewater though the recoveries had higher relative standard deviations rsds due to the wide variation in recoveries of ahls the usage of a single internal standard i e c7 hsl failed to provide acceptable relative recoveries for most of the ahls which were remarkably higher than 150 or lower than 30 fig 3b table s1 however the medium chain ahls had acceptable relative recoveries owing to their similar physiochemical properties as c7 hsl such as c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3 oxo c8 hsl in the four types of wastewater the complex matrix from wastewater might be the possible reason for poor recoveries of ahls as it could adversely affect spe process and lc ms ms analysis as shown in fig 3c and table s2 absolute matrix effects for domestic wastewater ranged from 9 to 78 which were higher than that of phenolic wastewater 4 45 the data indicated signal suppression in lc ms ms analysis due to the presence of interferences besides phenolic wastewater had more severe matrix effects than domestic wastewater it was also noted that the severity of matrix effects decreased with the increasing number of carbon atoms in the alkanoyl side chain of the ahls suggesting a possibility of hydrophilic interferences from the spe extracts the relative matrix effects of several ahls such as c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3 oxo c8 hsl in domestic wastewater as well as c4 hsl and 3 oxo c6 hsl in phenolic wastewater were less severe due to their similarities in chemical properties as the internal standard i e c7 hsl however the relative matrix effects for most ahls were above 150 fig 3d table 2s indicating that the usage of a single internal standard could not eliminate the matric effect therefore the spe extracts needed to be further cleaned up for accurate quantification of ahls in wastewater 3 2 spe lle of ahls 3 2 1 development of lle in this study lle using dcm was performed to extract ahls from the spe eluant aiming to remove interfering matrix in lc ms ms analysis dcm was previously used to extract ahls through lle in various wastewater samples and bacteria cultures medium with success tan et al 2014 yates et al 2002 it was promising to utilise dcm to extract ahls from the spe eluant which consisted of methanol and low amount of water 0 1 ml as dcm is miscible with methanol it was necessary to add water in appropriate volume to separate dcm from methanol during the lle process it was found that two distinct layers could be formed when the mixture of methanol 1 ml and water 0 5 ml was mixed with dcm with volume in the range of 1 6 ml to maintain the proper ratio between methanol and water 0 4 ml of water was added to the concentrated spe eluant 1 ml which contained methanol and approximately 0 1 ml of water following the optimized spe method the spe eluant was then topped up to 1 5 ml with methanol to optimise the modified lle different volumes of dcm i e 1 1 5 3 3 5 and 6 ml were tested for extracting ahls from 1 5 ml of the mixture of methanol and water v v 2 1 spiked with ahls of 2 μg l as shown in fig 4 a short chain ahls had poor recoveries when low volumes of dcm i e 1 0 1 5 ml were used the recoveries increased to more than 60 when dcm volumes were over 3 ml it implied that a larger volume of dcm was necessary to extract the more hydrophilic ahls efficiently from the mixture of methanol and water fig 4b the extraction efficiencies of medium and long chain ahls by the various dcm volumes were mostly comparable especially for long chain ahls whereas the largest volume of dcm i e 6 ml resulted in the lowest recoveries for most ahls fig 4a this could be due to the loss of ahls during a long evaporation period required for the larger volume of dcm the maximum recoveries of ahls were achieved when dcm volumes were 3 0 and 3 5 ml which ranged from 64 to 82 therefore 3 0 ml of dcm was used to extract ahls from spe eluant in this study as the lower volume of dcm would take a shorter time to evaporate and might also extract less interfering matrix 3 2 2 performance of spe lle for ultrapure water ahls were extracted from the spiked ultrapure water i e with ahls concentration of 500 ng l using the spe lle method absolute recoveries and relative recoveries of ahls are shown in fig 5 absolute recoveries of the ahls were in the range of 55 88 the data also showed that the absolute recoveries of unsaturated ahls i e 3 oxo c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl were lower than the corresponding saturated ones which is consistent with earlier study sun et al 2018 this could be attributed to the increased hydrophilicity of unsaturated ahls which might adversely affect the extraction efficiency of ahls through lle in addition it has been reported that the stability of ahls decreased with the introduction of 3 oxo group into the alkanoyl side chain leading to the higher rate of hydrolysis of unsaturated ahls decho et al 2011 in addition the extremely strong adsorption of c14 hsl to the hlb sorbent due to its high hydrophobicity might also explain its lower recovery than 3 oxo c14 hsl the relative recoveries of ahls in ultrapure water were in the range of 81 128 highlighting the feasibility and essentiality of using c7 hsl as internal standard in the spe lle method absolute recoveries of the ahls were in the range of 55 88 which is comparable with the results obtained by li et al 2006 higher recoveries of ahls 82 75 117 75 were obtained by wang et al 2017 which might be attributed to smaller sample volumes e g 2 ml and 10 ml and higher spiked concentrations of ahls i e 8 15 μg l used in evaluating the developed spe method however large sample volume e g 50 ml or 500 ml is usually needed to accurately profile ahls at trace levels in wastewater in our study the excellent performance of spe lle was confirmed by extracting low concentrations of ahls i e 0 5 μg l from large volume of wastewater samples e g 50 ml the results showed that the developed method can be applied to reveal the occurrence and distribution of ahls in various wastewater treatment system 3 2 3 performance of spe lle for wastewater wastewaters from two aerobic mbr systems were spiked with ahls at concentration of 500 ng l and was analyzed by the spe lle method the influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent of the two mbrs were used for spe lle evaluation in terms of absolute recoveries relative recoveries absolute matrix effect and relative matrix effect the absolute recoveries of ahls in wastewater samples are shown in fig 6 and table s3 it depicted that most of ahls had relatively good absolute recoveries which were between 30 and 68 for dw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls in influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent were 21 40 40 67 and 44 62 respectively for pw ae mbr the absolute recoveries of ahls in influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent were 34 58 except for c4 hsl at 7 37 61 and 45 68 respectively in general the recoveries of ahls in influent were lower than supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent for the two mbrs treating domestic wastewater and phenolic wastewater some of the ahls in influent had absolute recoveries below 30 especially for c4 hsl which were 21 and 7 in the two mbrs on the other hand the absolute recoveries of ahls in the supernatant of mixed liquor were comparable with the effluent for the two mbrs this is likely due to the lower organic contents in the supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent compared to the influent for example the chemical oxygen demand cod of effluent was much lower than those in the influent for the two mbrs domestic wastewater 400 mg l in the influent vs 40 mg l in the effluent phenolic wastewater 3000 mg l in the influent vs 100 mg l in the effluent table 2 our data suggested that the complex wastewater matrix hindered the absolute recoveries of ahls however it is worth noting that the spe lle could eliminate interfering wastewater matrix to a greater extent than the spe as suggested by the higher absolute recoveries of ahls using spe lle the relative recoveries of ahls in wastewater samples are shown in fig 6 and table s3 excellent relative recoveries of ahls in supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent were achieved for the two mbrs for dw ae mbr the relative recoveries were 75 120 and 88 120 respectively for pw ae mbr the relative recoveries were 66 108 and 74 129 respectively however for the influent the relative recoveries of several ahls were out of the acceptable range such as c10 hsl 139 and 3 oxo c12 hsl 141 in dw ae mbr as well as c4 hsl 21 3 oxo c6 hsl 150 c12 hsl 167 and 3 oxo c14 165 in pw ae mbr this suggested that the spe lle method was not suitable for the analysis of these ahls in untreated wastewater especially for untreated phenolic wastewater the absolute matrix effects of domestic wastewater and phenolic wastewater were 41 95 and 63 99 respectively indicating signal suppression in lc ms ms analysis fig 7 table s4 the matrix effects for spe lle were much less severe than spe which were from 9 to 78 and 4 45 respectively the relative matrix effects of supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent for most of ahls in the two mbrs were approximately 100 however higher relative matrix effects of ahls were observed in the influent of dw ae mbr e g 138 for both c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and pw ae mbr e g 178 for c4 hsl 200 for 3 oxo c6 hsl the higher relative matrix effects might be one of possible reasons for the poor relative recoveries of some ahls in the untreated domestic and phenolic wastewater nevertheless the results demonstrated that a clean up process i e lle after spe could effectively remove co extracted interferences from domestic and phenolic wastewater the results also suggested that inclusion of c7 hsl as internal standard in spe lle could counteract the matrix effects from treated domestic and phenolic wastewater 3 2 4 method detection limits the lods and loqs for the ahls in the various wastewater samples are shown in table 3 in general the lods were below 5 ng l regardless of the types of wastewater which were comparable with or lower than previous study sun et al 2018 it implied that the method was sensitive to quantify trace concentrations of ahls in various wastewater samples 3 3 occurrence and distribution of ahls in wastewater treatment systems the developed and validated spe lle method was used to explore the occurrence and distribution of ahls in five wastewater treatment systems which include one lab scale anaerobic digester and two lab scale mbrs treating domestic wastewater i e dw an ds dw an mbr dw ae mbr one lab scale mbr treating phenolic wastewater i e pw ae mbr and one pilot scale mbr treating industrial wastewater i e pimbr distinct profiles of ahls were observed in the five wastewater treatment systems fig 8 the highest concentrations of ahls was found in pimbr which was followed by dw an ds dw an mbr dw ae mbr and pw mbr for domestic wastewater treatment systems three ahls i e c4 hsl c6 hsl and c12 hsl were detected in the influent of dw an ds dw an mbr and dw ae mbr with concentrations ranging from 3 9 to 12 7 ng l in treated wastewater five ahls i e c4 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c10 hsl and c12 hsl were detected with concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 43 8 ng l it was found that c6 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c12 hsl were frequently detected but c10 hsl was only detected in mls dw ae while c4 hsl was only detected in inf dw and mls dw ae in the three systems the profiles of ahls in mixed liquor and effluent were different from the ones in influent however the profiles of ahls in mixed liquor and effluent were similar in dw an mbr but not in dw ae mbr for phenolic wastewater treatment system c4 hsl c12 hsl and c14 hsl were detected in the influent supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent of pw ae mbr these ahls had comparable concentrations 2 7 4 5 ng l and similar profiles for industrial wastewater treatment system four ahls i e c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl were detected in the supernatants of anoxic aerobic and mbr tanks of pimbr with concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 299 2 ng l c6 hsl was only detected in membrane tank of pimbr at a very low concentration of 3 5 ng l similar profiles for the other three ahls were observed in pimbr though concentrations in the aerobic and membrane tanks were lower than anoxic tank the similar distribution and concentrations of ahls between supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent in pw ae mbr suggested the feasibility of using ahl concentrations determined in effluent to study the mechanism of membrane fouling in mbr as recommended by other researchers huang et al 2019 yu et al 2016b it was mentioned that ahls could pass the membrane module in mbr due to their low molecular weights which might result in a similar distribution and concentrations of ahls between supernatant of mixed liquor and effluent however our data also showed that the distribution and concentrations of ahls in effluent were different from supernatant of mixed liquor for aerobic and anaerobic mbr treating domestic wastewater i e dw ae mbr dw an mbr it has been reported that the morphologies of caked layer on membrane surface played an important role on the retention of low molecular compounds 350 da yue et al 2015 which might result in a difference in ahls retention besides qq bacteria in the cake layer may also contribute to the lower concentrations of ahls in effluent compared with mixed liquor therefore in order to better understand ahls distribution in mbr system it is advisable to analyse the ahls in both mixed liquor and effluent it is worth noting that c6 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c10 hsl and c12 hsl were detected universally in mbr wastewater treatment systems kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 yu et al 2016a 2016b 2019 however few studies have reported the occurrence of short chain ahls e g c4 hsl and long chain ahls e g c14 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl for example only c6 hsl and c8 hsl were detected in aerobic mbrs treating domestic wastewater using spe c18 cartridge coupled with lc ms ms yu et al 2016a liu et al 2019 detected c4 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c12 hsl in the permeates of an anaerobic mbr treaing synthetic wastewaer using lle coupled with lc ms ms however the concentration of c4 hsl detected was minimal kim et al 2013 detected 3 oxo c8 hsl and c8 hsl in the biofilm formed on the membrane of an aerobic mbr treating synthetic wastewater using lle coupled with hplc in comparison our data revealed the occurrence of short chain medium chain and long chain ahls in wastewater treatment systems except for c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl besides the difference in types of wastewater as well as treatment systems the spe sorbents might be responsible for varied occurrence and distribution of ahls spe with c18 sorbent has been widely applied to extract ahls from wastewater yu et al 2016b 2019 however previous studies showed that c18 sorbent had poor performance for short and long chain ahls i e c4 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl and c14 hsl by comparing the extraction efficiencies of spe with various sorbents including c18 hlb and others li et al 2006 wang et al 2017 it is known that c18 sorbent has poor retention for hydrophilic compounds than hydrophobic ones however the long chain ahls may not be fully eluted from c18 sorbent due to the strong binding because of their extremely high hydrophobicity in comparison spe with hlb sorbent showed good recoveries of short to long chain ahls because it is capable of extracting both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds from aqueous samples wang et al 2017 in our study the short chain to long chain ahls were detected in the five wastewater treatment systems partly thanks to the usage of hlb sorbent in spe lle 3 4 implications of the developed spe lle method spe and lle have been using widely for extraction of ahls from wastewater though they suffer from severe matrix effects matrix matched calibration curve which is tedious to prepare and prone to error is currently used to overcome this kind of limitation the inclusion of stable isotopically labelled internal standards for analysis of ahls in wastewater is very promising but most of these standards are not commercially available yet the removal of interfering matrix through proper clean up after extraction is also a good way to eliminate matrix effects the developed and validated spe lle employs dcm to extract ahls from spe eluant the ahls are transferred to the bottom layer of dcm but the relatively hydrophilic interferences are retained in the top layer of the mixture of methanol and water the inclusion of c7 hsl as a single internal standard contributes to accurate quantification of ahls by correcting the loss of analyte in sample preparation with this reliable and effective method of spe lle trace levels of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems can be quantified with lc ms ms in addition to mbr treating domestic and industrial wastewater the occurrence of ahls in other wastewater treatment systems has drawn considerable attentions recently including granular sludge system ma et al 2018 tan et al 2014 anammox system tang et al 2015 and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr hu et al 2016 for example a positive relationship between cencentrations of ahls and granulation of sluge has been demonstrated in granular activated sludge system tan et al 2014 the increased activity and growth rate of anammox with the addition of c6 hsl and c8 hsl also has been verified in anammox system tang et al 2015 in addition hu et al 2016 reported thet ahls cencentration were positively correlated with biofim formation and activity in mbbr as such the developed and validated spe lle which can simply and accurately quantify ahls from vairous types of wastewater will provide an effective means to study the mechanisms of ahls mediated quroum sensing qs in various wastewater treatment systems 4 conclusions in this study a novel and robust method was developed and validated to identify and quantify 11 types of ahls in complex wastewater the developed method employed the spe to extract ahls from wastewater and lle to extract ahls from the spe eluant in sequence trace levels of ahls could be quantified accurately using lc ms ms without inclusion of matrix matched calibration curve the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the excess matrices in spe eluant could be greatly removed by utilising lle as a clean up method this made the spe lle method suitable for extracting ahls from real wastewater with reasonable recoveries and limited matrix effects 2 the inclusion of internal standard i e c7 hsl was crucial for accurate quantitative analysis of ahls in wastewater by correcting loss of analyte in sample preparation 3 good recoveries of ahls and limited matrix effects were obtained with the developed method for various types of wastewater especially for treated wastewater however recoveries and matrix effects of some ahls e g c4 hsl c10 hsl were out of acceptable range for untreated wastewater 4 the lods of the 11 ahls were below 5 ng l for the six different types of wastewater indicating the feasibility of the method for trace analysis of ahls in various wastewater treatment systems 5 wide spectrum of ahls were detected in various lab scale and pilot scale wastewater treatment systems including c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c12 hsl 3 oxo c14 hsl and c14 hsl with concentrations ranging from 2 7 to 299 2 ng l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17948,the solar chlorine process is an energy efficient advanced oxidation process that can produce reactive species such as hydroxyl radical reactive chlorine species and ozone this study investigated the process ability to detoxify the typical herbicides atrazine and mecoprop methylchlorophenoxypropionic acid both herbicides are resistant to direct solar photolysis or chlorination alone but they can be degraded by the solar chlorine process effectively atrazine inhibited the development of arabidopsis thaliana but such inhibition was negligible after solar chlorine treatment of an atrazine solution the transformation of atrazine in the process was shown to be through hydroxylation hydrogen abstraction and dechlorination but did not involve chlorine substitution or addition cl reacts with atrazine and mecoprop with rate constants of 6 87 109 m 1s 1 and 1 08 1010 m 1s 1 respectively while clo reacts with mecoprop with a rate constant of 1 11 108 m 1s 1 the degradation kinetics of atrazine and mecoprop by solar chlorine was simulated by modeling which fitted the experimental results well hydroxyl radicals ho mainly contributed to the degradation of atrazine by solar chlorine at ph 7 with the contribution of 65 whereas clo and o3 were main species responsible for the degradation of mecoprop with the contribution of 72 and 17 respectively the pseudo first order rate constants k s of the two degradations increased substantially by 28 8 for atrazine and by 198 for mecoprop when the chlorine dosage was increased from 50 μm to 200 μm the k s decreased with increasing ph the presence of natural organic matter inhibited the degradation of both herbicides while the presence of bromide enhanced their degradation this work reveals a feasible method for the

contamination and they are frequently detected in ground water and surface water where they may be toxic to some plants and animals craddock et al 2019 khan et al 2015 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 mcpp has been widely used for weeds control till now while atz had been used in the past for a long time and they are quite recalcitrant to traditional water treatment bianchi et al 2006 rodriguez et al 2011 atz can act as an endocrine disruptor and has carcinogenic effects even at relatively low concentration which poses a great risk to human health almeida et al 2019 rebecca 2002 the european union has set standards and ruled that the maximum concentration in drinking water for one herbicide is 0 1 μg l while the sum of all herbicides is 0 5 μg l the maximum concentration of atz allowed in the u s a is 3 μg l based on toxicological evidence juan et al 2000 therefore efficient techniques that can eliminate these resistant herbicides should be investigated uv based aops have been investigated for the degradation of herbicides uv h2o2 can effectively degrade mcpp with rate constant between mcpp and ho of 1 1 109 m 1s 1 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 additionally the uv persulfate and uv peroxymonosulfate aops have been reported to be effective for atz abatement khan et al 2014 lutze et al 2015 recently the uv chlorine process has also been demonstrated to be efficient for atz degradation kong et al 2016 however the high energy requirement of uv irradiation increases the operating cost of uv based aops the electrical energy per order ee o of uv light accounts for more than 90 of the total ee o of the uv h2o2 process and between 10 and 90 for the uv chlorine process in the degradation of a variety of micropollutants guo et al 2018 solar irradiation is a cost effective energy and the solar chlorine process has been investigated for micropollutant degradation and disinfection for example the solar chlorine process has been shown to be efficient for the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts which were resistant to either solar irradiation or chlorination alone forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 solar chlorine treatment has additionally been shown to be efficient for the abatement of a variety of pharmaceuticals such as caffeine carbamazepine and gemfibrozil hua et al 2019 sun et al 2016a b yang et al 2016 ho cl and o3 are generated during chlorine photolysis at irradiation wavelength 200 400 nm bulman et al 2019 of them ho and o3 are regarded as the primary reactive species in the disinfection forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 ho o3 as well as rcs are reported to be responsible for the degradation of ppcps hua et al 2019 however the roles of specific reactive species in the degradation of herbicides remains unknown oxidation s ability to alter toxicity during pollutant transformation is an important issue although phenol can be effectively degraded by uv h2o2 treatment the transformation products such as α β unsaturated enedials and oxoenals are more toxic in reacting with proteins than phenol itself prasse et al 2018 the decarboxylated intermediates formed in uv h2o2 treatment were demonstrated to be more toxic to luminescent bacteria than parent pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and ibuprofen wang et al 2018 the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri increased after the uv photolysis of gemfibrozil while it decreased after clo oxidation kong et al 2018 in addition the toxicity evolution is to a large extent a function of how much oxidation is applied which depends on the transformation products evolution for example the acute toxicity of mixture chemicals to daphnia magna increased firstly by uv h2o2 treatment and decreased when the uv fluence was higher than 300 mj cm2 rozas et al 2016 acute toxicity is easily used in assessing toxicity changes but it is not suitable for evaluating the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of micropollutants rizzo 2011 arabidopsis thaliana is a model plant which has been used for the analysis of the chronic toxicity of cuo nanoparticles and polychlorinated biphenyls subramanian et al 2017 wang et al 2016b the p450 family of genes which code for the terminal oxidase in the electron transfer chains have been widely used as bio markers for some herbicides and have played an important role in the response to environmental contaminants björklund and skagerberg 2006 dong et al 2009 fatima and masood 2006 kuiper et al 2008 the toxicity of herbicides to plants and the genetic changes involved need more comprehensive investigation this study was therefore designed to achieve the following objectives 1 to investigate the degradation kinetics of atz and mcpp by solar chlorine process and identify the reactive species involved 2 to investigate the changes in toxicity to vibrio fischeri and arabidopsis thaliana in solar chlorine treatment and the transformation pathways involved 3 to investigate the factors affecting the degradation of mcpp and atz by the solar chlorine process and 4 to test the applicability of the solar chlorine process to natural waters 2 materials and

secondary effluent were obtained from a drinking water treatment plant and a wastewater treatment plant in guangdong china they were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and stored at 4 c table s1 2 2 experimental procedure the solar chlorine experiments were conducted in a quartz container 250 ml with magnetic stirring and the surface of the reactor was illuminated with simulated sunlight crowntech sun simulator s0l30023a a test solution 250 ml containing 5 μm atz or mcpp and 1 μm nb was added to naocl stock solution to attain a desired concentration and simultaneously exposed to the simulated solar irradiation the ph 5 7 or 8 4 was maintained using 2 mm phosphate buffer samples were collected at pre determined time and quenched using ascorbic acid at a 2 1 m ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine similar tests were conducted by adding certain concentrations of nom nahco3 cl or br into the solution to investigate the effects of the water s composition on the degradation of atz or mcpp radical scavenging tests were carried out with the addition of 100 mm nahco3 or 50 mm tba all of the tests were conducted at least duplicate the error bars in all of the data plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data from the duplicated tests for toxicity analysis and intermediates identification the tests was conducted in the same manner a 500 ml sample was collected at the predetermined time and simultaneously quenched by na2s2o3 which was then concentrated to 50 ml by spe using hlb cartridges 200 mg 6 ml cnw technologies arabidopsis thaliana treated by

environmental technologies co ltd and a lumistox toxicity analyzer hach usa according to the method previously reported wu et al 2016 briefly 75 μl osmotic pressure adjusting solution was added into 675 μl sample and then 250 μl resuscitated bacterial solution was added to each sample samples were mixed and measured after 15 min note that methanol used in sample concentration for toxicity analysis was blown away and diluted in phosphate buffer 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of the chlorine stock solution was periodically determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the concentrations of atz and mcpp were analyzed using hplc agilent 1260 usa atz and mcpp were analyzed with different ratios of pure water and methanol at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and were detected at 222 and 230 nm respectively the transformation intermediates products of the two herbicides were identified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography in tandem with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and those for atz and mcpp were identified in positive esi and negative esi mode respectively the doc content was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu to quantitatively describe the role of ho nb was used as a probe to calculate the steady state concentration as it selectively only reacts with ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 hoigné 1983 the calculation of the relative contributions of the reactive species to the removal of atz or mcpp followed the methods described by xiang et al 2016 2 4 kinetic modeling the kinetic model contained 112 reactions table s3 and was simulated with kintecus v4 55 ianni 2015 using k obtained from the literatures bulman et al 2019 guo et al 2018 or estimated based on data fitting function of kintecus v4 55 the photolysis of chlorine follows eqs s 1 4 in table s3 the rate constants of chlorine photolysis was determined by experiment and the specific rate constants of eqs s 1 4 was determined by data fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of atz and mcpp fig 1 shows the experimental and modeling kinetics of atz and mcpp degradation by solar chlorination and solar chlorine treatment in pure water at ph 7 0 atz and mcpp were resistant to chlorination and solar photolysis whereas the removal rates of mcpp and atz were approximately 80 and 30 respectively within 90 min when solar chlorine treatment was applied the degradation of atz and mcpp in the solar chlorine process both followed pseudo first order kinetics the rate constant k for atz was determined to be 7 68 10 5 s 1 and that for mcpp was 2 69 10 4 s 1 which fits well with the modeling result the degradation can be attributed to reactive species such as ho rcs and o3 hua et al 2019 the reaction rate of ho with atz was reported to be 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 and that of mcpp was 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 their corresponding rates with o3 were 6 3 m 1s 1 and 111 m 1s 1 respectively beltrán et al 1993 table 1 however the reactivity of rcs with atz and mcpp remain unknown 3 2 roles of reactive species in the degradation of atz and mcpp by solar chlorine the second order rate constants of clo and cl with atz and mcpp were determined then the contribution of different reactive species to atz and mcpp degradation were further calculated 3 2 1 second order rate constants of clo and cl the second order rate constants of clo reacting with atz and mcpp were investigated through competition kinetics using 5 μm dmob as a reference compound dmob was used to determine the steady state concentration of clo in the system for dmob can react with clo at 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1987 hua et al 2019 to create a scenario for clo the uv chlorine process was spiked with 100 mm hco3 to scavenge ho cl and cl2 but not clo note that co3 was involved in this system and thus mdz 5 μm was used as the probe for co3 k 4 106 m 1s 1 to determine the co3 concentration wu et al 2017 the rate constant of atz with co3 was 4 0 106 m 1s 1 table 1 while that of mcpp with co3 was negligible as the degradation of mcpp by uv h2o2 hco3 process with 50 μm h2o2 and 100 mm nahco3 at ph 8 4 was similar to that by uv irradiation alone fig s1 the competition kinetics of dmob and atz or mcpp are shown in fig s2 and the second order rate constants for clo reacting

constant for clo with mcpp was determined to be 1 11 108 m 1 s 1 but that with atz was lower than 106 m 1 s 1 table 1 and fig s2 the second order rate constants of cl reacting with atz and mcpp were determined to be 6 87 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 08 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively both of which are much higher than those of ho k atz ho 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 k mcpp ho 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 table 1 the concentrations of ho cl and clo were determined to be 5 62 10 15 m 4 31 10 16 m and 9 28 10 13 m respectively in the solar chlorine process with 100 μm chlorine dosage and at ph 7 0 fig s4 the contributions of the different reactive species to the degradation of atz and mcpp were calculated which depended on the second order rate constant and the concentration of the specific radical the contribution of clo to the degradation of mcpp was 16 7 times that of ho and 22 1 times that of cl as for atz the contribution of ho to atz degradation was 5 69 times that of cl ho is the primary reactive specie for atz degradation while both clo and ho contribute to the degradation of mcpp under the experimental conditions studied 3 2 3 the roles of o3 the photolysis of clo generates o 3p which reacts with do to form o3 eq 8 9 table 2 zhou et al 2014 the role of o3 in the degradation of atz and mcpp by the solar chlorine process was investigated after purging nitrogen for at least 30 min to avoid the formation of o3 the k and k ho of atz and mcpp in the presence or absence of do were investigated at ph ranging from 5 0 to 8 4 fig 2 the degradation of both atz and mcpp was inhibited without do at any ph except for atz at ph 5 0 and the degree of inhibition increased with increasing ph the k of atz decreased by 37 1 at ph 7 0 and by 80 4 at 8 4 without do similarly the k of mcpp decreased by 9 4 at ph 5 0 25 7 at 7 0 and by 83 8 at 8 4 note that the k ho of atz and mcpp also decreased by 18 47 in the absence of do which indicated that ho was partially generated from o3 decay von gunten 2003 the formation of o3 increased with increasing ph as the proportion of ocl increased and the photolysis of ocl rather than hocl formed o 3p eq 6 7 the inhibitory effect of k mcpp can be partly ascribed to the inhibited formation of o3 in the absence of do as mcpp is reactive toward o3 with k of 111 m 1s 1 whereas atz is not reactive toward o3 3 2 4 roles of reactive species by kinetics modeling with the help of the kinetic model the specific k by different reactive species and their relative contributions to atz and mcpp degradation can be distinguished as also shown in fig 2 o3 contributed to the degradation of mcpp but not to atz for mcpp degradation clo ho and o3 were the main species in the presence of do which accounted for 72 7 2 and 17 respectively to the overall k at ph 7 in the absence of do only the former two contributed to the overall k by 78 and 14 respectively the inhibited degradation of mcpp in the absence of do was ascribed to the inhibited formation of o3 and the decreased steady state concentration of clo for atz degradation ho was the main species for atz degradation with the contribution to the overall k of 65 at ph 7 note that co3 also contributed to the degradation of atz at ph 7 and 8 4 as the pk a of h2co3 hco3 is 6 4 and hco3 other than h2co3 reacts with ho and cl eqs 14 16 3 2 5 effects of radical scavengers the radical scavengers of tba and hco3 were used to distinguish the roles of different radicals in the degradation of atz and mcpp in the solar chlorine process fig s5 shows the effects of tba and hco3 co3 2 on the degradation of atz and mcpp in the process at ph 8 4 the degradation of atz and mcpp was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 50 mm tba tba reacts with ho cl o 3p and clo with rate constants of 6 0 108 m 1s 1 3 0 108 m 1s 1 3 8 107 m 1s 1 and 1 3 107 m 1s 1 respectively table s2 while the reaction rate constant of tba with cl2 is only 700 m 1s 1 kong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the inhibitory effect of tba on the degradation of atz and mcpp indicate that ho cl and clo played important roles in the degradation of atz and mcpp but cl2 did not however the presence of hco3 100 mm slightly inhibited the degradation of atz and mcpp with removal rates at 90 min decreasing from 27 7 to 21 9 for atz and from 70 2 to 60 3 for mcpp hco3 reacts with ho cl and cl2 to form co3 with second order rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reaction of hco3 with clo and o3 is negligible kong et al 2016 wu et al 2017 table s2 the rate constant for atz reacting with co3 has been reported to be 4 0 106 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 while that with mcpp was determined to be negligible table 1 and fig s1 thus the slight inhibitory effect of hco3 on atz degradation was probably due to the compensation of co3 while that for mcpp was due to the important roles of clo and o3 in mcpp degradation 3 3 toxicity changes 3 3 1 toxicity to arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis thaliana was used to investigate the changes in toxicity after herbicide degradation by the solar chlorine treatment mcpp showed a negligible effect on the growth of arabidopsis thaliana while atz inhibited its development via inhibiting chlorophyll formation the inhibitory effect increased with increasing atz concentration from 31 25 to 62 5 μm however the inhibition decreased with increasing solar chlorine treatment time and no inhibition was observed after 600 min of treatment when the removal of atz reached almost 100 fig 3 a fig s6 this result indicates that the intermediates products formed during atz degradation by solar chlorine treatment exhibited no inhibitory effects on the development of arabidopsis thaliana any rna changes were evaluated using rna screening it has been reported that atz can induce the p450 and p450 isozymes in zebrafish dong et al 2009 so genes related to p450 were selectively analyzed fig 3b the genes related to p450 were not expressed in the control sample without atz while they were appreciably enhanced in the presence of 62 5 μm atz interestingly genes related to p450 had decreased significantly in the solar chlorine treated samples for example the rna expression of at2g24180 at2g30750 and at4g39950 increased by 264 6508 and 187 respectively in the presence of 62 5 μm atz while they decreased by 46 7 97 2 and 57 0 respectively after 600 min of solar chlorine treatment this indicates that the presence of atz induces the stress response in arabidopsis thaliana at the level of rna expression while the intermediates products formed during atz s degradation in the solar chlorine process exhibited no genotoxicity to arabidopsis thaliana at the rna level 3 3 2 acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri the acute toxicity results with vibrio fischeri are shown in fig s7 no obvious acute toxicity of atz to vibrio fischeri in terms of inhibition was observed and it changed only slightly within the range of 4 8 8 6 during the degradation of atz by solar chlorine treatment the acute toxicity initially increased and then decreased with increasing treatment time however the acute toxicity of mcpp to vibrio fischeri was more obvious with 15 9 inhibition which initially increased to 22 7 and then decreased to 15 4 during solar chlorine treatment atz showed slight acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri and it changed only slightly during atz degradation by the solar chlorine process however it exhibited appreciable inhibition to arabidopsis thaliana the different toxicity results by using arabidopsis thaliana and vibrio fischeri indicated the necessary to use comprehensive bioassays such as specific and non specific measures to evaluate the influence of water treatment to the water quality jia et al 2015 3 4 proposed degradation pathways of atz and mcpp transformation intermediates products during the degradation of atz and mcpp by the solar chlorine were identified the proposed structures and m z are shown in table s4 eight intermediates were identified during the atz degradation and four intermediates were identified during mcpp degradation the evolution of their abundances is shown in fig 4 most of intermediates increased initially and then decreased with increasing treatment time the proposed degradation pathway of atz by the solar chlorine treatment is shown in fig 5 a the initial products p187 m z 188 p173 m z 174 and p145 m z 146 were formed via dealkylation of atz the intermediate p197 m z 198 was formed through the dechlorination and hydroxylation of atz the intermediate p229 m z 230 was formed with relatively high abundance via h abstraction from the product p231 m z 232 which was formed by the hydroxylation of atz other intermediates p155 m z 156 p231 m z 232 and p213 m z 214 were formed with relatively lower abundances the intermediate p155 m z 156 was formed via dealkylation of the p197 m z 198 intermediate the intermediate p213 m z 214 was formed via h abstraction from atz note that all of the intermediates formed during atz s solar chlorine degradation have also been identified in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes except that intermediates p231 m z 232 and p229 m z 230 were not identified in the uv chlorine process the proposed degradation pathway of mcpp by the solar chlorine process is shown in fig 5b the product p171 m z 170 was formed via attack at the carboxyl site and on alkane groups the intermediate p158 m z 157 was formed via attack at the c o bond of the tertiary carbon of mcpp s propanoic moiety and the hydroxylation of aromatics while the intermediate p155 m z 154 was formed via h abstraction from the intermediate p158 m z 157 the subsequent cleavage of the product p171 m z 170 moiety formed the intermediate p127 m z 126 interestingly no intermediate with chlorine substitution was identified in the degradation of either atz or mcpp this is consistent with the previously published observations that no chlorine containing intermediate was identified during the uv chlorine or solar chlorine degradation of atz or carbamazepine kong et al 2016 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2016 however some chlorine containing products have been identified during the uv chlorine degradation of ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 gemfibrozil kong et al 2018 and iohexol wang et al 2016c the transformation products of mcpp indicate that hydroxylation or h abstraction was involved rather than chlorine addition 3 5 factors affecting the degradation of herbicides in the solar chlorine process 3 5 1 chlorine dosage the k s for both atz and mcpp degradation increased with increasing chlorine dosage figs s8 and 6 as chlorine dosage increased from 50 to 200 μm k of mcpp linearly increased from 1 50 10 4 s 1 to 4 47 10 4 s 1 r 2 0 94 while that of atz slightly increased from 5 87 10 5 s 1 to 7 56 10 5 s 1 the k ho values of atz and mcpp were not affected by chlorine dosage fig 6 which is similar to the observations with the uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 this is likely due to the increased formation of ho as well as its increased consumption by chlorine eqs 12 and 13 other reactive species other than ho primarily contributed to the degradation of both atz and mcpp at ph 7 which increased with increasing chlorine dosage and accounted for 75 86 and 95 98 respectively to the overall k of atz and mcpp respectively the linearly increasing k of mcpp could be ascribed to roles of clo and o3 in its degradation as discussed in 3 2 4 by using modeling fig 6 for mcpp degradation k clo increased by 440 with chlorine dosage rose from 50 to 200 μm due to the reaction of chlorine with ho and cl eqs 12 15 guo et al 2018 which occupied 54 87 of the overall k the contribution of ho changed slightly as for atz degradation ho took the major role which was slightly affected by chlorine dosage 3 5 2 ph the k values of both atz and mcpp decreased with increasing ph in the presence or absence of do fig 2 and fig s9 in the presence of do k of atz decreased from 1 26 10 4 s 1 to 5 78 10 5 s 1 and that of mcpp from 2 99 10 4 s 1 to 2 08 10 4 s 1 as the ph increased from 5 0 to 8 4 the k and k ho of atz decreased by 54 1 and 91 3 with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 4 ho contributed 68 2 to the k of atz at ph 5 0 and 12 9 at 8 4 similarly the k and k ho of mcpp decreased by 30 4 and 82 3 respectively with increasing ph and ho contributed 9 1 and 2 3 to mcpp s k in the absence of do the k and k ho values of atz and mcpp showed trends similar to those when do was present the k values of atz and mcpp decreased by 91 1 and 87 6 respectively while the k ho values decreased by 90 0 and 90 6 respectively as the ph increased from 5 0 to 8 4 in the absence of do the relative contributions of different reactive species to atz and mcpp are shown in fig 2 the decreased k ho values of atz and mcpp with increasing ph can be ascribed to the decreased ho concentration due to the relatively higher consumption of ho by ocl than that by hocl eqs 8 and 9 this is consistent with the observations of previous studies of the solar chlorine process the concentration of ho decreased by 61 1 as the ph increased from 6 0 to 8 4 at 1 mg l chlorine dosage hua et al 2019 also bulman et al 2019 found that the steady state concentrations of ho and cl decreased while the generation of o3 increased with increasing ph during chlorine photolysis the modeling result fig 2 showed that the specific k s of ho and clo to atz and mcpp degradation decreased with increasing ph from 5 to 8 4 while those of o3 and co3 increased at ph 8 4 the relative contributions of o3 and clo to mcpp degradation accounted for 64 and 32 respectively the increased formation of o3 and co3 with increasing ph partly compensates for the decreased contribution of ho to the k of atz and those of ho and clo to the k of mcpp this led to the slight decrease in the k s of atz and mcpp in the presence of do compared to that in its absence 3 5 3 effect of water composition fig 7 shows the degradation of atz and mcpp by the solar chlorine process in the presence of nom and common anions cl br and hco3 at ph 7 0 the k values of atz and mcpp were inhibited by 1 mg l nom or 1 mm hco3 but were enhanced in the presence of 5 μm br the presence of cl showed a negligible effect on the degradation of atz and mcpp the k values of atz decreased from 7 68 10 5 s 1 to 6 0 10 5 s 1 and those of mcpp decreased from 2 69 10 5 s 1 to 1 91 10 5 s 1 in the presence of 1 mg l of nom the inhibition of atz and mcpp degradation can be ascribed to the scavenging effect of nom on the reactive species the reaction rate constants of nom with clo ho and cl have been reported as 4 5 104 mg l s 1 2 5 104 mg l s 1 and 1 3 104 mg l s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 the presence of nom decreases the concentrations of these radicals that are responsible for atz and mcpp degradation to different extents also nom consumes o3 ikehata et al 2008 k atz and k mcpp decreased from 7 7 10 5 s 1 to 7 5 10 5 s 1 and from 2 7 10 4 s 1 to 2 4 10 4 s 1 respectively in the presence of 1 mm hco3 while k ho decreased by 42 and 46 respectively hco3 reacts with cl cl2 and ho to form co3 eqs 16 18 table 2 fang et al 2014 which decreased ho and cl available for atz and mcpp degradation co3 reacts with atz with a rate constant of 4 0 106 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 while with mcpp however the rate is negligible table 1 the lower rate constants of co3 with atz and mcpp than those of ho and cl results in an inhibitory effect of hco3 on atz and mcpp degradation br can react with hocl to form bromine with the reaction rate constant of 1 55 103 m 1s 1 lyon et al 2012 and the concentration of free chlorine decreased by 5 in the presence of 5 μm br then rbs such as br br2 and brcl were generated via the bromine photolysis and the reaction of bromide with ho and rcs heeb et al 2013 guo et al 2018 rbs are reported to be reactive with electron rich compounds such as phenolic aniline and olefinic compounds zhang and parker 2018 note that bromine is not reactive with atz and mcpp fig s10 thus the enhanced degradation of atz and mcpp in the presence of br could be ascribed to the oxidation of atz and mcpp by rbs 3 6 atz and mcpp degradation by real solar chlorine treatment in different waters to further evaluate the potential applicability of solar chlorine treatment the degradation of atz and mcpp was evaluated in real water by real sunlight fig 8 the degradation of atz and mcpp in pure water was much faster with 99 4 of the mcpp and 37 6 of the atz removed within 30 min the removal rates decreased in filtered drinking water and wastewater secondary effluent 96 9 of the mcpp was transformed within 30 min of treatment in filtered drinking water and 80 4 was transformed in the secondary effluent the removal rate of atz decreased from 62 8 over 90 min in pure water to 28 8 in the filtered drinking water and to 18 1 in the wastewater effluent the negligible degradation of atz and mcpp by solar chlorine in the wastewater effluent after 60 min can be ascribed to the undetectable residual total chlorine after that the doc concentrations were 1 18 mg l in the filtered drinking water and 2 36 mg l in the wastewater effluent which could consume chlorine and react with radicals as discussed in section 3 5 3 also the accompanying alkalinity also inhibited their degradation meanwhile the relatively low concentration of br 0 9 μm tab s1 had only a slight effect on atz and mcpp degradation in addition the ammonium concentrations in the drinking water and wastewater were 0 002 mg l and 0 71 mg l respectively shown in table s1 ammonium can react with chlorine to form chloramine and around 50 of chlorine 50 μm was rapidly converted to monochloramine in wastewater effluent wu et al 2017 ho cl cl2 and reactive nitrogen species can be formed during monochloramine photolysis li et al 2009 wu et al 2019 as such the effect of ammonia on the solar chlorine process is expected to be very complicated and should be investigated in the future it should be noted that the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo formed in the real solar chlorine system were determined to be 18 9 20 1 and 6 5 times higher than those formed in the simulated solar chlorine system hua et al 2019 this indicates that solar chlorine treatment had great potential in the practical removal of micropollutants under real sunlight 4 conclusions and engineering implications atz and mcpp can be removed efficiently by the solar chlorine process ho is the primary reactive specie that contribute to the degradation of atz while ho clo and o3 are important for the degradation of mcpp the second order rate constants of cl reacting with atz and mcpp were determined to be 6 87 109 m 1s 1 and 1 08 1010 m 1s 1 while those of clo were lower than 106 m 1s 1 and 1 11 108 m 1s 1 respectively the presence of atz inhibits the development of arabidopsis thaliana but the inhibitory effect decreases after the degradation of atz by the solar chlorine process moreover atz induces the expression of rna especially genes related to p450 but that is significantly decreased after solar chlorine treatment this indicates that the process is an effective detoxification technology for some herbicides hydroxylation hydrogen abstraction and dechlorination rather than chlorine addition or substitution happen during atz and mcpp degradation the k of atz increases slowly with the increasing chlorine dosage due to the relatively stable concentrations of ho and cl and the negligible contribution of o3 but it decreases with increasing ph because of the decreased ho and cl concentrations however the k of mcpp increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage due to the increased concentration of clo and its high reactivity with mcpp while it decreased slightly with increasing ph because of the increased formation of clo and o3 but less ho and cl solar chlorine treatment worked better in natural sunlight than in the simulated solar chlorine process atz s decreased toxicity to arabidopsis thaliana after degradation in the solar chlorine process indicates that the process effectively transforms and detoxifies the herbicide toxicity of atz while the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri slightly changed indicating the necessary to use comprehensive bioassays such as specific and non specific measures to evaluate the effect of water treatment to water quality both atz and mcpp can be transformed by dosing with free chlorine under solar irradiation in different water streams of practical interest this result combined with the decreased toxicity of atz intermediates formed in solar chlorine treatment indicates that such treatment can be a good alternative for the detoxification of some herbicides at low cost declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17948,the solar chlorine process is an energy efficient advanced oxidation process that can produce reactive species such as hydroxyl radical reactive chlorine species and ozone this study investigated the process ability to detoxify the typical herbicides atrazine and mecoprop methylchlorophenoxypropionic acid both herbicides are resistant to direct solar photolysis or chlorination alone but they can be degraded by the solar chlorine process effectively atrazine inhibited the development of arabidopsis thaliana but such inhibition was negligible after solar chlorine treatment of an atrazine solution the transformation of atrazine in the process was shown to be through hydroxylation hydrogen abstraction and dechlorination but did not involve chlorine substitution or addition cl reacts with atrazine and mecoprop with rate constants of 6 87 109 m 1s 1 and 1 08 1010 m 1s 1 respectively while clo reacts with mecoprop with a rate constant of 1 11 108 m 1s 1 the degradation kinetics of atrazine and mecoprop by solar chlorine was simulated by modeling which fitted the experimental results well hydroxyl radicals ho mainly contributed to the degradation of atrazine by solar chlorine at ph 7 with the contribution of 65 whereas clo and o3 were main species responsible for the degradation of mecoprop with the contribution of 72 and 17 respectively the pseudo first order rate constants k s of the two degradations increased substantially by 28 8 for atrazine and by 198 for mecoprop when the chlorine dosage was increased from 50 μm to 200 μm the k s decreased with increasing ph the presence of natural organic matter inhibited the degradation of both herbicides while the presence of bromide enhanced their degradation this work reveals a feasible method for the

contamination and they are frequently detected in ground water and surface water where they may be toxic to some plants and animals craddock et al 2019 khan et al 2015 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 mcpp has been widely used for weeds control till now while atz had been used in the past for a long time and they are quite recalcitrant to traditional water treatment bianchi et al 2006 rodriguez et al 2011 atz can act as an endocrine disruptor and has carcinogenic effects even at relatively low concentration which poses a great risk to human health almeida et al 2019 rebecca 2002 the european union has set standards and ruled that the maximum concentration in drinking water for one herbicide is 0 1 μg l while the sum of all herbicides is 0 5 μg l the maximum concentration of atz allowed in the u s a is 3 μg l based on toxicological evidence juan et al 2000 therefore efficient techniques that can eliminate these resistant herbicides should be investigated uv based aops have been investigated for the degradation of herbicides uv h2o2 can effectively degrade mcpp with rate constant between mcpp and ho of 1 1 109 m 1s 1 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 additionally the uv persulfate and uv peroxymonosulfate aops have been reported to be effective for atz abatement khan et al 2014 lutze et al 2015 recently the uv chlorine process has also been demonstrated to be efficient for atz degradation kong et al 2016 however the high energy requirement of uv irradiation increases the operating cost of uv based aops the electrical energy per order ee o of uv light accounts for more than 90 of the total ee o of the uv h2o2 process and between 10 and 90 for the uv chlorine process in the degradation of a variety of micropollutants guo et al 2018 solar irradiation is a cost effective energy and the solar chlorine process has been investigated for micropollutant degradation and disinfection for example the solar chlorine process has been shown to be efficient for the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts which were resistant to either solar irradiation or chlorination alone forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 solar chlorine treatment has additionally been shown to be efficient for the abatement of a variety of pharmaceuticals such as caffeine carbamazepine and gemfibrozil hua et al 2019 sun et al 2016a b yang et al 2016 ho cl and o3 are generated during chlorine photolysis at irradiation wavelength 200 400 nm bulman et al 2019 of them ho and o3 are regarded as the primary reactive species in the disinfection forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 ho o3 as well as rcs are reported to be responsible for the degradation of ppcps hua et al 2019 however the roles of specific reactive species in the degradation of herbicides remains unknown oxidation s ability to alter toxicity during pollutant transformation is an important issue although phenol can be effectively degraded by uv h2o2 treatment the transformation products such as α β unsaturated enedials and oxoenals are more toxic in reacting with proteins than phenol itself prasse et al 2018 the decarboxylated intermediates formed in uv h2o2 treatment were demonstrated to be more toxic to luminescent bacteria than parent pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole diclofenac and ibuprofen wang et al 2018 the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri increased after the uv photolysis of gemfibrozil while it decreased after clo oxidation kong et al 2018 in addition the toxicity evolution is to a large extent a function of how much oxidation is applied which depends on the transformation products evolution for example the acute toxicity of mixture chemicals to daphnia magna increased firstly by uv h2o2 treatment and decreased when the uv fluence was higher than 300 mj cm2 rozas et al 2016 acute toxicity is easily used in assessing toxicity changes but it is not suitable for evaluating the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of micropollutants rizzo 2011 arabidopsis thaliana is a model plant which has been used for the analysis of the chronic toxicity of cuo nanoparticles and polychlorinated biphenyls subramanian et al 2017 wang et al 2016b the p450 family of genes which code for the terminal oxidase in the electron transfer chains have been widely used as bio markers for some herbicides and have played an important role in the response to environmental contaminants björklund and skagerberg 2006 dong et al 2009 fatima and masood 2006 kuiper et al 2008 the toxicity of herbicides to plants and the genetic changes involved need more comprehensive investigation this study was therefore designed to achieve the following objectives 1 to investigate the degradation kinetics of atz and mcpp by solar chlorine process and identify the reactive species involved 2 to investigate the changes in toxicity to vibrio fischeri and arabidopsis thaliana in solar chlorine treatment and the transformation pathways involved 3 to investigate the factors affecting the degradation of mcpp and atz by the solar chlorine process and 4 to test the applicability of the solar chlorine process to natural waters 2 materials and

obtained from fisher scientific srnom was obtained from the international humic substances society dissolved in pure water and filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filtered drinking water and wastewater secondary effluent were obtained from a drinking water treatment plant and a wastewater treatment plant in guangdong china they were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and stored at 4 c table s1 2 2 experimental procedure the solar chlorine experiments were conducted in a quartz container 250 ml with magnetic stirring and the surface of the reactor was illuminated with simulated sunlight crowntech sun simulator s0l30023a a test solution 250 ml containing 5 μm atz or mcpp and 1 μm nb was added to naocl stock solution to attain a desired concentration and simultaneously exposed to the simulated solar irradiation the ph 5 7 or 8 4 was maintained using 2 mm phosphate buffer samples were collected at pre determined time and quenched using ascorbic acid at a 2 1 m ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine similar tests were conducted by adding certain concentrations of nom nahco3 cl or br into the solution to investigate the effects of the water s composition on the degradation of atz or mcpp radical scavenging tests were carried out with the addition of 100 mm nahco3 or 50 mm tba all of the tests were conducted at least duplicate the error bars in all of the data plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data from the duplicated tests for toxicity analysis and intermediates identification the tests was conducted in the same manner a 500 ml sample was collected at the predetermined time and simultaneously quenched by na2s2o3 which was then concentrated to 50 ml by spe using hlb cartridges 200 mg 6 ml cnw technologies arabidopsis thaliana treated by

environmental technologies co ltd and a lumistox toxicity analyzer hach usa according to the method previously reported wu et al 2016 briefly 75 μl osmotic pressure adjusting solution was added into 675 μl sample and then 250 μl resuscitated bacterial solution was added to each sample samples were mixed and measured after 15 min note that methanol used in sample concentration for toxicity analysis was blown away and diluted in phosphate buffer 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of the chlorine stock solution was periodically determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the concentrations of atz and mcpp were analyzed using hplc agilent 1260 usa atz and mcpp were analyzed with different ratios of pure water and methanol at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and were detected at 222 and 230 nm respectively the transformation intermediates products of the two herbicides were identified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography in tandem with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and those for atz and mcpp were identified in positive esi and negative esi mode respectively the doc content was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu to quantitatively describe the role of ho nb was used as a probe to calculate the steady state concentration as it selectively only reacts with ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 hoigné 1983 the calculation of the relative contributions of the reactive species to the removal of atz or mcpp followed the methods described by xiang et al 2016 2 4 kinetic modeling the kinetic model contained 112 reactions table s3 and was simulated with kintecus v4 55 ianni 2015 using k obtained from the literatures bulman et al 2019 guo et al 2018 or estimated based on data fitting function of kintecus v4 55 the photolysis of chlorine follows eqs s 1 4 in table s3 the rate constants of chlorine photolysis was determined by experiment and the specific rate constants of eqs s 1 4 was determined by data fitting 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of atz and mcpp fig 1 shows the experimental and modeling kinetics of atz and mcpp degradation by solar chlorination and solar chlorine treatment in pure water at ph 7 0 atz and mcpp were resistant to chlorination and solar photolysis whereas the removal rates of mcpp and atz were approximately 80 and 30 respectively within 90 min when solar chlorine treatment was applied the degradation of atz and mcpp in the solar chlorine process both followed pseudo first order kinetics the rate constant k for atz was determined to be 7 68 10 5 s 1 and that for mcpp was 2 69 10 4 s 1 which fits well with the modeling result the degradation can be attributed to reactive species such as ho rcs and o3 hua et al 2019 the reaction rate of ho with atz was reported to be 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 and that of mcpp was 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 their corresponding rates with o3 were 6 3 m 1s 1 and 111 m 1s 1 respectively beltrán et al 1993 table 1 however the reactivity of rcs with atz and mcpp remain unknown 3 2 roles of reactive species in the degradation of atz and mcpp by solar chlorine the second order rate constants of clo and cl with atz and mcpp were determined then the contribution of different reactive species to atz and mcpp degradation were further calculated 3 2 1 second order rate constants of clo and cl the second order rate constants of clo reacting with atz and mcpp were investigated through competition kinetics using 5 μm dmob as a reference compound dmob was used to determine the steady state concentration of clo in the system for dmob can react with clo at 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1987 hua et al 2019 to create a scenario for clo the uv chlorine process was spiked with 100 mm hco3 to scavenge ho cl and cl2 but not clo note that co3 was involved in this system and thus mdz 5 μm was used as the probe for co3 k 4 106 m 1s 1 to determine the co3 concentration wu et al 2017 the rate constant of atz with co3 was 4 0 106 m 1s 1 table 1 while that of mcpp with co3 was negligible as the degradation of mcpp by uv h2o2 hco3 process with 50 μm h2o2 and 100 mm nahco3 at ph 8 4 was similar to that by uv irradiation alone fig s1 the competition kinetics of dmob and atz or mcpp are shown in fig s2 and the second order rate constants for clo reacting with atz or mcpp were calculated according to eqs 1 3 1 k m d z k mdz uv k mdz co 3 co 3 ss 2 k d m o b k dmob uv k dmob clo clo ss 3 k atz mcpp clo k atz mcpp k atz mcpp uv k atz mcpp co 3 co 3 s s

rate constants for cl reacting with atz and mcpp were investigated through competition kinetics using nb ba and dmob as reference compounds in the uv chlorine process with 100 μm chlorine and 1 μm atz or mcpp at ph 7 0 shown in fig s3 the steady state concentration of cl was calculated according to eqs 4 and 5 and the rate constants of cl with atz and mcpp were calculated according to eqs 4 7 4 k n

the second order rate constant of atz or mcpp with cl 3 2 2 the roles of clo and cl clo and cl are reported to be the primary rcs in the solar chlorine process hua et al 2019 the second order rate constant for clo with mcpp was determined to be 1 11 108 m 1 s 1 but that with atz was lower than 106 m 1 s 1 table 1 and fig s2 the second order rate constants of cl reacting with atz and mcpp were determined to be 6 87 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 08 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively both of which are much higher than those of ho k atz ho 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 k mcpp ho 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 table 1 the concentrations of ho cl and clo were determined to be 5 62 10 15 m 4 31 10 16 m and 9 28 10 13 m respectively in the solar chlorine process with 100 μm chlorine dosage and at ph 7 0 fig s4 the contributions of the different reactive species to the degradation of atz and mcpp were calculated which depended on the second order rate constant and the concentration of the specific radical the contribution of clo to the degradation of mcpp was 16 7 times that of ho and 22 1 times that of cl as for atz the contribution of ho to atz degradation was 5 69 times that of cl ho is the primary reactive specie for atz degradation while both clo and ho contribute to the degradation of mcpp under the experimental conditions studied 3 2 3 the roles of o3 the photolysis of clo generates o 3p which reacts with do to form o3 eq 8 9 table 2 zhou et al 2014 the role of o3 in the degradation of atz and mcpp by the solar chlorine process was investigated after purging nitrogen for at least 30 min to avoid the formation of o3 the k and k ho of atz and mcpp in the presence or absence of do were investigated at ph ranging from 5 0 to 8 4 fig 2 the degradation of both atz and mcpp was inhibited without do at any ph except for atz at ph 5 0 and the degree of inhibition increased with increasing ph the k of atz decreased by 37 1 at ph 7 0 and by 80 4 at 8 4 without do similarly the k of mcpp decreased by 9 4 at ph 5 0 25 7 at 7 0 and by 83 8 at 8 4 note that the k ho of atz and mcpp also decreased by 18 47 in the absence of do which indicated that ho was partially generated from o3 decay von gunten 2003 the formation of o3 increased with increasing ph as the proportion of ocl increased and the photolysis of ocl rather than hocl formed o 3p eq 6 7 the inhibitory effect of k mcpp can be partly ascribed to the inhibited formation of o3 in the absence of do as mcpp is reactive toward o3 with k of 111 m 1s 1 whereas atz is not reactive toward o3 3 2 4 roles of reactive species by kinetics modeling with the help of the kinetic model the specific k by different reactive species and their relative contributions to atz and mcpp degradation can be distinguished as also shown in fig 2 o3 contributed to the degradation of mcpp but not to atz for mcpp degradation clo ho and o3 were the main species in the presence of do which accounted for 72 7 2 and 17 respectively to the overall k at ph 7 in the absence of do only the former two contributed to the overall k by 78 and 14 respectively the inhibited degradation of mcpp in the absence of do was ascribed to the inhibited formation of o3 and the decreased steady state concentration of clo for atz degradation ho was the main species for atz degradation with the contribution to the overall k of 65 at ph 7 note that co3 also contributed to the degradation of atz at ph 7 and 8 4 as the pk a of h2co3 hco3 is 6 4 and hco3 other than h2co3 reacts with ho and cl eqs 14 16 3 2 5 effects of radical scavengers the radical scavengers of tba and hco3 were used to distinguish the roles of different radicals in the degradation of atz and mcpp in the solar chlorine process fig s5 shows the effects of tba and hco3 co3 2 on the degradation of atz and mcpp in the process at ph 8 4 the degradation of atz and mcpp was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 50 mm tba tba reacts with ho cl o 3p and clo with rate constants of 6 0 108 m 1s 1 3 0 108 m 1s 1 3 8 107 m 1s 1 and 1 3 107 m 1s 1 respectively table s2 while the reaction rate constant of tba with cl2 is only 700 m 1s 1 kong et al 2016 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the inhibitory effect of tba on the degradation of atz and mcpp indicate that ho cl and clo played important roles in the degradation of atz and mcpp but cl2 did not however the presence of hco3 100 mm slightly inhibited the degradation of atz and mcpp with removal rates at 90 min decreasing from 27 7 to 21 9 for atz and from 70 2 to 60 3 for mcpp hco3 reacts with ho cl and cl2 to form co3 with second order rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reaction of hco3 with clo and o3 is negligible kong et al 2016 wu et al 2017 table s2 the rate constant for atz reacting with co3 has been reported to be 4 0 106 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 while that with mcpp was determined to be negligible table 1 and fig s1 thus the slight inhibitory effect of hco3 on atz degradation was probably due to the compensation of co3 while that for mcpp was due to the important roles of clo and o3 in mcpp degradation 3 3 toxicity changes 3 3 1 toxicity to arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis thaliana was used to investigate the changes in toxicity after herbicide degradation by the solar chlorine treatment mcpp showed a negligible effect on the growth of arabidopsis thaliana while atz inhibited its development via inhibiting chlorophyll formation the inhibitory effect increased with increasing atz concentration from 31 25 to 62 5 μm however the inhibition decreased with increasing solar chlorine treatment time and no inhibition was observed after 600 min of treatment when the removal of atz reached almost 100 fig 3 a fig s6 this result indicates that the intermediates products formed during atz degradation by solar chlorine treatment exhibited no inhibitory effects on the development of arabidopsis thaliana any rna changes were evaluated using rna screening it has been reported that atz can induce the p450 and p450 isozymes in zebrafish dong et al 2009 so genes related to p450 were selectively analyzed fig 3b the genes related to p450 were not expressed in the control sample without atz while they were appreciably enhanced in the presence of 62 5 μm atz interestingly genes related to p450 had decreased significantly in the solar chlorine treated samples for example the rna expression of at2g24180 at2g30750 and at4g39950 increased by 264 6508 and 187 respectively in the presence of 62 5 μm atz while they decreased by 46 7 97 2 and 57 0 respectively after 600 min of solar chlorine treatment this indicates that the presence of atz induces the stress response in arabidopsis thaliana at the level of rna expression while the intermediates products formed during atz s degradation in the solar chlorine process exhibited no genotoxicity to arabidopsis thaliana at the rna level 3 3 2 acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri the acute toxicity results with vibrio fischeri are shown in fig s7 no obvious acute toxicity of atz to vibrio fischeri in terms of inhibition was observed and it changed only slightly within the range of 4 8 8 6 during the degradation of atz by solar chlorine treatment the acute toxicity initially increased and then decreased with increasing treatment time however the acute toxicity of mcpp to vibrio fischeri was more obvious with 15 9 inhibition which initially increased to 22 7 and then decreased to 15 4 during solar chlorine treatment atz showed slight acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri and it changed only slightly during atz degradation by the solar chlorine process however it exhibited appreciable inhibition to arabidopsis thaliana the different toxicity results by using arabidopsis thaliana and vibrio fischeri indicated the necessary to use comprehensive bioassays such as specific and non specific measures to evaluate the influence of water treatment to the water quality jia et al 2015 3 4 proposed degradation pathways of atz and mcpp transformation intermediates products during the degradation of atz and mcpp by the solar chlorine were identified the proposed structures and m z are shown in table s4 eight intermediates were identified during the atz degradation and four intermediates were identified during mcpp degradation the evolution of their abundances is shown in fig 4 most of intermediates increased initially and then decreased with increasing treatment time the proposed degradation pathway of atz by the solar chlorine treatment is shown in fig 5 a the initial products p187 m z 188 p173 m z 174 and p145 m z 146 were formed via dealkylation of atz the intermediate p197 m z 198 was formed through the dechlorination and hydroxylation of atz the intermediate p229 m z 230 was formed with relatively high abundance via h abstraction from the product p231 m z 232 which was formed by the hydroxylation of atz other intermediates p155 m z 156 p231 m z 232 and p213 m z 214 were formed with relatively lower abundances the intermediate p155 m z 156 was formed via dealkylation of the p197 m z 198 intermediate the intermediate p213 m z 214 was formed via h abstraction from atz note that all of the intermediates formed during atz s solar chlorine degradation have also been identified in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes except that intermediates p231 m z 232 and p229 m z 230 were not identified in the uv chlorine process the proposed degradation pathway of mcpp by the solar chlorine process is shown in fig 5b the product p171 m z 170 was formed via attack at the carboxyl site and on alkane groups the intermediate p158 m z 157 was formed via attack at the c o bond of the tertiary carbon of mcpp s propanoic moiety and the hydroxylation of aromatics while the intermediate p155 m z 154 was formed via h abstraction from the intermediate p158 m z 157 the subsequent cleavage of the product p171 m z 170 moiety formed the intermediate p127 m z 126 interestingly no intermediate with chlorine substitution was identified in the degradation of either atz or mcpp this is consistent with the previously published observations that no chlorine containing intermediate was identified during the uv chlorine or solar chlorine degradation of atz or carbamazepine kong et al 2016 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2016 however some chlorine containing products have been identified during the uv chlorine degradation of ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 gemfibrozil kong et al 2018 and iohexol wang et al 2016c the transformation products of mcpp indicate that hydroxylation or h abstraction was involved rather than chlorine addition 3 5 factors affecting the degradation of herbicides in the solar chlorine process 3 5 1 chlorine dosage the k s for both atz and mcpp degradation increased with increasing chlorine dosage figs s8 and 6 as chlorine dosage increased from 50 to 200 μm k of mcpp linearly increased from 1 50 10 4 s 1 to 4 47 10 4 s 1 r 2 0 94 while that of atz slightly increased from 5 87 10 5 s 1 to 7 56 10 5 s 1 the k ho values of atz and mcpp were not affected by chlorine dosage fig 6 which is similar to the observations with the uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 this is likely due to the increased formation of ho as well as its increased consumption by chlorine eqs 12 and 13 other reactive species other than ho primarily contributed to the degradation of both atz and mcpp at ph 7 which increased with increasing chlorine dosage and accounted for 75 86 and 95 98 respectively to the overall k of atz and mcpp respectively the linearly increasing k of mcpp could be ascribed to roles of clo and o3 in its degradation as discussed in 3 2 4 by using modeling fig 6 for mcpp degradation k clo increased by 440 with chlorine dosage rose from 50 to 200 μm due to the reaction of chlorine with ho and cl eqs 12 15 guo et al 2018 which occupied 54 87 of the overall k the contribution of ho changed slightly as for atz degradation ho took the major role which was slightly affected by chlorine dosage 3 5 2 ph the k values of both atz and mcpp decreased with increasing ph in the presence or absence of do fig 2 and fig s9 in the presence of do k of atz decreased from 1 26 10 4 s 1 to 5 78 10 5 s 1 and that of mcpp from 2 99 10 4 s 1 to 2 08 10 4 s 1 as the ph increased from 5 0 to 8 4 the k and k ho of atz decreased by 54 1 and 91 3 with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 4 ho contributed 68 2 to the k of atz at ph 5 0 and 12 9 at 8 4 similarly the k and k ho of mcpp decreased by 30 4 and 82 3 respectively with increasing ph and ho contributed 9 1 and 2 3 to mcpp s k in the absence of do the k and k ho values of atz and mcpp showed trends similar to those when do was present the k values of atz and mcpp decreased by 91 1 and 87 6 respectively while the k ho values decreased by 90 0 and 90 6 respectively as the ph increased from 5 0 to 8 4 in the absence of do the relative contributions of different reactive species to atz and mcpp are shown in fig 2 the decreased k ho values of atz and mcpp with increasing ph can be ascribed to the decreased ho concentration due to the relatively higher consumption of ho by ocl than that by hocl eqs 8 and 9 this is consistent with the observations of previous studies of the solar chlorine process the concentration of ho decreased by 61 1 as the ph increased from 6 0 to 8 4 at 1 mg l chlorine dosage hua et al 2019 also bulman et al 2019 found that the steady state concentrations of ho and cl decreased while the generation of o3 increased with increasing ph during chlorine photolysis the modeling result fig 2 showed that the specific k s of ho and clo to atz and mcpp degradation decreased with increasing ph from 5 to 8 4 while those of o3 and co3 increased at ph 8 4 the relative contributions of o3 and clo to mcpp degradation accounted for 64 and 32 respectively the increased formation of o3 and co3 with increasing ph partly compensates for the decreased contribution of ho to the k of atz and those of ho and clo to the k of mcpp this led to the slight decrease in the k s of atz and mcpp in the presence of do compared to that in its absence 3 5 3 effect of water composition fig 7 shows the degradation of atz and mcpp by the solar chlorine process in the presence of nom and common anions cl br and hco3 at ph 7 0 the k values of atz and mcpp were inhibited by 1 mg l nom or 1 mm hco3 but were enhanced in the presence of 5 μm br the presence of cl showed a negligible effect on the degradation of atz and mcpp the k values of atz decreased from 7 68 10 5 s 1 to 6 0 10 5 s 1 and those of mcpp decreased from 2 69 10 5 s 1 to 1 91 10 5 s 1 in the presence of 1 mg l of nom the inhibition of atz and mcpp degradation can be ascribed to the scavenging effect of nom on the reactive species the reaction rate constants of nom with clo ho and cl have been reported as 4 5 104 mg l s 1 2 5 104 mg l s 1 and 1 3 104 mg l s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 the presence of nom decreases the concentrations of these radicals that are responsible for atz and mcpp degradation to different extents also nom consumes o3 ikehata et al 2008 k atz and k mcpp decreased from 7 7 10 5 s 1 to 7 5 10 5 s 1 and from 2 7 10 4 s 1 to 2 4 10 4 s 1 respectively in the presence of 1 mm hco3 while k ho decreased by 42 and 46 respectively hco3 reacts with cl cl2 and ho to form co3 eqs 16 18 table 2 fang et al 2014 which decreased ho and cl available for atz and mcpp degradation co3 reacts with atz with a rate constant of 4 0 106 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 while with mcpp however the rate is negligible table 1 the lower rate constants of co3 with atz and mcpp than those of ho and cl results in an inhibitory effect of hco3 on atz and mcpp degradation br can react with hocl to form bromine with the reaction rate constant of 1 55 103 m 1s 1 lyon et al 2012 and the concentration of free chlorine decreased by 5 in the presence of 5 μm br then rbs such as br br2 and brcl were generated via the bromine photolysis and the reaction of bromide with ho and rcs heeb et al 2013 guo et al 2018 rbs are reported to be reactive with electron rich compounds such as phenolic aniline and olefinic compounds zhang and parker 2018 note that bromine is not reactive with atz and mcpp fig s10 thus the enhanced degradation of atz and mcpp in the presence of br could be ascribed to the oxidation of atz and mcpp by rbs 3 6 atz and mcpp degradation by real solar chlorine treatment in different waters to further evaluate the potential applicability of solar chlorine treatment the degradation of atz and mcpp was evaluated in real water by real sunlight fig 8 the degradation of atz and mcpp in pure water was much faster with 99 4 of the mcpp and 37 6 of the atz removed within 30 min the removal rates decreased in filtered drinking water and wastewater secondary effluent 96 9 of the mcpp was transformed within 30 min of treatment in filtered drinking water and 80 4 was transformed in the secondary effluent the removal rate of atz decreased from 62 8 over 90 min in pure water to 28 8 in the filtered drinking water and to 18 1 in the wastewater effluent the negligible degradation of atz and mcpp by solar chlorine in the wastewater effluent after 60 min can be ascribed to the undetectable residual total chlorine after that the doc concentrations were 1 18 mg l in the filtered drinking water and 2 36 mg l in the wastewater effluent which could consume chlorine and react with radicals as discussed in section 3 5 3 also the accompanying alkalinity also inhibited their degradation meanwhile the relatively low concentration of br 0 9 μm tab s1 had only a slight effect on atz and mcpp degradation in addition the ammonium concentrations in the drinking water and wastewater were 0 002 mg l and 0 71 mg l respectively shown in table s1 ammonium can react with chlorine to form chloramine and around 50 of chlorine 50 μm was rapidly converted to monochloramine in wastewater effluent wu et al 2017 ho cl cl2 and reactive nitrogen species can be formed during monochloramine photolysis li et al 2009 wu et al 2019 as such the effect of ammonia on the solar chlorine process is expected to be very complicated and should be investigated in the future it should be noted that the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo formed in the real solar chlorine system were determined to be 18 9 20 1 and 6 5 times higher than those formed in the simulated solar chlorine system hua et al 2019 this indicates that solar chlorine treatment had great potential in the practical removal of micropollutants under real sunlight 4 conclusions and engineering implications atz and mcpp can be removed efficiently by the solar chlorine process ho is the primary reactive specie that contribute to the degradation of atz while ho clo and o3 are important for the degradation of mcpp the second order rate constants of cl reacting with atz and mcpp were determined to be 6 87 109 m 1s 1 and 1 08 1010 m 1s 1 while those of clo were lower than 106 m 1s 1 and 1 11 108 m 1s 1 respectively the presence of atz inhibits the development of arabidopsis thaliana but the inhibitory effect decreases after the degradation of atz by the solar chlorine process moreover atz induces the expression of rna especially genes related to p450 but that is significantly decreased after solar chlorine treatment this indicates that the process is an effective detoxification technology for some herbicides hydroxylation hydrogen abstraction and dechlorination rather than chlorine addition or substitution happen during atz and mcpp degradation the k of atz increases slowly with the increasing chlorine dosage due to the relatively stable concentrations of ho and cl and the negligible contribution of o3 but it decreases with increasing ph because of the decreased ho and cl concentrations however the k of mcpp increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage due to the increased concentration of clo and its high reactivity with mcpp while it decreased slightly with increasing ph because of the increased formation of clo and o3 but less ho and cl solar chlorine treatment worked better in natural sunlight than in the simulated solar chlorine process atz s decreased toxicity to arabidopsis thaliana after degradation in the solar chlorine process indicates that the process effectively transforms and detoxifies the herbicide toxicity of atz while the acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri slightly changed indicating the necessary to use comprehensive bioassays such as specific and non specific measures to evaluate the effect of water treatment to water quality both atz and mcpp can be transformed by dosing with free chlorine under solar irradiation in different water streams of practical interest this result combined with the decreased toxicity of atz intermediates formed in solar chlorine treatment indicates that such treatment can be a good alternative for the detoxification of some herbicides at low cost declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17949,bioelectrochemical systems bess are widely investigated as a promising technology to recover bioenergy or synthesize value added products from wastewaters the performance of bes depends on the activity of electroactive biofilm eab as the core of bes it is still unclear how the eab is formed from mixed inoculum and how exoelectrogens compete with non exoelectrogens here we confirmed that microbial community composition and the morphology of eab on the electrode including the thickness and porosity of the biofilm are critical for the performance of bes and these properties can be simply controlled by the substrate concentration during eab formation the eab formed with 0 1 g l of acetate eab 0 1 exhibited a 90 higher current density than that formed with 1 0 g l acetate eab 1 0 eab 0 1 had a 50 higher electroactivity per biomass and a 20 thinner thickness than eab 1 0 which was partly due to the 54 decrease of insulative polysaccharide in biofilm limited acetate also imposed a selective pressure to enrich geobacter up to 88 compared to 72 when acetate was abundant our findings demonstrate that a highly active eab can be formed by limiting substrate concentration providing a broader understanding of the eab formation process the ecology of interspecies competitions and potential applications for bioenergy recovery and trace toxicant detection in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical systems substrate limitation electroactivity extracellular cytochromes microbial community 1 introduction exoelectrogens widely distributed in water sediment and soil have attracted global concerns because of their unique ability of direct extracellular electron transfer eet malvankar and lovley 2012 exoelectrogens interact with other microorganisms proactively to form a complex electroactive biofilm eab which is regarded as the core in bioelectrochemical system bes for efficient anaerobic digestion jin et al 2017 desalination zhou et al 2019 bio hydrogen production sun et al 2008 nutrient conversion li et al 2020 wan et al 2020 and environmental pollution detection li et al 2018 recently bes has been demonstrated as an efficient wastewater treatment technology at cubic meter scale fed with domestic wastewater cheng et al 2014 feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 the effluent met the grade a standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant in china but the energy consumption was only 12 of activated sludge process he et al 2016 the energy saved here was partly from the self produced electricity by eab where the biofilm structure and component were essential to its performance roden et al 2010 exoelectrogens can be selectively acclimated up to 75 from 5 wastewater in 3 7 d upon feeding with acetate and produce 4 5 a m2 proceeding an interspecific electron transfer with non exoelectrogens to cope with metabolic electron imbalance and electron acceptor restriction kumar et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 however the over growth of non exoelectrogens with a large proportion will limit the biofilm electroactivity via the carbon source competition decrease of biofilm conductivity and other reasons kinetic analysis have shown that it can produce more than 10 a m2 in bess torres et al 2010 selectively increase of the population of exoelectrogens such as the addition of subminimal inhibitory concentration of tobramycin was proved to substantially enhance current density of bes indicating that the optimization of microbial composition was efficient to enhance the electroactivity of eab besides microorganisms the extracellular polymeric substance eps mainly consisted of polysaccharides and proteins is another important factor affecting electron transfer in eab xiao et al 2017 eps assisted in eab formation polysaccharides and intercellular electron transfer cytochromes protecting the microorganisms from unfavorable environment marshall et al 2006 sheng et al 2010 it was reported that the mixed eab reached a thickness of 37 87 μm in acetate fed systems after 30 days which was 4 1 9 7 times thicker than the monolayer cells du et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 therefore the distant bio electron transfer towards the anode closely associated with the conductivity of eps yuan and wang 2012 the spatial electron transfer of exoelectrogens located at the outer layer of the thick biofilm can be inhibited by insulative components such as polysaccharides xiao et al 2017 however polysaccharides in the biofilm were important as both scaffold to attach on the anode colvin 2012 and a form of extracellular carbon source storage where excess acetate was reported to increase the proportion of polysaccharides in the activated sludge ye et al 2011 the substrate concentration is one of the key parameters influencing both microbial community and eps component the current density of mixed bacteria in marine microbial fuel cells approached to a constant when the acetate concentration was larger than 0 50 mm according to monod equation quek et al 2015 but in most studies acetate was 12 mm 1 g l 24 times of that needed for current production li et al 2016 sun et al 2016 the response of current to substrate concentration of a well established eab is always described by a first order saturated equation in previous studies that is a limited substrate concentration corresponding to a low current density jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 tront et al 2009 however the substrate limitation can impose a selective pressure from the start of biofilm formation and may therefore change the microbial community and the eps components how is the eab formed at substrate limited condition how do exoelectrogens compete with non exoelectrogens at this time so far as we known there s limited information about this this is important because we have to know what organic loading is the suitable for bes based technologies based on our hypothesis excess acetate may 1 grow non exoelectrogens to decrease the proportion of exoelectrogens in eab and 2 accumulate insulative polysaccharides to resist distant bio electron transfer limiting acetate in bes was reported to impose a selective pressure on microbial communities probably good for exoelectrogens with high affinity to their substrate for example in acetate fed mfcs starvation was found effective to inhibit methanogens kaur et al 2014 polysaccharides in eps was a stored substrate which was degraded by bacterial strains isode 01 and isode 07 as the sole carbon source cappello et al 2011 and the polysaccharides supplied a part of substrate when strain fdn 01 used glucose instead of sodium succinate as carbon source lu et al 2019 thus eabs were individually acclimated at acetate limited 1 2 mm and acetate abundant 12 mm conditions their electroactivity was evaluated in half cell bess with electrode potential strictly poised at the same potential the mechanisms resulting in performance differences were further investigated by analyzing the microbial community and eps composition 2 methods and materials 2 1 construction and operation of the bioelectrochemical system three electrode

used as the counter electrode ce the reference electrode re was ag agcl with 4 0 m kcl all the electrodes were purchased from aida hengsheng technology co ltd tianjin china an 8 channel potentiostat chi 1000c chenhua instruments shanghai china was used to poise the electrode potential at 0 v versus ag agcl all reactors were operated at 30 c these reactors were inoculated by the effluent of microbial fuel cells 25 v v operated for 1 year and fed with acetate the medium contained a 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs na2hpo4 4 576 g l nah2po4 2 132 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l and kcl 0 13 g l a 5 ml l vitamin solution and a 12 5 ml l trace mineral solution li et al 2016 here the acetate concentrations were 1 0 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 g l and the acetate concentration was used as the only parameter to control biofilm growth the eabs acclimated under these conditions were marked as eab 1 0 to eab 0 1 the medium was continuously bubbled with n2 co2 4 1 v v for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen before inoculation all these reactors were operated in batch mode mixed continuously by magnetic stirrers the medium was replaced at the end of each cycle for the first cycle the residual acetate in the inoculum was measured to ensure the accurate concentration of acetate all batch reactors were operated in 4 parallel repeats 2 2 electrochemical characterizations cyclic voltammetry cv was used to characterize the electrochemical activity of the biofilm during enrichment before cv tests reactors were refreshed by new medium with acetate concentrations of 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l respectively the potential window was 0 6 to 0 2 v with a scan rate of 1 mv s zhou et al 2017 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was conducted at the open circuit potential ocp over the frequency range from 100 khz to 0 05 hz for the analysis of the internal resistance in order to characterize the eab at the most stable status the electrode was poised at the ocp each biofilm was stabilized at the open circuit potential for 1 h before the eis tests nyquist plots were fitted according to the equivalent circuit described in a previous study li et al 2014 cvs and eis tests were performed at representative time points including the lag phase 22 h exponential phase 46 h and mature phase 66 h the cvs and eis of abiotic control were shown in fig s3 2 3 biofilm topography metabolism and community analysis the spatial live dead topography of each biofilm was obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm880 germany biofilms were stained for 15 min with a live dead

min zumbusch et al 1994 the biomass protein density on the anode was measured by a bca protein quantification assay kit solarbio beijing li et al 2014 before the measurement the biofilm was scraped from the electrode using a sterile blade and pretreated with 0 2 m naoh the biofilms were sampled from parallel bes at 22 46 and 66 h biofilm dna was extracted using the soil genomic dna kit cw2091s comwin biotech co ltd beijing china according to standard protocols feng et al 2016 a forward primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and a reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were utilized to amplify the hypervariable v4 region of the 16s rdna the species level analysis was conducted by ncbi blast du et al 2018 the pcr products were then sent to a miseq illumina platform for sequencing novogene beijing china the results were analyzed using r language all sequence data sets in this study were available at ncbi sequence read archive sra under study with bioproject accession number prjna575601 eps was extracted using cation exchange resin bo et al 1996 the eabs collected under different carbon sources were stirred at 2000 g for 2 h at 4 c with resins the extracted eps were harvested by centrifugation of samples for 30 min at 4000 g and then the supernatant passed through the 0 22 μm filtration membrane the total protein concentration of eps was measured by bca protein quantification assay kit solarbio beijing the polysaccharose was evaluated by anthrone sulphuric acid colorimetry according previous studies lu et al 2019 2 4 calculation and statistical analysis the concentration of acetate in the anolyte was calculated as follow 1 ln c t c 0 kt where c 0 mg l is the influent acetate c t mg l is the acetate at time t h and k h 1 is the first order removal rate constant ren et al 2015 statistical analysis in our study was performed using one way analysis of variance anova followed by least significant difference lsd and the lsd results are reported only if the one way anova showed a significant effect srinivasan and butler 2017 the statistical analysis was represented by p in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm electroactivity a linear current increase was observed in each reactor in the initial 35 h fig 1 a and s1 currents then reached their peaks indicating the maturation of the eabs a biofilm had grown from a monolayer to a multilayer film when the current density reached 0 50 a m2 feng et al 2016 so we defined the startup time t start as the point when the current density approached 0 50 a m2 according to the statistical analysis table s1 the eab growing at acetate limiting condition of 0 1 g l 0 12 mm eab 0 1 had the shortest t start of 33 0 5 h which was 5 11 significantly faster p 0 05 n 4 than that observed at higher concentrations from 0 2 to 1 0 g l a shorter t start accompanied a higher current density where the highest current density of 5 7 0 1 a m2 was obtained in eab 0 1 at 54 h a value 50 111 higher than that observed for 0 2 1 0 g l acetate across the exponential growth phase from 22 to 46 h fig s2 the biofilm growing at limited acetate condition exhibited the highest electroactivity which was very different from the results obtained using pure cultures such as geobacter sulfurreducens where a higher acetate concentration resulted in a higher current density bond and lovley 2003 chen et al 2018 katuri et al 2010 according to the cv curves at different time profiles the current densities of eab 0 1 showed a higher redox activity than that of the other eabs 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 at the mature phase 66 h fig 1b the current density of eab 0 1 at 0 v 7 2 0 5 a m2 was 22 higher than that of eab 0 2 5 9 0 1 a m2 which was approximately 1 6 1 9 times of eab 0 5 and eab 1 0 a similar trend was also found at the exponential 46 h and lag phases 22 h fig s2 further confirming that the acetate limitation resulted in a highly active eab over the whole growth phase which was in accordance with the chronoamperometry results in fig 1a the experimental datasets of nyquist plots obtained via eis measurements along with the fitting results by equivalent circuit model ecm were shown in fig 2 a and fig s4 as can be seen in the plots all the eabs fed with different acetate concentrations exhibited the same curve consisting of two arcs based on this observation an ecm with two time constants fig 2b was selected malvankar et al 2012 yoho et al 2014 which contained one ohmic resistance r s two charge tansfer resistances r ct combined with two constant phase elements cpe in parallel we assumed that the impedance responses came from an electron transport chain thus these two resistances were set in series yan et al 2020 yoho et al 2014 the r s is contributed by the resistance of solution and connections and r ct represents the major kinetic limitation caused by slow activation reactions occurring at the interfaces between electrode biofilm and the surrounding electrolyte malvankar et al 2012 sekar and ramasamy 2013 where the cpe is used as a substitute of the possible double layer capacitance yan et al 2016 the occurrence of two time constants implied a two stage electron transfer mechanism which required further exploration to define therefore to avoid confusion only the first r ct value which we assumed to be the activation loss from the biofilm to the electrode would be used for comparison in later analysis the simulating results of r s was constant at 98 7 ω showing that all reactors were prepared in parallel with the same medium jiang et al 2017 because the charge transfer resistance r ct 103 105 was more than one order of magnitude higher than the r s 101 r ct was the dominant component of the total internal resistance the r ct of eab 0 1 936 10 ω was 85 lower than that of eab 1 0 6400 200 ω resulting in the higher current densities shown in fig 1 it seems that the low acetate concentration of 0 1 g l facilitated electron transfer from the bacteria to the electrode which could enhance the eab performance this unconventional active eab 0 1 is likely due to the mass transfer microbial viability and the differences in eps components it should be noted that the relatively high r ct was mainly due to the use of plain glassy carbon with an effective area of 0 19 cm2 errors of the simulation were shown in table s2 3 2 biofilm structure special viability and thickness the thickness of eab 1 0 19 0 μm was comparable with eab 0 1 17 5 μm and eab 0 5 18 5 μm at the lag phase and finally formed a 25 thicker biofilm 53 0 μm than that of eab 0 1 42 5 μm at the mature phase fig s5 eab 1 0 the thickest biofilm had the highest biomass 392 12 μg protein cm2 as showed in table s3 which was 24 higher than that of eab 0 1 317 14 μg protein cm2 previous studies reported that total biomass may be involved in extracellular electron transfer through the diffusive mechanism sun et al 2015 while the geometric structure of eab may affect the electroactivity the surface porosities p eab of each 6 μm optical sections was shown in fig 3 a all eabs growing at different acetate concentrations had a loose surface and relatively dense core the biofilm trend to closely pack as the acetate concentration decreased the average p eab of eab 0 1 was 24 3 which was 44 lower than that of eab 1 0 42 5 the top view of the autofluorescence signals in fig s6 also showed that the fluorescence intensity of the biofilm at 0 1 g l 2 2 a u was 29 larger than that at 1 0 g l 1 7 a u indicating that the autofluorescent cytochrome c both the intra and extra cellular cytochromes c in the acetate limited system were compacted this was further proved by the eps analysis the thick biofilm was not as electroactive as expected table s4 at the very beginning 22 h the specific biofilm electroactivity η was comparable 247 35 ma g protein p 0 05 n 4 among all biofilms except eab 1 0 126 5 ma g protein finally the η stabilized to 1198 20 ma g protein for eab 0 2 to eab 1 0 p 0 05 n 4 at their exponential growth phase while eab 0 1 reached an additional 50 higher η of 1798 15 ma g protein the main differentiation of bio electroactivity occurred at the exponential growth phase which is the period with the strongest growth substrate competition among the different species ganguly et al 2013 this can be probably an evidence that the exoelectrogens take advantage of this competition in this period when acetate was limited in bess the terminal electron acceptors are limited to methane complex biomass and probably hydrogen gas since the electrode poised at 0 v versus ag agcl is more thermodynamically favorable than other electron acceptors e0 ch4 359 mv e0 h2 414 mv ag agcl the transfer of electrons to the electrode at an acetate limiting condition seems to be a strategy to maximize the energy gain for bacterial growth call and logan 2008 mer and roger 2001 for example it was reported that exoelectrogens can outcompete the methanogens under acetate limited condition kaur et al 2014 the change of microbial community composition can be the ecological strategy in response to the substrate limitation this was further analyzed in part of the microbial community analysis the bacteria growing at a thickness of 24 30 μm exhibited their highest viabilities of 82 4 0 1 and 0 2 g l and 74 4 0 5 and 1 g l in all eabs and relatively lower acetate concentrations enhanced the bacterial activity fig 3b the inner core 6 24 μm had a comparable viability of 81 3 for 0 1 and 0 2 g l indicating that the growth of inner core bacteria was not inhibited however a serious inhibition of viability was observed in the biofilms fed with higher acetate concentrations of 0 5 and 1 g l and their viability linearly decreased from 78 30 μm 0 5 g l and 72 24 μm 1 g l to 65 and 60 respectively especially in the inner core of 6 μm this was also previously observed in a thick biofilm of geobacter anodireducens sun et al 2015 the viability of the outer layer 30 μm decreased towards the solution side confirming that the dominant factor controlling the biofilm activity was not the chemical diffusion of acetate or protons overall we found that the relatively low acetate concentration helped to construct a thin eab and that the activity of bacteria growing at the inner core was not limited by the biomass layer the structure of biofilm observed in context was mainly affected by eps extracellular protein and extracellular polysaccharide were skeleton in eps influenced the electrochemical performance of eab sheng et al 2010 so we further measured the eps components of different eabs the total content of eps in eab 1 0 was 567 14 μg cm2 which was 120 higher than that 262 9 μg cm2 in eab 0 1 table 1 the difference was mainly from polysaccharides which increased by 186 from 152 9 μg cm2 in eab 0 1 to 435 20 μg cm2 in eab 1 0 the over secretion of insulative polysaccharides in the biofilm may obstruct the electron transfer as a resistance although it could protect eab from disintegration by extreme environment polysaccharide is reported as a stored energy form when substrate is abundant which can be released at a substrate limited condition giroldo et al 2005 in this study the eab growing at acetate abundant condition 1 0 g l was found to produce 435 20 μg cm2 polysaccharide as a potential energy storage however the eab growing at acetate limited condition 0 1 g l only exhibited a 1 3 polysaccharide content 152 9 μg cm2 confirmed that the eab preferred to grow rather than energy storage when the carbon source was limited this is a very interesting phenomenon showing that we have to re consider the suitable niche to grow a highly active eab with reduced polysaccharide content bess were previously reported as a potential technology for energy recovery from industrial wastewaters including those with high organic contents feng et al 2008 2011 unfortunately the columbic efficiencies or current densities in these high organic loading systems were usually low and the reason can be partly explained according our findings in our opinion wastewaters with limited available substrates such as acetate and lactate are more applicable in bes to decrease the insulative polysaccharide in the biofilm and therefore to form a highly active eab for an efficient energy recovery 3 3 microbial community analysis illumina sequencing revealed that the acetate limitation also imposed a selective pressure on the microbial community the genus level identification showed that bacterial communities except for the inoculum 20 are dominated by geobacter and the similarity at the genus level among eab 0 1 to eab 1 0 was 45 according to the results of the otu cluster analysis figs 4 a and s7 geobacter known as a model genus of exoelectrogens were widely found in acetate fed microbial electrochemical systems rd et al 2012 compared to the 19 observed in the initial inoculum the proportion of geobacter increased from 69 in eab 1 0 to 82 in eab 0 1 showing that the low substrate concentration selectively enriched the population of geobacter which was in accordance with the η and autofluorescence results to confirm whether nonexoelectrogens were suppressed when the eab acclimated at a low acetate concentration five generations of consecutive transfer were compared between eab 0 1 and eab 1 0 fig 4b the proportion of geobacter in eab 0 1 increased continuously from 81 to 88 after five transfers however the proportion of geobacter stabilized at 72 in all five generations of eab 1 0 these results confirmed that a low acetate concentration provided the constant selective pressure to geobacter which could be attributed to the competitive edge of geobacter over other microorganisms on acetate utilization in the biofilm this needs to be further confirmed in fundamental studies in the future in order to compare the acetate utilization by non exoelectrogens in different eabs the degradation of acetate within 24 h was monitored under both closed and open circuit conditions the acetate degradation rates exhibit a similar trend for eab 0 1 and eab 1 0 fig 5 a acetate was degraded by 60 in a connected bes with eab 1 0 after 8 h which was slightly higher than 54 of eab 0 1 when the degradation was extended to 24 h the acetate degradation rates finally reached 74 and 67 for eab 1 0 and eab 0 1 demonstrating that most of the acetate was degraded in the initial 8 h however an obvious difference in acetate degradation was found under the open circuit fig 5a the acetate degradation rate of eab 1 0 36 was 80 higher than that of eab 0 1 20 after 24 h the acetate degradation rate was in accordance with the assumption of first order degradation kinetics fig 5b the first order degradation rate constant k was almost the same under the closed circuit for eab 1 0 0 102 h and eab 0 1 0 103 h however the k for eab 1 0 was 0 034 h at open circuit condition a value 89 higher than that of eab 0 1 0 018 h indicating more active non exoelectrogens were present in eab 1 0 than in eab 0 1 ren et al 2015 these results further confirmed that non exoelectrogens could be simply suppressed by a low substrate concentration corresponding to a higher proportion of geobacter in eab 0 1 here we found that the initial substrate concentration during biofilm formation is critical to the performance of bes the relatively low acetate concentration imposed a selective pressure to enrich geobacter and the thin biofilm with a spot of eps had a high electroactivity this thin and highly active eab may be sensitive to trace toxicants provided a new possibility to improve eab based biotoxicity sensors 4 conclusions our results highlighted the importance of eab optimization through organic loading control in bes with a limited acetate concentration the current density was improved by 90 than that with abundant acetate which can be mainly attributed to the decrease of insulative polysaccharide in eab and the selective enrichment of geobacter indicating that the low strength wastewaters were more applicable for an efficient bio current production this highly active eab with less polysaccharide may provide an alternative principle for the design of super sensitive biotoxicity sensors declaration of

reported that the mixed eab reached a thickness of 37 87 μm in acetate fed systems after 30 days which was 4 1 9 7 times thicker than the monolayer cells du et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 therefore the distant bio electron transfer towards the anode closely associated with the conductivity of eps yuan and wang 2012 the spatial electron transfer of exoelectrogens located at the outer layer of the thick biofilm can be inhibited by insulative components such as polysaccharides xiao et al 2017 however polysaccharides in the biofilm were important as both scaffold to attach on the anode colvin 2012 and a form of extracellular carbon source storage where excess acetate was reported to increase the proportion of polysaccharides in the activated sludge ye et al 2011 the substrate concentration is one of the key parameters influencing both microbial community and eps component the current density of mixed bacteria in marine microbial fuel cells approached to a constant when the acetate concentration was larger than 0 50 mm according to monod equation quek et al 2015 but in most studies acetate was 12 mm 1 g l 24 times of that needed for current production li et al 2016 sun et al 2016 the response of current to substrate concentration of a well established eab is always described by a first order saturated equation in previous studies that is a limited substrate concentration corresponding to a low current density jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 tront et al 2009 however the substrate limitation can impose a selective pressure from the start of biofilm formation and may therefore change the microbial community and the eps components how is the eab formed at substrate limited condition how do exoelectrogens compete with non exoelectrogens at this time so far as we known there s limited information about this this is important because we have to know what organic loading is the suitable for bes based technologies based on our hypothesis excess acetate may 1 grow non exoelectrogens to decrease the proportion of exoelectrogens in eab and 2 accumulate insulative polysaccharides to resist distant bio electron transfer limiting acetate in bes was reported to impose a selective pressure on microbial communities probably good for exoelectrogens with high affinity to their substrate for example in acetate fed mfcs starvation was found effective to inhibit methanogens kaur et al 2014 polysaccharides in eps was a stored substrate which was degraded by bacterial strains isode 01 and isode 07 as the sole carbon source cappello et al 2011 and the polysaccharides supplied a part of substrate when strain fdn 01 used glucose instead of sodium succinate as carbon source lu et al 2019 thus eabs were individually acclimated at acetate limited 1 2 mm and acetate abundant 12 mm conditions their electroactivity was evaluated in half cell bess with electrode potential strictly poised at the same potential the mechanisms resulting in performance differences were further investigated by analyzing the microbial community and eps composition 2 methods and materials 2 1 construction and operation of the bioelectrochemical system three electrode

chi 1000c chenhua instruments shanghai china was used to poise the electrode potential at 0 v versus ag agcl all reactors were operated at 30 c these reactors were inoculated by the effluent of microbial fuel cells 25 v v operated for 1 year and fed with acetate the medium contained a 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs na2hpo4 4 576 g l nah2po4 2 132 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l and kcl 0 13 g l a 5 ml l vitamin solution and a 12 5 ml l trace mineral solution li et al 2016 here the acetate concentrations were 1 0 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 g l and the acetate concentration was used as the only parameter to control biofilm growth the eabs acclimated under these conditions were marked as eab 1 0 to eab 0 1 the medium was continuously bubbled with n2 co2 4 1 v v for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen before inoculation all these reactors were operated in batch mode mixed continuously by magnetic stirrers the medium was replaced at the end of each cycle for the first cycle the residual acetate in the inoculum was measured to ensure the accurate concentration of acetate all batch reactors were operated in 4 parallel repeats 2 2 electrochemical characterizations cyclic voltammetry cv was used to characterize the electrochemical activity of the biofilm during enrichment before cv tests reactors were refreshed by new medium with acetate concentrations of 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l respectively the potential window was 0 6 to 0 2 v with a scan rate of 1 mv s zhou et al 2017 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was conducted at the open circuit potential ocp over the frequency range from 100 khz to 0 05 hz for the analysis of the internal resistance in order to characterize the eab at the most stable status the electrode was poised at the ocp each biofilm was stabilized at the open circuit potential for 1 h before the eis tests nyquist plots were fitted according to the equivalent circuit described in a previous study li et al 2014 cvs and eis tests were performed at representative time points including the lag phase 22 h exponential phase 46 h and mature phase 66 h the cvs and eis of abiotic control were shown in fig s3 2 3 biofilm topography metabolism and community analysis the spatial live dead topography of each biofilm was obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm880 germany biofilms were stained for 15 min with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit for the calculation of bacterial viability l13152 thermofisher scientific inc u s the images were scanned from the bottom to the top with a step of 2 μm the ratios of green to total cells viability and the coverage rate cr were calculated using zen blue software according to pixel counting we defined the surface porosity of eab p eab at a specific biofilm layer as

chromatography hplc was used to analyze the degradation of acetate with the following parameters separation column c18 column temperature 30 c flow rate 1 ml min wavelength 210 nm and detection time 5 min zumbusch et al 1994 the biomass protein density on the anode was measured by a bca protein quantification assay kit solarbio beijing li et al 2014 before the measurement the biofilm was scraped from the electrode using a sterile blade and pretreated with 0 2 m naoh the biofilms were sampled from parallel bes at 22 46 and 66 h biofilm dna was extracted using the soil genomic dna kit cw2091s comwin biotech co ltd beijing china according to standard protocols feng et al 2016 a forward primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and a reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were utilized to

novogene beijing china the results were analyzed using r language all sequence data sets in this study were available at ncbi sequence read archive sra under study with bioproject accession number prjna575601 eps was extracted using cation exchange resin bo et al 1996 the eabs collected under different carbon sources were stirred at 2000 g for 2 h at 4 c with resins the extracted eps were harvested by centrifugation of samples for 30 min at 4000 g and then the supernatant passed through the 0 22 μm filtration membrane the total protein concentration of eps was measured by bca protein quantification assay kit solarbio beijing the polysaccharose was evaluated by anthrone sulphuric acid colorimetry according previous studies lu et al 2019 2 4 calculation and statistical analysis the concentration of acetate in the anolyte was calculated as follow 1 ln c t c 0 kt where c 0 mg l is the influent acetate c t mg l is the acetate at time t h and k h 1 is the first order removal rate constant ren et al 2015 statistical analysis in our study was performed using one way analysis of variance anova followed by least significant difference lsd and the lsd results are reported only if the one way anova showed a significant effect srinivasan and butler 2017 the statistical analysis was represented by p in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm electroactivity a linear current increase was observed in each reactor in the initial 35 h fig 1 a and s1 currents then reached their peaks indicating the maturation of the eabs a biofilm had grown from a monolayer to a multilayer film when the current density reached 0 50 a m2 feng et al 2016 so we defined the startup time t start as the point when the current density approached 0 50 a m2 according to the statistical analysis table s1 the eab growing at acetate limiting condition of 0 1 g l 0 12 mm eab 0 1 had the shortest t start of 33 0 5 h which was 5 11 significantly faster p 0 05 n 4 than that observed at higher concentrations from 0 2 to 1 0 g l a shorter t start accompanied a higher current density where the highest current density of 5 7 0 1 a m2 was obtained in eab 0 1 at 54 h a value 50 111 higher than that observed for 0 2 1 0 g l acetate across the exponential growth phase from 22 to 46 h fig s2 the biofilm growing at limited acetate condition exhibited the highest electroactivity which was very different from the results obtained using pure cultures such as geobacter sulfurreducens where a higher acetate concentration resulted in a higher current density bond and lovley 2003 chen et al 2018 katuri et al 2010 according to the cv curves at different time profiles the current densities of eab 0 1 showed a higher redox activity than that of the other eabs 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 at the mature phase 66 h fig 1b the current density of eab 0 1 at 0 v 7 2 0 5 a m2 was 22 higher than that of eab 0 2 5 9 0 1 a m2 which was approximately 1 6 1 9 times of eab 0 5 and eab 1 0 a similar trend was also found at the exponential 46 h and lag phases 22 h fig s2 further confirming that the acetate limitation resulted in a highly active eab over the whole growth phase which was in accordance with the chronoamperometry results in fig 1a the experimental datasets of nyquist plots obtained via eis measurements along with the fitting results by equivalent circuit model ecm were shown in fig 2 a and fig s4 as can be seen in the plots all the eabs fed with different acetate concentrations exhibited the same curve consisting of two arcs based on this observation an ecm with two time constants fig 2b was selected malvankar et al 2012 yoho et al 2014 which contained one ohmic resistance r s two charge tansfer resistances r ct combined with two constant phase elements cpe in parallel we assumed that the impedance responses came from an electron transport chain thus these two resistances were set in series yan et al 2020 yoho et al 2014 the r s is contributed by the resistance of solution and connections and r ct represents the major kinetic limitation caused by slow activation reactions occurring at the interfaces between electrode biofilm and the surrounding electrolyte malvankar et al 2012 sekar and ramasamy 2013 where the cpe is used as a substitute of the possible double layer capacitance yan et al 2016 the occurrence of two time constants implied a two stage electron transfer mechanism which required further exploration to define therefore to avoid confusion only the first r ct value which we assumed to be the activation loss from the biofilm to the electrode would be used for comparison in later analysis the simulating results of r s was constant at 98 7 ω showing that all reactors were prepared in parallel with the same medium jiang et al 2017 because the charge transfer resistance r ct 103 105 was more than one order of magnitude higher than the r s 101 r ct was the dominant component of the total internal resistance the r ct of eab 0 1 936 10 ω was 85 lower than that of eab 1 0 6400 200 ω resulting in the higher current densities shown in fig 1 it seems that the low acetate concentration of 0 1 g l facilitated electron transfer from the bacteria to the electrode which could enhance the eab performance this unconventional active eab 0 1 is likely due to the mass transfer microbial viability and the differences in eps components it should be noted that the relatively high r ct was mainly due to the use of plain glassy carbon with an effective area of 0 19 cm2 errors of the simulation were shown in table s2 3 2 biofilm structure special viability and thickness the thickness of eab 1 0 19 0 μm was comparable with eab 0 1 17 5 μm and eab 0 5 18 5 μm at the lag phase and finally formed a 25 thicker biofilm 53 0 μm than that of eab 0 1 42 5 μm at the mature phase fig s5 eab 1 0 the thickest biofilm had the highest biomass 392 12 μg protein cm2 as showed in table s3 which was 24 higher than that of eab 0 1 317 14 μg protein cm2 previous studies reported that total biomass may be involved in extracellular electron transfer through the diffusive mechanism sun et al 2015 while the geometric structure of eab may affect the electroactivity the surface porosities p eab of each 6 μm optical sections was shown in fig 3 a all eabs growing at different acetate concentrations had a loose surface and relatively dense core the biofilm trend to closely pack as the acetate concentration decreased the average p eab of eab 0 1 was 24 3 which was 44 lower than that of eab 1 0 42 5 the top view of the autofluorescence signals in fig s6 also showed that the fluorescence intensity of the biofilm at 0 1 g l 2 2 a u was 29 larger than that at 1 0 g l 1 7 a u indicating that the autofluorescent cytochrome c both the intra and extra cellular cytochromes c in the acetate limited system were compacted this was further proved by the eps analysis the thick biofilm was not as electroactive as expected table s4 at the very beginning 22 h the specific biofilm electroactivity η was comparable 247 35 ma g protein p 0 05 n 4 among all biofilms except eab 1 0 126 5 ma g protein finally the η stabilized to 1198 20 ma g protein for eab 0 2 to eab 1 0 p 0 05 n 4 at their exponential growth phase while eab 0 1 reached an additional 50 higher η of 1798 15 ma g protein the main differentiation of bio electroactivity occurred at the exponential growth phase which is the period with the strongest growth substrate competition among the different species ganguly et al 2013 this can be probably an evidence that the exoelectrogens take advantage of this competition in this period when acetate was limited in bess the terminal electron acceptors are limited to methane complex biomass and probably hydrogen gas since the electrode poised at 0 v versus ag agcl is more thermodynamically favorable than other electron acceptors e0 ch4 359 mv e0 h2 414 mv ag agcl the transfer of electrons to the electrode at an acetate limiting condition seems to be a strategy to maximize the energy gain for bacterial growth call and logan 2008 mer and roger 2001 for example it was reported that exoelectrogens can outcompete the methanogens under acetate limited condition kaur et al 2014 the change of microbial community composition can be the ecological strategy in response to the substrate limitation this was further analyzed in part of the microbial community analysis the bacteria growing at a thickness of 24 30 μm exhibited their highest viabilities of 82 4 0 1 and 0 2 g l and 74 4 0 5 and 1 g l in all eabs and relatively lower acetate concentrations enhanced the bacterial activity fig 3b the inner core 6 24 μm had a comparable viability of 81 3 for 0 1 and 0 2 g l indicating that the growth of inner core bacteria was not inhibited however a serious inhibition of viability was observed in the biofilms fed with higher acetate concentrations of 0 5 and 1 g l and their viability linearly decreased from 78 30 μm 0 5 g l and 72 24 μm 1 g l to 65 and 60 respectively especially in the inner core of 6 μm this was also previously observed in a thick biofilm of geobacter anodireducens sun et al 2015 the viability of the outer layer 30 μm decreased towards the solution side confirming that the dominant factor controlling the biofilm activity was not the chemical diffusion of acetate or protons overall we found that the relatively low acetate concentration helped to construct a thin eab and that the activity of bacteria growing at the inner core was not limited by the biomass layer the structure of biofilm observed in context was mainly affected by eps extracellular protein and extracellular polysaccharide were skeleton in eps influenced the electrochemical performance of eab sheng et al 2010 so we further measured the eps components of different eabs the total content of eps in eab 1 0 was 567 14 μg cm2 which was 120 higher than that 262 9 μg cm2 in eab 0 1 table 1 the difference was mainly from polysaccharides which increased by 186 from 152 9 μg cm2 in eab 0 1 to 435 20 μg cm2 in eab 1 0 the over secretion of insulative polysaccharides in the biofilm may obstruct the electron transfer as a resistance although it could protect eab from disintegration by extreme environment polysaccharide is reported as a stored energy form when substrate is abundant which can be released at a substrate limited condition giroldo et al 2005 in this study the eab growing at acetate abundant condition 1 0 g l was found to produce 435 20 μg cm2 polysaccharide as a potential energy storage however the eab growing at acetate limited condition 0 1 g l only exhibited a 1 3 polysaccharide content 152 9 μg cm2 confirmed that the eab preferred to grow rather than energy storage when the carbon source was limited this is a very interesting phenomenon showing that we have to re consider the suitable niche to grow a highly active eab with reduced polysaccharide content bess were previously reported as a potential technology for energy recovery from industrial wastewaters including those with high organic contents feng et al 2008 2011 unfortunately the columbic efficiencies or current densities in these high organic loading systems were usually low and the reason can be partly explained according our findings in our opinion wastewaters with limited available substrates such as acetate and lactate are more applicable in bes to decrease the insulative polysaccharide in the biofilm and therefore to form a highly active eab for an efficient energy recovery 3 3 microbial community analysis illumina sequencing revealed that the acetate limitation also imposed a selective pressure on the microbial community the genus level identification showed that bacterial communities except for the inoculum 20 are dominated by geobacter and the similarity at the genus level among eab 0 1 to eab 1 0 was 45 according to the results of the otu cluster analysis figs 4 a and s7 geobacter known as a model genus of exoelectrogens were widely found in acetate fed microbial electrochemical systems rd et al 2012 compared to the 19 observed in the initial inoculum the proportion of geobacter increased from 69 in eab 1 0 to 82 in eab 0 1 showing that the low substrate concentration selectively enriched the population of geobacter which was in accordance with the η and autofluorescence results to confirm whether nonexoelectrogens were suppressed when the eab acclimated at a low acetate concentration five generations of consecutive transfer were compared between eab 0 1 and eab 1 0 fig 4b the proportion of geobacter in eab 0 1 increased continuously from 81 to 88 after five transfers however the proportion of geobacter stabilized at 72 in all five generations of eab 1 0 these results confirmed that a low acetate concentration provided the constant selective pressure to geobacter which could be attributed to the competitive edge of geobacter over other microorganisms on acetate utilization in the biofilm this needs to be further confirmed in fundamental studies in the future in order to compare the acetate utilization by non exoelectrogens in different eabs the degradation of acetate within 24 h was monitored under both closed and open circuit conditions the acetate degradation rates exhibit a similar trend for eab 0 1 and eab 1 0 fig 5 a acetate was degraded by 60 in a connected bes with eab 1 0 after 8 h which was slightly higher than 54 of eab 0 1 when the degradation was extended to 24 h the acetate degradation rates finally reached 74 and 67 for eab 1 0 and eab 0 1 demonstrating that most of the acetate was degraded in the initial 8 h however an obvious difference in acetate degradation was found under the open circuit fig 5a the acetate degradation rate of eab 1 0 36 was 80 higher than that of eab 0 1 20 after 24 h the acetate degradation rate was in accordance with the assumption of first order degradation kinetics fig 5b the first order degradation rate constant k was almost the same under the closed circuit for eab 1 0 0 102 h and eab 0 1 0 103 h however the k for eab 1 0 was 0 034 h at open circuit condition a value 89 higher than that of eab 0 1 0 018 h indicating more active non exoelectrogens were present in eab 1 0 than in eab 0 1 ren et al 2015 these results further confirmed that non exoelectrogens could be simply suppressed by a low substrate concentration corresponding to a higher proportion of geobacter in eab 0 1 here we found that the initial substrate concentration during biofilm formation is critical to the performance of bes the relatively low acetate concentration imposed a selective pressure to enrich geobacter and the thin biofilm with a spot of eps had a high electroactivity this thin and highly active eab may be sensitive to trace toxicants provided a new possibility to improve eab based biotoxicity sensors 4 conclusions our results highlighted the importance of eab optimization through organic loading control in bes with a limited acetate concentration the current density was improved by 90 than that with abundant acetate which can be mainly attributed to the decrease of insulative polysaccharide in eab and the selective enrichment of geobacter indicating that the low strength wastewaters were more applicable for an efficient bio current production this highly active eab with less polysaccharide may provide an alternative principle for the design of super sensitive biotoxicity sensors declaration of
