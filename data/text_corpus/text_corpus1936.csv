9680,black locust robinia pseudoacacia is widely planted throughout semiarid and subhumid regions of the loess plateau of china determining the changes in transpiration of this species in different climatic areas is important for revealing the acclimation mechanism of black locust and developing suitable forest management practices particularly in the context of global climate change here sap flow and canopy conductance of black locust plantation trees in semiarid yan an and subhumid yongshou sites were quantified using granier type thermal dissipation probes and concurrent environmental observations from 2012 to 2017 several physiological parameters were measured throughout the growing season the results showed that sap flow was correlated with phenological factors across seasons within a year however interannual changes in sap flow were affected mainly by the reference evapotranspiration et 0 at the yongshou site and jointly by precipitation p soil water content and p et 0 at the yan an site sap flow response to meteorological factors showed less discrepancy between pre and post rainfall periods at the yan an site moreover canopy conductance fluctuated less with a wider range of vapor pressure deficit vpd and the slope of canopy resistance as a function of vpd was lower indicating relatively lower sensitivity of stomatal conductance to environmental factors in yan an site physiological parameters except for predawn leaf water potential were significantly different between the two sites the results suggested that black locust tended to reduce transpiration modify leaf morphology and improve water use efficiency to enhance its adaptability to the dryer site the species changes stomatal regulation characteristics and general growth rate to acclimatize to distinct water habitats keywords sap flow canopy conductance canopy resistance drought acclimation drought sensitivity ecophysiological characteristics 1 introduction transpiration the evaporation process by which water is transferred from the soil to the atmosphere through plants constitutes an important part in coupling terrestrial water cycling and energy balance jiao et al 2019 kumagai et al 2014 ungar et al 2013 it is generally accepted that water absorption by plant roots and transportation through stems are driven by the force of transpiration sap flow in the stem xylem is thus frequently measured as a direct indicator or proxy of tree transpiration a more generalized interpretation of canopy response to changing environmental conditions can be derived by quantifying canopy conductance gas exchange across a canopy stratum based on tree transpiration and concurrent environmental factors schaefer 2011 to date studies of tree transpiration and canopy conductance have focused mainly on single species forest stands or the comparison among several tree species for example by analyzing canopy conductance based on sap flow measurement chen et al 2012 found the same regulation of the hydraulic response to vapor pressure deficit across varying tree sizes and environmental conditions a study conducted in the semiarid loess plateau region of china compared transpiration characteristics in response to climatic factors of three tree species du et al 2011 however knowledge about acclimation in the transpiration characteristics of a species under different climatic environments remains inadequate transpiration is primarily determined by plant features including ecophysiological characteristics and growth status and environmental factors granier et al 1996 oren and pataki 2001 pataki and oren 2003 the influence of environmental factors on transpiration actualizes through two aspects evaporative demand i e potential evapotranspiration and soil water supply grossiord et al 2017 naithani et al 2012 tie et al 2017 reported that when the leaf area index dropped to a low value the dominant factor for sap flow changed from meteorological to physiological factor showing a seasonal switching behavior the influence of soil water content on transpiration has been explored by data fitting with linear logistic and polynomial functions chang et al 2014 lagergren and lindroth 2002 zhao and liu 2010 however even the same species showed various responses to environmental factors due to its habitat and age related or size related physiological characteristics delzon and loustau 2005 ewers et al 2005 irvine et al 2004 an investigation of mongolian pine in its natural populations and stands planted outside its natural range found that the latter had higher transpiration but lower stomatal sensitivity under water loss song et al 2020 information about how these environmental factors interact to influence tree transpiration and canopy conductance is accumulating such knowledge is critical for revealing control mechanisms of transpiration and developing the long term hydrological regime of forests black locust robinia pseudoacacia was introduced as a dominant afforestation species on the loess plateau in china because of its fast growth and efficient role in soil conservation liang et al 2018 wang et al 2011a however the soil water in its stands has been found to decline probably due to high water consumption by this species chen et al 2007 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 consequently black locust plantations experience reduced growth and present symptoms of early degradation in semiarid areas chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 liang et al 2018 recent studies on responses of transpiration to drought conditions based on pot experiments or a single stand revealed some ecophysiological adaptation mechanisms in black locust mantovani et al 2014 yan et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 related studies on multiple stands focusing on acclimation to different climatic sites are scarce but are necessary for the clarification of water use strategy and adaptation mechanisms in this species particularly in the loess plateau region this study analyzed the transpiration and ecophysiological characteristics of black locust trees from two representative climatic sites the semiarid and subhumid areas of the loess plateau we aimed to investigate the potential differences in transpiration between the two sites as well as their ecophysiological mechanisms specifically the objectives were to 1 compare the factors influencing transpiration at seasonal and annual scales 2 determine the differences in response patterns of transpiration and canopy conductance to environmental factors and 3 clarify transpiration related physiological and morphological traits of trees between the two sites 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in 2012 2017 in two black locust robinia pseudoacacia planted forests in shaanxi province in the chinese loess plateau one site was at the yongshou forest station 34 48 42 n 107 58 83 e 1430 m a s l near yongshou county dominated by a subhumid climate with mean annual precipitation map and annual mean temperature amt are 617 mm and 10 8 c respectively he et al 2020 the other site with a temperate semiarid climate was located at mount gonglushan 36 25 40 n 109 31 53 e 1353 m a s l near yan an city the map and amt are 504 mm and 10 1 c respectively shi et al 2014 most of the precipitation occurs from july september in both sites there is a permanent 20 m 20 m research plot at each site for multipurpose investigations of for example evapotranspiration soil respiration soil moisture dynamics and soil microbial biology cheng et al 2020 du et al 2011 he et al 2020 shi et al 2014 tian et al 2017 yan et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in the year of 2012 the robinia stand in yan an site was an approximately 31 year old plantation on a southeast facing slope the density of tree stands was 2950 trees ha 1 the soil was derived from silt textured loess parent material which belongs to calcic cambisol group based on the food and agriculture organization fao classification system wang et al 2003 in yongshou site the plot on a northeast facing slope had been in place for 32 years tree density was 1600 trees ha 1 the soil texture was predominantly loam clay which belongs to anthrosols according to the fao classification system rong et al 2020 the leaf area index lai in each plot was measured once a month during the growing seasons may september in 2012 2017 using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor lincoln ne usa to avoid transient changes in sky conditions and influence from direct sunlight the measurement was conducted either under an overcast weather or during a period of very low solar elevation around sunset 2 2 sap flow measurement and canopy conductance estimate throughout the study period xylem sap flow was measured using granier type sensors granier 1987 in seven individuals representing the major diameters at breast height dbh classes in each site the average dbh at the yongshou site was 18 04 1 24 cm in 2012 and 20 34 1 51 cm in 2017 with an increment of 2 31 0 38 cm the respective dbh and increment at the yan an site were 10 83 1 05 cm 11 31 0 96 cm and 0 72 0 05 cm each sensor consisted of a pair of 10 mm long cylindrical probes with diameters of 2 mm a continuously heated upper probe supplied with 0 15 w of constant power and an unheated lower probe as a temperature reference james et al 2002 the probes were inserted into the sapwood vertically 15 cm apart at breast height of tree stems and two pairs were installed on the opposite sides of each sample tree to calculate their averages and for quality control of the measurements in case one sensor runs abnormally the temperature difference between the two probes was scanned every 30 s as a voltage value and the 30 min average was recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa with a multiplexer am16 32 campbell scientific usa sap flux density was calculated based on the measured temperature difference by using the empirical equation

d 0 and δt is the temperature difference between the two probes baseliner software was used to determine δt max as provided by oishi et al 2016 as the sapwood thickness of some sample trees was less than the probe length of 10 mm corrected values δt sw were used in those trees instead of the measured values δt for the temperature difference in eq 1 following the correction equation established by clearwater et al 1999 2 t sw t 1 a t max a where a is the proportion of the probe in the sapwood δt is the measured temperature difference between the two probes and δt sw is the actual temperature

is the sample tree number and n is the sample size f di and a si are the sap flux density and sapwood area of tree i respectively the sapwood thickness and area of the sample trees were calculated by core sample analysis an increment borer was applied to drill core samples regression equations of a s with dbh were derived from core samples taken from 15 randomly selected trees around the plots as a s 0 0096 dbh2 43 for the yongshou site and a s 0 1197 dbh1 5546 for the yan an site canopy conductance g c mol m 2 s 1 was calculated using a simplified formula established by kostner et al 1992 4 g

was measured with a pyranometer li 200 li cor inc usa and air temperature and relative humidity were monitored using a thermohygrograph hmp50 in yan an site and hmp110 in yongshou site vaisala helsinki finland the above two instruments were both mounted 2 m above the ground level a tipping bucket rain gauge davis 7852 davis instruments hayward ca usa approximately 0 5 m above ground was used to measure precipitation these data were sampled every 30 s and the 30 min average values were recorded in data loggers cr1000 campbell scientific usa air temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate vapor pressure deficit vpd according to campbell and norman 1998 as follows 5 vpd 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 rh the daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 mm was calculated using

sensors were used to monitor soil water content swc of the 0 100 cm soil profile at various soil depths 6 12 30 50 70 and 90 cm in each site during 2012 2017 data was recorded as one hour averages on a hobo data logger h21 001 in yan an site and h21 002 in yongshou site onset computer corporation bourne ma usa soil moisture value for the whole 0 100 cm horizon was calculated by averaging the data with different contribution weight of the sensors within the horizon in addition the averaged data have been verified by those from other three profiles 0 300 cm periodically measured by a time domain reflectometry tdr moisture measurement system trime imko micromodultechnik ettlingen germany du et al 2011 2 4 physiological parameter measurements during the growing season of 2016 leaf level ecophysiological parameters leaf water potential stable carbon isotope composition stomatal density and specific leaf area were periodically measured for three representative trees at each site leaf water potential was measured at predawn ψpd mpa 04 00 h and midday ψmd mpa 13 00 h on four typical sunny days representing the normal physiological status of each sample tree for months from june to september in each measurement period three canopy leafstalks with their compound leaves for each sample tree were taken from different branches as replicates the water potential was measured by a pressure chamber model 1000 pms instruments usa connected with a nitrogen cylinder on the day of water potential measurements three groups of sample leaves were prepared according to the following method fifteen canopy leaves sampled from three branches five leaves per branch were pooled into one composite sample for each sample tree in one group of sample leaves a layer of colorless nail polish was applied to the surface of each leaf and peeled off after a few minutes when it hardened the number of stomata was recorded under a microscope and stomatal density across the leaf area was then calculated two other groups of sample leaves were kept in paper bags and taken to the laboratory one of them was dried milled and sifted through a 0 1 mm screen the obtained powder was used to measure the stable carbon isotope ratio δ13c in a mass spectrometer mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the other group was oven dried at 80 c for 24 h and weighed after making full scale copy images an area meter in windows was used to determine surface area of the leaf images and specific leaf area sla cm2 g 1 was calculated by dividing leaf area with dry leaf weight 2 5 data analyses the whole tree hydraulic conductance of the soil to leaf pathway g p ml m 2 s 1 mpa 1 was calculated according to the darcy equation cohen et al 1983 lu et al 1996 sperry 2000 as follows 7 g p f dmd ψ pd ψ md where f dmd is the sap flux density at midday ψpd was used to represent soil water potential the sapflow driving force was thus assumed to be the difference between ψpd and ψmd to investigate the responses of sap flow to microclimate an integrated variable of transpiration vt was computed with r s and vpd because vpd contributes approximately more than 2 3 of the driving force of transpiration green 1993 zhang et al 1997 vt kpa w m 2 1 2 was calculated as follows du et al 2011 8 vt vpd r s 1 2 where vpd is vapor pressure deficit and r s is solar radiation the relationship between j s and vt was analyzed by fitting an exponential saturation function following ewers et al 2007 and kumagai et al 2008 as 9 y a 1 e bx where y is j s x is vt and a and b are fitting parameters to examine the response of g c to vpd the linear logarithmic function was used following oren et al 1999 as 10 g c m lnvpd g cref where g c is canopy conductance m is the sensitivity of g c to vpd and g cref is the reference canopy stomatal conductance for vpd 1 kpa canopy resistance r c m2 s mol 1 is the inverse of canopy conductance r c 1 g c cohen and naor 2002 demonstrated a linear relationship could give a good fit to link r c and vpd the influence of vpd on r c was expressed as 11 r c a b vpd where a is the canopy resistance when vpd 0 and b is the slope correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between j s and environmental factors on monthly and annual scales the significant differences in the regression parameters of j s to vt between fitted equations eq 9 were assessed using the wald test analysis of covariance ancova was used to test significant differences in m and g cref in eq 10 between the two sites significant differences between physiological parameters in the two sites were checked using a t test the programs r 3 5 0 and spss 16 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa were used for statistical analyses graph plotting was performed with sigmaplot 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results 3 1 general status of environmental factors and stem sap flow at the two sites the annual precipitation p reference evapotranspiration et 0 p et 0 and averaged soil water contents at the two sites from 2012 to 2017 are shown in fig 1 the year 2013 was excluded because of substantial lack of data caused by power failure at the yongshou site while et 0 for each year was higher in yan an site p and p et 0 were higher in yongshou as expected the average soil moisture content was significantly lower at the yan an site fig 2 presents the daily values of main meteorological factors soil water content and mean plot sap flux density for the may september period throughout the experimental years at the two sites seasonal variation patterns of the meteorological factors were identical in the two sites reaching a peak in july and august in addition to seasonal variation j s at both sites showed interannual variations even though j s in the yongshou site was larger overall the values cannot be directly compared because of the differences in multiple environmental factors 3 2 responses of transpiration related traits to meteorological variables in the two sites 3 2 1 monthly and annual variations in j s in relation to environmental factors as a key parameter indicating canopy structure gas exchange base and tree phenology lai in both sites showed a regular pattern of seasonal variation with the values in yongshou site constantly higher during the full leaf period fig 3 the maximum lai appeared in july for yongshou site whereas lai in yan an site was close from june to august except for the stand factor lai the environmental factors that drive transpiration were interrelated rather than independent and therefore pearson correlation analysis was used to explore major factors of j s at monthly and annual scales tables 1 and 2 at the monthly timescale significant positive relationships were detected between j s and et 0 lai vpd and r s in the yongshou site however for the yan an site j s was positively correlated only with lai to statistical significance in other words variations in j s closely followed phenology at both sites and transpiration of black locust in the yongshou site was also largely dependent on et 0 and other transpiration driving factors r s and vpd on the annual scale although no obvious relationship was detected between j s and either p swc or p et 0 within the five years a significant correlation between j s and et 0 was observed in the yongshou site however j s at the yan an site was positively related to p swc and p et 0 revealing distinct limiting factors between the two sites 3 2 2 effects of rainfall on the environmental response pattern of sap flow to elucidate the effect of short term soil water changes on the sensitivity of j s to transpiration driving factors half hourly data sets of j s and vt were comparatively analyzed for the pre and post rainfall periods five clear days in each in 2016 as a representative the pre and post rainfall periods were divided by three or four rainfall events which amounted to 118 mm and 66 mm in yan an and yongshou sites respectively and caused increases in mean soil water contents within the horizon of 0 1 m from 11 to 18 and from 22 to 24 in the two sites respectively only datasets collected from 6 00 14 00 were used in this analysis to prevent the influence of hysteresis between j s and vt in each period j s could be significantly fitted to vt using the exponential saturation function fig 4 the effect of short term soil water changes was obvious in both sites indicated by clear separation of the pre and post rainfall groups table 3 summarizes the results of the j s vt regression fitting and the significance test of the difference in each parameter between the pre and post rainfall periods a significant difference in parameter b between the two periods in both sites suggested that j s tended to reach saturation level earlier after soil water recharge by a rainfall event however the difference in parameter a reached statistical significance only at the yongshou site indicating that at the yan an site the maximum level of j s was limited and not influenced by short term changes in soil water 3 2 3 responses of canopy conductance to vpd to explore the hydraulic control of black locust in response to vpd as represented by canopy conductance g c and canopy resistance r c under different site conditions daily g c and r c was calculated for the full leaf expansion period in june august in 2016 figs 5 and 6 to eliminate the effect of other factors only data sets for rain free days with a daily mean vpd 0 6 kpa were included in this calculation the results showed that g c declined significantly with vpd and vpd explained more than 70 of the variation in g c at both sites fig 5 significant differences in regression parameters m and g cref were observed between the two sites p 0 01 with lower m and higher g cref detected in the yongshou site the fluctuation of g c under a wider range of vpd was obviously weaker in yan an than in the yongshou site indicating less sensitivity of the trees in yan an site to transpiration driving factors an increasing linear relationship was significantly fitted to describe the correspondence between r c and vpd during the study period in both sites fig 6a c overall black locust in yan an site had higher r c and the slopes were also slightly greater with respect to yongshou site implying a higher sensitivity of r c in yan an site further analysis on the whole tree hydraulic conductance g p and r c fig 6d showed that g p was negatively related to the slope of r c as a function of vpd in both sites 3 3 comparison of transpiration related physiological parameters between the two sites during the growing season to illustrate the physiological changes between the two sites several related physiological variables leaf water potential sapflow driving force g p sla δ13c and stomatal density were measured during the 2016 growing season the mean values and statistical differences between the two sites are presented in table 4 no obvious difference was found in ψpd between the two sites p 0 05 however ψmd sapflow driving force and g p showed significant differences p 0 05 suggesting that black locust in yan an site continues to absorb soil water at midday by decreasing the leaf water potential which in turn increases the sapflow driving force and reduces the g p there were remarkable differences in the sla and δ13c between the two sites p 0 01 stomatal density was higher in yan an site p 0 05 these results indicate that black locust can improve water use efficiency and change leaf morphology to enhance its adaptability to dry sites 4 discussion 4 1 dominant environmental factors of sap flow variations differ with habitat and timescale black locust trees in the two sites which differ in precipitation and average soil water content showed distinct differences in their average growth rates and sap flux densities this was consistent with the expected linkage between soil water availability and the amounts of transpiration and photosynthetic production the results revealed that the dominant factors influencing sap flow vary with time scales and study sites tables 1 and 2 lai was the most important index of seasonal water use and positively correlated with j s this coincides with the opinion that the amount of foliage is the primary factor defining the level of transpired water and canopy photosynthesis baldocchi et al 1987 similarly jiao et al 2016 found that the variation in lai determines the magnitude and patterns of monthly transpiration in a black locust plantation near yan an the global syntheses by sun et al 2011 and fang et al 2016b also suggested that lai could be a proxy for estimating transpiration at the ecosystem level however the effects of et 0 r s and vpd on monthly sap flow were statistically significant only at the yongshou site this was in line with the relatively optimal water conditions in the yongshou site resulting in greater importance of factors driving transpiration demand novick et al 2016 reported that atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function accounting for 70 of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests whereas in yan an site the meteorological driving factors were abundant and thus showed lower importance similar findings have been observed on haloxylon ammodendron plantations in central asian deserts and pinus tabulaeformis plantation forests in the loess plateau region of china which showed that sensitivity of transpiration to environmental factors decreased with increasing soil water stress fang et al 2016a gu et al 2017 this pattern may be related to lower sensitivity of stomatal conductance to the environment and stronger soil plant hydraulic resistance during soil water depletion baert et al 2015 jiao et al 2019 over the five years the annual sap flow of black locust in yan an site was significantly related to precipitation soil water content and p et 0 suggesting a strong influence of soil water related factors a three year measurement of stand transpiration in the black locust forest at this semiarid site also revealed a close relationship between stand transpiration and soil water content zhang et al 2015 similarly a study on european larch in a dry area of the alps found that sap flow increased with et 0 only at lower et 0 and leveled off at higher values obojes et al 2018 in contrast the annual variation in sap flow at the yongshou site was largely governed by et 0 instead of soil water conditions the sapflow driving force required for transpiration was larger in the year with higher et 0 resulting in a higher sap flux density this demonstrated that black locust in yongshou was able to transpire abundant amounts of water and soil conditions at the site were not subjected to moisture stress it also agrees with the general viewpoint that transpiration is driven by et 0 but limited by soil water content li et al 2017 zhao et al 2006 reported that transpiration is primarily controlled by et 0 under higher soil water content whereas relative extractable soil water is more pronounced when soil water declines to a low level therefore atmospheric evaporative demand controls mainly the transpiration of black locust under ample water conditions whereas soil water availability has a stronger influence in relatively limited soil water conditions 4 2 soil water conditions affect the sensitivity of sap flow and canopy conductance to environmental factors short term soil water changes affected the regression parameters of the half hourly j s and vt datasets fig 4 table 3 the large difference in parameter b between the pre and post rainfall periods in both sites indicated that soil water recharge significantly improved water absorption and transportation this is consistent with previous studies reporting that the process of transpiration in black locust is sensitive to soil water conditions du et al 2011 he et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 wang et al 2017 with decreasing soil water content the maximum value of transpiration would decline bond et al 2007 however for the present data sets separated by a rainfall event the difference in parameter a was statistically significant only at the yongshou site and the effect of the rainfall event was relatively smaller at the yan an site this might be attributed to a general reduction in maximum j s in tress acclimatized to dry area thus showing the limited influence of temporary soil water recharge similar results have been found in a throughfall exclusion experiment which showed that prolonged exclusion of throughfall 5 years caused a substantial decrease in transpiration which could not be recovered through temporary soil water recharge he et al 2020 stomatal closure due to increasing evaporative demand in terms of vpd has been found in many species at the leaf level huang et al 2011 siddiq et al 2017 song et al 2020 wieser et al 2014 it is reasonable to assume that the stomatal regulation of water use evolved to conserve water and maintain water status within limits that prevent excessive dehydration and physiological damage oren et al 1999 significant negative relationships between g c and vpd in both study sites indicated a control of g c in relation to evaporative demand fig 5 considering that greater sensitivity is associated with higher g c at low vpd the g c of black locust in the yongshou site should be more sensitive to vpd compared with that in the yan an site g c at the yan an site showed less amplitude throughout the entire vpd range moreover the differences in parameters m and g cref were both statistically significant between the two sites a higher g cref is associated with a higher m oren et al 1999 siddiq et al 2017 further analysis on the relationship between r c and vpd showed a positively linear correlation in all months and both sites fig 6 in addition to the expected exhibition of generally greater r c in yan an site a negative relationship between g p and the slope of r c as a function of vpd was also observed this was in agreement with the study by nemera et al 2020 who compared the dependence of g p across five irrigation treatments this relation supports the generalized proposal of bucci et al 2004 who found in vitro measured leaf specific hydraulic conductivity being strongly connected with in vivo estimated soil to leaf hydraulic conductance the results demonstrated a strong interaction between stomatal control and the environment suggesting a gradual stomatal closure as vpd increases during the short term drought period black locust adjusts its hydraulic conductivity to reduce transpiration and recover from soil water recharge several researchers have reported that prolonged soil water limitation might decrease stomatal conductance and leaf area possibly to avoid excessive loss of water liu et al 2013 miyazawa et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however it irreversibly impairs the stomatal control in black locust leading to lower responses to environmental factors in the long term the responses of both transpiration and canopy conductance to environmental factors would change depending on soil water conditions bond et al 2007 decreased sensitivity to short term soil water recharge may reflect the general lower growth rate of the species at the drier site jin et al 2011 found that as drought intensified the relationship between sla and nitrogen concentration per unit leaf area changed from positive to insignificant or negative suggesting that the trees were under substantial stress from the dry condition this could partially explain the frequent emergence of rampike and dwarf forms under long term water deficit conditions in the semiarid loess plateau yamanaka et al 2014 in the current study both transpiration and dbh increment changed less in yan an site probably due to the adaptability of black locust to long term or severe drought since planting density and tree size were relatively stable among years further investigations with precipitation gradients and long term scales might help elucidate water use performance and drought tolerance strategies of black locust under diverse climate conditions 4 3 black locust developed different drought avoidance strategies in subhumid and semiarid sites tree species confronted with different habitats could undergo physiological and structural adjustment under conditions of soil or atmospheric drought they would manage themselves to minimize water loss and avoid hydraulic system failure breda et al 2006 mantovani et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in the present study the sapflow driving force g p sla δ13c and stomatal density showed obvious differences between the two sites table 4 small sla implies tougher leaves and may be correlated with increasing aridity reich et al 1999 yan et al 2010 whereas δ13c can be an indicator of long term integrated water use efficiency wue and water stress conditions nemera et al 2020 thus black locust at the yan an site developed tougher leaves higher sapflow driving force larger wue and greater stomatal density compared with that in the yongshou site similar changes in leaf traits under drought conditions have been observed in other species bhusal et al 2020 choat et al 2006 in dryer areas trees improve wue to enhance their adaptability to drought by changing leaf morphology and physiological characteristics ψmd significantly differed whereas ψpd was not statistically different between the two sites during the dry period in summer table 4 this phenomenon indicated that black locust at the yan an site tended to experience a substantial decrease in leaf water potential to maintain the assimilation rate but with a risk of xylem embolism prolonged drought may cause ψmd to fall below its usual levels and reduce the capacity of the hydraulic system cochard et al 1992 franks et al 2007 garcia forner et al 2016 hoffmann et al 2011 miyazawa et al 2018 suggested that reducing minimum leaf water potential was a risky strategy to alleviate the impact of drought conditions on photosynthesis in black locust it may even lead to extensive canopy dieback and whole plant mortality choat et al 2019 davis et al 2002 he et al 2020 in contrast to the temporary drought in the subhumid site long term adaptation to the semiarid environment caused black locust to develop different morphological and physiological traits related to water use strategies this finding should be incorporated into practice and afforestation programs 4 4 implications of possible responses of black locust plantations to climate change climate change in the loess plateau is expected to induce stress on forest hydrological cycles and productivity by reducing annual precipitation and increasing air temperature tao et al 2003 thomas 2000 wang et al 2011b the model simulation showed that precipitation decreased at a rate of 0 99 mm yr 1 and the temperature increased annually by an average of 0 02 c from 1951 to 2008 in the loess plateau lü et al 2012 moreover drought intensity and duration will increase in the future which presents a serious threat to sustainable tree growth and ecosystem stability liu et al 2018 peng et al 2017 yan et al 2017 in this study black locust trees in the yongshou site with relatively higher stomatal sensitivity to environmental factors may have an advantage in terms of growth whereas those in yan an site would be at risk of dehydration and even death due to looser stomatal regulation the rainfall exclusion experiment also suggested that multi year decreases in precipitation would weaken the tree s response to environmental factors resulting in substantial growth reduction he et al 2020 additionally zhang et al 2020 reported that along the precipitation gradient on the loess plateau the annual percentage loss of whole plant hydraulic conductance in black locust stands increased linearly with decreasing mean annual precipitation map and could exceed 60 at sites with map 446 mm implying a strong limitation to sustainable growth of the plantations therefore considering the water use characteristics and global climate change vegetation management should be strengthened to reduce degradation of black locust plantations in the semiarid region of the loess plateau such as appropriate afforestation density control thinning management management of soil to collect rainwater for usage 5 conclusions distinct transpiration characteristics of black locust plantations have been detected between semiarid and subhumid sites in the loess plateau monthly changes in sap flow were related mainly to phenological factors particularly lai on the annual scale sap flow was significantly affected by precipitation soil water content and p et 0 in the semiarid yan an site but it was sensitive to et 0 in the yongshou site indicating the high importance of transpiration demand in the subhumid site canopy conductance canopy resistance and sap flow responses to vt suggested that black locust at the yan an site was less sensitive to short term changes in soil water and meteorological factors the sapflow driving force g p sla stomatal density and δ13c all showed significant differences between the two sites the results suggest distinct adaptability and water use mechanisms of black locust in different water habitats black locust tended to reduce transpiration modify leaf morphology and improve water use efficiency to enhance its adaptability in dryer areas variations in water use and physiological traits of black locust along a wider range of rainfall gradients need further

9680,black locust robinia pseudoacacia is widely planted throughout semiarid and subhumid regions of the loess plateau of china determining the changes in transpiration of this species in different climatic areas is important for revealing the acclimation mechanism of black locust and developing suitable forest management practices particularly in the context of global climate change here sap flow and canopy conductance of black locust plantation trees in semiarid yan an and subhumid yongshou sites were quantified using granier type thermal dissipation probes and concurrent environmental observations from 2012 to 2017 several physiological parameters were measured throughout the growing season the results showed that sap flow was correlated with phenological factors across seasons within a year however interannual changes in sap flow were affected mainly by the reference evapotranspiration et 0 at the yongshou site and jointly by precipitation p soil water content and p et 0 at the yan an site sap flow response to meteorological factors showed less discrepancy between pre and post rainfall periods at the yan an site moreover canopy conductance fluctuated less with a wider range of vapor pressure deficit vpd and the slope of canopy resistance as a function of vpd was lower indicating relatively lower sensitivity of stomatal conductance to environmental factors in yan an site physiological parameters except for predawn leaf water potential were significantly different between the two sites the results suggested that black locust tended to reduce transpiration modify leaf morphology and improve water use efficiency to enhance its adaptability to the dryer site the species changes stomatal regulation characteristics and general growth rate to acclimatize to distinct water habitats keywords sap flow canopy conductance canopy resistance drought acclimation drought sensitivity ecophysiological characteristics 1 introduction transpiration the evaporation process by which water is transferred from the soil to the atmosphere through plants constitutes an important part in coupling terrestrial water cycling and energy balance jiao et al 2019 kumagai et al 2014 ungar et al 2013 it is generally accepted that water absorption by plant roots and transportation through stems are driven by the force of transpiration sap flow in the stem xylem is thus frequently measured as a direct indicator or proxy of tree transpiration a more generalized interpretation of canopy response to changing environmental conditions can be derived by quantifying canopy conductance gas exchange across a canopy stratum based on tree transpiration and concurrent environmental factors schaefer 2011 to date studies of tree transpiration and canopy conductance have focused mainly on single species forest stands or the comparison among several tree species for example by analyzing canopy conductance based on sap flow measurement chen et al 2012 found the same regulation of the hydraulic response to vapor pressure deficit across varying tree sizes and environmental conditions a study conducted in the semiarid loess plateau region of china compared transpiration characteristics in response to climatic factors of three tree species du et al 2011 however knowledge about acclimation in the transpiration characteristics of a species under different climatic environments remains inadequate transpiration is primarily determined by plant features including ecophysiological characteristics and growth status and environmental factors granier et al 1996 oren and pataki 2001 pataki and oren 2003 the influence of environmental factors on transpiration actualizes through two aspects evaporative demand i e potential evapotranspiration and soil water supply grossiord et al 2017 naithani et al 2012 tie et al 2017 reported that when the leaf area index dropped to a low value the dominant factor for sap flow changed from meteorological to physiological factor showing a seasonal switching behavior the influence of soil water content on transpiration has been explored by data fitting with linear logistic and polynomial functions chang et al 2014 lagergren and lindroth 2002 zhao and liu 2010 however even the same species showed various responses to environmental factors due to its habitat and age related or size related physiological characteristics delzon and loustau 2005 ewers et al 2005 irvine et al 2004 an investigation of mongolian pine in its natural populations and stands planted outside its natural range found that the latter had higher transpiration but lower stomatal sensitivity under water loss song et al 2020 information about how these environmental factors interact to influence tree transpiration and canopy conductance is accumulating such knowledge is critical for revealing control mechanisms of transpiration and developing the long term hydrological regime of forests black locust robinia pseudoacacia was introduced as a dominant afforestation species on the loess plateau in china because of its fast growth and efficient role in soil conservation liang et al 2018 wang et al 2011a however the soil water in its stands has been found to decline probably due to high water consumption by this species chen et al 2007 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 consequently black locust plantations experience reduced growth and present symptoms of early degradation in semiarid areas chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 liang et al 2018 recent studies on responses of transpiration to drought conditions based on pot experiments or a single stand revealed some ecophysiological adaptation mechanisms in black locust mantovani et al 2014 yan et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 related studies on multiple stands focusing on acclimation to different climatic sites are scarce but are necessary for the clarification of water use strategy and adaptation mechanisms in this species particularly in the loess plateau region this study analyzed the transpiration and ecophysiological characteristics of black locust trees from two representative climatic sites the semiarid and subhumid areas of the loess plateau we aimed to investigate the potential differences in transpiration between the two sites as well as their ecophysiological mechanisms specifically the objectives were to 1 compare the factors influencing transpiration at seasonal and annual scales 2 determine the differences in response patterns of transpiration and canopy conductance to environmental factors and 3 clarify transpiration related physiological and morphological traits of trees between the two sites 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in 2012 2017 in two black locust robinia pseudoacacia planted forests in shaanxi province in the chinese loess plateau one site was at the yongshou forest station 34 48 42 n 107 58 83 e 1430 m a s l near yongshou county dominated by a subhumid climate with mean annual precipitation map and annual mean temperature amt are 617 mm and 10 8 c respectively he et al 2020 the other site with a temperate semiarid climate was located at mount gonglushan 36 25 40 n 109 31 53 e 1353 m a s l near yan an city the map and amt are 504 mm and 10 1 c respectively shi et al 2014 most of the precipitation occurs from july september in both sites there is a permanent 20 m 20 m research plot at each site for multipurpose investigations of for example evapotranspiration soil respiration soil moisture dynamics and soil microbial biology cheng et al 2020 du et al 2011 he et al 2020 shi et al 2014 tian et al 2017 yan et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in the year of 2012 the robinia stand in yan an site was an approximately 31 year old plantation on a southeast facing slope the density of tree stands was 2950 trees ha 1 the soil was derived from silt textured loess parent material which belongs to calcic cambisol group based on the food and agriculture organization fao classification system wang et al 2003 in yongshou site the plot on a northeast facing slope had been in place for 32 years tree density was 1600 trees ha 1 the soil texture was predominantly loam clay which belongs to anthrosols according to the fao classification system rong et al 2020 the leaf area index lai in each plot was measured once a month during the growing seasons may september in 2012 2017 using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor lincoln ne usa to avoid transient changes in sky conditions and influence from direct sunlight the measurement was conducted either under an overcast weather or during a period of very low solar elevation around sunset 2 2 sap flow measurement and canopy conductance estimate throughout the study period xylem sap flow was measured using granier type sensors granier 1987 in seven individuals representing the major diameters at breast height dbh classes in each site the average dbh at the yongshou site was 18 04 1 24 cm in 2012 and 20 34 1 51 cm in 2017 with an increment of 2 31 0 38 cm the respective dbh and increment at the yan an site were 10 83 1 05 cm 11 31 0 96 cm and 0 72 0 05 cm each sensor consisted of a pair of 10 mm long cylindrical probes with diameters of 2 mm a continuously heated upper probe supplied with 0 15 w of constant power and an unheated lower probe as a temperature reference james et al 2002 the probes were inserted into the sapwood vertically 15 cm apart at breast height of tree stems and two pairs were installed on the opposite sides of each sample tree to calculate their averages and for quality control of the measurements in case one sensor runs abnormally the temperature difference between the two probes was scanned every 30 s as a voltage value and the 30 min average was recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa with a multiplexer am16 32 campbell scientific usa sap flux density was calculated based on the measured temperature difference by using the empirical equation

d 0 and δt is the temperature difference between the two probes baseliner software was used to determine δt max as provided by oishi et al 2016 as the sapwood thickness of some sample trees was less than the probe length of 10 mm corrected values δt sw were used in those trees instead of the measured values δt for the temperature difference in eq 1 following the correction equation established by clearwater et al 1999 2 t sw t 1 a t max a where a is the proportion of the probe in the sapwood δt is the measured temperature difference between the two probes and δt sw is the actual temperature

core sample analysis an increment borer was applied to drill core samples regression equations of a s with dbh were derived from core samples taken from 15 randomly selected trees around the plots as a s 0 0096 dbh2 43 for the yongshou site and a s 0 1197 dbh1 5546 for the yan an site canopy conductance g c mol m 2 s 1 was calculated using a simplified formula established by kostner et al 1992 4 g

was measured with a pyranometer li 200 li cor inc usa and air temperature and relative humidity were monitored using a thermohygrograph hmp50 in yan an site and hmp110 in yongshou site vaisala helsinki finland the above two instruments were both mounted 2 m above the ground level a tipping bucket rain gauge davis 7852 davis instruments hayward ca usa approximately 0 5 m above ground was used to measure precipitation these data were sampled every 30 s and the 30 min average values were recorded in data loggers cr1000 campbell scientific usa air temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate vapor pressure deficit vpd according to campbell and norman 1998 as follows 5 vpd 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 rh the daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 mm was calculated using

ecophysiological parameters leaf water potential stable carbon isotope composition stomatal density and specific leaf area were periodically measured for three representative trees at each site leaf water potential was measured at predawn ψpd mpa 04 00 h and midday ψmd mpa 13 00 h on four typical sunny days representing the normal physiological status of each sample tree for months from june to september in each measurement period three canopy leafstalks with their compound leaves for each sample tree were taken from different branches as replicates the water potential was measured by a pressure chamber model 1000 pms instruments usa connected with a nitrogen cylinder on the day of water potential measurements three groups of sample leaves were prepared according to the following method fifteen canopy leaves sampled from three branches five leaves per branch were pooled into one composite sample for each sample tree in one group of sample leaves a layer of colorless nail polish was applied to the surface of each leaf and peeled off after a few minutes when it hardened the number of stomata was recorded under a microscope and stomatal density across the leaf area was then calculated two other groups of sample leaves were kept in paper bags and taken to the laboratory one of them was dried milled and sifted through a 0 1 mm screen the obtained powder was used to measure the stable carbon isotope ratio δ13c in a mass spectrometer mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the other group was oven dried at 80 c for 24 h and weighed after making full scale copy images an area meter in windows was used to determine surface area of the leaf images and specific leaf area sla cm2 g 1 was calculated by dividing leaf area with dry leaf weight 2 5 data analyses the whole tree hydraulic conductance of the soil to leaf pathway g p ml m 2 s 1 mpa 1 was calculated according to the darcy equation cohen et al 1983 lu et al 1996 sperry 2000 as follows 7 g p f dmd ψ pd ψ md where f dmd is the sap flux density at midday ψpd was used to represent soil water potential the sapflow driving force was thus assumed to be the difference between ψpd and ψmd to investigate the responses of sap flow to microclimate an integrated variable of transpiration vt was computed with r s and vpd because vpd contributes approximately more than 2 3 of the driving force of transpiration green 1993 zhang et al 1997 vt kpa w m 2 1 2 was calculated as follows du et al 2011 8 vt vpd r s 1 2 where vpd is vapor pressure deficit and r s is solar radiation the relationship between j s and vt was analyzed by fitting an exponential saturation function following ewers et al 2007 and kumagai et al 2008 as 9 y a 1 e bx where y is j s x is vt and a and b are fitting parameters to examine the response of g c to vpd the linear logarithmic function was used following oren et al 1999 as 10 g c m lnvpd g cref where g c is canopy conductance m is the sensitivity of g c to vpd and g cref is the reference canopy stomatal conductance for vpd 1 kpa canopy resistance r c m2 s mol 1 is the inverse of canopy conductance r c 1 g c cohen and naor 2002 demonstrated a linear relationship could give a good fit to link r c and vpd the influence of vpd on r c was expressed as 11 r c a b vpd where a is the canopy resistance when vpd 0 and b is the slope correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between j s and environmental factors on monthly and annual scales the significant differences in the regression parameters of j s to vt between fitted equations eq 9 were assessed using the wald test analysis of covariance ancova was used to test significant differences in m and g cref in eq 10 between the two sites significant differences between physiological parameters in the two sites were checked using a t test the programs r 3 5 0 and spss 16 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa were used for statistical analyses graph plotting was performed with sigmaplot 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results 3 1 general status of environmental factors and stem sap flow at the two sites the annual precipitation p reference evapotranspiration et 0 p et 0 and averaged soil water contents at the two sites from 2012 to 2017 are shown in fig 1 the year 2013 was excluded because of substantial lack of data caused by power failure at the yongshou site while et 0 for each year was higher in yan an site p and p et 0 were higher in yongshou as expected the average soil moisture content was significantly lower at the yan an site fig 2 presents the daily values of main meteorological factors soil water content and mean plot sap flux density for the may september period throughout the experimental years at the two sites seasonal variation patterns of the meteorological factors were identical in the two sites reaching a peak in july and august in addition to seasonal variation j s at both sites showed interannual variations even though j s in the yongshou site was larger overall the values cannot be directly compared because of the differences in multiple environmental factors 3 2 responses of transpiration related traits to meteorological variables in the two sites 3 2 1 monthly and annual variations in j s in relation to environmental factors as a key parameter indicating canopy structure gas exchange base and tree phenology lai in both sites showed a regular pattern of seasonal variation with the values in yongshou site constantly higher during the full leaf period fig 3 the maximum lai appeared in july for yongshou site whereas lai in yan an site was close from june to august except for the stand factor lai the environmental factors that drive transpiration were interrelated rather than independent and therefore pearson correlation analysis was used to explore major factors of j s at monthly and annual scales tables 1 and 2 at the monthly timescale significant positive relationships were detected between j s and et 0 lai vpd and r s in the yongshou site however for the yan an site j s was positively correlated only with lai to statistical significance in other words variations in j s closely followed phenology at both sites and transpiration of black locust in the yongshou site was also largely dependent on et 0 and other transpiration driving factors r s and vpd on the annual scale although no obvious relationship was detected between j s and either p swc or p et 0 within the five years a significant correlation between j s and et 0 was observed in the yongshou site however j s at the yan an site was positively related to p swc and p et 0 revealing distinct limiting factors between the two sites 3 2 2 effects of rainfall on the environmental response pattern of sap flow to elucidate the effect of short term soil water changes on the sensitivity of j s to transpiration driving factors half hourly data sets of j s and vt were comparatively analyzed for the pre and post rainfall periods five clear days in each in 2016 as a representative the pre and post rainfall periods were divided by three or four rainfall events which amounted to 118 mm and 66 mm in yan an and yongshou sites respectively and caused increases in mean soil water contents within the horizon of 0 1 m from 11 to 18 and from 22 to 24 in the two sites respectively only datasets collected from 6 00 14 00 were used in this analysis to prevent the influence of hysteresis between j s and vt in each period j s could be significantly fitted to vt using the exponential saturation function fig 4 the effect of short term soil water changes was obvious in both sites indicated by clear separation of the pre and post rainfall groups table 3 summarizes the results of the j s vt regression fitting and the significance test of the difference in each parameter between the pre and post rainfall periods a significant difference in parameter b between the two periods in both sites suggested that j s tended to reach saturation level earlier after soil water recharge by a rainfall event however the difference in parameter a reached statistical significance only at the yongshou site indicating that at the yan an site the maximum level of j s was limited and not influenced by short term changes in soil water 3 2 3 responses of canopy conductance to vpd to explore the hydraulic control of black locust in response to vpd as represented by canopy conductance g c and canopy resistance r c under different site conditions daily g c and r c was calculated for the full leaf expansion period in june august in 2016 figs 5 and 6 to eliminate the effect of other factors only data sets for rain free days with a daily mean vpd 0 6 kpa were included in this calculation the results showed that g c declined significantly with vpd and vpd explained more than 70 of the variation in g c at both sites fig 5 significant differences in regression parameters m and g cref were observed between the two sites p 0 01 with lower m and higher g cref detected in the yongshou site the fluctuation of g c under a wider range of vpd was obviously weaker in yan an than in the yongshou site indicating less sensitivity of the trees in yan an site to transpiration driving factors an increasing linear relationship was significantly fitted to describe the correspondence between r c and vpd during the study period in both sites fig 6a c overall black locust in yan an site had higher r c and the slopes were also slightly greater with respect to yongshou site implying a higher sensitivity of r c in yan an site further analysis on the whole tree hydraulic conductance g p and r c fig 6d showed that g p was negatively related to the slope of r c as a function of vpd in both sites 3 3 comparison of transpiration related physiological parameters between the two sites during the growing season to illustrate the physiological changes between the two sites several related physiological variables leaf water potential sapflow driving force g p sla δ13c and stomatal density were measured during the 2016 growing season the mean values and statistical differences between the two sites are presented in table 4 no obvious difference was found in ψpd between the two sites p 0 05 however ψmd sapflow driving force and g p showed significant differences p 0 05 suggesting that black locust in yan an site continues to absorb soil water at midday by decreasing the leaf water potential which in turn increases the sapflow driving force and reduces the g p there were remarkable differences in the sla and δ13c between the two sites p 0 01 stomatal density was higher in yan an site p 0 05 these results indicate that black locust can improve water use efficiency and change leaf morphology to enhance its adaptability to dry sites 4 discussion 4 1 dominant environmental factors of sap flow variations differ with habitat and timescale black locust trees in the two sites which differ in precipitation and average soil water content showed distinct differences in their average growth rates and sap flux densities this was consistent with the expected linkage between soil water availability and the amounts of transpiration and photosynthetic production the results revealed that the dominant factors influencing sap flow vary with time scales and study sites tables 1 and 2 lai was the most important index of seasonal water use and positively correlated with j s this coincides with the opinion that the amount of foliage is the primary factor defining the level of transpired water and canopy photosynthesis baldocchi et al 1987 similarly jiao et al 2016 found that the variation in lai determines the magnitude and patterns of monthly transpiration in a black locust plantation near yan an the global syntheses by sun et al 2011 and fang et al 2016b also suggested that lai could be a proxy for estimating transpiration at the ecosystem level however the effects of et 0 r s and vpd on monthly sap flow were statistically significant only at the yongshou site this was in line with the relatively optimal water conditions in the yongshou site resulting in greater importance of factors driving transpiration demand novick et al 2016 reported that atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function accounting for 70 of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests whereas in yan an site the meteorological driving factors were abundant and thus showed lower importance similar findings have been observed on haloxylon ammodendron plantations in central asian deserts and pinus tabulaeformis plantation forests in the loess plateau region of china which showed that sensitivity of transpiration to environmental factors decreased with increasing soil water stress fang et al 2016a gu et al 2017 this pattern may be related to lower sensitivity of stomatal conductance to the environment and stronger soil plant hydraulic resistance during soil water depletion baert et al 2015 jiao et al 2019 over the five years the annual sap flow of black locust in yan an site was significantly related to precipitation soil water content and p et 0 suggesting a strong influence of soil water related factors a three year measurement of stand transpiration in the black locust forest at this semiarid site also revealed a close relationship between stand transpiration and soil water content zhang et al 2015 similarly a study on european larch in a dry area of the alps found that sap flow increased with et 0 only at lower et 0 and leveled off at higher values obojes et al 2018 in contrast the annual variation in sap flow at the yongshou site was largely governed by et 0 instead of soil water conditions the sapflow driving force required for transpiration was larger in the year with higher et 0 resulting in a higher sap flux density this demonstrated that black locust in yongshou was able to transpire abundant amounts of water and soil conditions at the site were not subjected to moisture stress it also agrees with the general viewpoint that transpiration is driven by et 0 but limited by soil water content li et al 2017 zhao et al 2006 reported that transpiration is primarily controlled by et 0 under higher soil water content whereas relative extractable soil water is more pronounced when soil water declines to a low level therefore atmospheric evaporative demand controls mainly the transpiration of black locust under ample water conditions whereas soil water availability has a stronger influence in relatively limited soil water conditions 4 2 soil water conditions affect the sensitivity of sap flow and canopy conductance to environmental factors short term soil water changes affected the regression parameters of the half hourly j s and vt datasets fig 4 table 3 the large difference in parameter b between the pre and post rainfall periods in both sites indicated that soil water recharge significantly improved water absorption and transportation this is consistent with previous studies reporting that the process of transpiration in black locust is sensitive to soil water conditions du et al 2011 he et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 wang et al 2017 with decreasing soil water content the maximum value of transpiration would decline bond et al 2007 however for the present data sets separated by a rainfall event the difference in parameter a was statistically significant only at the yongshou site and the effect of the rainfall event was relatively smaller at the yan an site this might be attributed to a general reduction in maximum j s in tress acclimatized to dry area thus showing the limited influence of temporary soil water recharge similar results have been found in a throughfall exclusion experiment which showed that prolonged exclusion of throughfall 5 years caused a substantial decrease in transpiration which could not be recovered through temporary soil water recharge he et al 2020 stomatal closure due to increasing evaporative demand in terms of vpd has been found in many species at the leaf level huang et al 2011 siddiq et al 2017 song et al 2020 wieser et al 2014 it is reasonable to assume that the stomatal regulation of water use evolved to conserve water and maintain water status within limits that prevent excessive dehydration and physiological damage oren et al 1999 significant negative relationships between g c and vpd in both study sites indicated a control of g c in relation to evaporative demand fig 5 considering that greater sensitivity is associated with higher g c at low vpd the g c of black locust in the yongshou site should be more sensitive to vpd compared with that in the yan an site g c at the yan an site showed less amplitude throughout the entire vpd range moreover the differences in parameters m and g cref were both statistically significant between the two sites a higher g cref is associated with a higher m oren et al 1999 siddiq et al 2017 further analysis on the relationship between r c and vpd showed a positively linear correlation in all months and both sites fig 6 in addition to the expected exhibition of generally greater r c in yan an site a negative relationship between g p and the slope of r c as a function of vpd was also observed this was in agreement with the study by nemera et al 2020 who compared the dependence of g p across five irrigation treatments this relation supports the generalized proposal of bucci et al 2004 who found in vitro measured leaf specific hydraulic conductivity being strongly connected with in vivo estimated soil to leaf hydraulic conductance the results demonstrated a strong interaction between stomatal control and the environment suggesting a gradual stomatal closure as vpd increases during the short term drought period black locust adjusts its hydraulic conductivity to reduce transpiration and recover from soil water recharge several researchers have reported that prolonged soil water limitation might decrease stomatal conductance and leaf area possibly to avoid excessive loss of water liu et al 2013 miyazawa et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however it irreversibly impairs the stomatal control in black locust leading to lower responses to environmental factors in the long term the responses of both transpiration and canopy conductance to environmental factors would change depending on soil water conditions bond et al 2007 decreased sensitivity to short term soil water recharge may reflect the general lower growth rate of the species at the drier site jin et al 2011 found that as drought intensified the relationship between sla and nitrogen concentration per unit leaf area changed from positive to insignificant or negative suggesting that the trees were under substantial stress from the dry condition this could partially explain the frequent emergence of rampike and dwarf forms under long term water deficit conditions in the semiarid loess plateau yamanaka et al 2014 in the current study both transpiration and dbh increment changed less in yan an site probably due to the adaptability of black locust to long term or severe drought since planting density and tree size were relatively stable among years further investigations with precipitation gradients and long term scales might help elucidate water use performance and drought tolerance strategies of black locust under diverse climate conditions 4 3 black locust developed different drought avoidance strategies in subhumid and semiarid sites tree species confronted with different habitats could undergo physiological and structural adjustment under conditions of soil or atmospheric drought they would manage themselves to minimize water loss and avoid hydraulic system failure breda et al 2006 mantovani et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in the present study the sapflow driving force g p sla δ13c and stomatal density showed obvious differences between the two sites table 4 small sla implies tougher leaves and may be correlated with increasing aridity reich et al 1999 yan et al 2010 whereas δ13c can be an indicator of long term integrated water use efficiency wue and water stress conditions nemera et al 2020 thus black locust at the yan an site developed tougher leaves higher sapflow driving force larger wue and greater stomatal density compared with that in the yongshou site similar changes in leaf traits under drought conditions have been observed in other species bhusal et al 2020 choat et al 2006 in dryer areas trees improve wue to enhance their adaptability to drought by changing leaf morphology and physiological characteristics ψmd significantly differed whereas ψpd was not statistically different between the two sites during the dry period in summer table 4 this phenomenon indicated that black locust at the yan an site tended to experience a substantial decrease in leaf water potential to maintain the assimilation rate but with a risk of xylem embolism prolonged drought may cause ψmd to fall below its usual levels and reduce the capacity of the hydraulic system cochard et al 1992 franks et al 2007 garcia forner et al 2016 hoffmann et al 2011 miyazawa et al 2018 suggested that reducing minimum leaf water potential was a risky strategy to alleviate the impact of drought conditions on photosynthesis in black locust it may even lead to extensive canopy dieback and whole plant mortality choat et al 2019 davis et al 2002 he et al 2020 in contrast to the temporary drought in the subhumid site long term adaptation to the semiarid environment caused black locust to develop different morphological and physiological traits related to water use strategies this finding should be incorporated into practice and afforestation programs 4 4 implications of possible responses of black locust plantations to climate change climate change in the loess plateau is expected to induce stress on forest hydrological cycles and productivity by reducing annual precipitation and increasing air temperature tao et al 2003 thomas 2000 wang et al 2011b the model simulation showed that precipitation decreased at a rate of 0 99 mm yr 1 and the temperature increased annually by an average of 0 02 c from 1951 to 2008 in the loess plateau lü et al 2012 moreover drought intensity and duration will increase in the future which presents a serious threat to sustainable tree growth and ecosystem stability liu et al 2018 peng et al 2017 yan et al 2017 in this study black locust trees in the yongshou site with relatively higher stomatal sensitivity to environmental factors may have an advantage in terms of growth whereas those in yan an site would be at risk of dehydration and even death due to looser stomatal regulation the rainfall exclusion experiment also suggested that multi year decreases in precipitation would weaken the tree s response to environmental factors resulting in substantial growth reduction he et al 2020 additionally zhang et al 2020 reported that along the precipitation gradient on the loess plateau the annual percentage loss of whole plant hydraulic conductance in black locust stands increased linearly with decreasing mean annual precipitation map and could exceed 60 at sites with map 446 mm implying a strong limitation to sustainable growth of the plantations therefore considering the water use characteristics and global climate change vegetation management should be strengthened to reduce degradation of black locust plantations in the semiarid region of the loess plateau such as appropriate afforestation density control thinning management management of soil to collect rainwater for usage 5 conclusions distinct transpiration characteristics of black locust plantations have been detected between semiarid and subhumid sites in the loess plateau monthly changes in sap flow were related mainly to phenological factors particularly lai on the annual scale sap flow was significantly affected by precipitation soil water content and p et 0 in the semiarid yan an site but it was sensitive to et 0 in the yongshou site indicating the high importance of transpiration demand in the subhumid site canopy conductance canopy resistance and sap flow responses to vt suggested that black locust at the yan an site was less sensitive to short term changes in soil water and meteorological factors the sapflow driving force g p sla stomatal density and δ13c all showed significant differences between the two sites the results suggest distinct adaptability and water use mechanisms of black locust in different water habitats black locust tended to reduce transpiration modify leaf morphology and improve water use efficiency to enhance its adaptability in dryer areas variations in water use and physiological traits of black locust along a wider range of rainfall gradients need further

citrus trees with the increased mortality and need to resetting trees the demand for healthy trees from citrus nurseries has risen drastically in the last few years to meet the demand and accelerate tree growth the citrus nursery industry should use modern horticultural practices such as more efficient irrigation methods fertigation and more vigorous rootstocks this study evaluated the effect of subirrigation systems in tree production time water and fertilizer inputs and plant growth of commercial citrus rootstocks cultivated in treepots we tested five irrigation methods three ebb and flow

soil borne diseases and hlb has propelled the nursery industry in the last decade reducing water and fertilizer waste while improving rootstock development is a milestone that nurseries should try to achieve in this era of hlb the most common irrigation systems used in protected plant production are overhead and drip irrigation davies and zalman 2008 yeager et al 2010 open systems do not reuse or recirculate the fertilizer solution increasing water consumption and wasting fertilizer koech and langat 2018 tüzel et al 2001 in contrast closed systems such as subirrigation can control soil

successfully by the greenhouse industry to produce citrus liners tomatoes and various leafy vegetables and other woody plants barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a incrocci et al 2006 nicola et al 2007 santamaria et al 2003 a preceding study conducted by jani et al 2021 determined that subirrigation methods accelerated the establishment and development of six commercially available citrus rootstock liners in cone shaped containers compared to seedlings grown under standard nursery overhead irrigation the study revealed that ebb and flow subirrigation at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 produced taller liners with more biomass than plants under the traditional nursery irrigation method recirculating systems are suitable for reducing the leaching of nutrients through the soil profile and water consumption rootstock seedlings grown in cone shaped containers need to be transferred to a larger pot treepot for adequate tree growth the transplanting procedure is essential for improved root development uptake of nutrients and fast canopy growth until grafting small containers are excellent for growing rootstock seedlings while larger containers induce vigorous tree growth in the nursery the use of subirrigation methods coupled with capacitance sensors in large containers can reduce human labor as the sensors trigger the irrigation based on a certain volumetric substrate content θ threshold limited information is available on using subirrigation methods during the growth and development of rootstock liners in treepots prior to grafting and their effects on water management and environmental sustainability this study evaluated biometric and substrate physicochemical parameters of commercially available rootstocks grown in treepots under distinct irrigation methods we hypothesized that ebb and flow subirrigation accelerates the plant growth of commercial citrus liners transplanted into treepots while reducing water and fertilizer use 2 material and methods 2 1

thresholds the θ in the ebb and flow θ of 0 36 m3 m 3 was unusually variable and irrigation was activated above the set limit for 2 3 of the study fig 1 b drip irrigation and capillary mat resulted in the lowest θ during the experiment ranging from 0 22 to 0 32 and 0 19 0 33 m3 m 3 respectively with values below the lowest ebb and flow treatment between 0 33 and 0 65 m3 m 3 ebb and flow methods utilized a fraction of water compared to capillary mats and drip irrigation p 0 05 fig 2a drip irrigation used 32 more water than the three ebb and flow treatments p 0 05 fig 2a within the ebb and flow benches the thresholds used to trigger the irrigation did not affect water use which averaged 424l throughout the experiment p 0 05 fig 2a nor the volume of water moved through the system p 0 05 fig 2c despite the relatively small amount of water used the ebb and flow system at 0 48 m3 m 3 moved 3 more water than drip irrigation p 0 05 fig 2c because of the large number of irrigation events in comparison to capillary mats and drip irrigation which used a fixed irrigation schedule during the study p 0 05 fig 2b 3 2 plant growth both irrigation methods and rootstocks influenced plant height throughout the experiment p 0 05 table 2 at week 19 ebb and flow benches triggered by θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 produced plants 18 taller compared to θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 and with 18 thicker stems than capillary mats p 0 05 tables 2 and 3 however neither was significantly different p 0 05 from the conventional drip irrigation system irrespective of the irrigation system utilized ufr 16 and us 802 rootstocks were the tallest and thickest rootstocks at the end of the study with the smallest being us 812 p 0 05 tables 2 and 3 at week 1 stem diameter varied with the interaction between the irrigation system and rootstock varieties p 0 05 table 3 ufr 2 us 802 and kuharske had stems 29 thicker under drip irrigation than ufr 16 us 812 and x 639 p 0 05 uppercase letters fig 3 only ufr 16 and ufr 2 had distinct stem diameter responses depending on the irrigation method utilized p 0 05 lowercase letters fig 3 ebb and flow subirrigation at 0 24 m3 m 3 increased stem thickness in ufr 16 compared to drip irrigation for ufr 2 the capillary mat was detrimental for stem development compared to drip irrigation p 0 05 lowercase letters fig 3 3 3 root fresh and dry weight the production of fresh roots varied with the irrigation methods and rootstock variety tested capillary mats produced 265 more fresh roots from week 1 15 table 4 conventional drip irrigation increased fresh root production by 173 in the same period in contrast θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 yielded the highest root fresh production among the ebb and flow levels tested 125 compared to 120 and 109 for θ of 0 36 and θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 respectively ufr 16 and us 802 hybrids produced more roots than kuharske us 812 and x 639 varieties throughout the study p 0 05 table 4 at week 19 root fresh weight dropped in all the rootstock varieties tested except ufr 16 us 802 and ufr 2 the significant interaction between irrigation systems and rootstock varieties on week 15 fig 4 shows that in all the ebb and flow subirrigation treatments kuharske and us 812 presented the lowest root fresh weight compared to ufr 16 p 0 05 table 4 fig 4 uppercase letters ufr 2 fresh root weight was higher than us 812 in ebb and flow ɵ 0 24 m3 m 3 and drip irrigation p 0 05 fig 4 uppercase letters additionally ufr 16 was the only rootstock with higher root fresh weight across the different irrigation methods fig 4 lowercase letters drip irrigation resulted in less biomass than ebb and flow ɵ 0 24 and ɵ 0 36 m3 m 3 root dry weight was influenced by the irrigation levels on weeks 7 and 15 and in both weeks θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 had higher root weight than drip irrigation table 5 at week 19 the biomass of plants under θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 ebb and flow threshold and capillary mat irrigation averaged 8 16 and 8 02 g respectively data not shown at the end of the experiment rootstocks ufr 2 ufr 16 and us 802 produced more root dry weight than the other rootstocks tested interaction between the irrigation methods and the rootstocks was not significant for dry weight 3 4 canopy fresh and dry weight in this experiment irrigation methods influenced canopy fresh weight only at week 15 table 6 as the conventional drip irrigation yielded higher canopy weights than the ebb and flow systems at thresholds with θ of 0 36 and θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 at the same time rootstock variety significantly affected fresh canopy weight during the study p 0 05 table 6 at most measurements canopy fresh weight for ufr 16 was more than double that of kuharske us 812 and x 639 rootstocks p 0 05 table 6 though not significantly different from ufr 2 and us 802 at the start of the experiment canopy fresh weight was affected by the interaction between the irrigation method and rootstock only at week 15 p 0 05 table 6 two varieties were observed to have canopy fresh with distinguished weights ufr 16 and us 812 p 0 05 fig 5 uppercase letters ufr 16 had higher canopy fresh weight irrespective of the irrigation method utilized while us 812 performed poorly in all the irrigation treatments ufr 2 was the only rootstock with significant differences within irrigation methods p 0 05 fig 5 lowercase letters as conventional drip irrigation yielded higher canopy fresh weight than the capillary mat the dry canopy weight showed no significant differences for the irrigation treatments as with the fresh canopy weight however the canopy dry weight was influenced by the genetic differences among the rootstocks p 0 05 table 7 ufr 16 ufr 2 and us 802 showed the highest dry weight over time table 7 with ufr 16 being consistently the most elevated no interactions were found between the irrigation treatments and rootstocks 3 5 nutrient concentration in fertilizer solution as expected macro and micro nutrients changed over time depending on the irrigation system p 0 05 table 8 the only mineral elements that did not significantly differ for irrigation methods were magnesium sulfate zinc and manganese all statistically significant nutrients for irrigation methods had maximum concentration levels at the highest ebb and flow threshold θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 a reduction of nitrate ammonia calcium and sulfate concentrations was observed in the fertilizer solution from week 1 11 due to nutrient uptake by plants p 0 05 table 8 fig 6 nitrogen as nitrate was the only mineral element that decreased by 24 7 from week 1 19 p 0 05 table 8 3 6 substrate electric conductivity and ph this study supplied plants with the same fertilizer solution using three different irrigation systems ebb and flow drip irrigation and capillary mat with the same fertilizer solution formulation a common problem from subirrigation systems is the accumulation of salt in the upper substrate layers with the potential to cause damage to the root apexes and new feeder roots impairing nutrient uptake in this study the fertigation solution was completed to the tank s capacity every week with the same solution therefore the changes observed in electric conductivity are possibly due to the roots uptake fig 7 drip irrigation had the lowest electric conductivities since the fertilizer solution percolated through the substrate p 0 05 table 9 on the contrary supplying fertigation via capillary mats might have accumulated a higher concentration of salts throughout the substrate mainly because the bottom of the pot is constantly in contact with the fertilizer solution p 0 05 table 9 from weeks 14 19 all irrigation methods reached a plateau of electric conductivity with drip irrigation lower than the other irrigation methods in the last three weeks of the study fig 7 ebb and flow systems yielded similar substrate electrical conductivity p 0 05 table 9 fig 7 under drip and capillary mat irrigation systems ph values over 7 were found in weeks 2 4 6 and 9 p 0 05 fig 8 whereas under ebb and flow systems with θ thresholds of 0 36 and 0 48 had ph in the 5 5 6 5 range for the same weeks fig 8 for the ebb and flow θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold the ph values were slightly lower than 5 5 throughout the experiment fig 8 although not statistically different than the other ebb and flow treatments table 9 substrate ph under drip irrigation was lower than the other irrigation methods towards the end weeks 14 19 fig 8 substrate ph variated by rootstock and irrigation method applied p 0 05 table 9 amongst the rootstocks ufr 2 and us 802 under capillary mat irrigation had slightly more acidic substrate ph p 0 05 uppercase letters on fig 9 while x 639 kuharske and us 812 substrates were marginally higher in addition kuharske and x 639 had different responses for substrate ph within the irrigation system p 0 05 lowercase letters fig 9 as ebb and flow system threshold at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 yielding the lowest substrate ph in contrast the capillary mat had the highest ph values 4 discussion the ebb and flow system at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 used 98 less water than the conventional drip irrigation system fig 2 a water conservation using the ebb and flow system is well known gent and mcavoy 2011 incrocci et al 2006 a previous study under the same conditions found that ebb and flow systems saved 86 of water compared to overhead irrigation jani et al 2021 the use of ebb and flow irrigation can also decrease nutrient leaching throughout the soil profile reducing groundwater contamination as the excess fertilizer solution is circulated back to the tank over time dole et al 1994 fig 2 c groundwater contamination with residues from agriculture has been an environmental challenge in modern agriculture the reuse of water is appealing as a tool to optimize production systems in citrus nurseries as the irrigation system applies fertilizer inputs to supply necessary fertilizer and water for plant growth ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b plant availability from nurseries is one of the bottlenecks of citrus production in florida as the resetting of plants affected by hlb has increased exponentially over the last decade burani arouca et al 2016 our study shows that using capacitance sensors to trigger ebb and flow irrigation at the θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 produced citrus rootstocks with the same height as conventional drip irrigation a study in brazil showed that regulated deficit irrigation did not influence the timeline for transplanting citrus liners girardi et al 2018 indicating that a low threshold for automated irrigation is viable in citrus nursery production although florida citrus liner transplanting guidelines are still scarce vincent et al 2020 state that the rootstocks must be at least 9 55 cm in diameter before planting in our study the ebb and flow irrigation at the θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 yielded rootstocks with the minimum stem diameter for field planting earlier compared to capillary irrigation table 3 and fig 3 rootstock hybrids have been used in citrus production for decades and their effects on scion performance are well documented albrecht et al 2012 2019b dubey and sharma 2016 laino et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 taylor and dimsey 1993 establishing a rootstock variety that performs well in the nursery increases the chances of a positive field response when grafted with the scion of interest especially under the pressure of hlb albrecht et al 2012 plant height and stem diameter are the main parameters that nurseries target to produce high quality trees for new field plantings or resetting vincent et al 2020 zekri 2018 the hybrids ufr 16 and us 802 produced taller plants table 2 and thicker stems table 3 than the other varieties tested in this study irrespective of the irrigation method used the pummelo parentage can be seen in the vigorous growth of both ufr 16 and us 802 compared to us 812 ufr 16 and us 802 grew 45 7 and 28 9 cm respectively while us 812 grew only 12 4 cm from week 1 19 ufr 16 is a hybrid from the shekwasha mandarin and hirado buntan pink pummelo citrus reticulata citrus grandis while us 802 is a hybrid of siamese pummelo with gotha road trifoliate orange poncirus trifoliata citrus grandis pummelos are often used as the female parent of a hybrid due to the natural vigor and faster implementation of the young tree in the field bowman et al 2016 bowman and albrecht 2020 the significant interaction in stem diameter could help the nursery choose the best irrigation method for the rootstock of interest or vice versa fig 3 canopy growth depends on several factors root development status nutrient and water availability and genetics a vigorous rootstock usually induces higher canopy biomass in the field in this study pummelo hybrids ufr 16 ufr 2 and us 802 had heavier canopy than kuharske us 812 and x 639 selections by the end of the trial tables 6 7 this indicates that the genetic pedigree of the rootstocks influenced the growth and development despite the irrigation system used fuller canopy development is one of the primary genetic responses inherited from the parentals used during the breeding process of pummelo as all the listed hybrid rootstocks used in this study have citrus grandis as one of the parents combined with the irrigation system ufr 16 and ufr 2 had the most significant canopy weight using little water at the θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 fig 5 these interactions between irrigation and rootstock are crucial to determine the best combination for future field plantings while saving time and water in nursery operations nogueira et al 2009 like the canopy and stem measurements root fresh and dry weight varied depending on the rootstock tested tables 4 5 fig 4 at the end of the experiment pummelo hybrids ufr 16 ufr 2 and us 802 had the largest fresh and dry root weights week 19 at week 15 pummelo hybrids ufr 16 and ufr 2 yielded the heaviest fresh roots under ebb and flow subirrigation levels fig 4 maximizing its growth towards the end of the study a decline in fresh root production was observed on week 19 relatively to week 15 in all ebb and flow treatments probably due to the limited space available in the pots for root growth nevertheless on weeks 7 and 15 θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold accumulated more dry weight than drip irrigation evidence that low threshold values can increase root growth improving water and nutrient uptake table 5 as citrus roots are naturally shallow the increase in root volume is crucial for plant development at the nursery and the field clas reduces the root growth in citrus plants affected by hlb johnson et al 2014 by selecting rootstocks capable of developing roots before hlb infection scions have a higher probability of growing and surviving under field conditions albrecht and bowman 2019 bisi et al 2020 bowman and albrecht 2020 grosser et al 2016 2014 the constant supply of nutrients to crops under hydroponic systems is the foundation for optimal plant growth however upon the continuous presence of ions at the roots phytotoxic problems can occur the fertilizer solution had all ions except for sulfate below optimum levels according to the citrus seedling production guideline bataglia et al 2008 even so none of the rootstocks showed symptoms of leaf nutrient deficiencies we noticed a reduction of fertilizer solution concentration from week 1 19 due to nutrient use by the plants for growing p 0 05 table 8 the significant interaction between irrigation method and week of sampling for nitrate fig 6 presented a similar response from the plant over the weeks of the study and could be explained by the increase in canopy volume and root growth tables 3 7 the sharp decrease in nitrate concentration in the last sampling week could result from increased fertilizer uptake by the plant even replenishing the fertilizer solution tank with fresh solution several factors affect nutrient availability in the substrate such as the concentration of the elements organic matter content and ph the adequate ph for absorption of vital elements by roots should range between 5 5 and 6 5 substrates under subirrigation systems are more likely to accumulate salts in the upper layers and be more acidic due to ammonia in fertilizers rouphael et al 2006 the substrates with ph 7 are probably the result of anion uptake from the fertilizer solution by plant roots santamaria et al 2003 substrate electrochemical properties are analyzed to inform potential jeopardizing conditions for the plant s root development electric conductivities reached a plateau from weeks 14 19 table 9 week 14 represents the first week of march 2019 when warmer weather and higher solar radiation might have stimulated new growth fig 7 maximizing nutrient uptake in our study the ebb and flow systems decreased substrate ph and increased electrical conductivity compared with drip irrigation fig 8 similar to previous reports bouchaaba et al 2015 incrocci et al 2006 rouphael et al 2008 2006 an increase in the substrate or water ph over neutral ph 7 is detrimental to the overall health of citrus plants ghimire et al 2020 shahzad et al 2021 moreover none of the irrigation methods applied in this study had ph over 7 although kuharske us 812 and x 639 yielded higher substrate ph under capillary mats irrigation fig 9 the lower substrate ph under ebb and flow irrigation between 5 1 and 5 2 did not compromise nutrient delivery in our study as the rootstocks developed without showing nutritional deficiency or toxicity symptoms the use of the ebb and flow system has been tested and refined over the last decades in vegetable and ornamental crops chen et al 2001 ferrarezi et al 2015b gent and mcavoy 2011 nicola et al 2007 ristvey et al 2019 wortman 2015 and citrus more recently ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a b jani et al 2021 our study shows that ebb and flow systems can accelerate rootstock growth in 30 days while reducing the leaching of fertilizers and chemicals into the ground 5 conclusions in the hlb era keeping citrus grove production is essential for the future of the industry growers requests for healthy trees for new plantings and resetting have created a higher demand from the nursery than before nurseries need to employ environmentally acceptable practices to produce more trees in a short period as a conventional irrigation system does not support such demand we demonstrated that an ebb and flow subirrigation system with a threshold of θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 to trigger irrigation accelerated the production of selected rootstock varieties under greenhouse conditions and the water use decreased drastically compared to the conventional irrigation system used by nurseries such a subirrigation system can increase monthly tree production and save inputs such as water and fertilizer future applications of a subirrigation system described in this study in

9681,over the past decade citrus production has sharply decreased in florida because of citrus greening or huanglongbing hlb a disease that reduces fruit yield and quality and eventually kills the citrus trees with the increased mortality and need to resetting trees the demand for healthy trees from citrus nurseries has risen drastically in the last few years to meet the demand and accelerate tree growth the citrus nursery industry should use modern horticultural practices such as more efficient irrigation methods fertigation and more vigorous rootstocks this study evaluated the effect of subirrigation systems in tree production time water and fertilizer inputs and plant growth of commercial citrus rootstocks cultivated in treepots we tested five irrigation methods three ebb and flow subirrigation systems triggered at specific volumetric water contents θ 0 24 0 36 and 0 48 m3 m 3 capillary mats and a conventional drip irrigation system and six commercial rootstocks kuharske ufr 2 ufr 16 us 802 us 812 and x 639 the experiment was arranged in a split plot design with the main plot consisting of the five irrigation methods and sub plots the different rootstocks ebb and flow

method utilized although the substrate electrical conductivity was higher in all subirrigation methods the values were below 1 ds cm 1 not causing symptoms of osmotic stress in plants our results show that the ebb and flow subirrigation system at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 is the best option for accelerating citrus growth in treepots with peat perlite substrate and to conserve water in florida nurseries in

commercial varieties are known to be hlb resistant alves et al 2021 as growers must replant trees to maintain productivity in hlb affected groves citrus nurseries started experiencing high demand for healthy trees the trees need to have specific standards such as homogenous size substantial root growth and good survival in the field vashisth et al 2020 the constant need for field ready trees creates operational challenges for the nurseries such as reduced turnaround time to produce a tree limited labor inefficient water and fertilizer management and the potential for groundwater contamination phogat et al 2014 simonne et al 2010 nurseries can increase tree supply for field replanting by choosing suitable rootstocks enhancing horticultural practices such as irrigation systems

soil borne diseases and hlb has propelled the nursery industry in the last decade reducing water and fertilizer waste while improving rootstock development is a milestone that nurseries should try to achieve in this era of hlb the most common irrigation systems used in protected plant production are overhead and drip irrigation davies and zalman 2008 yeager et al 2010 open systems do not reuse or recirculate the fertilizer solution increasing water consumption and wasting fertilizer koech and langat 2018 tüzel et al 2001 in contrast closed systems such as subirrigation can control soil moisture improve water and fertilizer usage more precisely and create a unique and favorable root environment for plant development ferrarezi et al 2015a hunter et al 2018 subirrigation has been used successfully by the greenhouse industry to produce citrus liners tomatoes and various leafy vegetables and other woody plants barreto et al 2015 ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a incrocci et al 2006 nicola et al 2007 santamaria et al 2003 a preceding study conducted by jani et al 2021 determined that subirrigation methods accelerated the establishment and development of six commercially available citrus rootstock liners in cone shaped containers compared to seedlings grown under standard nursery overhead irrigation the study revealed that ebb and flow subirrigation at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 produced taller liners with more biomass than plants under the traditional nursery irrigation method recirculating systems are suitable for reducing the leaching of nutrients through the soil profile and water consumption rootstock seedlings grown in cone shaped containers need to be transferred to a larger pot treepot for adequate tree growth the transplanting procedure is essential for improved root development uptake of nutrients and fast canopy growth until grafting small containers are excellent for growing rootstock seedlings while larger containers induce vigorous tree growth in the nursery the use of subirrigation methods coupled with capacitance sensors in large containers can reduce human labor as the sensors trigger the irrigation based on a certain volumetric substrate content θ threshold limited information is available on using subirrigation methods during the growth and development of rootstock liners in treepots prior to grafting and their effects on water management and environmental sustainability this study evaluated biometric and substrate physicochemical parameters of commercially available rootstocks grown in treepots under distinct irrigation methods we hypothesized that ebb and flow subirrigation accelerates the plant growth of commercial citrus liners transplanted into treepots while reducing water and fertilizer use 2 material and methods 2 1

thresholds the θ in the ebb and flow θ of 0 36 m3 m 3 was unusually variable and irrigation was activated above the set limit for 2 3 of the study fig 1 b drip irrigation and capillary mat resulted in the lowest θ during the experiment ranging from 0 22 to 0 32 and 0 19 0 33 m3 m 3 respectively with values below the lowest ebb and flow treatment between 0 33 and 0 65 m3 m 3 ebb and flow methods utilized a fraction of water compared to capillary mats and drip irrigation p 0 05 fig 2a drip irrigation used 32 more water than the three ebb and flow treatments p 0 05 fig 2a within the ebb and flow benches the thresholds used to trigger the irrigation did not affect water use which averaged 424l throughout the experiment p 0 05 fig 2a nor the volume of water moved through the system p 0 05 fig 2c despite the relatively small amount of water used the ebb and flow system at 0 48 m3 m 3 moved 3 more water than drip irrigation p 0 05 fig 2c because of the large number of irrigation events in comparison to capillary mats and drip irrigation which used a fixed irrigation schedule during the study p 0 05 fig 2b 3 2 plant growth both irrigation methods and rootstocks influenced plant height throughout the experiment p 0 05 table 2 at week 19 ebb and flow benches triggered by θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 produced plants 18 taller compared to θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 and with 18 thicker stems than capillary mats p 0 05 tables 2 and 3 however neither was significantly different p 0 05 from the conventional drip irrigation system irrespective of the irrigation system utilized ufr 16 and us 802 rootstocks were the tallest and thickest rootstocks at the end of the study with the smallest being us 812 p 0 05 tables 2 and 3 at week 1 stem diameter varied with the interaction between the irrigation system and rootstock varieties p 0 05 table 3 ufr 2 us 802 and kuharske had stems 29 thicker under drip irrigation than ufr 16 us 812 and x 639 p 0 05 uppercase letters fig 3 only ufr 16

compared to drip irrigation for ufr 2 the capillary mat was detrimental for stem development compared to drip irrigation p 0 05 lowercase letters fig 3 3 3 root fresh and dry weight the production of fresh roots varied with the irrigation methods and rootstock variety tested capillary mats produced 265 more fresh roots from week 1 15 table 4 conventional drip irrigation increased fresh root

not significant for dry weight 3 4 canopy fresh and dry weight in this experiment irrigation methods influenced canopy fresh weight only at week 15 table 6 as the conventional drip irrigation yielded higher canopy weights than the ebb and flow systems at thresholds with θ of 0 36 and θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 at the same time rootstock variety significantly affected fresh canopy weight during the study p 0

at the start of the experiment canopy fresh weight was affected by the interaction between the irrigation method and rootstock only at week 15 p 0 05 table 6 two varieties were observed to have canopy

all the irrigation treatments ufr 2 was the only rootstock with significant differences within irrigation methods p 0 05 fig 5 lowercase letters as conventional drip irrigation yielded higher canopy fresh weight than the capillary mat the dry canopy weight showed no significant differences for the irrigation treatments as with the fresh canopy weight however the canopy dry weight was influenced by the genetic differences among the rootstocks p 0 05 table 7 ufr 16 ufr 2 and us 802 showed the highest dry weight over time table 7 with ufr 16 being consistently the most elevated no interactions were found between the irrigation treatments and rootstocks 3 5 nutrient concentration in fertilizer solution as expected macro and micro nutrients changed over time depending on the irrigation system p 0 05 table 8 the only mineral elements that did not significantly differ for irrigation methods were magnesium sulfate zinc and manganese all statistically significant nutrients for irrigation methods had maximum concentration levels at the highest ebb and flow threshold θ of 0 48 m3 m 3 a reduction of nitrate ammonia calcium and sulfate concentrations was observed in the fertilizer solution from week 1 11 due to nutrient uptake by plants p 0 05 table 8 fig 6 nitrogen as nitrate was the only mineral element that decreased by 24 7 from week 1 19 p 0 05 table 8 3 6 substrate electric conductivity and ph this study supplied plants with the same fertilizer solution using three different irrigation systems ebb and flow drip irrigation and capillary mat with the same fertilizer solution formulation a common problem from subirrigation systems is the accumulation of salt in the upper substrate layers with the potential to cause damage to the root apexes and new feeder roots impairing nutrient uptake in this study the fertigation solution was completed to the tank s capacity every week with the same solution therefore the changes observed in electric conductivity are possibly due to the roots uptake fig 7 drip irrigation had the lowest electric conductivities since the fertilizer solution percolated through the substrate p 0 05 table 9 on the contrary supplying fertigation via capillary mats might have accumulated a higher concentration of salts throughout the substrate mainly because the bottom of the pot is constantly in contact with the fertilizer solution p 0 05 table 9 from weeks 14 19 all irrigation methods reached a plateau of electric conductivity with drip irrigation lower than the other irrigation methods in the last three weeks of the study fig 7 ebb and flow systems yielded similar substrate electrical conductivity p 0 05 table 9 fig 7 under drip and capillary mat irrigation systems ph values over 7 were found in weeks 2 4 6 and 9 p 0 05 fig 8 whereas under ebb and flow systems with θ thresholds of 0 36 and 0 48 had ph in the 5 5 6 5 range for the same weeks fig 8 for the ebb and flow θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold the ph values were slightly lower than 5 5 throughout the experiment fig 8 although not statistically different than the other ebb and flow treatments table 9 substrate ph under drip irrigation was lower than the other irrigation methods towards the end weeks 14 19 fig 8 substrate ph variated by rootstock and irrigation method applied p 0 05 table 9 amongst the rootstocks ufr 2 and us 802 under capillary mat irrigation had slightly more acidic substrate ph p 0 05 uppercase letters on fig 9 while x 639 kuharske and us 812 substrates were marginally higher in addition kuharske and x 639 had different responses for substrate ph within the irrigation system p 0 05 lowercase letters fig 9 as ebb and flow system threshold at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 yielding the lowest substrate ph in contrast the capillary mat had the highest ph values 4 discussion the ebb and flow system at θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 used 98 less water than the conventional drip irrigation system fig 2 a water conservation using the ebb and flow system is well known gent and mcavoy 2011 incrocci et al 2006 a previous study under the same conditions found that ebb and flow systems saved 86 of water compared to overhead irrigation jani et al 2021 the use of ebb and flow irrigation can also decrease nutrient leaching throughout the soil profile reducing groundwater contamination as the excess fertilizer solution is circulated back to the tank over time dole et al 1994 fig 2 c groundwater contamination with residues from agriculture has been an environmental challenge in modern agriculture the reuse of water is appealing as a tool to optimize production systems in citrus nurseries as the irrigation system applies fertilizer inputs to supply necessary fertilizer and water for plant growth ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017b plant availability from nurseries is one of the bottlenecks of citrus production in florida as the resetting of plants affected by hlb has increased exponentially over the last decade burani arouca et al 2016 our study shows that using capacitance sensors to trigger ebb and flow irrigation at the θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 produced citrus rootstocks with the same height as conventional drip irrigation a study in brazil showed that regulated deficit irrigation did not influence the timeline for transplanting citrus liners girardi et al 2018 indicating that a low threshold for automated irrigation is viable in citrus nursery production although florida citrus liner transplanting guidelines are still scarce vincent et al 2020 state that the rootstocks must be at least 9 55 cm in diameter before planting in our study the ebb and flow irrigation at the θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 yielded rootstocks with the minimum stem diameter for field planting earlier compared to capillary irrigation table 3 and fig 3 rootstock hybrids have been used in citrus production for decades and their effects on scion performance are well documented albrecht et al 2012 2019b dubey and sharma 2016 laino et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 taylor and dimsey 1993 establishing a rootstock variety that performs well in the nursery increases the chances of a positive field response when grafted with the scion of interest especially under the pressure of hlb albrecht et al 2012 plant height and stem diameter are the main parameters that nurseries target to produce high quality trees for new field plantings or resetting vincent et al 2020 zekri 2018 the hybrids ufr 16 and us 802 produced taller plants table 2 and thicker stems table 3 than the other varieties tested in this study irrespective of the irrigation method used the pummelo parentage can be seen in the vigorous growth of both ufr 16 and us 802 compared to us 812 ufr 16 and us 802 grew 45 7 and 28 9 cm respectively while us 812 grew only 12 4 cm from week 1 19 ufr 16 is a hybrid from the shekwasha mandarin and hirado buntan pink pummelo citrus reticulata citrus grandis while us 802 is a hybrid of siamese pummelo with gotha road trifoliate orange poncirus trifoliata citrus grandis pummelos are often used as the female parent of a hybrid due to the natural vigor and faster implementation of the young tree in the field bowman et al 2016 bowman and albrecht 2020 the significant interaction in stem diameter could help the nursery choose the best irrigation method for the rootstock of interest or vice versa fig 3 canopy growth depends on several factors root development status nutrient and water availability and genetics a vigorous rootstock usually induces higher canopy biomass in the field in this study pummelo hybrids ufr 16 ufr 2 and us 802 had heavier canopy than kuharske us 812 and x 639 selections by the end of the trial tables 6 7 this indicates that the genetic pedigree of the rootstocks influenced the growth and development despite the irrigation system used fuller canopy development is one of the primary genetic responses inherited from the parentals used during the breeding process of pummelo as all the listed hybrid rootstocks used in this study have citrus grandis as one of the parents combined with the irrigation system ufr 16 and ufr 2 had the most significant canopy weight using little water at the θ threshold of 0 24 m3 m 3 fig 5 these interactions between irrigation and rootstock are crucial to determine the best combination for future field plantings while saving time and water in nursery operations nogueira et al 2009 like the canopy and stem measurements root fresh and dry weight varied depending on the rootstock tested tables 4 5 fig 4 at the end of the experiment pummelo hybrids ufr 16 ufr 2 and us 802 had the largest fresh and dry root weights week 19 at week 15 pummelo hybrids ufr 16 and ufr 2 yielded the heaviest fresh roots under ebb and flow subirrigation levels fig 4 maximizing its growth towards the end of the study a decline in fresh root production was observed on week 19 relatively to week 15 in all ebb and flow treatments probably due to the limited space available in the pots for root growth nevertheless on weeks 7 and 15 θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 threshold accumulated more dry weight than drip irrigation evidence that low threshold values can increase root growth improving water and nutrient uptake table 5 as citrus roots are naturally shallow the increase in root volume is crucial for plant development at the nursery and the field clas reduces the root growth in citrus plants affected by hlb johnson et al 2014 by selecting rootstocks capable of developing roots before hlb infection scions have a higher probability of growing and surviving under field conditions albrecht and bowman 2019 bisi et al 2020 bowman and albrecht 2020 grosser et al 2016 2014 the constant supply of nutrients to crops under hydroponic systems is the foundation for optimal plant growth however upon the continuous presence of ions at the roots phytotoxic problems can occur the fertilizer solution had all ions except for sulfate below optimum levels according to the citrus seedling production guideline bataglia et al 2008 even so none of the rootstocks showed symptoms of leaf nutrient deficiencies we noticed a reduction of fertilizer solution concentration from week 1 19 due to nutrient use by the plants for growing p 0 05 table 8 the significant interaction between irrigation method and week of sampling for nitrate fig 6 presented a similar response from the plant over the weeks of the study and could be explained by the increase in canopy volume and root growth tables 3 7 the sharp decrease in nitrate concentration in the last sampling week could result from increased fertilizer uptake by the plant even replenishing the fertilizer solution tank with fresh solution several factors affect nutrient availability in the substrate such as the concentration of the elements organic matter content and ph the adequate ph for absorption of vital elements by roots should range between 5 5 and 6 5 substrates under subirrigation systems are more likely to accumulate salts in the upper layers and be more acidic due to ammonia in fertilizers rouphael et al 2006 the substrates with ph 7 are probably the result of anion uptake from the fertilizer solution by plant roots santamaria et al 2003 substrate electrochemical properties are analyzed to inform potential jeopardizing conditions for the plant s root development electric conductivities reached a plateau from weeks 14 19 table 9 week 14 represents the first week of march 2019 when warmer weather and higher solar radiation might have stimulated new growth fig 7 maximizing nutrient uptake in our study the ebb and flow systems decreased substrate ph and increased electrical conductivity compared with drip irrigation fig 8 similar to previous reports bouchaaba et al 2015 incrocci et al 2006 rouphael et al 2008 2006 an increase in the substrate or water ph over neutral ph 7 is detrimental to the overall health of citrus plants ghimire et al 2020 shahzad et al 2021 moreover none of the irrigation methods applied in this study had ph over 7 although kuharske us 812 and x 639 yielded higher substrate ph under capillary mats irrigation fig 9 the lower substrate ph under ebb and flow irrigation between 5 1 and 5 2 did not compromise nutrient delivery in our study as the rootstocks developed without showing nutritional deficiency or toxicity symptoms the use of the ebb and flow system has been tested and refined over the last decades in vegetable and ornamental crops chen et al 2001 ferrarezi et al 2015b gent and mcavoy 2011 nicola et al 2007 ristvey et al 2019 wortman 2015 and citrus more recently ferrarezi and testezlaf 2017a b jani et al 2021 our study shows that ebb and flow systems can accelerate rootstock growth in 30 days while reducing the leaching of fertilizers and chemicals into the ground 5 conclusions in the hlb era keeping citrus grove production is essential for the future of the industry growers requests for healthy trees for new plantings and resetting have created a higher demand from the nursery than before nurseries need to employ environmentally acceptable practices to produce more trees in a short period as a conventional irrigation system does not support such demand we demonstrated that an ebb and flow subirrigation system with a threshold of θ of 0 24 m3 m 3 to trigger irrigation accelerated the production of selected rootstock varieties under greenhouse conditions and the water use decreased drastically compared to the conventional irrigation system used by nurseries such a subirrigation system can increase monthly tree production and save inputs such as water and fertilizer future applications of a subirrigation system described in this study in

9682,the shortage of freshwater resources is a considerable challenge for agricultural production in the north china plain ncp safe and efficient use of saline water resources is thus urgently required to reveal the effects of different salinities of irrigation water on the yield and soil quality of mulched drip irrigated cotton a field experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 five salinity levels of irrigation water were included 1 3 t1 control 5 4 t2 8 8 t3 12 4 t4 and 15 9 t5 ds m 1 the results showed that the harvesting density and seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water saline water irrigation with salinity 8 8 ds m 1 did not lead to salt accumulation in the main root zone 0 60 cm with each passing year but a decrease of salt in 2018 in the third year of saline water irrigation with the increase in irrigation water salinity the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e soil sodium adsorption ratio sar ph and bulk density bd in the plow layer gradually increased however the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks water stable macroaggregate 0 25 mm content catalase cat and urease ure activity decreased with increasing salinity moreover the soil organic carbon soc content and alkaline phosphatase alp activity increased first and then decreased irrigation water salinity 5

soil quality index sqi of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 1 2 10 5 16 5 and 23 7 respectively considering cotton yield soil salt accumulation and sqi mulched drip irrigation is conducive to the sustainability of cotton with saline water levels below 5 4 ds m 1 graphical abstract ga1 keywords mulched drip irrigation yield components salt accumulation soil physicochemical properties soil enzyme activity 1 introduction globally there are more than 2 billion people living in countries with water shortages and as many as 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year un water 2019 as such the global water shortage problem is becoming increasingly serious in the north china plain ncp where freshwater resources are extremely scarce the amount of freshwater resources per capita is less than 1 12 of that worldwide the ncp is one of the principal areas in the production of grains and cotton in china due to extreme shortages of surface water in this region deep groundwater has been overexploited for an extended time which seriously affects the sustainable utilization of water resources and the stable development of agriculture however as an alternative source of fresh water shallow underground saline water resources in this area are abundant and widely distributed li and ren 2021 as a representative area the hebei low plain located in the northeast of the ncp has a total shallow underground saline water storage capacity of 1 54 1010 m3 distributed over 91 8 of the total area cao et al 2007 nonetheless less than 10 of the total saline water is utilized the scientific and rational utilization of saline water is of great importance to address the supply and demand antinomy of water resources li et al 2015 irrigation with saline water not only increases soil moisture but also may lead to soil salinization cotton has a strong salt tolerance and is often used as a pioneer crop for saline water irrigation maas et al 1986 zhang et al 2016 some scholars have indicated that appropriate soil salt brought by saline water has few effects on cotton growth and yield or even promotes them bezborodov et al 2010 yang et al 2020 among them yang et al 2020 found that mulched drip irrigation with saline water at 3 g l 1 could promote cotton yield compared with 1 g l 1 treatment however salt accumulation may occur with long term saline water irrigation posing a potential threat to both the soil environment and crop growth zheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in terms of soil response sameni and morshedi 2000 reported that soil structure and hydraulic conductivity were affected under saline water irrigation due to swelling and dispersion of clay particles yang et al 2020 found that saline water irrigation could increase soil ph and change the composition of ions in soil feigen et al 1991 indicated that excessive sodium ions in irrigation water resulted in the dispersion and expansion of soil particles which could damage the aggregate structure and led to surface soil compaction zhang et al 2015b found that saline water irrigation reduced soil microbial biomass and inhibit the activity of soil enzymes thus reducing the degradation rate of organic carbon ensuring that the soil quality does not deteriorate is an important goal for the sustainable development of agriculture with saline water irrigation however due to the complexity and slow evolution of soil quality it is difficult to observe changes in soil quality nortcliff 2002 to better describe the soil quality of cotton fields quantitatively under saline water irrigation the soil quality index sqi has been proposed the sqi includes characteristics that represent certain soil functions and have wide ranging applications in addition to exhibiting sensitivity reliability and ease of observation carter et al 1997 erkossa et al 2007 karlen et al 1996 through principal component analysis pca a minimum data set mds of the sqi is established and the sqi is then calculated andrews et al 2002 larson and pierce 1994 mandal et al 2008 zhang et al 2020a this method has been widely used and has achieved good results feng 2014a zhang et al 2020a the selection of an appropriate irrigation technique is also a key issue in the utilization of saline water conventional surface irrigation techniques have been mostly used for saline water irrigation of cotton in the ncp feng et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 reported the effects of saline water furrow and border irrigation on the accumulation of soil salt and the emergence growth and yield of cotton indicating that the irrigation water salinity threshold values were 7 1 and 8 8 ds m 1 respectively additionally zhang et al 2020a studied the effects of saline water border irrigation on soil physicochemical properties cotton yield fiber quality and final soil quality and suggested that irrigation water salinity 3 4 ds m 1 was suitable for long term use compared with conventional surface irrigation drip irrigation has the advantages of a smaller irrigation quota less salt accumulation in the soil a higher irrigation frequency and creation of a desalination zone for roots kang et al 2010 thus regarded as the most suitable method for saline water irrigation shalhevet 1994 currently there have been many studies on saline water drip irrigation in cotton rajak et al 2006 reported that cotton growth and yield under drip irrigation with saline water of 2 2 ds m 1 were even better than those under furrow irrigation with fresh water of 0 25 ds m 1 in china saline water drip irrigation is mainly applied in northwest arid areas yang et al 2020 studied the changes in soil salinity soil chemical properties and cotton yield under saline water mulched drip irrigation indicating that saline water salinities below 6 g l 1 were suitable for cotton irrigation min et al 2016 reported that saline water drip irrigation reduced cotton biomass and yield with irrigation water salinity increasing from 0 35 to 8 04 ds m 1 taken together there are significant differences in the effects of saline water irrigation on cotton in different areas using different irrigation methods however fewer studies have investigated the effects of saline water mulched drip irrigation on cotton growth and soil quality in the ncp in this study saline water mulched drip irrigation of cotton was employed to 1 understand the response of cotton yield to different salinities of drip irrigation water 2 analyze the effects of saline water drip irrigation on soil salinity 3 explore the effects of drip irrigation with different salinity levels of irrigation water on soil physicochemical properties and 4 determine the salinity threshold of saline water drip irrigation in the ncp through a soil quality assessment the findings of this study will enrich the understanding of saline water irrigation in the ncp and be of great importance for safe utilization of saline water and sustainable agricultural development 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted at the hengshui experimental station 37 44 n 115 47 e and 21 m above sea level located in the ncp from 2017 to 2019 this station is characterized by a semihumid and semiarid climate with an annual sunshine duration of 2509 h the mean maximum and minimum annual temperatures are 12 8 19 1 and 7 9 respectively the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 500 and 1785 mm respectively the soil texture of the station is loam and the groundwater depth is below 5 m the ec e ph sar bd water stable aggregate 0 25 mm content and field capacity measured according to the field technique from fao irrigation and drainage paper 45 of the top 20 cm soil layer before the experiment in 2017 were 2 65 ds m 1 7 94 2 88 mmol l 1 1 2 1 32 g cm 3 47 92 and 0 32 cm3 cm 3 respectively soil organic matter available nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents in the plow layer were 11 5 g kg 1 76 mg kg 1 15 mg kg 1 and 112 mg kg 1 respectively an automatic meteorological observation station was used to record rainfall and other data temperature wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and solar radiation at the site 2 2 experimental design the experimental plots were arranged in a randomized block design with each treatment having three replicate plots of size 37 62 m2 5 7 m 6 6 m before sowing a total of 750 kg ha 1 of compound fertilizer 15 n 15 p2o5 and 15 k2o was applied to the plots which was followed by rotary tillage seeds of cotton gossypium hirsutum l cultivar ji 863 were sown on 27 apr 2017 26 apr 2018 and 23 apr 2019 cotton harvested on 3 nov 2017 1 nov 2018 and 1 nov 2019 cotton was manually sown at intervals of 30 cm along the drip line with alternating wide narrow spacing 80 50 cm between rows the planting mode for cotton under mulched drip irrigation mainly includes two parts mulching area and bare soil area a schematic diagram of cotton planting is shown in fig 1 for the drip irrigation system the irrigation water was prepared in a removable tank 3 m3 using deep groundwater 110 m below the soil surface and calculated amount of salt and then pumped into each plot each row of cotton was laid with a drip tube 10 tubes per plot after sowing with 30 cm spacing between emitters and 3 l h 1 flow rate per emitter at a work pressure of 0 1 mpa the lateral spacing between drip lines was the same as that of the cotton rows the irrigation amount was measured using a water meter and controlled using a water tight valve previous studies have indicated that film mulch is necessary for saline water irrigated cotton in the ncp dong et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 because it has the essential effects of reducing soil evaporation increasing soil temperature inhibiting salt accumulation on the soil surface and promoting cotton yield therefore narrow rows of cotton plants were mulched with transparent plastic film as a basic agronomic measure and the bare soil area was equal to the mulching area fig 1 no drainage system existed in the experimental field according to li and ren 2021 in the heilonggang region where the experimental station is located the areas distributing shallow groundwater with salinities ranging from 1 to 10 g l 1 approximately 1 3 17 7 ds m 1 accounted for approximately 81 of the total area therefore five salinity levels of irrigation water were tested in the study 1 3 t1 control 5 4 t2 8 8 t3 12 4 t4 and 15 9 t5 ds m 1 the shallow saline groundwater in the study area was mainly formed by continental salinization and seawater intrusion and primarily included na and cl ions zhou et al 2008 therefore the irrigation water for the t2t5 treatments 5 4 15 9 ds m 1 was obtained by mixing deep groundwater 1 3 ds m 1 with sea salt mainly na and cl ions the ion content in irrigation water is presented in table 1 drip irrigation was applied immediately after sowing in 2017 and 2019 owing to heavy rainfall 48 mm in 2018 prior to sowing no irrigation was applied immediately after sowing soil moisture at a depth of 060 cm with 10 cm intervals underneath drip lines was measured using the drying method at 10 day intervals the plots were irrigated when the soil moisture of the planned wetting layer 0 30 cm at the seedling stage 0 40 cm at the squaring stage and 0 60 cm at the flowering stage underneath the drip lines was below 70 of the field capacity θ f because of the continental monsoon climate with simultaneous rain and heat in the ncp rainfall can basically satisfy the growth of cotton however a short period of drought often occurs in the early growth stages zhang et al 2020b therefore for the intent of water savings 20 mm was selected as the irrigation quota irrigation was applied on 30 apr and 18 may in 2017 4 jun 28 jun and 8 jul in 2018 and 24 apr 26 may 14 jun and 29 jun in 2019 the precipitation distribution from 2017 to 2019 is presented in fig 2 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 annual soil salinity in the main root zone considering that the soil water and salt processes present a two dimensional distribution under the drip irrigation and that the cotton roots are concentrated around the main root zone soil samples were collected from the 060 cm layer from three representative sites i e the middle of bare soil underneath drip lines and the middle of mulching rows at locations perpendicular to the drip tape ning et al 2015 2021 soil cores were collected every 10 cm up to 60 cm with an auger before sowing and after harvesting of cotton after the air dried soil samples were ground and screened using a 2 mm sieve the electrical conductivity ec1 5 of the mixed solution which was prepared using soil and water in a 1 5 ratio by weight was measured the soil ec1 5 of the main root zone in each treatment was represented by the mean value of the three sampling sites additionally the saturated soil extract was also prepared after the saturated mud was centrifuged 3180 g 30 min according to the united states salinity laboratory 1954 the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e and ec1 5 were then measured using a dds 307a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china based on the analyses of 108 soil samples the relationship between ec1 5 and ec e was determined as shown in eq 1 1 ec e 9 367 ec 1 5 0 001 r 2 0 99 2 3 2 cotton yield and components cotton was divided into three batches based on maturity for manual picking from central rows of each plot to determine seed cotton yield the boll number per plant weight of 100 bolls and harvesting density were determined at the boll opening stage 2 3 3 physicochemical properties of the soil plow layer in 2019 soil samples from the 0 20 cm depth layer were collected in the middle of mulching and bare rows after harvesting cotton in 2019 soil electrical conductivity and ph after air drying the soil samples were ground and screened 2 mm sieve the ec1 5 and ph of the soil solution prepared using soil and water in a 1 5 ratio by weight were measured using a dds 307a conductivity meter and phs 3 c ph meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china respectively the ec e was calculated using eq 1 soil sodium adsorption ratio sar the concentration of na ions was measured using an f 100 flame photometer shanghai metash instruments co ltd shanghai china concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions were measured using a tas 990 atomic absorption spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd beijing china subsequently the sar was calculated using eq 2 2 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 1 2 where sar is the sodium adsorption ratio mmol l 1 1 2 and na ca2 and mg2 are the concentrations of na ca2 and mg2 mmol l 1 respectively soil bulk density bd a ring knife volume of 100 cm3 was used to collect soil samples from the plow layer at depth of 020 cm and soil bd was determined after drying the soil samples to a constant weight at 105 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the falling head method was used to determine ks wang et al 2018 using a tst 55 permeation meter nanjing soil instrument co ltd nanjing china soil ks was calculated as 3 k s al at ln h 1 h 2 where ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 a is pressure tube area cm2 l is soil sample height cm a is cross sectional area of soil sample cm2 h 1 is initial head cm h 2 is final head cm and t is time d soil aggregate content after the undisturbed soil samples were air dried and broken along the texture into pieces with a diameter of approximately 1 cm the composition of the soil aggregates was determined using a tpf 100 soil aggregate structure analyzer zhejiang top cloud agri technology co ltd zhejiang china soil organic carbon content soc after the air dried soil samples were ground and then screened using a 60 mesh sieve the soc content was determined using the hydrated thermal potassium dichromate oxidation colorimetric method bao 2000 soil enzyme activity after the air dried soil samples were ground and then screened using a 60 mesh sieve soil urease ure activity was determined using the indophenol blue colorimetric method with a urea matrix witte and medina escobar 2001 catalase cat activity was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry johansson and borg 1988 and alkaline phosphatase alp activity was determined by the disodium phenylphosphate colorimetric method guan 1986 the catalytic degradation of 1 μmol h2o2 per gram of air dried soil sample per day was defined as a unit of cat activity the production of 1 μg nh3 n per gram of air dried soil sample per day was defined as a unit of ure activity and the release of 1 μmol phenol per gram of air dried soil sample per day at 37 was defined as a unit of alp activity 2 3 4 soil quality assessment factor analysis was used to evaluate each soil indicator and principal factors pc were extracted using the principal component analysis pca zhang et al 2020a the soil quality index sqi was calculated using eq 4 4 sqi i 1 n w i s i where i is the evaluation variable or factor w is the weightage factor determined from the ratio of the variance coefficient from each factor to the total cumulative variance coefficients of the principal component considered s is the score of each variable in the minimum data set mds and n is the number of variables in mds 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova pearson correlation analysis and factor analysis were performed using the data processing system software tang and zhang 2013 and means were compared using the least significant difference test lsd differences were deemed significant at a probability of p 0 05 the principal component analysis method pca was used to extract principal factors in the soil quality assessment 3 results 3 1 effects of saline water mulched drip irrigation on cotton yield fig 3 demonstrates that drip irrigation with saline water had no clear effect on the number of bolls or weight per boll both the seed cotton yield and harvesting density showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing as the salinity increased compared to the seed cotton yield of the t1 treatment only the t5 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased cotton yield by 10 7 and 13 2 in 2017 and 2019 respectively among the three cotton yield components the correlation between harvesting density and seed cotton yield was the highest p 0 01 table 2 in addition there were interannual variations in cotton yield for all the treatments during 20172019 the average seed cotton yields in 2018 and 2019 were 44 4 and 16 3 higher than those in 2017 respectively table 3 indicates that the year factor had significant p 0 01 effects on cotton yield and the three yield components whereas irrigation water salinity had significant p 0 01 effects only on harvesting density relative seed cotton yield is defined as the ratio of cotton yield of a treatment to that of t1 treatment the average relative seed cotton yield from 2017 to 2019 increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water a significant quadratic correlation was identified between the relative seed cotton yield y unitless and the irrigation water salinity x ds m 1 with the fitting equation y 0 0007x 2 0 009x 0 9884 r 2 0 9641 p 0 01 the correlation indicated that the irrigation water salinity threshold was 11 4 ds m 1 above which the relative cotton yield dropped below 1 3 2 annual variation in soil salinity in the main root zone fig 4 shows that the ranges of soil ec e in the main root zone 0 60 cm before sowing and after harvesting for the t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments were 1 202 27 2 003 22 1 743 55 2 274 41 and 2 275 09 ds m 1 in 20172019 respectively each year salt accumulation occurred in the t2t5 treatments after harvesting compared to before sowing with soil ec e increasing by 2 523 9 8 129 5 10 935 7 and 6 041 2 for the t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments respectively from 2017 to 2019 however soil ec e fluctuated during the interannual period compared with the initial value in 2017 the soil ec e of the t1 t2 and t3 treatments decreased by 47 2 5 7 and 1 0 after harvesting in 2018 while that of t4 and t5 treatments increased by 36 9 and 43 1 the soil ec e of the t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments after harvesting in 2019 increased by 41 6 56 0 93 9 and 124 1 respectively table 3 shows that the soil ec e was significantly p 0 01 affected by the year factor irrigation water salinity and their interaction 3 3 effects of saline water mulched drip irrigation on the soil physicochemical properties of the plow layer 3 3 1 soil chemical properties soil ec e ph sar and soc content in the plow layer 0 20 cm after cotton harvesting in 2019 are shown in table 4 soil ec e increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water compared with the t1 treatment the soil ec e of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments increased by 0 55 1 40 2 47 and 3 65 ds m 1 in the mulching rows and increased by 0 44 1 43 2 59 and 3 76 ds m 1 in the bare rows respectively among them the differences between the t3 t4 and t5 treatments and t1 treatment were significant p 0 05 compared with mulching rows the soil ec e in the bare rows increased by 27 4 16 2 15 9 14 2 and 10 9 for t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments respectively moreover saline water drip irrigation increased soil ph but there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the treatments soil sar increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water table 4 compared with t1 treatment the sar of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments increased by 2 102 51 3 055 53 5 386 89 and 6 378 09 mmol l 1 1 2 respectively in the bare rows soil sar of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 8 6 37 5 18 0 and 17 9 respectively compared with that in the mulching rows the soc content first exhibited an increasing trend and then decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity table 4 in the order of t2 t3 t4 t1 t5 however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the soc content between t2 t3 t4 t5 and t1 treatments the soc content in the bare rows was slightly higher than that in the mulching rows 3 3 2 soil physical properties the soil bd ks and water stable macroaggregate 0 25 mm content of the plow layer after cotton harvesting in 2019 are shown in table 5 soil bd increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water however only the bd of t4 and t5 treatments in the bare rows significantly p 0 05 increased compared with that of the t1 treatment increasing by 0 08 and 0 13 g cm 3 respectively soil bd in the bare rows was slightly higher than that in the mulching rows furthermore ks showed a decreasing trend from t1 to t5 treatments compared with the t1 treatment the ks of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 5 38 4 14 518 3 22 324 9 and 25 126 8 respectively with no significant difference p 0 05 among the treatments the ks of the bare rows decreased by 7 114 1 compared with that in the mulching rows for all treatments saline water irrigation reduced the soil water stable macroaggregate content table 5 compared with the t1 treatment the macroaggregate content of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 0 46 9 8 512 2 14 015 0 and 19 921 0 respectively with significant differences between t4 t5 and t1 treatments p 0 05 the soil macroaggregate content in the bare rows decreased by 3 010 5 compared with that in the mulching rows for all treatments 3 3 3 soil enzyme activity table 6 shows cat ure and alp activities in the 0 20 cm soil layer the activities of cat and ure showed a decreasing trend with increasing salinity of irrigation water but there was no significant difference p 0 05 among all treatments the activities of cat and ure in the bare rows were lower than those in the mulching rows as irrigation water salinity increased alp activity increased first and then decreased and the maximum values were observed in t2 treatment compared with the t1 treatment only the alp activity of t5 treatment in the mulching row significantly p 0 05 decreased by 5 1 3 4 soil quality assessment table 7 shows the statistical results of the two principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 and a cumulative contribution rate of 96 53 combined with the load of each indicator and pearson correlation coefficients table 7 a representative index was selected from each group of indicators with high correlations then all the selected indexes were put into the mds for assessment among soil ec e ph and sar with high correlation coefficients ec e with high load and directly representing soil salinity was put into the mds among water stable macroaggregates bd and ks with high correlation coefficients ks was selected and put into the mds because of higher load for the biological indicators ure activity with a higher load than that of cat and alp activities was put in the mds finally soc was added to the mds to ensure the comprehensiveness of the evaluation indexes thus the mds included soil ec e soc ks and ure activity in the mds the weight of each index was represented as the percentage of the index load out of the total load table 7 which were 0 111 pc1 0 204 pc2 0 122 pc1 and 0 122 pc1 for ec e soc ks and ure activity respectively the sqi was calculated using eq 4 and the scores of each index and the sqi of each treatment are shown in table 8 the soil quality decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water compared with the t1 treatment the sqi of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 1 2 10 5 16 5 and 23 7 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 cotton yield and soil salinity under saline water mulched drip irrigation previous studies have shown that a low cotton emergence percentage limits the application of saline water irrigation in cotton fields feng et al 2014a zheng et al 2020 this is because cotton seedling emergence is directly related to its harvesting density which determines the yield in this study cotton harvesting density increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water which can be explained by the response of seedling emergence to irrigation water salinity reported by zhang et al 2020b we observed interannual variations in cotton harvesting density of all treatments was quite clear with the highest values in 2018 this is because no saline water irrigation was applied after sowing in 2018 owing to heavy rainfall 48 mm prior to planting which reduced the initial soil ec e and ensured high seedling emergence rate leading to a high harvesting density in this study saline water mulched drip irrigation exhibited few negative effects on the boll number and weight per boll fig 3 table 3 and appropriate salinity of irrigation water was even beneficial which was similar to the reports of zheng et al 2020 and zhang et al 2018 grieve et al 2012 indicated that a certain salinity can slow the vegetative growth of cotton and promotes the transportation of excess photosynthates to reproductive organs which may explain the above results the three yield components together determined seed cotton yield among them the pearson correlation coefficient table 2 between seed cotton yield and harvesting density was the highest which led to the cotton yield increasing first and then decreasing with increasing salinity of irrigation water additionally soil ec e of all treatments from 2017 to 2019 fig 4 was below the critical salinity threshold of cotton 7 7 ds m 1 reported by maas et al 1986 therefore only the cotton yield of t5 15 9 ds m 1 treatment in 2017 and 2019 significantly decreased compared with that of t1 treatment compared with the few variations between the treatments in the same year there were more interannual variations in cotton yield the year factor had a significant effect on cotton yield table 3 because cotton yield is not only associated with soil salinity but also closely related to climatic factors sawan 2018 wang et al 2015 specifically despite the highest precipitation and least irrigation in 2017 the seed cotton yield was the lowest of three years this can be ascribed to more rainfall and higher air humidity during the late flower and boll opening periods than in 2018 and 2019 this resulted in a higher boll shedding rate lower boll number and lower cotton yield in 2017 in this study regression analysis between relative cotton yield and irrigation water salinity indicated that the salinity threshold of irrigation water was 11 4 ds m 1 which was higher than 7 1 ds m 1 under furrow irrigation feng et al 2015 and 8 8 ds m 1 under border irrigation zhang et al 2018 in the same study area moreover there was no seedling replenishment in this study while seedling transplanting was conducted in both the above studies because of the smaller irrigation quota of drip irrigation less salt is brought into the soil meanwhile drip irrigation can maintain high soil matric potential in the root zone creating a desalination region for the plant li and kang 2020 both these factors resulted in a higher salinity threshold under drip irrigation than under conventional surface irrigation the variation in soil salinity is associated with many factors such as climatic factors groundwater level and mulching measures which results in high temporal and spatial variability in soil salinity ren et al 2019 in this study soil ec e was not only closely associated with irrigation water salinity but also significantly affected by the year factor table 3 after harvesting the soil ec e of treatments with irrigation water salinity 8 8 ds m 1 decreased in 2018 compared with that in 2017 which was caused by a heavy rainfall of 118 mm in august 6 7 2018 having a strong leaching effect on soil salt due to more salt input with irrigation water and less rainfall in 2019 the soil ec e of all treatments dramatically increased the soil ec e of the t1 t2 and t3 treatments was less than 4 ds m 1 at a non salinized level united states salinity laboratory 1954 indicating that the irrigation water salinity should be controlled below 8 8 ds m 1 nonetheless the study period was not long enough to indicate whether soil salt would continue to accumulate or reach equilibrium thus an analysis of a longer duration in combination with hydrological chronology is necessary however based on long term located border and furrow saline water irrigation experiments for 10 years some scholars have reported that soil salinity did not accumulate over successive years but instead reached a dynamic equilibrium due to the effect of rainfall leaching under moderate irrigation water salinity zhang et al 2020a zheng et al 2020 4 2 soil physicochemical properties under saline water mulched drip irrigation after saline water mulched drip irrigation for three years soil ec e of the plow layer increased with increasing irrigation water salinity the soil ec e was lower in the mulching rows than in the bare rows because plastic mulch film has the function of preserving soil moisture and inhibiting salt accumulation on the soil surface liu et al 2005 sar is an indicator of the harmful effects of na ions on soil due to the large amount of na ions brought by irrigation water as well as the exchange and adsorption between ca2 mg2 and na ions in soil wu and wang 2010 the sar increased as irrigation water salinity increased furthermore na ions brought by irrigation water were mainly concentrated around the emitters yang et al 2020 resulting in higher sar in mulching rows when the content of na ions in the soil reached a certain level the high sar could lead to soil alkalization bajwa and josan 1989 yu and wang 1988 which explains the increasing trend in soil ph the salt ions especially na ions brought by saline water irrigation promote the dispersion of soil particles and alter soil structure leading to an increase in soil bd ji et al 2014 which is consistent with the findings of our study we found that film mulching could reduce the soil bd with anikwe et al 2007 finding the similar results this is because plastic film mulching can improve the soil environment and promote root growth which is conducive to pore formation in the soil zheng 2019 soil ks is an essential parameter for characterizing the soil infiltration capacity in our study soil ks showed a decreasing trend with increasing irrigation water salinity high sar can reduce the infiltration and soil ks guo and liu 2014 klopp et al 2020 in addition chen et al 2014 and li et al 2021 reported that an increase in soil bd indicated a decrease in soil porosity which increased soil compaction and led to a decrease in ks the ranges of soil bd and ks change among treatments were small in our study this probably benefited from the less salt input with irrigation water from drip irrigation aggregates are the basic unit of soil structure among which water stable macroaggregates with particle sizes greater than 0 25 mm are the most essential serving as an important indicator of soil quality jin et al 2019 in our study saline water drip irrigation tended to reduce the water stable macroaggregate content mainly because the na ions brought by saline water exhibited a low electric charge large radius and small hydration energy which caused the expansion and dispersion of soil colloidal particles wu and wang 2010 thereby reducing the macroaggregate contents furthermore soil microorganisms play an important role in the formation and stability of macroaggregates denef et al 2001 li et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the salt brought by saline water reduced the activity and number of soil microorganisms resulting in the decomposition of soil aggregates and deterioration of soil structure zhang et al 2015b elmajdoub et al 2014 nonetheless film mulch could promote the activity of microorganisms thus promoting the formation of macroaggregates the soc content increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water the reason is that the salt ions brought by saline water irrigation first adversely affected the activity of microorganisms and reduced the decomposition rate of organic carbon leading to an increase in soc content zhang et al 2015b however aggregates constitute the primary reservoir of organic carbon and affect its storage liu et al 2018 kan et al 2020 therefore further increase in irrigation water salinity resulted in the disruption and dispersion of aggregates and the consequent loss of organic carbon guo et al 2018 previous studies have shown that plastic film mulch increase soil temperature and thus promote the decomposition of organic carbon trumbore et al 1996 some studies have also found that mulching significantly increased soil respiration li et al 2004 zhang et al 2015a which also accelerated the consumption of organic carbon these results can explain the low soc content in the mulching rows observed in this study soil enzymes such as ure and phosphatase are closely associated with the release of soil nutrients and their activities are affected by soil salinity singh and kumar 2008 tripathi et al 2007 yuan et al 2007 our study demonstrates that the activities of ure and cat showed a decreasing trend as the irrigation water salinity increased on the one hand salt stress can inhibit root growth and reduce the number of microorganisms thus inhibiting the synthesis of soil enzymes feng et al 2014b on the other hand higher soil salinity can lead to protein denaturation and inactivate soil enzymes chen et al 2017 yuan et al 2007 the activity of alp first showed an increasing trend perhaps because the alkaline environment caused by the increase in sar could promote alp activity wang et al 2009 compared with the initial soil physicochemical properties of the plow layer before experiment in 2017 soil ec e ph sar bd and macroaggregate content exhibited no significant change after 3 years of saline water drip irrigation with salinity 5 4 ds m 1 this further verified that saline water drip irrigation with appropriate salinity would lead to limited deterioration in soil physicochemical properties 4 3 security evaluation of saline water drip irrigation according to the findings of our study to maintain the cotton yield soil salinity and sqi at a relatively appropriate level the irrigation water salinity should be controlled below 11 4 8 8 and 5 4 ds m 1 respectively therefore saline water with salinity below 11 4 ds m 1 can be used for the temporary and supplementary irrigation of cotton while saline water with salinity below 5 4 ds m 1 is more conducive to the sustainability of mulched drip irrigated cotton this concentration is lower than the 8 8 ds m 1 obtained by zhang et al 2020b who did not consider the effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality based on the soil quality assessment of cotton fields with saline water border irrigation for 10 years zhang et al 2020a concluded that the threshold for irrigation water salinity was 3 4 ds m 1 which was lower than that reported in this study in addition the soil quality assessment in this study accounted more evaluation indicators including soil physical chemical and biological properties to ensure that the assessment is more representative the short term implementation of saline water irrigation may have no significant harmful effect but its impact on the soil environment is sustained which may be risky after long term application the limitation of this study is that the experimental period was short thus it was difficult to reveal the underlying mechanism effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality consequently the effects of long term saline water drip irrigation on the soil environment in this area need further investigation 5 conclusion a three year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different irrigation water salinities on the cotton yield soil salinity and soil quality under mulched drip irrigation we observed that the irrigation water salinity threshold for cotton was 11 4 ds m 1 above which the yield began to decrease the year factor rather than irrigation water salinity significantly p 0 01 affected cotton yield soil ec e of the main root zone increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water irrigation water salinity 8 8 ds m 1 did not lead to salt accumulation with each successive year but a decrease of soil salt in 2018 moreover after continuous saline water irrigation for 3 years irrigation water salinity 5 4 ds m 1 had no significant effect on physicochemical properties of soil such as ph soc bd ks water stable aggregate and the activities of cat ure and alp nonetheless the sqi decreased gradually with increasing salinity of irrigation water comprehensive consideration of cotton yield soil salt accumulation and sqi it is more conducive to the sustainability of mulched drip irrigation for cotton with saline water below 5 4 ds m 1 in the ncp further studies on the underlying mechanism effects of long term saline water drip irrigation on the soil environment are still needed in the ncp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9682,the shortage of freshwater resources is a considerable challenge for agricultural production in the north china plain ncp safe and efficient use of saline water resources is thus urgently required to reveal the effects of different salinities of irrigation water on the yield and soil quality of mulched drip irrigated cotton a field experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 five salinity levels of irrigation water were included 1 3 t1 control 5 4 t2 8 8 t3 12 4 t4 and 15 9 t5 ds m 1 the results showed that the harvesting density and seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water saline water irrigation with salinity 8 8 ds m 1 did not lead to salt accumulation in the main root zone 0 60 cm with each passing year but a decrease of salt in 2018 in the third year of saline water irrigation with the increase in irrigation water salinity the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e soil sodium adsorption ratio sar ph and bulk density bd in the plow layer gradually increased however the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks water stable macroaggregate 0 25 mm content catalase cat and urease ure activity decreased with increasing salinity moreover the soil organic carbon soc content and alkaline phosphatase alp activity increased first and then decreased irrigation water salinity 5 4 ds m 1 had no significant effect on most physicochemical properties such as ph soc content bd ks water stable aggregate content and activities of cat ure and alp compared with the t1 treatment the soil quality index sqi of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 1 2 10 5 16 5 and 23 7 respectively considering cotton yield soil salt accumulation and sqi mulched drip irrigation is conducive to the sustainability of cotton with saline water levels below 5 4 ds m 1 graphical abstract ga1 keywords mulched drip irrigation yield components salt accumulation soil physicochemical properties soil enzyme activity 1 introduction globally there are more than 2 billion people living in countries with water shortages and as many as 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year un water 2019 as such the global water shortage problem is becoming increasingly serious in the north china plain ncp where freshwater resources are extremely scarce the amount of freshwater resources per capita is less than 1 12 of that worldwide the ncp is one of the principal areas in the production of grains and cotton in china due to extreme shortages of surface water in this region deep groundwater has been overexploited for an extended time which seriously affects the sustainable utilization of water resources and the stable development of agriculture however as an alternative source of fresh water shallow underground saline water resources in this area are abundant and widely distributed li and ren 2021 as a representative area the hebei low plain located in the northeast of the ncp has a total shallow underground saline water storage capacity of 1 54 1010 m3 distributed over 91 8 of the total area cao et al 2007 nonetheless less than 10 of the total saline water is utilized the scientific and rational utilization of saline water is of great importance to address the supply and demand antinomy of water resources li et al 2015 irrigation with saline water not only increases soil moisture but also may lead to soil salinization cotton has a strong salt tolerance and is often used as a pioneer crop for saline water irrigation maas et al 1986 zhang et al 2016 some scholars have indicated that appropriate soil salt brought by saline water has few effects on cotton growth and yield or even promotes them bezborodov et al 2010 yang et al 2020 among them yang et al 2020 found that mulched drip irrigation with saline water at 3 g l 1 could promote cotton yield compared with 1 g l 1 treatment however salt accumulation may occur with long term saline water irrigation posing a potential threat to both the soil environment and crop growth zheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in terms of soil response sameni and morshedi 2000 reported that soil structure and hydraulic conductivity were affected under saline water irrigation due to swelling and dispersion of clay particles yang et al 2020 found that saline water irrigation could increase soil ph and change the composition of ions in soil feigen et al 1991 indicated that excessive sodium ions in irrigation water resulted in the dispersion and expansion of soil particles which could damage the aggregate structure and led to surface soil compaction zhang et al 2015b found that saline water irrigation reduced soil microbial biomass and inhibit the activity of soil enzymes thus reducing the degradation rate of organic carbon ensuring that the soil quality does not deteriorate is an important goal for the sustainable development of agriculture with saline water irrigation however due to the complexity and slow evolution of soil quality it is difficult to observe changes in soil quality nortcliff 2002 to better describe the soil quality of cotton fields quantitatively under saline water irrigation the soil quality index sqi has been proposed the sqi includes characteristics that represent certain soil functions and have wide ranging applications in addition to exhibiting sensitivity reliability and ease of observation carter et al 1997 erkossa et al 2007 karlen et al 1996 through principal component analysis pca a minimum data set mds of the sqi is established and the sqi is then calculated andrews et al 2002 larson and pierce 1994 mandal et al 2008 zhang et al 2020a this method has been widely used and has achieved good results feng 2014a zhang et al 2020a the selection of an appropriate irrigation technique is also a key issue in the utilization of saline water conventional surface irrigation techniques have been mostly used for saline water irrigation of cotton in the ncp feng et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 reported the effects of saline water furrow and border irrigation on the accumulation of soil salt and the emergence growth and yield of cotton indicating that the irrigation water salinity threshold values were 7 1 and 8 8 ds m 1 respectively additionally zhang et al 2020a studied the effects of saline water border irrigation on soil physicochemical properties cotton yield fiber quality and final soil quality and suggested that irrigation water salinity 3 4 ds m 1 was suitable for long term use compared with conventional surface irrigation drip irrigation has the advantages of a smaller irrigation quota less salt accumulation in the soil a higher irrigation frequency and creation of a desalination zone for roots kang et al 2010 thus regarded as the most suitable method for saline water irrigation shalhevet 1994 currently there have been many studies on saline water drip irrigation in cotton rajak et al 2006 reported that cotton growth and yield under drip irrigation with saline water of 2 2 ds m 1 were even better than those under furrow irrigation with fresh water of 0 25 ds m 1 in china saline water drip irrigation is mainly applied in northwest arid areas yang et al 2020 studied the changes in soil salinity soil chemical properties and cotton yield under saline water mulched drip irrigation indicating that saline water salinities below 6 g l 1 were suitable for cotton irrigation min et al 2016 reported that saline water drip irrigation reduced cotton biomass and yield with irrigation water salinity increasing from 0 35 to 8 04 ds m 1 taken together there are significant differences in the effects of saline water irrigation on cotton in different areas using different irrigation methods however fewer studies have investigated the effects of saline water mulched drip irrigation on cotton growth and soil quality in the ncp in this study saline water mulched drip irrigation of cotton was employed to 1 understand the response of cotton yield to different salinities of drip irrigation water 2 analyze the effects of saline water drip irrigation on soil salinity 3 explore the effects of drip irrigation with different salinity levels of irrigation water on soil physicochemical properties and 4 determine the salinity threshold of saline water drip irrigation in the ncp through a soil quality assessment the findings of this study will enrich the understanding of saline water irrigation in the ncp and be of great importance for safe utilization of saline water and sustainable agricultural development 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted at the hengshui experimental station 37 44 n 115 47 e and 21 m above sea level located in the ncp from 2017 to 2019 this station is characterized by a semihumid and semiarid climate with an annual sunshine duration of 2509 h the mean maximum and minimum annual temperatures are 12 8 19 1 and 7 9 respectively the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 500 and 1785 mm respectively the soil texture of the station is loam and the groundwater depth is below 5 m the ec e ph sar bd water stable aggregate 0 25 mm content and field capacity measured according to the field technique from fao irrigation and drainage paper 45 of the top 20 cm soil layer before the experiment in 2017 were 2 65 ds m 1 7 94 2 88 mmol l 1 1 2 1 32 g cm 3 47 92 and 0 32 cm3 cm 3 respectively soil organic matter available nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k contents in the plow layer were 11 5 g kg 1 76 mg kg 1 15 mg kg 1 and 112 mg kg 1 respectively an automatic meteorological observation station was used to record rainfall and other data temperature wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and solar radiation at the site 2 2 experimental design the experimental plots were arranged in a randomized block design with each treatment having three replicate plots of size 37 62 m2 5 7 m 6 6 m before sowing a total of 750 kg ha 1 of compound fertilizer 15 n 15 p2o5 and 15 k2o was applied to the plots which was followed by rotary tillage seeds of cotton gossypium hirsutum l cultivar ji 863 were sown on 27 apr 2017 26 apr 2018 and 23 apr 2019 cotton harvested on 3 nov 2017 1 nov 2018 and 1 nov 2019 cotton was manually sown at intervals of 30 cm along the drip line with alternating wide narrow spacing 80 50 cm between rows the planting mode for cotton under mulched drip irrigation mainly includes two parts mulching area and bare soil area a schematic diagram of cotton planting is shown in fig 1 for the drip irrigation system the irrigation water was prepared in a removable tank 3 m3 using deep groundwater 110 m below the soil surface and calculated amount of salt and then pumped into each plot each row of cotton was laid with a drip tube 10 tubes per plot after sowing with 30 cm spacing between emitters and 3 l h 1 flow rate per emitter at a work pressure of 0 1 mpa the lateral spacing between drip lines was the same as that of the cotton rows the irrigation amount was measured using a water meter and controlled using a water tight valve previous studies have indicated that film mulch is necessary for saline water irrigated cotton in the ncp dong et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 because it has the essential effects of reducing soil evaporation increasing soil temperature inhibiting salt accumulation on the soil surface and promoting cotton yield therefore narrow rows of cotton plants were mulched with transparent plastic film as a basic agronomic measure and the bare soil area was equal to the mulching area fig 1 no drainage system existed in the experimental field according to li and ren 2021 in the heilonggang region where the experimental station is located the areas distributing shallow groundwater with salinities ranging from 1 to 10 g l 1 approximately 1 3 17 7 ds m 1 accounted for approximately 81 of the total area therefore five salinity levels of irrigation water were tested in the study 1 3 t1 control 5 4 t2 8 8 t3 12 4 t4 and 15 9 t5 ds m 1 the shallow saline groundwater in the study area was mainly formed by continental salinization and seawater intrusion and primarily included na and cl ions zhou et al 2008 therefore the irrigation water for the t2t5 treatments 5 4 15 9 ds m 1 was obtained by mixing deep groundwater 1 3 ds m 1 with sea salt mainly na and cl ions the ion content in irrigation water is presented in table 1 drip irrigation was applied immediately after sowing in 2017 and 2019 owing to heavy rainfall 48 mm in 2018 prior to sowing no irrigation was applied immediately after sowing soil moisture at a depth of 060 cm with 10 cm intervals underneath drip lines was measured using the drying method at 10 day intervals the plots were irrigated when the soil moisture of the planned wetting layer 0 30 cm at the seedling stage 0 40 cm at the squaring stage and 0 60 cm at the flowering stage underneath the drip lines was below 70 of the field capacity θ f because of the continental monsoon climate with simultaneous rain and heat in the ncp rainfall can basically satisfy the growth of cotton however a short period of drought often occurs in the early growth stages zhang et al 2020b therefore for the intent of water savings 20 mm was selected as the irrigation quota irrigation was applied on 30 apr and 18 may in 2017 4 jun 28 jun and 8 jul in 2018 and 24 apr 26 may 14 jun and 29 jun in 2019 the precipitation distribution from 2017 to 2019 is presented in fig 2 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 annual soil salinity in the main root zone considering that the soil water and salt processes present a two dimensional distribution under the drip irrigation and that the cotton roots are concentrated around the main root zone soil samples were collected from the 060 cm layer from three representative sites i e the middle of bare soil underneath drip lines and the middle of mulching rows at locations perpendicular to the drip tape ning et al 2015 2021 soil cores were collected every 10 cm up to 60 cm with an auger before sowing and after harvesting of cotton after the air dried soil samples were ground and screened using a 2 mm sieve the electrical conductivity ec1 5 of the mixed solution which was prepared using soil and water in a 1 5 ratio by weight was measured the soil ec1 5 of the main root zone in each treatment was represented by the mean value of the three sampling sites additionally the saturated soil extract was also prepared after the saturated mud was centrifuged 3180 g 30 min according to the united states salinity laboratory 1954 the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ec e and ec1 5 were then measured using a dds 307a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china based on the analyses of 108 soil samples the relationship between ec1 5 and ec e was determined as shown in eq 1 1 ec e 9 367 ec 1 5 0 001 r 2 0 99 2 3 2 cotton yield and components cotton was divided into three batches based on maturity for manual picking from central rows of each plot to determine seed cotton yield the boll number per plant weight of 100 bolls and harvesting density were determined at the boll opening stage 2 3 3 physicochemical properties of the soil plow layer in 2019 soil samples from the 0 20 cm depth layer were collected in the middle of mulching and bare rows after harvesting cotton in 2019 soil electrical conductivity and ph after air drying the soil samples were ground and screened 2 mm sieve the ec1 5 and ph of the soil solution prepared using soil and water in a 1 5 ratio by weight were measured using a dds 307a conductivity meter and phs 3 c ph meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china respectively the ec e was calculated using eq 1 soil sodium adsorption ratio sar the concentration of na ions was measured using an f 100 flame photometer shanghai metash instruments co ltd shanghai china concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions were measured using a tas 990 atomic absorption spectrophotometer beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd beijing china subsequently the sar was calculated using eq 2 2 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 1 2 where sar is the sodium adsorption ratio mmol l 1 1 2 and na ca2 and mg2 are the concentrations of na ca2 and mg2 mmol l 1 respectively soil bulk density bd a ring knife volume of 100 cm3 was used to collect soil samples from the plow layer at depth of 020 cm and soil bd was determined after drying the soil samples to a constant weight at 105 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the falling head method was used to determine ks wang et al 2018 using a tst 55 permeation meter nanjing soil instrument co ltd nanjing china soil ks was calculated as 3 k s al at ln h 1 h 2 where ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 a is pressure tube area cm2 l is soil sample height cm a is cross sectional area of soil sample cm2 h 1 is initial head cm h 2 is final head cm and t is time d soil aggregate content after the undisturbed soil samples were air dried and broken along the texture into pieces with a diameter of approximately 1 cm the composition of the soil aggregates was determined using a tpf 100 soil aggregate structure analyzer zhejiang top cloud agri technology co ltd zhejiang china soil organic carbon content soc after the air dried soil samples were ground and then screened using a 60 mesh sieve the soc content was determined using the hydrated thermal potassium dichromate oxidation colorimetric method bao 2000 soil enzyme activity after the air dried soil samples were ground and then screened using a 60 mesh sieve soil urease ure activity was determined using the indophenol blue colorimetric method with a urea matrix witte and medina escobar 2001 catalase cat activity was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry johansson and borg 1988 and alkaline phosphatase alp activity was determined by the disodium phenylphosphate colorimetric method guan 1986 the catalytic degradation of 1 μmol h2o2 per gram of air dried soil sample per day was defined as a unit of cat activity the production of 1 μg nh3 n per gram of air dried soil sample per day was defined as a unit of ure activity and the release of 1 μmol phenol per gram of air dried soil sample per day at 37 was defined as a unit of alp activity 2 3 4 soil quality assessment factor analysis was used to evaluate each soil indicator and principal factors pc were extracted using the principal component analysis pca zhang et al 2020a the soil quality index sqi was calculated using eq 4 4 sqi i 1 n w i s i where i is the evaluation variable or factor w is the

principal component analysis method pca was used to extract principal factors in the soil quality assessment 3 results 3 1 effects of saline water mulched drip irrigation on cotton yield fig 3 demonstrates that drip irrigation with saline water had no clear effect on the number of bolls or weight per boll both the seed cotton yield and harvesting density showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing as the salinity increased compared to the seed cotton yield of the t1 treatment only the t5 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased cotton yield by 10 7 and 13 2 in 2017 and 2019 respectively among the three cotton yield components the correlation between harvesting density and seed cotton yield was the highest p 0 01 table 2 in addition there were interannual variations in cotton yield for all the treatments during 20172019 the average seed cotton yields in 2018 and 2019 were 44 4 and 16 3 higher than those in 2017 respectively table 3 indicates that the year factor had significant p 0 01 effects on cotton yield and the three yield components whereas irrigation water salinity had significant p 0 01 effects only on harvesting density relative seed cotton yield is defined as the ratio of cotton yield of a treatment to that of t1 treatment the average relative seed cotton yield from 2017 to 2019 increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water a significant quadratic correlation was identified between the relative seed cotton yield y unitless and the irrigation water salinity x ds m 1 with the fitting equation y 0 0007x 2 0 009x 0 9884 r 2 0 9641 p 0 01 the correlation indicated that the irrigation water salinity threshold was 11 4 ds m 1 above which the relative cotton yield dropped below 1 3 2 annual variation in soil salinity in the main root zone fig 4 shows that the ranges of soil ec e in the main root zone 0 60 cm before sowing and after harvesting for the t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments were 1 202 27 2 003 22 1 743 55 2 274 41 and 2 275 09 ds m 1 in 20172019 respectively each year salt accumulation occurred in the t2t5 treatments after harvesting compared to before sowing with soil ec e increasing by 2 523 9 8 129 5 10 935 7 and 6 041 2 for the t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments respectively from 2017 to 2019 however soil ec e fluctuated during the interannual period compared with the initial value in 2017 the soil ec e of the t1 t2 and t3 treatments decreased by 47 2 5 7 and 1 0 after harvesting in 2018 while that of t4 and t5 treatments increased by 36 9 and 43 1 the soil ec e of the t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments after harvesting in 2019 increased by 41 6 56 0 93 9 and 124 1 respectively table 3 shows that the soil ec e was significantly p 0 01 affected by the year factor irrigation water salinity and their interaction 3 3 effects of saline water mulched drip irrigation on the soil physicochemical properties of the plow layer 3 3 1 soil chemical properties soil ec e ph sar and soc content in the plow layer 0 20 cm after cotton harvesting in 2019 are shown in table 4 soil ec e increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water compared with the t1 treatment the soil ec e of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments increased by 0 55 1 40 2 47 and 3 65 ds m 1 in the mulching rows and increased by 0 44 1 43 2 59 and 3 76 ds m 1 in the bare rows respectively among them the differences between the t3 t4 and t5 treatments and t1 treatment were significant p 0 05 compared with mulching rows the soil ec e in the bare rows increased by 27 4 16 2 15 9 14 2 and 10 9 for t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments respectively moreover saline water drip irrigation increased soil ph but there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the treatments soil sar increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water table 4 compared with t1 treatment the sar of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments increased by 2 102 51 3 055 53 5 386 89 and 6 378 09 mmol l 1 1 2 respectively in the bare rows soil sar of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 8 6 37 5 18 0 and 17 9 respectively compared with that in the mulching rows the soc content first exhibited an increasing trend and then decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity table 4 in the order of t2 t3 t4 t1 t5 however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the soc content between t2 t3 t4 t5 and t1 treatments the soc content in the bare rows was slightly higher than that in the mulching rows 3 3 2 soil physical properties the soil bd ks and water stable macroaggregate 0 25 mm content of the plow layer after cotton harvesting in 2019 are shown in table 5 soil bd increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water however only the bd of t4 and t5 treatments in the bare rows significantly p 0 05 increased compared with that of the t1 treatment increasing by 0 08 and 0 13 g cm 3 respectively soil bd in the bare rows was slightly higher than that in the mulching rows furthermore ks showed a decreasing trend from t1 to t5 treatments compared with the t1 treatment the ks of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 5 38 4 14 518 3 22 324 9 and 25 126 8 respectively with no significant difference p 0 05 among the treatments the ks of the bare rows decreased by 7 114 1 compared with that in the mulching rows for all treatments saline water irrigation reduced the soil water stable macroaggregate content table 5 compared with the t1 treatment the macroaggregate content of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 0 46 9 8 512 2 14 015 0 and 19 921 0 respectively with significant differences between t4 t5 and t1 treatments p 0 05 the soil macroaggregate content in the bare rows decreased by 3 010 5 compared with that in the mulching rows for all treatments 3 3 3 soil enzyme activity table 6 shows cat ure and alp activities in the 0 20 cm soil layer the activities of cat and ure showed a decreasing trend with increasing salinity of irrigation water but there was no significant difference p 0 05 among all treatments the activities of cat and ure in the bare rows were lower than those in the mulching rows as irrigation water salinity increased alp activity increased first and then decreased and the maximum values were observed in t2 treatment compared with the t1 treatment only the alp activity of t5 treatment in the mulching row significantly p 0 05 decreased by 5 1 3 4 soil quality assessment table 7 shows the statistical results of the two principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 and a cumulative contribution rate of 96 53 combined with the load of each indicator and pearson correlation coefficients table 7 a representative index was selected from each group of indicators with high correlations then all the selected indexes were put into the mds for assessment among soil ec e ph and sar with high correlation coefficients ec e with high load and directly representing soil salinity was put into the mds among water stable macroaggregates bd and ks with high correlation coefficients ks was selected and put into the mds because of higher load for the biological indicators ure activity with a higher load than that of cat and alp activities was put in the mds finally soc was added to the mds to ensure the comprehensiveness of the evaluation indexes thus the mds included soil ec e soc ks and ure activity in the mds the weight of each index was represented as the percentage of the index load out of the total load table 7 which were 0 111 pc1 0 204 pc2 0 122 pc1 and 0 122 pc1 for ec e soc ks and ure activity respectively the sqi was calculated using eq 4 and the scores of each index and the sqi of each treatment are shown in table 8 the soil quality decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water compared with the t1 treatment the sqi of t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments decreased by 1 2 10 5 16 5 and 23 7 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 cotton yield and soil salinity under saline water mulched drip irrigation previous studies have shown that a low cotton emergence percentage limits the application of saline water irrigation in cotton fields feng et al 2014a zheng et al 2020 this is because cotton seedling emergence is directly related to its harvesting density which determines the yield in this study cotton harvesting density increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water which can be explained by the response of seedling emergence to irrigation water salinity reported by zhang et al 2020b we observed interannual variations in cotton harvesting density of all treatments was quite clear with the highest values in 2018 this is because no saline water irrigation was applied after sowing in 2018 owing to heavy rainfall 48 mm prior to planting which reduced the initial soil ec e and ensured high seedling emergence rate leading to a high harvesting density in this study saline water mulched drip irrigation exhibited few negative effects on the boll number and weight per boll fig 3 table 3 and appropriate salinity of irrigation water was even beneficial which was similar to the reports of zheng et al 2020 and zhang et al 2018 grieve et al 2012 indicated that a certain salinity can slow the vegetative growth of cotton and promotes the transportation of excess photosynthates to reproductive organs which may explain the above results the three yield components together determined seed cotton yield among them the pearson correlation coefficient table 2 between seed cotton yield and harvesting density was the highest which led to the cotton yield increasing first and then decreasing with increasing salinity of irrigation water additionally soil ec e of all treatments from 2017 to 2019 fig 4 was below the critical salinity threshold of cotton 7 7 ds m 1 reported by maas et al 1986 therefore only the cotton yield of t5 15 9 ds m 1 treatment in 2017 and 2019 significantly decreased compared with that of t1 treatment compared with the few variations between the treatments in the same year there were more interannual variations in cotton yield the year factor had a significant effect on cotton yield table 3 because cotton yield is not only associated with soil salinity but also closely related to climatic factors sawan 2018 wang et al 2015 specifically despite the highest precipitation and least irrigation in 2017 the seed cotton yield was the lowest of three years this can be ascribed to more rainfall and higher air humidity during the late flower and boll opening periods than in 2018 and 2019 this resulted in a higher boll shedding rate lower boll number and lower cotton yield in 2017 in this study regression analysis between relative cotton yield and irrigation water salinity indicated that the salinity threshold of irrigation water was 11 4 ds m 1 which was higher than 7 1 ds m 1 under furrow irrigation feng et al 2015 and 8 8 ds m 1 under border irrigation zhang et al 2018 in the same study area moreover there was no seedling replenishment in this study while seedling transplanting was conducted in both the above studies because of the smaller irrigation quota of drip irrigation less salt is brought into the soil meanwhile drip irrigation can maintain high soil matric potential in the root zone creating a desalination region for the plant li and kang 2020 both these factors resulted in a higher salinity threshold under drip irrigation than under conventional surface irrigation the variation in soil salinity is associated with many factors such as climatic factors groundwater level and mulching measures which results in high temporal and spatial variability in soil salinity ren et al 2019 in this study soil ec e was not only closely associated with irrigation water salinity but also significantly affected by the year factor table 3 after harvesting the soil ec e of treatments with irrigation water salinity 8 8 ds m 1 decreased in 2018 compared with that in 2017 which was caused by a heavy rainfall of 118 mm in august 6 7 2018 having a strong leaching effect on soil salt due to more salt input with irrigation water and less rainfall in 2019 the soil ec e of all treatments dramatically increased the soil ec e of the t1 t2 and t3 treatments was less than 4 ds m 1 at a non salinized level united states salinity laboratory 1954 indicating that the irrigation water salinity should be controlled below 8 8 ds m 1 nonetheless the study period was not long enough to indicate whether soil salt would continue to accumulate or reach equilibrium thus an analysis of a longer duration in combination with hydrological chronology is necessary however based on long term located border and furrow saline water irrigation experiments for 10 years some scholars have reported that soil salinity did not accumulate over successive years but instead reached a dynamic equilibrium due to the effect of rainfall leaching under moderate irrigation water salinity zhang et al 2020a zheng et al 2020 4 2 soil physicochemical properties under saline water mulched drip irrigation after saline water mulched drip irrigation for three years soil ec e of the plow layer increased with increasing irrigation water salinity the soil ec e was lower in the mulching rows than in the bare rows because plastic mulch film has the function of preserving soil moisture and inhibiting salt accumulation on the soil surface liu et al 2005 sar is an indicator of the harmful effects of na ions on soil due to the large amount of na ions brought by irrigation water as well as the exchange and adsorption between ca2 mg2 and na ions in soil wu and wang 2010 the sar increased as irrigation water salinity increased furthermore na ions brought by irrigation water were mainly concentrated around the emitters yang et al 2020 resulting in higher sar in mulching rows when the content of na ions in the soil reached a certain level the high sar could lead to soil alkalization bajwa and josan 1989 yu and wang 1988 which explains the increasing trend in soil ph the salt ions especially na ions brought by saline water irrigation promote the dispersion of soil particles and alter soil structure leading to an increase in soil bd ji et al 2014 which is consistent with the findings of our study we found that film mulching could reduce the soil bd with anikwe et al 2007 finding the similar results this is because plastic film mulching can improve the soil environment and promote root growth which is conducive to pore formation in the soil zheng 2019 soil ks is an essential parameter for characterizing the soil infiltration capacity in our study soil ks showed a decreasing trend with increasing irrigation water salinity high sar can reduce the infiltration and soil ks guo and liu 2014 klopp et al 2020 in addition chen et al 2014 and li et al 2021 reported that an increase in soil bd indicated a decrease in soil porosity which increased soil compaction and led to a decrease in ks the ranges of soil bd and ks change among treatments were small in our study this probably benefited from the less salt input with irrigation water from drip irrigation aggregates are the basic unit of soil structure among which water stable macroaggregates with particle sizes greater than 0 25 mm are the most essential serving as an important indicator of soil quality jin et al 2019 in our study saline water drip irrigation tended to reduce the water stable macroaggregate content mainly because the na ions brought by saline water exhibited a low electric charge large radius and small hydration energy which caused the expansion and dispersion of soil colloidal particles wu and wang 2010 thereby reducing the macroaggregate contents furthermore soil microorganisms play an important role in the formation and stability of macroaggregates denef et al 2001 li et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the salt brought by saline water reduced the activity and number of soil microorganisms resulting in the decomposition of soil aggregates and deterioration of soil structure zhang et al 2015b elmajdoub et al 2014 nonetheless film mulch could promote the activity of microorganisms thus promoting the formation of macroaggregates the soc content increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water the reason is that the salt ions brought by saline water irrigation first adversely affected the activity of microorganisms and reduced the decomposition rate of organic carbon leading to an increase in soc content zhang et al 2015b however aggregates constitute the primary reservoir of organic carbon and affect its storage liu et al 2018 kan et al 2020 therefore further increase in irrigation water salinity resulted in the disruption and dispersion of aggregates and the consequent loss of organic carbon guo et al 2018 previous studies have shown that plastic film mulch increase soil temperature and thus promote the decomposition of organic carbon trumbore et al 1996 some studies have also found that mulching significantly increased soil respiration li et al 2004 zhang et al 2015a which also accelerated the consumption of organic carbon these results can explain the low soc content in the mulching rows observed in this study soil enzymes such as ure and phosphatase are closely associated with the release of soil nutrients and their activities are affected by soil salinity singh and kumar 2008 tripathi et al 2007 yuan et al 2007 our study demonstrates that the activities of ure and cat showed a decreasing trend as the irrigation water salinity increased on the one hand salt stress can inhibit root growth and reduce the number of microorganisms thus inhibiting the synthesis of soil enzymes feng et al 2014b on the other hand higher soil salinity can lead to protein denaturation and inactivate soil enzymes chen et al 2017 yuan et al 2007 the activity of alp first showed an increasing trend perhaps because the alkaline environment caused by the increase in sar could promote alp activity wang et al 2009 compared with the initial soil physicochemical properties of the plow layer before experiment in 2017 soil ec e ph sar bd and macroaggregate content exhibited no significant change after 3 years of saline water drip irrigation with salinity 5 4 ds m 1 this further verified that saline water drip irrigation with appropriate salinity would lead to limited deterioration in soil physicochemical properties 4 3 security evaluation of saline water drip irrigation according to the findings of our study to maintain the cotton yield soil salinity and sqi at a relatively appropriate level the irrigation water salinity should be controlled below 11 4 8 8 and 5 4 ds m 1 respectively therefore saline water with salinity below 11 4 ds m 1 can be used for the temporary and supplementary irrigation of cotton while saline water with salinity below 5 4 ds m 1 is more conducive to the sustainability of mulched drip irrigated cotton this concentration is lower than the 8 8 ds m 1 obtained by zhang et al 2020b who did not consider the effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality based on the soil quality assessment of cotton fields with saline water border irrigation for 10 years zhang et al 2020a concluded that the threshold for irrigation water salinity was 3 4 ds m 1 which was lower than that reported in this study in addition the soil quality assessment in this study accounted more evaluation indicators including soil physical chemical and biological properties to ensure that the assessment is more representative the short term implementation of saline water irrigation may have no significant harmful effect but its impact on the soil environment is sustained which may be risky after long term application the limitation of this study is that the experimental period was short thus it was difficult to reveal the underlying mechanism effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality consequently the effects of long term saline water drip irrigation on the soil environment in this area need further investigation 5 conclusion a three year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different irrigation water salinities on the cotton yield soil salinity and soil quality under mulched drip irrigation we observed that the irrigation water salinity threshold for cotton was 11 4 ds m 1 above which the yield began to decrease the year factor rather than irrigation water salinity significantly p 0 01 affected cotton yield soil ec e of the main root zone increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water irrigation water salinity 8 8 ds m 1 did not lead to salt accumulation with each successive year but a decrease of soil salt in 2018 moreover after continuous saline water irrigation for 3 years irrigation water salinity 5 4 ds m 1 had no significant effect on physicochemical properties of soil such as ph soc bd ks water stable aggregate and the activities of cat ure and alp nonetheless the sqi decreased gradually with increasing salinity of irrigation water comprehensive consideration of cotton yield soil salt accumulation and sqi it is more conducive to the sustainability of mulched drip irrigation for cotton with saline water below 5 4 ds m 1 in the ncp further studies on the underlying mechanism effects of long term saline water drip irrigation on the soil environment are still needed in the ncp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

phenolic compounds vitamin c and e pérez labrada et al 2019 these compounds are beneficial for human health such as reducing the risk of inflammatory processes cancer and cardiovascular diseases blando et al 2019 globally there is a shortage of vegetables to meet the requirement of a healthy diet dias et al 2017 greenhouse production can help to meet demand for vegetables particularly during the colder seasons maham et al 2020 greenhouse vegetable production system gvps in china has developed rapidly over the past 30 years liang et al 2018 recently urbanization has contributed to the rapid development of gvps in northern china he et al 2016 the total area of greenhouse vegetables reached 3 7 million ha in 2014 hao et al 2020 continuous increasing irrigation and fertilization amounts in the gvps improved vegetable yields while too much water and fertilizer applied can jeopardize fruit quality and compromise profit dias et al 2017 liu et al 2019 qu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 li et al 2018 pointed out that the conventional total n fertilization rate reached 2508 kg n ha 1 y 1 in shandong province of china therefore optimal water and fertilizer management

tomato and resource utilization efficiency as well as optimizing fruit quality economic yield x 1 fruit lycopene content x 2 fruit nitrate content x 3 and water use efficiency x 4 nitrogen use efficiency x 5 and net profit x 6 were selected for evaluation economic yield and net profit are what greenhouse tomato growers are most concerned about lycopene and nitrate content of fruits are important indexes for evaluating fruit quality and food security improving water and nitrogen use efficiency can effectively reduce resource waste and prevent environmental harm additionally seasons influenced greenhouse tomato production strongly so dataset were evaluated using principal component analysis in autumn and spring separately there were close correlations among these six indicators in both autumn and spring tables 3 and 4 standardized value of the six indicators under various treatments in autumn and spring were obtained using spss software tables s3 and s4 according to the principle that the accumulative contribution rate was greater than 85 and two and three principal components were obtained after dimension reduction of each index in autumn and spring respectively table 5 composition matrix and eigenvectors of the six indicators under the principal components were calculated tables s5 and s6 the f n values were calculated by the sum of the corresponding product of the eigenvector and the standardized values of the six indicators under various treatments in autumn and spring taking the dataset in autumn as an example the calculation formulas of f 1 under principal component 1 and f 2 under principal component 2 were as follows 5 f 1 0 538 x 1 0 526 x 2 0 063 x 3 0 376 x 4 0 131 x 5 0 520 x 6 6 f 2 0 249 x 1 0 229x 2 0 628x 3 0 365 x 4 0 522 x 5 0 293 x 6 the weighted means were calculated by the proportion of eigenvalues of two principal components for obtaining the comprehensive score f of the corresponding treatment table 6 the calculation formula is 7 f 0 580f 1 0 420f 2 similarly the f values of the corresponding treatments in spring were obtained table 6 compared with the other three fertilization practices sosc ranked first in the three irrigation treatments in both autumn and spring in autumn w2sosc was the first recommendation the ranking followed the order of sosc so cc sc under any irrigation regimes in autumn in spring the first place was got by w1sosc the ranking was sosc sc so cc under w1 and w2 and sosc so sc cc under w3 4 discussion soluble solids vitamin c and soluble sugar content of fruits increased with the decrease of water supply this phenomenon can be due to that increased water accumulation caused dilution of fruit compounds chen et al 2013 du et al 2017 more accumulated sugar and less water are conducive to vitamin c synthesis veit köhler et al 1999 lu et al 2019 besides the current study found that only chemical fertilizer applied treatment sc obtained relatively high nitrate content in fruits however the nitrate content in fruits in each treatment was far lower than the national vegetable safety standard of 600 mg kg 1 wang and li 2003 zou et al 2017 in the present study organic fertilizers produced lower nitrate content in tomato fruits than conventional ones table 2 herencia et al 2011 pointed out that organically managed soils generally provided plants with lower amounts of nitrogen than chemically fertilized soils and excess nitrogen in chemically fertilized soils was inclined to accumulate in fruits as nitrate when the amount of nitrogen supply exceeded the amount of nitrogen used by the fruits to produce protein with the decrease of water supply the yield decreased significantly irrigation amount of 100 etc 75 etc and 50 etc in this study produced 64 96 63 03 and 56 41 t ha 1 tomato fruits respectively zhang et al 2017 reported aboveground biomass was seriously inhibited under high water stress resulting in reduced yield in this study sc produced more yield than cc under sufficient irrigation condition moreover despite the larger yield in spring net profit was higher in autumn due to the higher off season market price fig 2 and table s1 results showed that sosc obtained the high net profit while cc had relatively low net profit under w1 and w2 and gained significantly higher net profit than sc under w3 in spring 2016 it can be concluded that both yield and net profit of sc under w1 were higher than those of cc previous studies found that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers significantly increased the economic benefit of 2 87 thousand dollars ha 1 on average and the highest economic benefit was obtained when the application ratio of chemical fertilizer to pig manure was 3 1 hao et al 2012 therefore the large proportion of chicken manure in cc of this study might be one of the reasons why cc treatment failed to show the advantages of combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in improving economic benefit results indicated that the strongly positive relationship between irrigation amount and total water consumption of tomato plants irrigation directly increases soil moisture content and soil water status has been further considered as the key factor to maintain the optimal water driving force and leaf stomatal function zhang et al 2018 plants in arid areas transmit signals to shoots that can limit transpiration thereby reducing water consumption wang et al 2020 additionally the results of this study showed that the gap of water consumption between different fertilization practices in the same growing season decreased with the decrease of irrigation water adequate water supply was conducive to nitrogen fertilizer to perform their roles sadras et al 2012 moreover the present study showed that sosc achieved greater water use efficiency under the three irrigation levels in four growing seasons the gaps of water use efficiency between fertilization practices were larger under w1 and w2 compared with w3 sc obtained lower water use efficiency than the other fertilization practices under w3 this clearly indicated 100 etc and 75 etc irrigation levels were helpful to promote water use efficiency of sc which even exceeded that of cc under the same irrigation condition cc only presented the advantages of the combination application of organic and inorganic fertilizers under w3 due to the slower mineralization rate of manure relative to chemical fertilizers murugan and swarnam 2013 previous studies have shown that deficit irrigation reduced the ability of crops to absorb and utilize nitrogen effectively especially in the case of nitrogen deficiency which may lead to a significant decrease in yield badr et al 2018 wang et al 2019 besides plant nitrogen uptake of tomato was low in cc this result may be explained by slow mineralization rate of organic matter and low mobilization of nutrients in chicken manure prevented enough soil nutrients supporting plant growth zhang et al 2012 however soluble organic or inorganic fertilizers had good mobility in the soil providing plants with better soil nutrient conditions moreover previous studies have suggested that combination of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers could provide mostly effective nutrients for crop growth agegnehu et al 2016 ding et al 2012 shedeed et al 2009 proposed that fertilizer should be applied in stages to timely meet crop nitrogen demand for achieving maximum nitrogen use efficiency higher plant nitrogen uptake in sosc in this study supported these earlier findings compared with organic or inorganic fertilizer application alone the combination of the two not only increased nitrogen use efficiency agegnehu et al 2016 wen et al 2016 but also improved economic benefit and sustained agricultural production by reducing chemical fertilizers use and alleviating soil environmental pollution caused by nitrogen leaching hernández et al 2014 in this study in comparison to cc sosc provided more available nutrients for plant growth which resulted in more yield and plant nitrogen uptake as well as lower nitrogen use efficiency however nitrogen use efficiency in cc was significantly greater than that in sc only under w3 a possible explanation for this result may be slow mineralization rate and the lack of adequate nutrient support for plant growth in cc compared with sc 5 conclusions optimal water and fertilizer management is urgently needed for sustainable greenhouse production with the increase of irrigation amount tomato yield total water consumption and plant nitrogen uptake improved conversely fruit soluble solids vitamin c soluble sugar content and water use efficiency wue reduced with the increased water supply the combined application of soluble organic and inorganic fertilizers sosc increased plant nitrogen uptake net profit and wue and significantly improved yield organic fertilizers addition reduced fruit nitrate content generally water deficit promoted chicken manures with chemical fertilizers application cc to obtain higher wue than only chemical fertilizer applied sc based on the principal component analysis it was concluded that the comprehensive ranking of the combined application of soluble organic and inorganic fertilizers sosc was first regardless of the irrigation levels and seasons importantly full irrigation 100 etc and deficit irrigation 75 etc in combination with soluble organic and chemical fertilizer w1sosc and w2sosc were highly recommended for spring and autumn tomato production respectively this study provided a scientific basis for the effective management of irrigation and fertilization in northwest china in various growing seasons further research

et al 2019 szabo et al 2019 tomato fruits have great economic and nutritional importance as well as high nutritional value thanks to the presence of numerous antioxidant compounds such as carotenoids phenolic compounds vitamin c and e pérez labrada et al 2019 these compounds are beneficial for human health such as reducing the risk of inflammatory processes cancer and cardiovascular diseases blando et al 2019 globally there is a shortage of vegetables to meet the requirement of a healthy diet dias et al 2017 greenhouse production can help to meet demand for vegetables particularly during the colder seasons maham et al 2020 greenhouse vegetable production system gvps in china has developed rapidly over the past 30 years liang et al 2018 recently urbanization has contributed to the rapid development of gvps in northern china he et al 2016 the total area of greenhouse vegetables reached 3 7 million ha in 2014 hao et al 2020 continuous increasing irrigation and fertilization amounts in the gvps improved vegetable yields while too much water and fertilizer applied can jeopardize fruit quality and compromise profit dias et al 2017 liu et al 2019 qu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 li et al 2018 pointed out that the conventional total n fertilization rate reached 2508 kg n ha 1 y 1 in shandong province of china therefore optimal water and fertilizer management for sustainable greenhouse production has become an important topic intensive greenhouse production involving chemical fertilizer and organic manure application may affect soil chemical and biological quality hao et al 2020 wu et al 2021 he et al 2016 reported that applying organic fertilizer more efficiently could reduce soil toxicity from manure application besides liquid fertilizer is often supplemented for longer term crops or species with high nitrogen requirements in order to mitigate the negative impacts of chemical n fertilization single source or blended liquid organic fertilizer management strategies have been developed and assessed for tomato production in the field qu et al 2020 liquid fertilizer also tends to be more quickly plant available compared to substrate incorporated fertilizer burnett et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to explore the comprehensive effects of soluble organic and or inorganic fertilizers on greenhouse tomato production mitigation measures for n leaching risk from greenhouse vegetable fields should consider regulations on irrigation and fertilization practices li et al 2018 tomato is sensitive to water deficit hou et al 2020 li et al 2017 xing et al 2015 which leads to a reduction in seed development and germination impairing vegetative growth and reproduction iovieno et al 2016 maham et al 2020 indicated that reduced irrigation led to increased adverse environmental impacts and the highest irrigation level and the lowest fertilization level led to best environmental performance wu et al 2019 found that the soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools were significantly affected by irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates and their interactions at various soil depths however optimizing the application of nitrogen under certain water conditions did not continue to increase yield cui et al 2020 yan et al 2019 zou et al 2020 therefore efficient water and fertilizer management practices

tomato and resource utilization efficiency as well as optimizing fruit quality economic yield x 1 fruit lycopene content x 2 fruit nitrate content x 3 and water use efficiency x 4 nitrogen use efficiency x 5 and net profit x 6 were selected for evaluation economic yield and net profit are what greenhouse tomato growers are most concerned about lycopene and nitrate content of fruits are important indexes for evaluating fruit quality and food security improving water and nitrogen use efficiency can effectively reduce resource waste and prevent environmental harm additionally seasons influenced greenhouse tomato production strongly so dataset were evaluated using principal component analysis in autumn and spring separately there were close correlations among these six indicators in both autumn and spring tables 3 and 4 standardized value of the six indicators under various treatments in autumn and spring were obtained using spss software tables s3 and s4 according to the principle that the accumulative contribution rate was greater than 85 and two and three principal components were obtained after dimension reduction of each index in autumn and spring respectively table 5 composition matrix and eigenvectors of the six indicators under the principal components were calculated tables s5 and s6 the f n values were calculated by the sum of the corresponding product of the eigenvector and the standardized values of the six indicators under various treatments in autumn and spring taking the dataset in autumn as an example the calculation formulas of f 1 under principal component 1 and f 2 under principal component 2 were as follows 5 f 1 0 538 x 1 0 526 x 2 0 063 x 3 0 376 x 4 0 131 x 5 0 520 x 6 6 f 2 0 249 x 1 0 229x 2 0 628x 3 0 365 x 4 0 522 x 5 0 293 x 6 the weighted means were calculated by the proportion of eigenvalues of two principal components for obtaining the comprehensive score f of the corresponding treatment table 6 the calculation formula is 7 f 0 580f 1 0 420f 2 similarly the f values of the corresponding treatments in spring were obtained table 6 compared with the other three fertilization practices sosc ranked first in the three irrigation treatments in both autumn and spring in autumn w2sosc was the first recommendation the ranking followed the order of sosc so cc sc under any irrigation regimes in autumn in spring the first place was got by w1sosc the ranking was sosc sc so cc under w1 and w2 and sosc so sc cc under w3 4 discussion soluble solids vitamin c and soluble sugar content of fruits increased with the decrease of water supply this phenomenon can be due to that increased water accumulation caused dilution of fruit compounds chen et al 2013 du et al 2017 more accumulated sugar and less water are conducive to vitamin c synthesis veit köhler et al 1999 lu et al 2019 besides the current study found that only chemical fertilizer applied treatment sc obtained relatively high nitrate content in fruits however the nitrate content in fruits in each treatment was far lower than the national vegetable safety standard of 600 mg kg 1 wang and li 2003 zou et al 2017 in the present study organic fertilizers produced lower nitrate content in tomato fruits than conventional ones table 2 herencia et al 2011 pointed out that organically managed soils generally provided plants with lower amounts of nitrogen than chemically fertilized soils and excess nitrogen in chemically fertilized soils was inclined to accumulate in fruits as nitrate when the amount of nitrogen supply exceeded the amount of nitrogen used by the fruits to produce protein with the decrease of water supply the yield decreased significantly irrigation amount of 100 etc 75 etc and 50 etc in this study produced 64 96 63 03 and 56 41 t ha 1 tomato fruits respectively zhang et al 2017 reported aboveground biomass was seriously inhibited under high water stress resulting in reduced yield in this study sc produced more yield than cc under sufficient irrigation condition moreover despite the larger yield in spring net profit was higher in autumn due to the higher off season market price fig 2 and table s1 results showed that sosc obtained the high net profit while cc had relatively low net profit under w1 and w2 and gained significantly higher net profit than sc under w3 in spring 2016 it can be concluded that both yield and net profit of sc under w1 were higher than those of cc previous studies found that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers significantly increased the economic benefit of 2 87 thousand dollars ha 1 on average and the highest economic benefit was obtained when the application ratio of chemical fertilizer to pig manure was 3 1 hao et al 2012 therefore the large proportion of chicken manure in cc of this study might be one of the reasons why cc treatment failed to show the advantages of combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in improving economic benefit results indicated that the strongly positive relationship between irrigation amount and total water consumption of tomato plants irrigation directly increases soil moisture content and soil water status has been further considered as the key factor to maintain the optimal water driving force and leaf stomatal function zhang et al 2018 plants in arid areas transmit signals to shoots that can limit transpiration thereby reducing water consumption wang et al 2020 additionally the results of this study showed that the gap of water consumption between different fertilization practices in the same growing season decreased with the decrease of irrigation water adequate water supply was conducive to nitrogen fertilizer to perform their roles sadras et al 2012 moreover the present study showed that sosc achieved greater water use efficiency under the three irrigation levels in four growing seasons the gaps of water use efficiency between fertilization practices were larger under w1 and w2 compared with w3 sc obtained lower water use efficiency than the other fertilization practices under w3 this clearly indicated 100 etc and 75 etc irrigation levels were helpful to promote water use efficiency of sc which even exceeded that of cc under the same irrigation condition cc only presented the advantages of the combination application of organic and inorganic fertilizers under w3 due to the slower mineralization rate of manure relative to chemical fertilizers murugan and swarnam 2013 previous studies have shown that deficit irrigation reduced the ability of crops to absorb and utilize nitrogen effectively especially in the case of nitrogen deficiency which may lead to a significant decrease in yield badr et al 2018 wang et al 2019 besides plant nitrogen uptake of tomato was low in cc this result may be explained by slow mineralization rate of organic matter and low mobilization of nutrients in chicken manure prevented enough soil nutrients supporting plant growth zhang et al 2012 however soluble organic or inorganic fertilizers had good mobility in the soil providing plants with better soil nutrient conditions moreover previous studies have suggested that combination of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers could provide mostly effective nutrients for crop growth agegnehu et al 2016 ding et al 2012 shedeed et al 2009 proposed that fertilizer should be applied in stages to timely meet crop nitrogen demand for achieving maximum nitrogen use efficiency higher plant nitrogen uptake in sosc in this study supported these earlier findings compared with organic or inorganic fertilizer application alone the combination of the two not only increased nitrogen use efficiency agegnehu et al 2016 wen et al 2016 but also improved economic benefit and sustained agricultural production by reducing chemical fertilizers use and alleviating soil environmental pollution caused by nitrogen leaching hernández et al 2014 in this study in comparison to cc sosc provided more available nutrients for plant growth which resulted in more yield and plant nitrogen uptake as well as lower nitrogen use efficiency however nitrogen use efficiency in cc was significantly greater than that in sc only under w3 a possible explanation for this result may be slow mineralization rate and the lack of adequate nutrient support for plant growth in cc compared with sc 5 conclusions optimal water and fertilizer management is urgently needed for sustainable greenhouse production with the increase of irrigation amount tomato yield total water consumption and plant nitrogen uptake improved conversely fruit soluble solids vitamin c soluble sugar content and water use efficiency wue reduced with the increased water supply the combined application of soluble organic and inorganic fertilizers sosc increased plant nitrogen uptake net profit and wue and significantly improved yield organic fertilizers addition reduced fruit nitrate content generally water deficit promoted chicken manures with chemical fertilizers application cc to obtain higher wue than only chemical fertilizer applied sc based on the principal component analysis it was concluded that the comprehensive ranking of the combined application of soluble organic and inorganic fertilizers sosc was first regardless of the irrigation levels and seasons importantly full irrigation 100 etc and deficit irrigation 75 etc in combination with soluble organic and chemical fertilizer w1sosc and w2sosc were highly recommended for spring and autumn tomato production respectively this study provided a scientific basis for the effective management of irrigation and fertilization in northwest china in various growing seasons further research may be undertaken to explore the effects of various fertilization rates and the ratio of soluble organic and inorganic fertilizers on greenhouse tomato production declaration of competing interest the

9684,fruit quality as affected by water deficit applied at different growth stages remain largely elusive therefore to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation di timing and degree under drip irrigation on fruit physical and chemical quality of citrus the low d15 mild d30 moderate d45 and severe d60 water deficit treatments were set at the growth stage i ii iii and iv respectively with a control treatment ck during two growing seasons the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the early growth stage stages i and ii had remarkable effects on physical quality of citrus the i d45 treatment increased the single fruit weight and firmness by 5 78 9 85 and 13 25 17 14 respectively and the ii d15 treatment improved them by 6 67 9 15 and 1 43 14 46 the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the middle growth stage stage iii had remarkable effects on physical and chemical quality of citrus there was no remarkable reduction in fruit physical quality under the iii d15 treatment while the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vitamin c vc total soluble solids tss and mi tss ta titratable acidity ratio were significantly increased by 12 95 17 67 9 26 17 84 7 90 19 65 9 10 29 20 7 68 15 96 and 18 07 29 19 p 0 05 respectively and ta was reduced by 8 82 9 91 the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the late growth stage stage iv had remarkable effects on chemical quality of citrus the iv d30 treatment significantly increased the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vc tss and mi by 22 95 25 54 16 47 17 79 18 56 19 54 25 63 50 23 12 49 20 59 and 18 87 24 47 p 0 05 respectively while reduced ta by 3 60 5 88 therefore i d45 and ii d15 treatments significantly improved physical quality of citrus by saving about 178 and 154 m3 ha at stage i and ii respectively iii d15 and iv d30 treatments significantly increased chemical quality of citrus by saving about 635 and 782 m3 ha at stage iii and iv respectively which was demonstrated as the suitable water deficit pattern and this strategy had no significant effect on yield among all the treatments the iv d30 treatment improved the fruit quality of citrus most significantly keywords citrus trees drought stress fruit quality water deficit strategy 1 introduction citrus is one of the most widely cultivated and diversified fruits in the world the current global annual production has reached 158 million tons among which the annual production in china is 44 million tons fao 2019 previous studies have shown that citrus fruits are one of the main sources of vc for humans gordon et al 2020 and citrus fibers possess better functional properties than dietary fibers from other sources such as grains due to their special microstructure and higher soluble dietary fiber zhang et al 2020 it is generally recognized that having citrus can reduce the risk of cancer cardiovascular disease and diabetes shahidi and yeo 2018 the world health organization also encourages the provision of high quality products to the markets of developed countries however global warming in recent years has led to an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall and evaporation events liu et al 2018 and the shortage of water resources has become the most important restrictive factor in agricultural production the main citrus producing areas in southern china have large rainfall but uneven temporal and spatial distribution the prevailing seasonal drought and engineering water shortage in these areas are the main reasons for the unstable yield and low quality of citrus therefore there is an urgent demand to explore suitable deficit irrigation strategies to improve the nutritional characteristics and fruit quality of citrus synchronously with saved irrigation water deficit irrigation di has been demonstrated to balance vegetative and reproductive growth of crops and thus inhibit their overgrowth thereby achieving the purpose of water conservation and quality improvement of citrus zhong et al 2019 many previous studies have shown that di reduces the concentration of titratable acidity ta improves the maturity index mi of citrus silveira et al 2020 increases the firmness and the concentrations of total soluble solid tss and mi of apple and peach zhong et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 multiple studies on the effect of di on citrus mainly focused on applying suitable water stress during the non critical water demand period panigrahi and srivastava 2016 silveira et al 2020 after rehydration fruit growth can accelerate to reach its potential size and quality which is known as compensatory growth of fruit kuşçu et al 2014 argued that excessive water stress could affect the quality of fruits even in a non sensitive period indicating that the effects of di on fruit quality of citrus are related to the degree of water stress under drip irrigation furthermore water deficit stage also affects fruit quality it has been shown that the formation of these qualities has diverse responses to varied degree of water deficit during different growth periods silveira et al 2020 water deficit applied at bud burst to flowering period promoted citrus flowering silveira et al 2020 but it also affected the completion of pollination leading to excessive fruit dropping in june zhong et al 2019 the application of di during the fruit growing period improved fruit chroma pérez pastor et al 2007 the sugar concentration and acidity of citrus increased through osmotic regulation when water deficit was applied at end of the swelling period and at the beginning of the ripening period which increased the palatability of citrus flavor obenland et al 2018 in addition severe water deficit applied at fruit expansion period could affect fruit size pérez pastor et al 2014 drip irrigation provides high frequency precise and uniform water supply and minimizes the deep leakage and leaching of nutrients from the irrigated root zone cote et al 2003 which can save water and promote nutrients absorbed by crops drip irrigation has great potential in improving single weight and total soluble solids tss of tomato liu et al 2011 increasing the size single weight and chroma of apples küçükyumuk et al 2012 raising the contents of glucose and sucrose of almond sánchez bel et al 2008 and improving the contents of glucose fructose and tss of jujube gao et al 2014 in summary although some scholars had studied the effect of water deficit on citrus quality they mainly focused on implementing water deficit in a particular stage or applying different degrees of water deficit in multiple stages which was different from our experimental design and objective in addition their research was not only aimed at citrus quality so the proposed water deficit strategy may not be suitable for the goal of obtaining high quality citrus this study included 17 treatments aimed to investigate the effects of water deficit degree timing and the interaction of two factors on citrus quality which was conducive to fully understand the impact of water deficit on citrus quality and maximize water saving the main purposes of this study are to 1 investigate the effects of water deficit under drip irrigation at different growth stages on the physical and chemical properties of citrus 2 explore the mechanisms of changes in citrus quality as affected by water deficit under di 3 propose an appropriate water deficit strategy at different growth stages of citrus in order to provide guidance for promoting the development of water saving quality improvement and efficiency enhancement of the citrus production industry in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in pujiang county chengdu city sichuan province china 30 19 12 n 103 25 48 e during two growing seasons from april 2017 to late january 2018 and from april 2018 to late january 2019 the soil type is yellow loam with ph of 5 5 averaged soil bulk density of 1 45 g cm3 field capacity of 37 89 and permanent wilting point of 15 38 soil volumetric water content it is usually difficult and expensive to directly measure the soil water content at permanent wilting point the research of richards and weaver 1943 was very important to adopt the now classical wilting point concept used by soil scientists which defined the permanent wilting point as water content retained in the soil under a matric potential of 1500 hpa in this study soil weighing 0 015 kg was saturated in small rings of known volume and subjected to a matric potential of 15 000 hpa in a pressure plate apparatus in order to measure the soil water content at the classical permanent wilting point of the soil we took undisturbed soil of 0 60 cm with an interval of 10 cm at three positions in the experimental area with a cutting ring volume of 100 cm3 put the cutting ring into a flat bottom container with a water level slightly lower than the height of the cutting ring to fully wet it and then add filter paper at the bottom of the cutting ring to drain water for 24 h evett et al 2019 finally the soil water content in each cutting ring was measured based on the drying method and the average value was taken as the field capacity of this study the experimental site is in the hinterland of chengdu plain which has subtropical humid monsoon climate total rainfall daily mean temperature and daily average relative humidity in 2017 and 2018 was 967 1 mm 16 58 c 81 01 and 1250 4 mm 16 52 c 81 86 respectively fig 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was performed on 8 year old shiranuhi citrus trees citrus reticulate c reticulata c sinenesis grafted on red tangerine citrus tangerine hort ex tanaka rootstock the main growth period of the citrus trees in the experiment was from early april every year to late february of the following year the whole growth period was divided into four growth stages i e bud bust to flowering stage stage ⅰ from early april to late april young fruit stage stage ⅱ from early may to late june fruit expansion stage stage ⅲ from early july to late october and fruit maturation stage stage ⅳ from early november to late february of the following year the experiment was carried out in a rain shelter in order to get rid of the influence of rainfall on water control the rain shelter is an arched structure with a height of 4 6 m and a width of 3 8 m which is open around to ensure ventilation the light transmittance of the rain shelter is 95 and in order to reduce the influence of dust it was cleaned once every 2 months the citrus trees are arranged in equal spacing with spacing between trees and rows of 2 5 3 0 m height of 2 25 2 53 m and truck diameter of 21 23 cm the groundwater depth in the experimental area is more than 12 m and the water quality meets the agricultural water standard which had no impact on the experimental the drainage ditches with width of 30 cm and depth of 60 cm were used in the experimental sites to prevent the lateral movement of water between experimental blocks buffer trees were adopted for isolation to avoid mutual influence among treatments drip irrigation was used in the experiment an irrigation pipe was arranged around the tree with a radius of 40 cm each tree was supplied with 10 built in drippers with a space of 25 cm whose type of dripper was pressure compensated the flow rate of the drippers was 1 6 l h the water quality was in accordance with the requirements of drip irrigation the remaining field management measures were the same for all treatments the low d15 mild d30 moderate d45 and severe d60 water deficit treatments were set at the growth stage i ii iii and iv respectively with a control treatment ck according to the local guidance and the physiological water demand of citrus citrus can grow normally when the soil water content is higher than 60 of the field capacity therefore 60 of the field capacity was used as the lower limit of irrigation under ck treatment in other words the ck treatment was irrigated when the soil water content was approximately near or lower than 60 of field capacity at stage i iv combined with the management experience of local farms we determined the irrigation amount in different stages of ck treatment in table 1 and obtained the irrigation maximum of ck treatment the irrigation time of other treatments were same as the irrigation dates of ck treatment the experiment consisted of a randomized block design with three replicates to minimize plot effects fig 2 and table 1 show the specific experimental design 2 3 meteorological factors air temperature relative air humidity and rainfall were measured using an automatic weather station wenjiang experimental station meteorological observatory recording at time step of 30 min 2 4 soil water content using a soil sampler the vertical soil gravimetric water content swc profile was measured at 10 cm intervals over the 60 cm deep soil layer at horizontal distances of 10 cm from the dripper backfill the holes after each measurement to ensure the minimum impact on the roots soil samples were taken 2 3 days and 6 11 days after irrigation the drying method was used to determine the swc the oven temperature was set to 110 and the drying time was 24 h the average value of the six parts was taken as the swc of this study 2 5 measurements of physical qualities after maturation one fruit was taken from the upper middle and lower parts of the east south west and north directions on the tree respectively the average weight of the harvested 12 single fruits was determined the firmness was measured at the upper middle and lower parts of the flesh using gy 4 gy 4 top cloud agri technology co ltd china and the firmness of these three parts was averaged as the actual fruit firmness hue angle h is one of the main attributes of color representing the actual perceived colors such as red 0 orange 45 and yellow 90 zhang and zhou 2019 therefore in this study h was selected as the main chroma parameter the h was measured at six positions along the fruits horizontal diameter using colorimeter cr 300 konika minolta japan the water content of fruits was determined by oven drying method fresh fruits were dried at 105 for 30 min and then dried at 70 until constant weigh 2 6 measurements of chemical qualities the glucose fructose and sucrose were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the reference substance was placed in a brown measuring bottle and then distilled water was added to make a solution with a concentration of 1 mg ml adjusted according to the actual content of the sample the test samples were obtained after mashing centrifuging 10 000 r min 5 min and filtering 0 45 m the analysis was carried on a phenomenex luna nh2 column 4 6 250 mm 5 µm with evaporative light scattering detector and acetonitrile aqueous solution 75 25 as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the eld60 detector s drift tube temperature was 70 and the carrier was nitrogen gain 7 spray pressure was 3 5 bar and the gas flow rate was 2 5 l min and the injection volume was 2 l the content of vc was determined by spectrophotometry pepkowitz 1943 total soluble solids tss was measured using a hand held sugar meter lh b55 0 55 the titratable acid ta was determined by titration with 0 1 n naoh metrohm 785 dmp titrino the maturity index mi was calculated as tss ta 2 7 the fruit number and yield after maturation we harvested all the fruits under each treatment and calculated the number of fruits per tree as the average fruit number of each tree the yield was calculated based on the fruit weight and average floor area of each tree 2 8 statistical analysis the data variance analysis was used by ibm spss statistical software package spss 19 0 inc usa and the means were compared by duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water content the variations of soil gravimetric water content swc under all treatments in two growing seasons is shown in fig 3 the lines in the fig 3 did not mean that soil water content decrease or increase was linear it only reflected the average rate of soil water content reduction between two observations irrigation was applied 3 6 15 and 12 times at stage i ii iii and iv respectively the swc of ck treatment varied from 15 44 16 55 before each irrigation in the two growing seasons in other words all water deficit treatments were irrigated as the swc of ck treatment was approximately near or lower than 60 of field capacity at stage i iv which met the experimental design in addition the swc of all water deficit treatments was lower than that of ck and became more obvious with the aggravation of water deficit 3 2 effect of water deficit at bud burst to flowering stage under drip irrigation on citrus quality the effect of water deficit on physico chemical qualities and yield of citrus at bud burst to flowering stage stage i under drip irrigation is shown in table 2 the physical qualities of citrus were significantly affected by water deficit under drip irrigation at stage i compared with ck water deficit applied at stage i significantly increased single fruit weight which was markedly increased by 10 64 17 48 under i d60 treatment p 0 05 except for i d15 treatment water deficit at stage i resulted in a decrease in hue angle especially in i d30 treatment with significant reduction by 5 56 7 34 p 0 05 the fruit firmness was increased by 10 84 38 57 p 0 05 during the two year deficit irrigation which was beneficial to transportation and storage for citrus water deficit at stage i showed no significant effect on the fruit water content water deficit influenced chemical qualities of citrus at stage i the i d45 treatment significantly increased fructose and glucose content by 10 81 and 5 15 respectively in 2017 compared with ck p 0 05 where there were no significant changes in fructose and glucose content under other treatments during the two years p 0 05 the i d15 treatment significantly increased sucrose content by 4 11 in 2018 p 0 05 whereas non significant changes were observed in other treatments p 0 05 the i d45 and i d60 treatments markedly improved tss content by 7 68 9 78 and 4 59 8 82 respectively p 0 05 but there were not significant differences in other treatments in 2017 and 2018 in 2017 both i d15 and i d30 treatments remarkably reduced ta content by 19 82 and 17 12 p 0 05 there was no significant effect on ta content under other treatments in these two years compared with ck the i d45 treatments markedly improved citrus yield by 3 07 p 0 05 and there was not difference in 2018 and the i d30 treatment significantly increased citrus yield by 5 09 5 54 p 0 05 but i d60 treatment significantly decreased citrus yield by 8 46 16 97 p 0 05 overall with the saving of 45 irrigation amount at stage i the i d45 treatment significantly improved the single fruit weight firmness and tss and the yield did not decrease significantly which was the suitable water deficit degree at stage i 3 3 effect of water deficit at young fruit stage under drip irrigation on citrus quality the effect of water deficit on physico chemical qualities and yield of citrus at young fruit stage stage ii under drip irrigation is shown in table 3 the water deficit at stage ii under drip irrigation had a significant effect on the physical qualities of citrus compared with ck the ii d15 treatment increased the single fruit weight by 6 67 9 15 during the two years p 0 05 differently the ii d60 treatment significantly decreased the single fruit weight by 6 20 8 12 p 0 05 all di treatments in stage ii led to a decrease in hue angle in 2017 and 2018 and decreased with the intensity of water deficit the hue angle was significantly decreased by 10 23 12 01 under ii d60 p 0 05 the ii d45 and ii d60 treatments showed an increasing trend of firmness with the intensity of water deficit and the ii d60 treatment significantly increase the firmness of fruits by 24 10 40 00 p 0 05 water deficit showed no significant effect on the water content at stage ii p 0 05 compared with ck the ii d15 treatment significantly increased the contents of fructose glucose and sucrose by 7 56 11 62 0 77 8 23 and 4 67 7 21 respectively p 0 05 indicating that the low water

and degree on citrus quality yield and the fruit number the results of multi way analysis of variance of deficit irrigation stage and degree on citrus quality yield and the fruit number are shown in table 6 water deficit stage and degree had extremely significant effect on citrus quality yield and fruit number p 0 01 except for fructose in 2017 and the effect of water deficit stage on fructose reached a significant level in 2017 p 0 05 in addition the interaction between both deficit irrigation stage and degree also had extremely significant effect on citrus quality yield and the fruit number p 0 01 indicating that we can analyze the effect of water deficit on citrus quality and the fruit number at a certain growth stage 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water deficit under drip irrigation at different growth stages on citrus quality it was found that the water deficit under drip irrigation applied at early stages stage i and stage ii had a significant effect on the physical quality of citrus but it showed little impact on chemical quality it can be seen from fig 3 that the soil water content under i d15 i d30 i d45 and i d60 treatments was lower than ck which may affect pollination rodriguez et al 2007 resulting in excessive fruit dropping in june the existing citrus could obtain more photosynthate to increase the single fruit weight moreover water deficit applied at stage i and ii limited the vegetative growth of fruit trees cui et al 2009 due to the compensating effect of water deficit that is conducive to energy storage selahvarzi et al 2017 more photosynthetic products can be accumulated to provide key energy for the reproductive growth of citrus thus increasing the weight of single fruits the citrus exposed to more light resulting in the increase of surface temperature of citrus fruits 20 slowed down the decomposition of chlorophyll alquézar et al 2008 and then affected the chroma of citrus in the case of water deficit inositol was accumulated in the flesh of plants to enhance stress resistance thus promoting the production of pectin valluru and van den ende 2011 thus improving fruit firmness however sucrose produced by photosynthesis in this period was mainly used for cell division differentiation and the construction of various organelles moreover the juice sac cells were not vacuolated at this time so there was little difference in chemical quality of fruits among the treatments it can be observed that the water deficit applied at middle stage stage iii had a significant effect on the physical and chemical quality of citrus stage iii is the key period of pulp cell expansion caused by the rapid increase of water content of the juice sac cells and water deficit could seriously inhibit its expansion thus affecting single fruit weight and water content it can be seen from table 4 that the single fruit weight in 2018 was lower than that in 2017 under the same treatment after water deficit at stage iii which was due to the higher soil water content in 2017 under the same treatment fig 3 volschenk 2021 reported that the effect of water stress on fruit during fruit expansion stage was mainly exhibited in the size of the fruit stage iii is also a key period of carotenoid synthesis bain 1958 water deficit interfered with the synthesis of carotenoids by increasing the content of gibberellin davenport 2011 and abscisic acid zhang and davies 1990 in leaves and ultimately affected the peel chroma in addition water deficit could inhibit the degradation of pectin and the destruction of the cellular hemicellulose structure of cell walls and finally increased the fruit firmness water deficit usually causes a decrease in osmotic potential plant cells maintain cell turgor by decomposing sucrose and accumulating solutes barry et al 2004 moreover water deficit also increases the activity of soluble sugar hockema and etxeberria 2001 and promotes osmotic regulation however the influence of water deficit applied at stage iii on fruit water content could also be an important factor influencing the changes of fructose glucose sucrose vc ta and tss contents compared with the early and middle stages the water deficit in the late stage stage iv had a significant effect on the chemical quality of citrus while had little effect on the physical quality at fruit maturation stage the growth of flesh tissue was almost complete and thus the physical quality of fruit showed no obvious change cui et al 2009 the fruits water content did not change significantly when stage iv was under water stress condition indicating that the changes of fructose glucose and sucrose contents were not caused by passive dehydration of the juice sac cells which may be the result of the impact of water deficit on sucrose hydrolysis barry et al 2004 meanwhile the hydrolysis of sucrose affected the sucrose concentration gradient between the juice sac cells and the phloem sugar unloading zones and in turn affected the sink strength this directly or indirectly influence the allocation of photosynthetic products from source leaves to fruits finally affecting the accumulation of sugar in citrus fruits some studies proposed that degradation of ta mainly occurred at stage iv lado et al 2018 in accordance with this the present study found that the iv 15 iv 30 and iv 45 treatments reduced the ta content thus indicating that appropriate water deficit at stage iv promoted the degradation of ta it was found that the vc content was increased under iv 15 iv 30 and iv 45 treatments which was also observed by wang et al 2011 4 2 effect of water deficit degrees under drip irrigation at the same growth stage on citrus quality in this study it was found that the i d15 i d30 i d45 and i d60 treatments all increased the single fruit weight and firmness which showed an upward trend as the water deficit increased and the soil water content fig 3 decreased with the aggravation of water deficit that is there was a negative correlation between soil water content at stage i and single fruit weight and firmness this agrees with zhong et al 2019 the treatments of ii d15 and ii d30 increased the single fruit weight whereas under the ii d45 and ii d60 treatments it significantly decreased this indicated that when the water deficit at stage ii increased the water stress from mild water deficit ii d30 to moderate water deficit ii d45 the major factor affecting the single fruit weight changed from restricting vegetative growth to inhibiting cell division rodrigues et al 2019 the ii d15 ii d30 and ii d45 treatments did not significantly affect the vc content however the vc content was remarkably decreased under the ii d60 treatment although the stage ii was not the main stage for vc synthesis severe water deficit ii d60 during this growth stage might have an irreversible impact on the photosynthetic reaction center of crops resulting in reduced dark reaction capacity of crops and unbalanced photoelectron demand as well as a lot of free radicals in the accumulation stage leading vc to be oxidized aziz et al 2018 in contrast to the growth stage ii the iii d15 and iii d30 treatments significantly increased vc which was mainly due to the fact that water deficit at stage iii reduced the leaf area index and enhanced the light intensity in the canopy and enhanced the synthesis capacity of vc wang et al 2011 however under the iii d45 and iii d60 treatments the content of vc was significantly reduced which could be due to the large consumption of vc as an antioxidant at stage iii and iv with the intensification of water deficit the contents of fructose glucose sucrose tss and mi all showed a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing this might be related to osmotic adjustment and with the water deficit increased water deficit seriously affected photosynthesis and sugar transportation rodrigues et al 2019 resulting in the reduction of fructose glucose sucrose tss content and mi 4 3 the citrus quality can be significantly improved by proper water deficit pattern under drip irrigation the effects of water deficit on the fruit quality of citrus are determined by the combination of the water deficit timing and degree in this study the i d45 and ii d15 treatments significantly improved single fruit weight and firmness and higher firmness could contribute to less economic losses caused by storage and transportation the iii d15 and iv d30 treatments significantly increased the contents of fructose glucose and sucrose p 0 05 and the tss content was also significantly increased correspondingly the tss and ta content are known to be used commercially as indicators of fruit riper the taste of citrus fruits is mainly determined by the ratio of tss to ta content as the capsule mi goldenberg et al 2014 in this study both iii d15 and iv d30 treatments significantly increased mi the pulp of citrus was also rich in vc making the most important contribution to antioxidant performance and nutritional value of citrus goldenberg et al 2014 this study found the citrus yield under i d45 40 101 and 34 600 kg ha and ii d15 39 294 and 35 293 kg ha treatments did not decrease significantly and iii d15 37 448 and 33 100 kg ha and iv d30 38 088 and 34 350 kg ha treatments also did not significantly reduce the citrus yield and fruit number in 2017 and 2018 which was the proper water deficit pattern under drip irrigation in conclusion the application of i d45 ii d15 iii d15 and iv d30 treatments at stage i ii iii and iv respectively significantly improved the citrus quality despite this study are focusing on citrus quality parameters there are another parameter that should be considered the fruits number and yield the yield and fruit number under the appropriate water deficit mode we proposed proved that we can obtain high quality citrus and acceptable yield at the same time in addition if the goal is to maximize the economy this study should establish a functional relationship between the price difference of different quality fruits and the degree of yield loss however price factors are greatly affected by market fluctuations therefore the analysis of yield and quality can explain the significance and application value of water saving irrigation pattern 5 conclusion water deficit under drip irrigation applied at early growth stage stage i and ii mainly affected the fruit physical quality of citrus compared with ck i d15 i d30 i d45 i d60 ii d15 and ii d30 treatments significantly increased single fruit weight and firmness and i d45 treatment markedly improved them by 5 78 9 85 and 13 25 17 14 respectively and the ii d15 treatment also improved them by 6 67 9 15 and 1 43 14 46 furthermore i d45 treatment improved tss by 7 68 9 78 and ii d15 treatment increased the contents of fructose sucrose tss and mi by 7 56 11 62 4 67 7 21 7 68 8 82 and 30 16 40 67 respectively i d45 40 101 and 34 600 kg ha and ii d15 39 294 and 35 293 kg ha treatments had no significant effect on citrus yield the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the middle growth stage stage iii had remarkable effects on both physical and chemical quality of citrus compared with ck water deficit applied at stage iii reduced single fruit weight hue angle and firmness while no significant decrease was observed under the iii d15 treatment meanwhile iii d15 treatment significantly increased the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vc tss and mi by 12 95 17 67 9 26 17 84 7 90 19 65 9 10 29 20 7 68 15 96 and 18 07 29 19 respectively while reduced ta by 8 82 9 91 iii d30 37 448 and 33 100 kg ha treatment did not significantly decrease the citrus yield the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the late growth stage stage iv had remarkable effects on chemical quality of citrus compared with ck iv d15 iv d30 and iv d45 treatments did not change significantly single fruit weight and fruit water content while significantly increased the contents of vc and mi and iv d30 treatment improved the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vc tss and mi by 22 95 25 54 16 47 17 79 18 56 19 54 25 63 50 23 12 49 20 59 and 18 87 24 47 respectively while reduced ta by 3 60 5 88 iv d30 treatment 38 088 and 34 350 kg ha did not significantly influence the citrus yield conclusively under the drip irrigation the application of i d45 ii d15 iii d15 and iv d30 treatments at stage i ii iii and iv respectively saved 178 154 635 and 782 m3 ha respectively and improved the fruit quality of citrus without significant effect on yield which was demonstrated as the optimal water deficit pattern among all the treatments the iv d30 treatment resulted in the most obvious

9684,fruit quality as affected by water deficit applied at different growth stages remain largely elusive therefore to evaluate the effects of deficit irrigation di timing and degree under drip irrigation on fruit physical and chemical quality of citrus the low d15 mild d30 moderate d45 and severe d60 water deficit treatments were set at the growth stage i ii iii and iv respectively with a control treatment ck during two growing seasons the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the early growth stage stages i and ii had remarkable effects on physical quality of citrus the i d45 treatment increased the single fruit weight and firmness by 5 78 9 85 and 13 25 17 14 respectively and the ii d15 treatment improved them by 6 67 9 15 and 1 43 14 46 the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the middle growth stage stage iii had remarkable effects on physical and chemical quality of citrus there was no remarkable reduction in fruit physical quality under the iii d15 treatment while the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vitamin c vc total soluble solids tss and mi tss ta titratable acidity ratio were significantly increased by 12 95 17 67 9 26 17 84 7 90 19 65 9 10 29 20 7 68 15 96 and 18 07 29 19 p 0 05 respectively and ta was reduced by 8 82 9 91 the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the late growth stage stage iv had remarkable effects on chemical quality of citrus the iv d30 treatment significantly increased the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vc tss and mi by 22 95 25 54 16 47 17 79 18 56 19 54 25 63 50 23 12 49 20 59 and 18 87 24 47 p 0 05 respectively while reduced ta by 3 60 5 88 therefore i d45 and ii d15 treatments significantly improved physical quality of citrus by saving about 178 and 154 m3 ha at stage i and ii respectively iii d15 and iv d30 treatments significantly increased chemical quality of citrus by saving about 635 and 782 m3 ha at stage iii and iv respectively which was demonstrated as the suitable water deficit pattern and this strategy had no significant effect on yield among all the treatments the iv d30 treatment improved the fruit quality of citrus most significantly keywords citrus trees drought stress fruit quality water deficit strategy 1 introduction citrus is one of the most widely cultivated and diversified fruits in the world the current global annual production has reached 158 million tons among which the annual production in china is 44 million tons fao 2019 previous studies have shown that citrus fruits are one of the main sources of vc for humans gordon et al 2020 and citrus fibers possess better functional properties than dietary fibers from other sources such as grains due to their special microstructure and higher soluble dietary fiber zhang et al 2020 it is generally recognized that having citrus can reduce the risk of cancer cardiovascular disease and diabetes shahidi and yeo 2018 the world health organization also encourages the provision of high quality products to the markets of developed countries however global warming in recent years has led to an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall and evaporation events liu et al 2018 and the shortage of water resources has become the most important restrictive factor in agricultural production the main citrus producing areas in southern china have large rainfall but uneven temporal and spatial distribution the prevailing seasonal drought and engineering water shortage in these areas are the main reasons for the unstable yield and low quality of citrus therefore there is an urgent demand to explore suitable deficit irrigation strategies to improve the nutritional characteristics and fruit quality of citrus synchronously with saved irrigation water deficit irrigation di has been demonstrated to balance vegetative and reproductive growth of crops and thus inhibit their overgrowth thereby achieving the purpose of water conservation and quality improvement of citrus zhong et al 2019 many previous studies have shown that di reduces the concentration of titratable acidity ta improves the maturity index mi of citrus silveira et al 2020 increases the firmness and the concentrations of total soluble solid tss and mi of apple and peach zhong et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 multiple studies on the effect of di on citrus mainly focused on applying suitable water stress during the non critical water demand period panigrahi and srivastava 2016 silveira et al 2020 after rehydration fruit growth can accelerate to reach its potential size and quality which is known as compensatory growth of fruit kuşçu et al 2014 argued that excessive water stress could affect the quality of fruits even in a non sensitive period indicating that the effects of di on fruit quality of citrus are related to the degree of water stress under drip irrigation furthermore water deficit stage also affects fruit quality it has been shown that the formation of these qualities has diverse responses to varied degree of water deficit during different growth periods silveira et al 2020 water deficit applied at bud burst to flowering period promoted citrus flowering silveira et al 2020 but it also affected the completion of pollination leading to excessive fruit dropping in june zhong et al 2019 the application of di during the fruit growing period improved fruit chroma pérez pastor et al 2007 the sugar concentration and acidity of citrus increased through osmotic regulation when water deficit was applied at end of the swelling period and at the beginning of the ripening period which increased the palatability of citrus flavor obenland et al 2018 in addition severe water deficit applied at fruit expansion period could affect fruit size pérez pastor et al 2014 drip irrigation provides high frequency precise and uniform water supply and minimizes the deep leakage and leaching of nutrients from the irrigated root zone cote et al 2003 which can save water and promote nutrients absorbed by crops drip irrigation has great potential in improving single weight and total soluble solids tss of tomato liu et al 2011 increasing the size single weight and chroma of apples küçükyumuk et al 2012 raising the contents of glucose and sucrose of almond sánchez bel et al 2008 and improving the contents of glucose fructose and tss of jujube gao et al 2014 in summary although some scholars had studied the effect of water deficit on citrus quality they mainly focused on implementing water deficit in a particular stage or applying different degrees of water deficit in multiple stages which was different from our experimental design and objective in addition their research was not only aimed at citrus quality so the proposed water deficit strategy may not be suitable for the goal of obtaining high quality citrus this study included 17 treatments aimed to investigate the effects of water deficit degree timing and the interaction of two factors on citrus quality which was conducive to fully understand the impact of water deficit on citrus quality and maximize water saving the main purposes of this study are to 1 investigate the effects of water deficit under drip irrigation at different growth stages on the physical and chemical properties of citrus 2 explore the mechanisms of changes in citrus quality as affected by water deficit under di 3 propose an appropriate water deficit strategy at different growth stages of citrus in order to provide guidance for promoting the development of water saving quality improvement and efficiency enhancement of the citrus production industry in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in pujiang county chengdu city sichuan province china 30 19 12 n 103 25 48 e during two growing seasons from april 2017 to late january 2018 and from april 2018 to late january 2019 the soil type is yellow loam with ph of 5 5 averaged soil bulk density of 1 45 g cm3 field capacity of 37 89 and permanent wilting point of 15 38 soil volumetric water content it is usually difficult and expensive to directly measure the soil water content at permanent wilting point the research of richards and weaver 1943 was very important to adopt the now classical wilting point concept used by soil scientists which defined the permanent wilting point as water content retained in the soil under a matric potential of 1500 hpa in this study soil weighing 0 015 kg was saturated in small rings of known volume and subjected to a matric potential of 15 000 hpa in a pressure plate apparatus in order to measure the soil water content at the classical permanent wilting point of the soil we took undisturbed soil of 0 60 cm with an interval of 10 cm at three positions in the experimental area with a cutting ring volume of 100 cm3 put the cutting ring into a flat bottom container with a water level slightly lower than the height of the cutting ring to fully wet it and then add filter paper at the bottom of the cutting ring to drain water for 24 h evett et al 2019 finally the soil water content in each cutting ring was measured based on the drying method and the average value was taken as the field capacity of this study the experimental site is in the hinterland of chengdu plain which has subtropical humid monsoon climate total rainfall daily mean temperature and daily average relative humidity in 2017 and 2018 was 967 1 mm 16 58 c 81 01 and 1250 4 mm 16 52 c 81 86 respectively fig 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was performed on 8 year old shiranuhi citrus trees citrus reticulate c reticulata c sinenesis grafted on red tangerine citrus tangerine hort ex tanaka rootstock the main growth period of the citrus trees in the experiment was from early april every year to late february of the following year the whole growth period was divided into four growth stages i e bud bust to flowering stage stage ⅰ from early april to late april young fruit stage stage ⅱ from early may to late june fruit expansion stage stage ⅲ from early july to late october and fruit maturation stage stage ⅳ from early november to late february of the following year the experiment was carried out in a rain shelter in order to get rid of the influence of rainfall on water control the rain shelter is an arched structure with a height of 4 6 m and a width of 3 8 m which is open around to ensure ventilation the light transmittance of the rain shelter is 95 and in order to reduce the influence of dust it was cleaned once every 2 months the citrus trees are arranged in equal spacing with spacing between trees and rows of 2 5 3 0 m height of 2 25 2 53 m and truck diameter of 21 23 cm the groundwater depth in the experimental area is more than 12 m and the water quality meets the agricultural water standard which had no impact on the experimental the drainage ditches with width of 30 cm and depth of 60 cm were used in the experimental sites to prevent the lateral movement of water between experimental blocks buffer trees were adopted for isolation to avoid mutual influence among treatments drip irrigation was used in the experiment an irrigation pipe was arranged around the tree with a radius of 40 cm each tree was supplied with 10 built in drippers with a space of 25 cm whose type of dripper was pressure compensated the flow rate of the drippers was 1 6 l h the water quality was in accordance with the requirements of drip irrigation the remaining field management measures were the same for all treatments the low d15 mild d30 moderate d45 and severe d60 water deficit treatments were set at the growth stage i ii iii and iv respectively with a control treatment ck according to the local guidance and the physiological water demand of citrus citrus can grow normally when the soil water content is higher than 60 of the field capacity therefore 60 of the field capacity was used as the lower limit of irrigation under ck treatment in other words the ck treatment was irrigated when the soil water content was approximately near or lower than 60 of field capacity at stage i iv combined with the management experience of local farms we determined the irrigation amount in different stages of ck treatment in table 1 and obtained the irrigation maximum of ck treatment the irrigation time of other treatments were same as the irrigation dates of ck treatment the experiment consisted of a randomized block design with three replicates to minimize plot effects fig 2 and table 1 show the

reached a significant level in 2017 p 0 05 in addition the interaction between both deficit irrigation stage and degree also had extremely significant effect on citrus quality yield and the fruit number p 0 01 indicating that we can analyze the effect of water deficit on citrus quality and the fruit number at a certain growth stage 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water deficit under drip irrigation at different growth stages on citrus quality it was found that the water deficit under drip irrigation applied at early stages stage i and stage ii had a significant effect on the physical quality of citrus but it showed little impact on chemical quality it can be seen from fig 3 that the soil water content under i d15 i d30 i d45 and i d60 treatments was lower than ck which may affect pollination rodriguez et al 2007 resulting in excessive fruit dropping in june the existing citrus could obtain more photosynthate to increase the single fruit weight moreover water deficit applied at stage i and ii limited the vegetative growth of fruit trees cui et al 2009 due to the compensating effect of water deficit that is conducive to energy storage selahvarzi et al 2017 more photosynthetic products can be accumulated to provide key energy for the reproductive growth of citrus thus increasing the weight of single fruits the citrus exposed to more light resulting in the increase of surface temperature of citrus fruits 20 slowed down the decomposition of chlorophyll alquézar et al 2008 and then affected the chroma of citrus in the case of water deficit inositol was accumulated in the flesh of plants to enhance stress resistance thus promoting the production of pectin valluru and van den ende 2011 thus improving fruit firmness however sucrose produced by photosynthesis in this period was mainly used for cell division differentiation and the construction of various organelles moreover the juice sac cells were not vacuolated at this time so there was little difference in chemical quality of fruits among the treatments it can be observed that the water deficit applied at middle stage stage iii had a significant effect on the physical and chemical quality of citrus stage iii is the key period of pulp cell expansion caused by the rapid increase of water content of the juice sac cells and water deficit could seriously inhibit its expansion thus affecting single fruit weight and water content it can be seen from table 4 that the single fruit weight in 2018 was lower than that in 2017 under the same treatment after water deficit at stage iii which was due to the higher soil water content in 2017 under the same treatment fig 3 volschenk 2021 reported that the effect of water stress on fruit during fruit expansion stage was mainly exhibited in the size of the fruit stage iii is also a key period of carotenoid synthesis bain 1958 water deficit interfered with the synthesis of carotenoids by increasing the content of gibberellin davenport 2011 and abscisic acid zhang and davies 1990 in leaves and ultimately affected the peel chroma in addition water deficit could inhibit the degradation of pectin and the destruction of the cellular hemicellulose structure of cell walls and finally increased the fruit firmness water deficit usually causes a decrease in osmotic potential plant cells maintain cell turgor by decomposing sucrose and accumulating solutes barry et al 2004 moreover water deficit also increases the activity of soluble sugar hockema and etxeberria 2001 and promotes osmotic regulation however the influence of water deficit applied at stage iii on fruit water content could also be an important factor influencing the changes of fructose glucose sucrose vc ta and tss contents compared with the early and middle stages the water deficit in the late stage stage iv had a significant effect on the chemical quality of citrus while had little effect on the physical quality at fruit maturation stage the growth of flesh tissue was almost complete and thus the physical quality of fruit showed no obvious change cui et al 2009 the fruits water content did not change significantly when stage iv was under water stress condition indicating that the changes of fructose glucose and sucrose contents were not caused by passive dehydration of the juice sac cells which may be the result of the impact of water deficit on sucrose hydrolysis barry et al 2004 meanwhile the hydrolysis of sucrose affected the sucrose concentration gradient between the juice sac cells and the phloem sugar unloading zones and in turn affected the sink strength this directly or indirectly influence the allocation of photosynthetic products from source leaves to fruits finally affecting the accumulation of sugar in citrus fruits some studies proposed that degradation of ta mainly occurred at stage iv lado et al 2018 in accordance with this the present study found that the iv 15 iv 30 and iv 45 treatments reduced the ta content thus indicating that appropriate water deficit at stage iv promoted the degradation of ta it was found that the vc content was increased under iv 15 iv 30 and iv 45 treatments which was also observed by wang et al 2011 4 2 effect of water deficit degrees under drip irrigation at the same growth stage on citrus quality in this study it was found that the i d15 i d30 i d45 and i d60 treatments all increased the single fruit weight and firmness which showed an upward trend as the water deficit increased and the soil water content fig 3 decreased with the aggravation of water deficit that is there was a negative correlation between soil water content at stage i and single fruit weight and firmness this agrees with zhong et al 2019 the treatments of ii d15 and ii d30 increased the single fruit weight whereas under the ii d45 and ii d60 treatments it significantly decreased this indicated that when the water deficit at stage ii increased the water stress from mild water deficit ii d30 to moderate water deficit ii d45 the major factor affecting the single fruit weight changed from restricting vegetative growth to inhibiting cell division rodrigues et al 2019 the ii d15 ii d30 and ii d45 treatments did not significantly affect the vc content however the vc content was remarkably decreased under the ii d60 treatment although the stage ii was not the main stage for vc synthesis severe water deficit ii d60 during this growth stage might have an irreversible impact on the photosynthetic reaction center of crops resulting in reduced dark reaction capacity of crops and unbalanced photoelectron demand as well as a lot of free radicals in the accumulation stage leading vc to be oxidized aziz et al 2018 in contrast to the growth stage ii the iii d15 and iii d30 treatments significantly increased vc which was mainly due to the fact that water deficit at stage iii reduced the leaf area index and enhanced the light intensity in the canopy and enhanced the synthesis capacity of vc wang et al 2011 however under the iii d45 and iii d60 treatments the content of vc was significantly reduced which could be due to the large consumption of vc as an antioxidant at stage iii and iv with the intensification of water deficit the contents of fructose glucose sucrose tss and mi all showed a trend of firstly increasing and then decreasing this might be related to osmotic adjustment and with the water deficit increased water deficit seriously affected photosynthesis and sugar transportation rodrigues et al 2019 resulting in the reduction of fructose glucose sucrose tss content and mi 4 3 the citrus quality can be significantly improved by proper water deficit pattern under drip irrigation the effects of water deficit on the fruit quality of citrus are determined by the combination of the water deficit timing and degree in this study the i d45 and ii d15 treatments significantly improved single fruit weight and firmness and higher firmness could contribute to less economic losses caused by storage and transportation the iii d15 and iv d30 treatments significantly increased the contents of fructose glucose and sucrose p 0 05 and the tss content was also significantly increased correspondingly the tss and ta content are known to be used commercially as indicators of fruit riper the taste of citrus fruits is mainly determined by the ratio of tss to ta content as the capsule mi goldenberg et al 2014 in this study both iii d15 and iv d30 treatments significantly increased mi the pulp of citrus was also rich in vc making the most important contribution to antioxidant performance and nutritional value of citrus goldenberg et al 2014 this study found the citrus yield under i d45 40 101 and 34 600 kg ha and ii d15 39 294 and 35 293 kg ha treatments did not decrease significantly and iii d15 37 448 and 33 100 kg ha and iv d30 38 088 and 34 350 kg ha treatments also did not significantly reduce the citrus yield and fruit number in 2017 and 2018 which was the proper water deficit pattern under drip irrigation in conclusion the application of i d45 ii d15 iii d15 and iv d30 treatments at stage i ii iii and iv respectively significantly improved the citrus quality despite this study are focusing on citrus quality parameters there are another parameter that should be considered the fruits number and yield the yield and fruit number under the appropriate water deficit mode we proposed proved that we can obtain high quality citrus and acceptable yield at the same time in addition if the goal is to maximize the economy this study should establish a functional relationship between the price difference of different quality fruits and the degree of yield loss however price factors are greatly affected by market fluctuations therefore the analysis of yield and quality can explain the significance and application value of water saving irrigation pattern 5 conclusion water deficit under drip irrigation applied at early growth stage stage i and ii mainly affected the fruit physical quality of citrus compared with ck i d15 i d30 i d45 i d60 ii d15 and ii d30 treatments significantly increased single fruit weight and firmness and i d45 treatment markedly improved them by 5 78 9 85 and 13 25 17 14 respectively and the ii d15 treatment also improved them by 6 67 9 15 and 1 43 14 46

101 and 34 600 kg ha and ii d15 39 294 and 35 293 kg ha treatments had no significant effect on citrus yield the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the middle growth stage stage iii had remarkable effects on both physical and chemical quality of citrus compared with ck water deficit applied at stage iii reduced single fruit weight hue angle and firmness while no significant

29 20 7 68 15 96 and 18 07 29 19 respectively while reduced ta by 8 82 9 91 iii d30 37 448 and 33 100 kg ha treatment did not significantly decrease the citrus yield the application of water deficit under drip irrigation at the late growth stage stage iv had remarkable effects on chemical quality of citrus compared with ck iv d15 iv d30 and iv d45 treatments did not change significantly single fruit weight and fruit water content while significantly increased the contents of vc and mi and iv d30 treatment improved the contents of fructose glucose sucrose vc tss and mi by 22 95 25 54 16 47 17 79 18 56 19 54 25 63 50 23 12 49 20 59 and 18 87 24 47 respectively while reduced ta by 3 60 5 88 iv d30 treatment 38 088 and 34 350 kg ha did not significantly influence the citrus yield conclusively under the drip irrigation the application of i d45 ii d15 iii d15 and iv d30 treatments at stage i ii iii and iv respectively saved 178 154 635 and 782 m3 ha respectively and improved the fruit quality of citrus without significant effect on yield which was demonstrated as the optimal water deficit pattern among all the treatments the iv d30 treatment resulted in the most obvious
