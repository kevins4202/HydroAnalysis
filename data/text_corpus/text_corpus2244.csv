11220,increasing temperatures and rainfall variability in the midwestern u s have spurred interest in strategies to reduce risks of heat and drought stress in traditionally rainfed crops including asparagus a long term field experiment was conducted on sandy soils in western michigan from 2010 17 to evaluate the effects of three levels of irrigation none overhead or sub surface drip and two asparagus cultivars guelph millennium gm and jersey supreme js for reducing these risks overhead irrigation during the fern growth period resulted in cumulative yield improvements of 10 for gm during the 2012 17 growing seasons with the largest yield benefits 21 occurring in 2012 following hot dry conditions the previous summer in contrast cumulative yields of js were unaffected by irrigation and yield reductions of 13 due to irrigation were observed in 2017 following wet conditions the previous late summer and fall estimates of cultivar water use by depth suggest that js was better able to tolerate drought due to a deeper root system compared to gm however our results suggest that js may also be more sensitive than gm to excessive soil moisture during fall senescence yield response did not vary with delivery system but sub surface drip used less water than overhead irrigation these results demonstrate the important role of both genetics and management practices in mitigating drought risk keywords asparagus climate change adaptation drought stress rooting depth sub surface irrigation overhead irrigation 1 introduction increasing summer temperatures and rainfall variability have been observed in the great lakes region and climate models predict continuation of these trends villarini et al 2011 pryor et al 2014 according to pryor et al 2014 the average midwest air temperature increased by more than 0 80 c between 1900 and 2010 with an acceleration of warming observed since 1950 trends in midwest drought severity and duration depend on the geographical area timescale and timing evaluated for example drought stress and severity in the midwest reportedly declined between 1916 2007 mishra and cherkauer 2010 in contrast dai et al 2016 report increasing temperatures and declining rainfall in the late growing season between 1980 2013 regional climate models predict higher average levels of spring precipitation reductions in average summer precipitation of approximately 8 by 2050 pryor et al 2013 and increases in the number of days without precipitation pryor et al 2014 observed increases in the variability and intensity of rainfall villarini et al 2011 are also expected to increase rahmstorf and coumou 2011 pryor et al 2014 projected increases in summer temperatures and reductions in summer rainfall suggest that many important agricultural crops in the midwest including asparagus may experience increases in heat and drought stress in the coming decades that threaten their economic viability the us asparagus industry has a value of approximately 73 million per year with michigan accounting for the largest acreage of any state usda nass 2018 high temperatures coupled with low precipitation have negatively impacted asparagus quality and yield in several production regions with climates similar to that of michigan during harvest high temperatures reduce spear quality and increase the rate of spear growth making it difficult for timely harvest given limited labor availability for example heißner et al 2006 showed that for some white asparagus cultivars the percentage of open tips increased from 0 to 20 or more as soil temperatures increased from 20 to 25 c similarly in green asparagus reduced soil and air temperatures were associated with a lower percentage of open tips brainard et al 2018 although asparagus is deep rooted and relatively drought tolerant soil water content during fern growth is an important determinant of crop yields drost and wilcox lee 1997 hartman 1981 and drought stress during fern growth can limit the capacity of plants to produce the soluble carbohydrates in storage roots necessary for high yields in subsequent seasons drost and wilcox lee 1997 stressed plants may also be susceptible to fungal diseases including fusarium morrison et al 2011 and phytophthora saude et al 2008 investment in irrigation systems is one potentially valuable approach for reducing risks associated with predicted increases in drought historically michigan asparagus has not been irrigated however irrigation trials have demonstrated improved yields in many parts of the world including rain fed climates similar to that of michigan hartmann 1981 rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 zinkernagel and kahlen 2015 for example rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 observed yield improvements of over 30 with many cultivars in poland in germany irrigation resulted in increased spear number and yield on sandy soils hartmann 1981 1996 zinkernagel and kahlen 2015 however in some cases excessive moisture can exacerbate fungal pathogens like phytophthora asparagi saude et al 2008 or cause excessive fern growth which may reduce assimilate accumulation and subsequent yields wilson et al 1996 beyond its direct effects irrigation may also indirectly benefit cropping systems by creating opportunities for valuable complementary practices including cover cropping and fertigation for example in irrigated asparagus production systems cover crops growing below the fern canopy may be established with reduced risk of competition for water with the asparagus crop brainard et al 2012 if competition for water is minimized these living mulches may suppress weeds protect soils from erosion paine 1995 brainard et al 2012 and improve nutrient retention and recycling paschold and artelt 1995 without adversely affecting crop growth irrigation may also be used to apply activate or protect fertilizers and pesticides thereby reducing input costs and losses to the environment threadgill 1985 several different irrigation systems are available to growers including overhead surface drip and sub surface drip and the choice of system can impact water use efficiency crop response efficacy of complementary practices and profitability camp 1998 sterret et al 1990 in general yields of many field and horticultural crops are similar to or better with subsurface drip irrigation compared to overhead or furrow irrigation with improved water use efficiency camp 1998 for example in one of the few studies comparing irrigation systems for asparagus sterret et al 1990 found that in some years yields of asparagus were improved and water use reduced with sub surface drip irrigation compared to overhead sprinklers in peruvian asparagus production systems it is estimated that drip irrigation systems use about 63 as much water as flood irrigation while maintaining crop yields schwarz et al 2016 in addition under drip irrigation fertigation can be used to target agrichemicals directly to the root zone thereby lowering input costs and minimizing losses through leaching and volatilization by minimizing soil surface and leaf moisture drip systems may also reduce the incidence of foliar diseases rotem and palti 1969 and weeds grattan et al 1988 however for large scale production overhead irrigation systems are often less expensive and more flexible than subsurface drip and can be used to reduce heat stress through evaporative cooling brainard et al 2018 to facilitate herbicide activation and cover crop establishment brainard et al 2012 and to reduce soil erosion tibke 1988 and the damaging effects of wind blown soil hodges and brandle 2006 crop cultivars vary in their tolerance to heat and drought stress and identification of traits associated with that tolerance may facilitate efforts to breed more resilient cultivars drought tolerance may be determined in part by traits related to stomatal regulation schaller and paschold 2009 cattivelli et al 2008 phenology richards 2006 or root depth and morphology hund et al 2009 lopez et al 2017 in asparagus several studies have documented variation in cultivar response to irrigation and tolerance to drought hartmann 1981 1996 rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 wilson et al 1996 schaller and paschold 2009 but the basis for this variation is often unclear in controlled greenhouse studies schaller and paschold 2009 found evidence that the drought tolerant cultivar grolim had more sensitive stomatal regulation in response to water deficit and hence greater tolerance to drought than the cultivar gijnlim however drought tolerance is often the result of a complex combination of traits that entail tradeoffs which must be understood in order to develop new cultivars with improved performance in dry environments cattivelli et al 2008 the primary objectives of our research were to 1 characterize historic changes in water deficits occurring during peak fern growth in western michigan one of the primary asparagus producing regions of the us 2 evaluate the potential importance of irrigation and cultivar selection for managing drought stress in asparagus 3 evaluate cultivar differences in soil water use patterns at different depths and 4 evaluate the relative impacts of different irrigation delivery systems sub surface drip versus overhead on yield and water use we hypothesized that 1 irrigation during fern growth would improve asparagus yields 2 drought tolerance and hence the benefits of irrigation would vary by cultivar 3 variation in cultivar response to drought would be associated with differences in soil water use patterns and 4 sub surface drip irrigation would provide equivalent yield improvements to overhead while reducing water requirements overall we anticipated that combinations of irrigation and cultivar choice would reduce the risks associated with drought stress in michigan production systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 historic climate to characterize historic water deficits of greatest relevance for asparagus production we used reference potential transpiration rpet and rainfall data from the hart mi 43 7366 lat 86 3594 deg long enviro weather network station msu 2018 located in the center of michigan s primary asparagus production region rpet was calculated using using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 from temperature humidty wind speed and irradiance data available from the hart station since 1997 we calculated the potential water deficit pwd as the difference between rpet and rainfall during each month from june september as well as for the peak fern growth period from july august during july and august the asparagus canopy is typically closed cladophylls are fully expanded and crop coefficients typically range from 0 7 to 1 0 paschold et al 2003 2 2 site characteristics and experimental design a field experiment was established in oceana county western michigan in 2010 six experimental treatments were examined consisting of all combinations of two factors 1 irrigation system with three levels none overhead and sub surface drip and 2 asparagus cultivar with two levels jersey supreme js and guelph millennium gm the experimental design was a split plot design with irrigation system as the main plot factor and cultivar as the subplot factor main plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 4 replications and subplots randomly assigned to either half of each main plot main plots measured 6 1 x 36 4 m with four rows of asparagus spaced 1 5 m apart subplots were 6 1 x 18 2 m data were collected from the inside two rows of each plot to minimize edge effects the soil type was representative of michigan asparagus production a well drained spinks loamy fine sand 86 sand 8 clay and 3 silt with volumetric soil moisture content in the top 60 cm of approximately 11 5 at field capacity and 3 3 at the permanent wilting point nrcs 2017 the experimental area had no reported history of previous asparagus production and had been either fallowed or cover cropped for several years prior to planting soils sampled from the experimental area had a mean ph of 6 7 soil organic matter content of 1 2 and k p ca and mg concentrations of 81 120 439 and 84 ppm respectively 2 3 trial establishment and maintenance on 17 may 2010 one year old crowns were planted at a density of 36 889 ha 1 at approximately 23 cm depth in furrows spaced 1 5 m between rows the weight of gm crowns was less than that of js but both cultivars appeared un desiccated and disease free netafim uniram tubing with 45 cm emitter spacing and 1 59 l per hour output was placed below the crowns in furrow in sub surface drip irrigation plots furrows were filled in slowly to hill over crowns with several cultivations during june and july as plants became established asparagus was managed in accordance with standard grower practice with annual applications of herbicides insecticides and fungicides applied as needed to control weeds insects including asparagus miner and asparagus beetle and foliar diseases including purple spot and rust hausbeck et al 2017 fertilization consisted of initial applications of 50 50 and 135 kg ha of n p and k respectively followed by annual applications of 90 157 20 and 2 5 kg ha 1 of n k s and b in subsequent years the only management practice that varied by treatment was irrigation system as described below 2 4 moisture monitoring and irrigation during the 2011 2016 growing seasons soil volumetric water content vwc was monitored using the diviner 2000 system sentek stepney au which estimates vwc based on measurements of soil capacitance in 2010 one meter long specialized pvc tubes were hand augured into each plot to record moisture at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 90 cm in 2011 and 2012 readings were conducted on a weekly basis throughout the fern growth period with additional readings taken before and after each irrigation event in subsequent years readings were taken at 1 2 wk intervals mean vwc to a depth of 60 cm was used to schedule irrigation unreliably low vwc readings vwc 2 were excluded from analysis these occurred primarily at the 10 cm depth in 2011 and 2012 due to occasional poor soil contact with sensor tubes irrigation was initiated when vwc declined to 25 50 of available water 5 4 7 4 vwc and was applied to replenish soil moisture to 75 100 of available water 9 5 11 5 vwc overhead irrigation was applied through nelson orbitors model r 10 walla walla wa with road guard blinders with an overlapping alternating 5 8 m radius semi circular spray pattern from 1 5 m pvc risers 2 5 change in vwc by depth to gain insight into cultivar differences in water use by soil depth the change in vwc during selected dry periods was evaluated in un irrigated treatments at 10 cm increments to a depth of 90 cm for this analysis we selected 1 2 week intervals during the fern growth period from late june to early august based on availability of vwc data absence of rainfall and initial vwc between 50 75 available water these conditions were chosen in order to eliminate changes in vwc due to precipitation and to minimize changes due to drainage for each dry period daily water loss from each soil depth was calculated by dividing total water loss from that depth by the number of days 2 6 fern evaluation fern biomass samples were collected after first frost in november of each year from 2011 2017 in all years stems were clipped at the soil surface weighed fresh in the field and converted to dry weights based on the dry fresh weight ratio of an approximately 1 kg sub sample the fresh weight sampling unit varied somewhat between years in 2011 and 2012 25 stems were sampled from each plot to determine fresh weights and converted to kg ha units based on stem density counts in other years fern fresh weights were taken from all stems from either three 2013 2014 and 2016 or six subsamples 2015 and 2017 consisting of 1 m of row from the center two rows of each plot during drought conditions in 2011 several additional measurements were taken to characterize drought effects on fern growth on 8 august stems were categorized and counted from two 1 m row sections per plot as either mature stems with cladophylls new recently emerging stems without cladophylls and dead stems with no green tissue to non destructively measure fern development light interception was measured with a portable par sensing bar lightscout 6 quantum bar spectrum technologies aurora il between 11 a m and 1 pm under clear skies on 19 aug 6 sept and 4 october in each plot one reading was taken above the canopy and five readings taken below the canopy at approximately 30 cm above ground level with light interception calculated as 1 li 100 parb para 100 where parb is the average of the 5 below canopy measurements and para is the above canopy measurement on 4 october 2011 prior to cladophyll sensescence all stems from 5 crowns per plot were cut at the soil surface dried separated into cladophyll and non cladophyll tissue and weighed 2 7 yield and quality assessment yields were determined from the center two rows of each sub plot during the 2012 17 harvest seasons late april early june harvests occurred every 1 2 days for a total of 13 harvests in 2012 and 20 to 23 harvests each season thereafter harvest was done by hand using the snapping method common in michigan spears were harvested at 15 25 cm length cumulative fresh weight of marketable yield for each year was calculated for analysis in addition spear quality was assessed from all spears on two harvest dates in 2012 14 may and 24 may classifying spears into the following size grades by diameter at the base small between 7 9 and 12 7 mm regular 12 7 to 17 5 mm and jumbo greater than 17 5 mm the total number and fresh weight of spears in each size grade was evaluated and mean weight per spear calculated by dividing the total number of spears by their total weight for each size category 2 8 statistical analysis for each year of the study the fixed effects of irrigation none overhead or drip and cultivar gm or js and their interactions on vwc asparagus stem number shoot dry weight yield and quality measures were analyzed using proc mixed procedures in sas sas institute 2009 with block and irrigation block interaction as random effects to improve assumptions of normality and homogeneity of residuals stem number data was either log or square root transformed and cladophyll data log transformed prior to analysis all other responses did not require transformation because changes in vwc during dry down periods see section 2 4 were evaluated only in cultivar subplots within unirrigated treatments our design for this response simplified to a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates blocks therefore only the fixed effect of cultivar was included in the model with block treated as a random effect 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and potential evapotranspiration historic potential water deficits pwd during peak fern growth july aug in hart mi increased between 1997 and 2017 fig 1 although large annual variations in pwd occurred linear regression of pwd against year demonstrate an overall increase in pwd during peak fern growth of approximately 54 mm since 1997 with average annual increases of 2 71 mm year 1 p value 0 018 this increase in pwd reflects a combination of declining rainfall and increasing rates of rpet during july and august table 1 it should be noted however that no comparable trends were observed for june harvest and early fern growth period or september onset of fern senescence these results are consistent with regional climate models for the midwest which project increased spring precipitation but reductions in average summer precipitation of approximately 8 by 2050 pryor et al 2013 as well as increases in summer temperatures pryor et al 2014 consistent with the long term trends pwd during the irrigation experiment 2010 17 were generally higher than the 20 year average fig 1 table 1 during peak fern growth and irrigation testing july aug mean precipitation from 2010 17 was 130 mm ranging from 78 mm 2014 to 186 mm 2010 preciptitation during this period was slightly lower than the 20 year average of 138 mm in contrast fern period reference potential evapotranspiration rpet was higher than the 20 year average 235 mm ranging from 209 mm 2014 to 251 mm 2012 table 1 the potential water deficit rpet rainfall during the fern growth period was greatest in 2011 138 mm and 2014 132 mm 3 2 irrigation and soil moisture soil vwc varied considerably both across and within years fig 2 lines based in part on differences in the quantity and timing of rainfall and irrigation events fig 2 bars as expected years with greatest potential water deficits fig 1 2011 and 2014 also generally had the most prolonged periods of low soil moisture vwc 25 available fig 2a and d in contrast relatively few periods of low vwc occurred in 2015 and 2016 fig 2e and f the number of irrigation events used to maintain vwc 25 available in irrigated treatments ranged from three in 2015 and 2016 to seven in 2011 fig 1a f gray bars both irrigated treatments had significantly greater vwc than the unirrigated control p 0 05 for extended periods ranging from late july until late august in 2011 2013 2014 and 2015 in contrast differences in vwc in 2012 and 2016 were limited primarily to early july in 2015 the irrigation event that occurred in early august was followed by multiple rainfall events resulting in moisture levels near field capacity going into september 3 3 fern response to irrigation final fern dry weight in late fall differed by cultivar but not by irrigation system table 2 detailed fern data collection from 2011 suggests that the lack of detected irrigation effects on final fern biomass may have been due in part to large variability in fern biomass data at the final sampling date and to the loss of cladophylls that occurred before that time in 2011 fern dry weight sampled on 4 october prior to cladophyll drop revealed 45 higher cladophyll dry weight in drip irrigated versus unirrigated treatments table 3 following cladophyll drop at the 11 november sampling date differences in fern shoot weight were no longer significant table 2 light interception from developing fern an indirect measurement of fern leaf area was also higher in irrigated treatments compared to the un irrigated treatments in 2011 table 3 specifically fern light interception was 7 13 and 14 higher in irrigated compared to unirrigated treatments at the aug sept and oct sampling dates respectively previous studies have shown increases in fern growth with irrigation but these responses have not always been correlated with improvements in yield for example wilson et al 1996 recorded increases in fern bioimass of 29 following high levels of irrigation during a hot dry season but yields the following year were reduced by 54 on the other hand sterret et al 1990 reported increases in fern stem number diameter and height in response to irrigation as well as subsequent increases in yield 3 4 yield and quality yields of asparagus were influenced by cultivar irrigation or their interactions in all years of the study table 4 compared to the unirrigated control overhead irrigation resulted in 10 greater mean cumulative yields for gm during the 2012 17 growing seasons with the largest yield benefits 21 occurring in spring 2012 following hot dry conditions in summer 2011 js yields were 7 higher in irrigated compared to unirrigated treatemtns in 2012 following drought conditions in summer 2011 however in contrast to gm js yields were equal to or lower in irrigated compared to unirrigated treatments in subsequent years and there were no cumulative yield benefits of irrigation yields of js were approximately 13 lower in irrigated compared to unirrigated controls in 2017 variation in cultivar yield response to irrigation has been observed in several other studies for example wilson et al 1996 found that the cultivar jersey giant was less sensitive to irrigation than uc157 schaller and paschold 2009 reported that gijnlim was more susceptible to drought stress than grolim rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 also observed differences in cultivar response to irrigation with european cultivars generally showing greater positive response than non european cultivars including js the reason for the negative response of js to irrigation observed in the last year of the study is unclear one possibility is that irrigation resulted in excessive moisture in the crop root zone in irrigated treatments in some years this may have occurred in late summer of 2015 when a late irrigation event was followed by rainfall resulting in elevated vwc and near saturated soil moisture conditions in early fall fig 2e wilson et al 1996 observed yield reductions under high levels of irrigation in new zealand and speculated that the cause may have been late season fern renewal which depletes bud number and root carbohydrate storage thus leading to yield reductions in the following year excessive moisture conditions may also have exacerbated soilborne fungal pathogens of asparagus including phythophthora and fusarium species falloon and grogan 1991 saude et al 2008 3 5 cultivar differences in water use changes in soil water content by depth during dry periods in unirrigated treatments were often different in js compared to gm treatments fig 3 total changes in vwc in the top 90 cm of soil during drydown periods were greater in js compared to gm treatments especially during the 2013 2016 seasons 4 7 years after establishment fig 3c f differences in soil moisture loss between cultivar treatments were largest at depths below 60 cm js greater than gm likely reflecting greater rooting depth of js compared to gm for example the percentage of soil moisture lost from 60 to 90 cm ranged from 23 to 27 of total soil moisture loss from 0 to 90 cm for js but only 8 17 for gm treatments in contrast the percentage of soil moisture loss from the top 30 cm ranged from 35 to 40 for js compared to 53 60 for gm previous studies suggest that the effect of cultivar root depth on yield depends critically on the specific crop soil type and climate conditions lopez et al 2017 although the effects of irrigation and tillage on asparagus root distribution have been characterized drost 1999 drost and wilcox lee 2000 to our knowledge cultivar differences in asparagus water use by depth have not been previously explored high root length density in deep soil layers has been associated with high yields during drought stress in other crops including chickpeas kashiwagi et al 2006 and simulation models for sweet sorghum suggest that breeding aimed at increased rooting depth may be a valuable approach to reducing drought stress lopez et al 2017 however vigorous root growth can also deplete soil water reserves resulting in reduced yields if subsequent drought stress occurs vadez 2014 lopez et al 2017 in our study js removed moisture from deeper in the soil profile but also generally removed more total soil moisture than gm fig 3 suggesting that under extreme drought conditions with limited soil water reserves js could be less drought tolerant than gm 4 conclusion our hypothesis that irrigation during fern growth would improve asparagus yield under michigan growing conditions was supported for the cultivar gm but not for the cultivar js for gm irrigation during fern growth in relatively hot dry years resulted in improvements in yield the following year over the course of the experiment overhead irrigation resulted in a 10 increase in cumulative yields of gm or the equivalent of 3 1 t ha 1 in contrast for js irrigation had little or no benefit beyond the first year and resulted in yield reductions of as much as 13 in year 7 one interesting result from our study was that variation in cultivar response to irrigation appeared to be related to differences in rooting depth as evidenced by differences in soil water loss patterns fig 3 under drought conditions the deeper root profile of js compared to gm may have facilitated drought avoidance by accessing deeper soil moisture pools although drought tolerance may be conferred through other mechanisms in asparagus e g schaller and paschold 2009 selection for more extensive root systems may be a useful approach for mitigating risks of drought stress without reliance on expensive irrigation systems lopez et al 2017 the highest yields recorded in our study 7 t ha 1 in 2017 were obtained with gm cultivar under overhead irrigation in addition gm is well known for its greater stand longevity under michigan and ontario growing conditions compared to cultivars closely related to js e g jersey giant even when irrigation is not used panjtandoust and wolyn 2016 therefore given current cultivar choices investment in irrigation appears to be an important practical strategy for mitigating risks associated with drought stress overall these results demonstrate the important potential role of both genetics and management practices in mitigating drought risk they also illustrate the complexity of these interactions and potential tradeoffs associated with alternative risk mitigation strategies although js was less dependent on irrigation to maximize yields compared to gm it is also appears to be more sensitive to excessive moisture conditions and hence potentially less reliable under the increasingly variable rainfall conditions predicted by climate models given projected increases in both the incidence of drought stress as well as increases in periods of excessive moisture selection of cultivars with drought tolerance may be counterproductive if they are correlated with disease sensitivity to better understand such potential tradeoffs identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with the indirect impacts of soil moisture on crops is needed for example excessive soil moisture during the late fern growth stage may reduce subsequent yields by interfering with the optimal timing of dormancy induction promoting counterproductive late season fern initiation or exacerbating soil borne fungal diseases if the former then plant breeding and management strategies to minimize this problem might focus on genetic control of dormancy induction e g panjtandoust and wolyn 2016 on the other hand if the moisture response is driven by interactions with soilborne disease then breeding efforts to identify disease tolerance traits are likely to be most beneficial in either case management practices which buffer asparagus from stress should be helpful if current climate trends continue such practices may include not only irrigation but practices such as cover cropping which may improve soil physical and biological properties that improve infiltration and water holding capacity other management practices which indirectly address issues associated with excessive or deficient soil moisture e g integrated cultural and chemical disease management will likely also be critical to maintain crop productivy in a changing climate acknowledgements the work in this publication stems in part from

11220,increasing temperatures and rainfall variability in the midwestern u s have spurred interest in strategies to reduce risks of heat and drought stress in traditionally rainfed crops including asparagus a long term field experiment was conducted on sandy soils in western michigan from 2010 17 to evaluate the effects of three levels of irrigation none overhead or sub surface drip and two asparagus cultivars guelph millennium gm and jersey supreme js for reducing these risks overhead irrigation during the fern growth period resulted in cumulative yield improvements of 10 for gm during the 2012 17 growing seasons with the largest yield benefits 21 occurring in 2012 following hot dry conditions the previous summer in contrast cumulative yields of js were unaffected by irrigation and yield reductions of 13 due to irrigation were observed in 2017 following wet conditions the previous late summer and fall estimates of cultivar water use by depth suggest that js was better able to tolerate drought due to a deeper root system compared to gm however our results suggest that js may also be more sensitive than gm to excessive soil moisture during fall senescence yield response did not vary with delivery system but sub surface drip used less water than overhead irrigation these results demonstrate the important role of both genetics and management practices in mitigating drought risk keywords asparagus climate change adaptation drought stress rooting depth sub surface irrigation overhead irrigation 1 introduction increasing summer temperatures and rainfall variability have been observed in the great lakes region and climate models predict continuation of these trends villarini et al 2011 pryor et al 2014 according to pryor et al 2014 the average midwest air temperature increased by more than 0 80 c between 1900 and 2010 with an acceleration of warming observed since 1950 trends in midwest drought severity and duration depend on the geographical area timescale and timing evaluated for example drought stress and severity in the midwest reportedly declined between 1916 2007 mishra and cherkauer 2010 in contrast dai et al 2016 report increasing temperatures and declining rainfall in the late growing season between 1980 2013 regional climate models predict higher average levels of spring precipitation reductions in average summer precipitation of approximately 8 by 2050 pryor et al 2013 and increases in the number of days without precipitation pryor et al 2014 observed increases in the variability and intensity of rainfall villarini et al 2011 are also expected to increase rahmstorf and coumou 2011 pryor et al 2014 projected increases in summer temperatures and reductions in summer rainfall suggest that many important agricultural crops in the midwest including asparagus may experience increases in heat and drought stress in the coming decades that threaten their economic viability the us asparagus industry has a value of approximately 73 million per year with michigan accounting for the largest acreage of any state usda nass 2018 high temperatures coupled with low precipitation have negatively impacted asparagus quality and yield in several production regions with climates similar to that of michigan during harvest high temperatures reduce spear quality and increase the rate of spear growth making it difficult for timely harvest given limited labor availability for example heißner et al 2006 showed that for some white asparagus cultivars the percentage of open tips increased from 0 to 20 or more as soil temperatures increased from 20 to 25 c similarly in green asparagus reduced soil and air temperatures were associated with a lower percentage of open tips brainard et al 2018 although asparagus is deep rooted and relatively drought tolerant soil water content during fern growth is an important determinant of crop yields drost and wilcox lee 1997 hartman 1981 and drought stress during fern growth can limit the capacity of plants to produce the soluble carbohydrates in storage roots necessary for high yields in subsequent seasons drost and wilcox lee 1997 stressed plants may also be susceptible to fungal diseases including fusarium morrison et al 2011 and phytophthora saude et al 2008 investment in irrigation systems is one potentially valuable approach for reducing risks associated with predicted increases in drought historically michigan asparagus has not been irrigated however irrigation trials have demonstrated improved yields in many parts of the world including rain fed climates similar to that of michigan hartmann 1981 rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 zinkernagel and kahlen 2015 for example rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 observed yield improvements of over 30 with many cultivars in poland in germany irrigation resulted in increased spear number and yield on sandy soils hartmann 1981 1996 zinkernagel and kahlen 2015 however in some cases excessive moisture can exacerbate fungal pathogens like phytophthora asparagi saude et al 2008 or cause excessive fern growth which may reduce assimilate accumulation and subsequent yields wilson et al 1996 beyond its direct effects irrigation may also indirectly benefit cropping systems by creating opportunities for valuable complementary practices including cover cropping and fertigation for example in irrigated asparagus production systems cover crops growing below the fern canopy may be established with reduced risk of competition for water with the asparagus crop brainard et al 2012 if competition for water is minimized these living mulches may suppress weeds protect soils from erosion paine 1995 brainard et al 2012 and improve nutrient retention and recycling paschold and artelt 1995 without adversely affecting crop growth irrigation may also be used to apply activate or protect fertilizers and pesticides thereby reducing input costs and losses to the environment threadgill 1985 several different irrigation systems are available to growers including overhead surface drip and sub surface drip and the choice of system can impact water use efficiency crop response efficacy of complementary practices and profitability camp 1998 sterret et al 1990 in general yields of many field and horticultural crops are similar to or better with subsurface drip irrigation compared to overhead or furrow irrigation with improved water use efficiency camp 1998 for example in one of the few studies comparing irrigation systems for asparagus sterret et al 1990 found that in some years yields of asparagus were improved and water use reduced with sub surface drip irrigation compared to overhead sprinklers in peruvian asparagus production systems it is estimated that drip irrigation systems use about 63 as much water as flood irrigation while maintaining crop yields schwarz et al 2016 in addition under drip irrigation fertigation can be used to target agrichemicals directly to the root zone thereby lowering input costs and minimizing losses through leaching and volatilization by minimizing soil surface and leaf moisture drip systems may also reduce the incidence of foliar diseases rotem and palti 1969 and weeds grattan et al 1988 however for large scale production overhead irrigation systems are often less expensive and more flexible than subsurface drip and can be used to reduce heat stress through evaporative cooling brainard et al 2018 to facilitate herbicide activation and cover crop establishment brainard et al 2012 and to reduce soil erosion tibke 1988 and the damaging effects of wind blown soil hodges and brandle 2006 crop cultivars vary in their tolerance to heat and drought stress and identification of traits associated with that tolerance may facilitate efforts to breed more resilient cultivars drought tolerance may be determined in part by traits related to stomatal regulation schaller and paschold 2009 cattivelli et al 2008 phenology richards 2006 or root depth and morphology hund et al 2009 lopez et al 2017 in asparagus several studies have documented variation in cultivar response to irrigation and tolerance to drought hartmann 1981 1996 rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 wilson et al 1996 schaller and paschold 2009 but the basis for this variation is often unclear in controlled greenhouse studies schaller and paschold 2009 found evidence that the drought tolerant cultivar grolim had more sensitive stomatal regulation in response to water deficit and hence greater tolerance to drought than the cultivar gijnlim however drought tolerance is often the result of a complex combination of traits that entail tradeoffs which must be understood in order to develop new cultivars with improved performance in dry environments cattivelli et al 2008 the primary objectives of our research were to 1 characterize historic changes in water deficits occurring during peak fern growth in western michigan one of the primary asparagus producing regions of the us 2 evaluate the potential importance of irrigation and cultivar selection for managing drought stress in asparagus 3 evaluate cultivar differences in soil water use patterns at different depths and 4 evaluate the relative impacts of different irrigation delivery systems sub surface drip versus overhead on yield and water use we hypothesized that 1 irrigation during fern growth would improve asparagus yields 2 drought tolerance and hence the benefits of irrigation would vary by cultivar 3 variation in cultivar response to drought would be associated with differences in soil water use patterns and 4 sub surface drip irrigation would provide equivalent yield improvements to overhead while reducing water requirements overall we anticipated that combinations of irrigation and cultivar choice would reduce the risks associated with drought stress in michigan production systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 historic climate to characterize historic water deficits of greatest relevance for asparagus production we used reference potential transpiration rpet and rainfall data from the hart mi 43 7366 lat 86 3594 deg long enviro weather network station msu 2018 located in the center of michigan s primary asparagus production region rpet was calculated using using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 from temperature humidty wind speed and irradiance data available from the hart station since 1997 we calculated the potential water deficit pwd as the difference between rpet and rainfall during each month from june september as well as for the peak fern growth period from july august during july and august the asparagus canopy is typically closed cladophylls are fully expanded and crop coefficients typically range from 0 7 to 1 0 paschold et al 2003 2 2 site characteristics and experimental design a field experiment was established in oceana county western michigan in 2010 six experimental treatments were examined consisting of all combinations of two factors 1 irrigation system with three levels none overhead and sub surface drip and 2 asparagus cultivar with two levels jersey supreme js and guelph millennium gm the experimental design was a split plot design with irrigation system as the main plot factor and cultivar as the subplot factor main plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 4 replications and subplots randomly assigned to either half of each main plot main plots measured 6 1 x 36 4 m with four rows of asparagus spaced 1 5 m apart subplots were 6 1 x 18 2 m data were collected from the inside two rows of each plot to minimize edge effects the soil type was representative of michigan asparagus production a well drained spinks loamy fine sand 86 sand 8 clay and 3 silt with volumetric soil moisture content in the top 60 cm of approximately 11 5 at field capacity and 3 3 at the permanent wilting point nrcs 2017 the experimental area had no reported history of previous asparagus production and had been either fallowed or cover cropped for several years prior to planting soils sampled from the experimental area had a mean ph of 6 7 soil organic matter content of 1 2 and k p ca and mg concentrations of 81 120 439 and 84 ppm respectively 2 3 trial establishment and maintenance on 17 may 2010 one year old crowns were planted at a density of 36 889 ha 1 at approximately 23 cm depth in furrows spaced 1 5 m between rows the weight of gm crowns was less than that of js but both cultivars appeared un desiccated and disease free netafim uniram tubing with 45 cm emitter spacing and 1 59 l per hour output was placed below the crowns in furrow in sub surface drip irrigation plots furrows were filled in slowly to hill over crowns with several cultivations during june and july as plants became established asparagus was managed in accordance with standard grower practice with annual applications of herbicides insecticides and fungicides applied as needed to control weeds insects including asparagus miner and asparagus beetle and foliar diseases including purple spot and rust hausbeck et al 2017 fertilization consisted of initial applications of 50 50 and 135 kg ha of n p and k respectively followed by annual applications of 90 157 20 and 2 5 kg ha 1 of n k s and b in subsequent years the only management practice that varied by treatment was irrigation system as described below 2 4 moisture monitoring and irrigation during the 2011 2016 growing seasons soil volumetric water content vwc was monitored using the diviner 2000 system sentek stepney au which estimates vwc based on measurements of soil capacitance in 2010 one meter long specialized pvc tubes were hand augured into each plot to record moisture at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 90 cm in 2011 and 2012 readings were conducted on a weekly basis throughout the fern growth period with additional readings taken before and after each irrigation event in subsequent years readings were taken at 1 2 wk intervals mean vwc to a depth of 60 cm was used to schedule irrigation unreliably low vwc readings vwc 2 were excluded from analysis these occurred primarily at the 10 cm depth in 2011 and 2012 due to occasional poor soil contact with sensor tubes irrigation was initiated when vwc declined to 25 50 of available water 5 4 7 4 vwc and was applied to replenish soil moisture to 75 100 of available water 9 5 11 5 vwc overhead irrigation was applied through nelson orbitors model r 10 walla walla wa with road guard blinders with an overlapping alternating 5 8 m radius semi circular spray pattern from 1 5 m pvc risers 2 5 change in vwc by depth to gain insight into cultivar differences in water use by soil depth the change in vwc during selected dry periods was evaluated in un irrigated treatments at 10 cm increments to a depth of 90 cm for this analysis we selected 1 2 week intervals during the fern growth period from late june to early august based on availability of vwc data absence of rainfall and initial vwc between 50 75 available water these conditions were chosen in order to eliminate changes in vwc due to precipitation and to minimize changes due to drainage for each dry period daily water loss from each soil depth was calculated by dividing total water loss from that depth by the number of days 2 6 fern evaluation fern biomass samples were collected after first frost in november of each year from 2011 2017 in all years stems were clipped at the soil surface weighed fresh in the field and converted to dry weights based on the dry fresh weight ratio of an approximately 1 kg sub sample the fresh weight sampling unit varied somewhat between years in 2011 and 2012 25 stems were sampled from each plot to determine fresh weights and converted to kg ha units based on stem density counts in other years fern fresh weights were taken from all stems from either three 2013 2014 and 2016 or six subsamples 2015 and 2017 consisting of 1 m of row from the center two rows of each plot during drought conditions in 2011 several additional measurements were taken to characterize drought effects on fern growth on 8 august stems were categorized and counted from two 1 m row sections per plot as either mature stems with cladophylls new recently emerging stems without cladophylls and dead stems with no green tissue to non destructively measure fern development light interception was measured with a portable par sensing bar lightscout 6 quantum bar spectrum technologies aurora il between 11 a m and 1 pm under clear skies on 19 aug 6 sept and 4 october in each plot one reading was taken above the canopy and five readings taken below the canopy at approximately 30 cm above ground level with light interception calculated as 1 li 100 parb para 100 where parb is the average of the 5 below canopy measurements and para is the above canopy measurement on 4 october 2011 prior to cladophyll sensescence all stems from 5 crowns per plot were cut at the soil surface dried separated into cladophyll and non cladophyll tissue and weighed 2 7 yield and quality assessment yields were determined from the center two rows of each sub plot during the 2012 17 harvest seasons late april early june harvests occurred every 1 2 days for a total of 13 harvests in 2012 and 20 to 23 harvests each season thereafter harvest was done by hand using the snapping method common in michigan spears were harvested at 15 25 cm length cumulative fresh weight of marketable yield for each year was calculated for analysis in addition spear quality was assessed from all spears on two harvest dates in 2012 14 may and 24 may classifying spears into the following size grades by diameter at the base small between 7 9 and 12 7 mm regular 12 7 to 17 5 mm and jumbo greater than 17 5 mm the total number and fresh weight of spears in each size grade was evaluated and mean weight per spear calculated by dividing the total number of spears by their total weight for each size category 2 8 statistical analysis for each year of the study the fixed effects of irrigation none overhead or drip and cultivar gm or js and their interactions on vwc asparagus stem number shoot dry weight yield and quality measures were analyzed using proc mixed procedures in sas sas institute 2009 with block and irrigation block interaction as random effects to improve assumptions of normality and homogeneity of residuals stem number data was either log or square root transformed and cladophyll data log transformed prior to analysis all other responses did not require transformation because changes in vwc during dry down periods see section 2 4 were evaluated only in cultivar subplots within unirrigated treatments our design for this response simplified to a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates blocks therefore only the fixed effect of cultivar was included in the model with block treated as a random effect 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and potential evapotranspiration historic potential water deficits pwd during peak fern growth july aug in hart mi increased between 1997 and 2017 fig 1 although large annual variations in pwd occurred linear regression of pwd against year demonstrate an overall increase in pwd during peak fern growth of approximately 54 mm since 1997 with average annual increases of 2 71 mm year 1 p value 0 018 this increase in pwd reflects a combination of declining rainfall and increasing rates of rpet during july and august table 1 it should be noted however that no comparable trends were observed for june harvest and early fern growth period or september onset of fern senescence these results are consistent with regional climate models for the midwest which project increased spring precipitation but reductions in average summer precipitation of approximately 8 by 2050 pryor et al 2013 as well as increases in summer temperatures pryor et al 2014 consistent with the long term trends pwd during the irrigation experiment 2010 17 were generally higher than the 20 year average fig 1 table 1 during peak fern growth and irrigation testing july aug mean precipitation from 2010 17 was 130 mm ranging from 78 mm 2014 to 186 mm 2010 preciptitation during this period was slightly lower than the 20 year average of 138 mm in contrast fern period reference potential evapotranspiration rpet was higher than the 20 year average 235 mm ranging from 209 mm 2014 to 251 mm 2012 table 1 the potential water deficit rpet rainfall during the fern growth period was greatest in 2011 138 mm and 2014 132 mm 3 2 irrigation and soil moisture soil vwc varied considerably both across and within years fig 2 lines based in part on differences in the quantity and timing of rainfall and irrigation events fig 2 bars as expected years with greatest potential water deficits fig 1 2011 and 2014 also generally had the most prolonged periods of low soil moisture vwc 25 available fig 2a and d in contrast relatively few periods of low vwc occurred in 2015 and 2016 fig 2e and f the number of irrigation events used to maintain vwc 25 available in irrigated treatments ranged from three in 2015 and 2016 to seven in 2011 fig 1a f gray bars both irrigated treatments had significantly greater vwc than the unirrigated control p 0 05 for extended periods ranging from late july until late august in 2011 2013 2014 and 2015 in contrast differences in vwc in 2012 and 2016 were limited primarily to early july in 2015 the irrigation event that occurred in early august was followed by multiple rainfall events resulting in moisture levels near field capacity going into september 3 3 fern response to irrigation final fern dry weight in late fall differed by cultivar but not by irrigation system table 2 detailed fern data collection from 2011 suggests that the lack of detected irrigation effects on final fern biomass may have been due in part to large variability in fern biomass data at the final sampling date and to the loss of cladophylls that occurred before that time in 2011 fern dry weight sampled on 4 october prior to cladophyll drop revealed 45 higher cladophyll dry weight in drip irrigated versus unirrigated treatments table 3 following cladophyll drop at the 11 november sampling date differences in fern shoot weight were no longer significant table 2 light interception from developing fern an indirect measurement of fern leaf area was also higher in irrigated treatments compared to the un irrigated treatments in 2011 table 3 specifically fern light interception was 7 13 and 14 higher in irrigated compared to unirrigated treatments at the aug sept and oct sampling dates respectively previous studies have shown increases in fern growth with irrigation but these responses have not always been correlated with improvements in yield for example wilson et al 1996 recorded increases in fern bioimass of 29 following high levels of irrigation during a hot dry season but yields the following year were reduced by 54 on the other hand sterret et al 1990 reported increases in fern stem number diameter and height in response to irrigation as well as subsequent increases in yield 3 4 yield and quality yields of asparagus were influenced by cultivar irrigation or their interactions in all years of the study table 4 compared to the unirrigated control overhead irrigation resulted in 10 greater mean cumulative yields for gm during the 2012 17 growing seasons with the largest yield benefits 21 occurring in spring 2012 following hot dry conditions in summer 2011 js yields were 7 higher in irrigated compared to unirrigated treatemtns in 2012 following drought conditions in summer 2011 however in contrast to gm js yields were equal to or lower in irrigated compared to unirrigated treatments in subsequent years and there were no cumulative yield benefits of irrigation yields of js were approximately 13 lower in irrigated compared to unirrigated controls in 2017 variation in cultivar yield response to irrigation has been observed in several other studies for example wilson et al 1996 found that the cultivar jersey giant was less sensitive to irrigation than uc157 schaller and paschold 2009 reported that gijnlim was more susceptible to drought stress than grolim rolbiecki and rolbiecki 2007 also observed differences in cultivar response to irrigation with european cultivars generally showing greater positive response than non european cultivars including js the reason for the negative response of js to irrigation observed in the last year of the study is unclear one possibility is that irrigation resulted in excessive moisture in the crop root zone in irrigated treatments in some years this may have occurred in late summer of 2015 when a late irrigation event was followed by rainfall resulting in elevated vwc and near saturated soil moisture conditions in early fall fig 2e wilson et al 1996 observed yield reductions under high levels of irrigation in new zealand and speculated that the cause may have been late season fern renewal which depletes bud number and root carbohydrate storage thus leading to yield reductions in the following year excessive moisture conditions may also have exacerbated soilborne fungal pathogens of asparagus including phythophthora and fusarium species falloon and grogan 1991 saude et al 2008 3 5 cultivar differences in water use changes in soil water content by depth during dry periods in unirrigated treatments were often different in js compared to gm treatments fig 3 total changes in vwc in the top 90 cm of soil during drydown periods were greater in js compared to gm treatments especially during the 2013 2016 seasons 4 7 years after establishment fig 3c f differences in soil moisture loss between cultivar treatments were largest at depths below 60 cm js greater than gm likely reflecting greater rooting depth of js compared to gm for example the percentage of soil moisture lost from 60 to 90 cm ranged from 23 to 27 of total soil moisture loss from 0 to 90 cm for js but only 8 17 for gm treatments in contrast the percentage of soil moisture loss from the top 30 cm ranged from 35 to 40 for js compared to 53 60 for gm previous studies suggest that the effect of cultivar root depth on yield depends critically on the specific crop soil type and climate conditions lopez et al 2017 although the effects of irrigation and tillage on asparagus root distribution have been characterized drost 1999 drost and wilcox lee 2000 to our knowledge cultivar differences in asparagus water use by depth have not been previously explored high root length density in deep soil layers has been associated with high yields during drought stress in other crops including chickpeas kashiwagi et al 2006 and simulation models for sweet sorghum suggest that breeding aimed at increased rooting depth may be a valuable approach to reducing drought stress lopez et al 2017 however vigorous root growth can also deplete soil water reserves resulting in reduced yields if subsequent drought stress occurs vadez 2014 lopez et al 2017 in our study js removed moisture from deeper in the soil profile but also generally removed more total soil moisture than gm fig 3 suggesting that under extreme drought conditions with limited soil water reserves js could be less drought tolerant than gm 4 conclusion our hypothesis that irrigation during fern growth would improve asparagus yield under michigan growing conditions was supported for the cultivar gm but not for the cultivar js for gm irrigation during fern growth in relatively hot dry years resulted in improvements in yield the following year over the course of the experiment overhead irrigation resulted in a 10 increase in cumulative yields of gm or the equivalent of 3 1 t ha 1 in contrast for js irrigation had little or no benefit beyond the first year and resulted in yield reductions of as much as 13 in year 7 one interesting result from our study was that variation in cultivar response to irrigation appeared to be related to differences in rooting depth as evidenced by differences in soil water loss patterns fig 3 under drought conditions the deeper root profile of js compared to gm may have facilitated drought avoidance by accessing deeper soil moisture pools although drought tolerance may be conferred through other mechanisms in asparagus e g schaller and paschold 2009 selection for more extensive root systems may be a useful approach for mitigating risks of drought stress without reliance on expensive irrigation systems lopez et al 2017 the highest yields recorded in our study 7 t ha 1 in 2017 were obtained with gm cultivar under overhead irrigation in addition gm is well known for its greater stand longevity under michigan and ontario growing conditions compared to cultivars closely related to js e g jersey giant even when irrigation is not used panjtandoust and wolyn 2016 therefore given current cultivar choices investment in irrigation appears to be an important practical strategy for mitigating risks associated with drought stress overall these results demonstrate the important potential role of both genetics and management practices in mitigating drought risk they also illustrate the complexity of these interactions and potential tradeoffs associated with alternative risk mitigation strategies although js was less dependent on irrigation to maximize yields compared to gm it is also appears to be more sensitive to excessive moisture conditions and hence potentially less reliable under the increasingly variable rainfall conditions predicted by climate models given projected increases in both the incidence of drought stress as well as increases in periods of excessive moisture selection of cultivars with drought tolerance may be counterproductive if they are correlated with disease sensitivity to better understand such potential tradeoffs identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with the indirect impacts of soil moisture on crops is needed for example excessive soil moisture during the late fern growth stage may reduce subsequent yields by interfering with the optimal timing of dormancy induction promoting counterproductive late season fern initiation or exacerbating soil borne fungal diseases if the former then plant breeding and management strategies to minimize this problem might focus on genetic control of dormancy induction e g panjtandoust and wolyn 2016 on the other hand if the moisture response is driven by interactions with soilborne disease then breeding efforts to identify disease tolerance traits are likely to be most beneficial in either case management practices which buffer asparagus from stress should be helpful if current climate trends continue such practices may include not only irrigation but practices such as cover cropping which may improve soil physical and biological properties that improve infiltration and water holding capacity other management practices which indirectly address issues associated with excessive or deficient soil moisture e g integrated cultural and chemical disease management will likely also be critical to maintain crop productivy in a changing climate acknowledgements the work in this publication stems in part from

11221,urmia lake river basin ulrb is one of the most important habitats in the world and one of the major agricultural regions in iran on average the ratio of irrigation to evapotranspiration in this basin is more than 73 investigating the irrigation water requirement pattern changes and the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration during the basin development period on a regional scale play important roles in understanding the basin situation in this study the actual evapotranspiration has been estimated by sebal model by estimating the precipitation distribution in the basin the agricultural irrigation water requirement pattern has been calculated using the land use map in 1995 2010 and 2014 in the total agricultural lands and in its 7 major subbasins where et changes from 369 to 1000 mm the maximum irrigation water consumption were 535 million cubic meters in urmia subbasin 2010 and then 469 million cubic meters in miandoab subbasin 2014 while its average was 2108 million cubic meters in the basin furthermore the maximum and minimum levels of evapotranspiration pattern in the total agricultural lands were 765 and 555 mm in 2010 and 1995 respectively this study included 1 a comparison between regional irrigation water requirement in the basin and 2 investigating the causes of including natural and anthropogenic changes in the amount of irrigation water consumption over the years the study approach provided a simple but powerful assessment to describe the irrigation water consumption pattern in the subbasins using the minimum ground data and to identify the water management strategies in basin agriculture and climate changes keywords urmia lake river basin ulrb irrigation water requirement evapotranspiration sebal natural and anthropogenic factors 1 introduction water resources are one of the most important assets for growth and development of societies according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao approximately 70 of the water consumed globally is being used in agriculture 11 in urban and 19 in industrial systems aquastat 2016 being the largest water consumer agricultural sector will be even more challenged to increase its products by more than 50 percent by 2030 to provide the food for an increased population oecd 2017 at the same time available water resources are reduced in the face of elevated human activity and natural forces altogether providing enough water for the agricultural sector is of the major concerns and needs more attention by scientists and decision makers iran is located in one of the hot and dry regions of the world the high water consumption in agricultural sector upsets water resource balance in many of its basins urmia lake river basin ulrb is one of the most important basins in iran which is faced with several environmental issues in the last two decades the level of the urmia lake has been continuously declining from 1995 to 2015 ulrp 2015 increased water consumptions in different sectors especially by the agricultural sector has been recognized as one of the main factors in diminishing water level in the urmia lake hassanzadeh et al 2012 these changes have a direct impact on the livelihood of more than 5 million people residing in the neighboring regions and severely threaten the agricultural productivity in the agriculturally rich regions of the ulrb one of the key elements in handling the current crisis in the ulrb is water consumption management especially in the agricultural sector thus numerous studies have been conducted in the basin to estimate the existing water consumption and evaluate the potential of both surface and underground water resources in order to present strategies for reducing basin scale agricultural water consumption according to the studies the average irrigation water consumption in the agricultural sector was estimated to be more than 7600 cubic meters per hectare in 1994 1995 jamab 1998 irrigation water consumption in agricultural sector of the ulrb in 2001 2002 and 2013 2014 were estimated to be more than 5700 jamab 2005 and about 5800 yekom 2016 cubic meters per hectare respectively the important aspect of these studies has been using mean precipitation and actual evapotranspiration to calculate the irrigation water consumption considering the local competitions and high development in the region excessive burden was imposed on the water use capacity of the basin and damaged performance of the system it is estimated that agricultural sector is responsible for more than 85 of the water consumptions in the ulrb agricultural sector mahab ghodss 2013 one of the difficulties in estimating the water consumption arises when different crops with distinct growth rates exist within a region with the similar weather conditions in the basin moreover extensive data requirement including irrigation efficiency method and water transfer coefficients adds to complexity of the water consumption estimation limited access to the required data led scientists to use the remote sensing technology in estimating the water consumptions at the basin scale remote sensing techniques was widely used in assessing the environmental issues anderson et al 2011 jung et al 2006 masoner et al 2003 yang et al 2012 numerous studies have used remotely sensed data to estimate the water balance at the basin scale elhag et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 these methods provided both the possibility of spatial analysis of water consumption changes cai and sharma 2010 muthuwatta et al 2010 and the representation of evapotranspiration distribution maes and steppe 2012 vinukollu et al 2011 with the development of remote sensing technologies several methods were developed to estimate the water consumption in the agricultural sector many studies computed irrigation water consumption from the difference between two parameters of crop evapotranspiration et and effective precipitation pef in the region ir etc efp castaño et al 2010 isidoro et al 2004 merriam et al 1999 in addition various models have been developed based on satellite images to evaluate the evapotranspiration which is one of the most important components of the water consumption estimation in the agricultural sector actual evapotranspiration eta estimation methods are divided into two general categories i single source and ii two sources single source methods treat evaporation e and transpiration t as a single factor i e evapotranspiration et while two source methods use independent factors for e and t in the single source models it is assumed that the entire surface is influenced by temperature and humidity nishida et al 2003 thus only aerodynamic resistance in water heat transfer process is used on the other hand two source models use several distinct resistance factors for plants and soil some of the popular two source methods are two source energy balance method tseb kustas and norman 1996 norman et al 1995 and simpliﬁed two source energy balance stseb sánchez et al 2008 well known one source methods are surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen 2000 bastiaanssen et al 1998 mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 sebal model has gained popularity due to its simplicity need for minimum ground based measurements and providing an automatic internal calibration in the analysis of satellite image liou and kar 2014 sebal is designed for calculating the segmentation and energy on a regional scale bastiaanssen et al 1998 one of the main input data for the sebal model is the geo referenced satellite images including images from a set of different bands i e visible infrared and thermal sebal model has been used to calculate the eta across a range of land uses in nansi lake wetland in china sun et al 2011 this study showed the ability of sebal model in estimating the spatial eta in spite of little ground based weather data over the large areas sun et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 2005 determined the accuracy of the sebal model under different climatic conditions at the basin and farm scales the typical accuracies achieved on a farm and seasonal scales were 85 and 95 respectively while the annual accuracy for large basins was on average 96 bastiaanssen et al 2005 moreover batra et al 2006 showed that the et values obtained from modis images agreed well with the ground measurements with a correlation coefficient of around 0 96 due to the lack of the ground measurement and inconsistency between the data used for estimation of water consumption in the previous studies in the ulrb there is no agreement on the amount of water uses in the agricultural sector and its changes over the time in addition rates of precipitation and evapotranspiration are generally not known and do not have a proper spatial coverage in this study eta and precipitation rates in years 1995 2010 and 2014 were estimated to evaluate changes in irrigation water consumption in the ulrb the year 1995 was selected as a baseline condition as the lake was in its highest level over the past 20 years the year 2010 was chosen as a highly stressed year in the basin in last two decades in terms of the reduced precipitation and elevated agricultural water consumption and finally the year 2014 was selected as a representative condition in the recent years to estimate the actual evapotranspiration the sebal model was used along with the modis images finally the possible causes of changes in irrigation water consumption in the selected years were analyzed based on the climate factors long and short term changes in climatic parameters and anthropogenic factors changes in the crop type and cultivation area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ulrb is located northwest of iran between 44 13 47 54 e and 35 40 38 29 n fig 1 with an area of 52 000 square kilometers fathian et al 2016 this

the study area seven sub catchments including sarab miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh urmia tabriz saeinghale and maragheh were selected as the main agricultural lands of the basin for the analysis fig 1 these seven subbasins contain more than 60 percent of the irrigated areas of the basin and played an important role in the region s agriculture and thus water consumption major crops in the study areas are wheat barley sugar beet alfalfa apple and grape recently the crop pattern in urmia lake river basin has changed and water based crops such as alfalfa sugar beet and orchards have been cultivated more intensively 2 2 irrigation water requirement the irrigation water requirement u is defined as the depth of irrigation water that is required to produce healthy crops masoner et al 2003 since the estimated precipitation in this study was on average less than about 260 mm hot and dry climate stored soil moisture was not considered to evaluate u the precipitation calculation method is fully explained in section 2 4 furthermore u is calculated by subtracting crop evapotranspiration et from the amount of water available to the crop through natural precipitation pef masoner et al 2003 1 u e t p e f the volume of irrigation water consumptions is calculated by multiplying the agricultural land area by u depth of irrigation water consumption in mm 2 3 evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration in the selected three years 1995 2010 and 2014 on annual and monthly scales in ulrb were estimated using sebal model sebal model has been applied using satellite images and meteorological data to estimate the surface energy balance in this method latent heat flux for each pixel of the images is estimated for the time of every satellite overpass and monthly and daily latent heat flux are composed subsequently allen et al 2002 by 2 λ e t r n g h where λet is the latent heat flux w m 2 rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m 2 g is soil heat flux w m 2 and h is sensible heat flux to the air w m 2 the net radiation flux is computed by subtracting outgoing radiant fluxes from incoming radiant fluxes the net radiation flux at the surface rn is given in the following equation subsequently allen et al 2002 3 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where r s is the incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 r l is the incoming longwave radiation w m 2 r l is the outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 α is the surface albedo dimensionless and ε0 is the surface thermal emissivity dimensionless to estimate the soil heat flux in sebal model the ratio g rn using the empirical equation 4 is computed bastiaanssen 2000 4 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 n d v i 4 where ts is the surface temperature k and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index sensible heat flux based on the theory of mass transfer of heat and momentum between the surface and the area near surface and aerodynamic resistance are estimated it is computed using the following equation allen et al 2002 5 h ρ c p d t r a h where ρ is air density kg m 3 cp is air specific heat 1004 j kg 1 k 1 dt k is the temperature difference between two specific heights and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m 1 according to allen et al 2002 dt were considered for 0 1 m and 2 m in this study finally an instantaneous evapotranspiration depth is computed as 6 e t i n s t 3600 λ e t λ ρ w where etinst is the instantaneous et mm hr 1 3600 is the time conversion factor and λ is the latent heat of vaporization or the heat absorbed when a kilogram of water evaporates j kg 1 to estimate the actual evapotranspiration both ground and satellite data were required ground data used in this study were meteorological data including daily mean minimum and maximum temperature c the number of sunshine hours h relative humidity and wind speed m s 1 in addition to ground data a number of modis products were also used to evaluate the evapotranspiration in years 2010 and 2014 they included mcd15a3 lai vegetation index with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 4 days mod11l2 land surface temperature with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of daily and mod13a2 ndvi vegetation index with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 16 days reverb 2017 to calculate et avhrr images with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of daily were used in 1995 noaa 2017 since vegetation does not change considerably within a month one or two images seem to be sufficient as a representative condition of the whole month therefore 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and 4 day leaf area index lai products were used in this study but at the same time as land surface temperature variation cannot be neglected during a month the daily product was used to calculate evapotranspiration according to these reasons the modis sensor includes daily 4 day and 16 day products 2 4 precipitation numerous methods exist to interpolate ground data and produce the precipitation map the kriging group method was chosen as the most appropriate interpolation methods for precipitation data li and heap 2011 mair and fares 2010 one of the advantages of kriging group method is the possibility of including the secondary data such as weather radar data height etc carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 li and heap 2011 which helped in improved precipitation estimations in order to select the most appropriate method of kriging group error of both kriging and co kriging methods were compared through a cross validation examined error indicators include slope mean root mean square error rmse and average standard error ase the co kriging method was selected as the appropriate method after assessing the error indicators the data used in estimating the precipitation were monthly precipitation data of 25 synoptic stations chbmet 2017 and 129 rain gauges wrm 2017 in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 moreover since ulrb has been classified as a mountainous basin and the number of rain gauges has been limited the digital elevation map was used as a secondary data to improve the accuracy of spatial estimations goovaerts 2000 as such since the trmm that is one of the research satellite launched to increase the understanding of spatial and temporal precipitation patterns in tropical regions in collaboration with japan and america in 1997 huffman and bolvin 2013 and ground based precipitation data had the same pattern monthly trmm data for the years 2010 and 2014 were used as the secondary data ges disc 2016 to achieve the higher confidence level of the rain and synoptic data the stations which had poor quality were removed based on ghajarnia et al 2015 since the existence of normal distribution for the hydrographic data in statistical interpolation methods is the main condition of using these data alexandersson 1986 the evaluation of the data distribution and its normalization were done by gs software in this study moreover to estimate the effective precipitation the fao s suggested table which shows the ratio between precipitation and effective precipitation was used fao 2017 according to this table coefficient of 0 66 was used to calculate the effective precipitation 2 5 land use in this study the purpose of producing the land use map has been assessing the changes of the cultivation area of the irrigated lands including farms and orchards to obtain land use maps an object oriented classification was emoployed frohn et al 2009 lewinski 2007 mitri and gitas 2002 therfore eight frames of landsat satellite images were selected and the images have been segmented using the multiresolution segmentation algorithm then four classes were defined rangeland irrigated agricultural lands farms and orchards water bodies wasteland and salt lands in this classification classes were divided based on the mean standard deviation maximum difference between each class values of normalized vegetation index ndvi for each cover and their spectral characteristics to prepare the land use map for the year 1995 and 2010 satellite images of landsat 5 t m and for 2014 satellite images of landsat 8 were used usgs 2017 in this way images of june july and may were utilized as the land was at the maximum cultivation level due to the lack of access to the image in 1995 the year 1998 the nearest year to 1995 had to be substituted in addition to satellite images ndvi was also used as the secondary data to improve the resolution of various phenomena to assess the accuracy of the land use map 100 test samples in different classes were extracted from high resolution satellite images google earth for the years 2010 and 2014 then by comparing the samples with land use map overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were obtained for the classified map the overall accuracy of the map was determined by dividing pixels of the error matrix classified properly to the total number of pixels in the matrix furthermore due to the fragmentation of satellite images discrete multivariate techniques were used to evaluate their accuracy kappa coefficient is one of the multivariate statistical parameters which assess the accuracy between the classified map and the reference data this data shown by the original diameter and chance agreement in the form of columns and rows kappa value of greater than 0 8 indicates very high accuracy of the classified map values between 0 4 and 0 8 represents moderate accuracy and that below 0 4 indicates low accuracy of the map 2 6 analysis of irrigation water consumption changes to study the changes in irrigation water consumption the reference evapotranspiration eto is estimated according to the proposed fao penman monteith equation eto that is dependent on only climatic factors indicates the potential of the reference crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions of accessing to water resources allen et al 1998 the temporal pattern of eto was investigated to see if significant changes were observed in the annual eto in the long term 1989 2014 moreover the areas with the statistically different means and variances of annual eto were also specified since considerable changes were observed in the time series analysis of the statistical significant difference between at least two time periods was essential therefore the period from 1989 to 2014 was divided into two 13 year periods long term from 1989 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2014 differences were assessed using analysis of variance mehod anova f test statistic for 95 confidence level in order to find areas with statistically significant difference in the eto the f test statistic was performed for each station individually finally probability value p value map was spatially computed with idw interpolation method with a power of 2 and cell size of 1000 m in the ulrb to calculate the eto based on fao penman monteith equation meteorological data mean temperature c relative humidity wind speed m s 1 and the number of sunshine hours h from 15 synoptic stations in the period from 1989 to 2014 were used chbmet 2017 to determine the role of human activities in the irrigation water consumption the crop pattern and the changes in cultivation area were also studied for the years 1995 2010 and 2014 ulrp 2015 agriculture jahad 2015 3 result and discussion 3 1 validation of precipitation and land use results the results of cross validation error indicators of kriging and co kriging methods are presented in table 1 according to this table although errors of these two methods do not have any significant differences the co kriging method offers a better performance to evaluate the accuracy of land use map the results have been compared with the samples extracted from high resolution satellite images google earth for the years 2010 and 2014 kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of the map were 0 98 and 99 23 in 2014 and were 0 96 and 97 94 in 2010 respectively 3 2 spatial and temporal changes in et and et pef annual spatial distribution of et and et pef in ulrb in the three years 1995 2010 and 2014 is presented in fig 2 the results of et precipitation et pef and cultivation area on an annual scale in agricultural lands are also summarized in table 2 the minimum and maximum values of et and et pef were observed in wastelands and agricultural lands respectively according to fig 2 et and et pef have showed an increase in the agricultural lands and a decrease in rangelands in the 1995 to 2010 period while water consumptions decreased in the agricultural lands and increased in rangelands during 2010 to 2014 this means that water consumption in the basin has been increased in non irrigational areas the reason is the considerably expansion of rain fed farms and the decline of irrigated farms in the year 2014 compared to 2010 it was expected that the cultivation area would increase from 1995 to 2014 but increase in the agricultural water consumption and consequently dramatic decline in water resources make ulrp implement some projects such as blocking some unauthorized wells and reducing irrigation water allocations which led to decline in the cultivation area among the study subbasins the highest values of et occure in urmia subbasin and then miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh subbasins in addition to urmia miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh subbasins major water consumption also occures in sarab located in north eastern part of the lake urmia and miandoab subbasins are two of the most important subbasins due to the maximum cultivation area and high et and et pef these subbasins contain around 16 22 of total water consumption of farms and 13 19 of the cultivation area according to fig 2 urmia lake had its maximum surface area in 1995 its surface area was dramatically declined in 2010 and 2014 particularly in southern part of the lake as the water body shrunk the lake s surrounding salt land area has increased considerably therefore it is essential to control and limit the increasing trend in water consumption as one of the factors affecting the reduction of the lake s inflow in the study area particularly urmia and miandoab subbasins according to table 2 on average et for irrigated farms in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 were 555 765 and 736 mm and et pef were 360 596 and 563 mm respectively the highest et and et pef occur in 2010 followed by 2014 the ratio of effective precipitation to et for the year 1995 is 0 35 which indicates that 35 of the et total amount of water consumed by the plant through either rainfall or irrigation occurred is provided by precipitation this ratio for the years 2010 and 2014 is estimated to be 22 and 24 respectively this shows that the share of precipitation in satisfying the plant water requirement in 1995 is higher than two other analysis years thus is considered relatively wet in 2014 and 2010 about 75 to 80 of the required water for agriculture is provided by irrigation this proportion is observed throughout all subbasins the cultivation area shows 11 increase from 1995 to 2010 and a 3 decrease from 2010 to 2014 subsequently et pef increases about one billion and 171 million cubic meters mcm within 15 years 1995 2010 and decreases 204 mcm in the second four years 2014 to 2010 fig 3 shows the volume of irrigation water consumption for each subbasin individually over the three analysis years et pef values in 1995 2010 and 2014 are 1393 2566 and 2364 mcm respectively having the 60 of the total cultivation are of the entire basin these subbains constitute 69 68 and 66 of total agricultural irrigation water consumption in the three analysis years respectively miandoab and urmia subbasins have higher water uses and thus higher priority in planning for water consumption reduction and irrigation policies 3 3 natural and anthropogenic factors affecting agricultural irrigation water consumption according to the results of the anova the p value with the amount of 0 003 is less than the probability level of 0 05 therefore there is the statistical significant difference between the annual eto values of the two periods of time and this difference is significant at a certainty level of 99 eto increased about 256 mm 25 in 2010 compared to 1995 and declined about 26 mm 2 compared to 2014 it should be noted that the ratio of eto changes was almost 2 in 2010 compared to 2014 and 25 in 2010 compared to 1995 therefore eto did not show many changes in 2010 and 2014 but at the same time it had significant changes in 2010 and 2014 compared to 1995 that could be justified by the test results one of the reasons for this could be successive droughts in 1998 2001 it was analyzed by anova f test statistic and concluded that there was a significant increase in the reference evapotranspiration from 1995 to 2014 according to the p value map fig 4 the areas shown in red indicate areas where the significance was at a probability level of 0 05 and white areas represent areas with no significant differences these red areas show a significant difference in et0 from 1989 to 2014 and consequently more severe and meaningful climatic changes than other areas in other words the potential of evapotranspiration in these areas increased these results show that the spatial distribution in urmia maragheh part of miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh and sarab subbasins have had significant differences around agricultural areas and have changed over the past 26 years 2001 2014 compared to 1989 2001 to study irrigation water consumption changes in the agricultural lands of ulrb due to human activities crop pattern and cultivation area of crops such as cereals wheat and barley alfalfa sugar beet and orchards were considered table 3 according to this table about 30 50 of the cultivation area was devoted to the cereals then about 18 45 and 18 to 30 were devoted to orchards and alfalfa respectively cereals as a crop with the largest cultivation area and the other crops with high water demand were studied fig 5 shows the volume of irrigation water consumption and its change of percentage for each crop individually over three years et pef caused by the cultivation of cereals and alfalfa in the three years 1995 2014 ha d a declining trend and in 2014 compared to 1995 fell 185 35 mcm decline in the first 15 years and 150 mcm decline in the second four years and 226 mcm 82 mcm of decline in the first 15 years and 144 mcm of decline in the second four years also the cultivation area for the water based crops such as sugar beet and orchards had an increasing trend for the three years so that in 2014 compared to 1995 changed about 18 and 97 4 thousand hectares respectively and subsequently the amount of their et pef increased 126 and 662 mcm respectively in total the amount of irrigation water consumption of the mentioned crops in the total agricultural lands in 1995 2010 and 2014 were obtained 1710 2133 and 2087 mcm respectively from 1995 to 2014 22 percent 377 mcm increased from this amount a 24 percent increase 423 mcm was from 1995 to 2010 and a 2 percent decline was 45 mcm from 2010 to 2014 4 summary and conclusion water use data and accessibility to it in the basin are very important for evaluation management and development of water resource projects especially in arid and semi arid regions the purpose of this study was monitoring and evaluating of spatial and temporal changes in et pef in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 in urmia basin and its major agricultural lands including urmia miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh sarab tabriz maragheh and saeinghale subbasins in addition human activities and natural factors affecting these changes were also evaluated to estimate et pef estimation of parameters like cultivation area precipitation and et were required cultivation area farms and orchards in 1995 2010 and 2014 using the land use map made by landsat satellite images and object oriented classification method were estimated 387 5 430 67 and 419 5 thousand hectares respectively the mean basin precipitation using the interpolation of the ground and satellite data co kriging in 1995 2010 and 2014 were 297 256 and 261 mm respectively the spatial distribution map of et was produced using sebal model and avhrr modis images on monthly scale on average evapotranspiration values of irrigated agricultural lands in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 were estimated 555 765 and 736 mm respectively considering the effective precipitation over the agricultural lands et pef in the years mentioned above were calculated 1393 2566 and 2364 mcm and standard deviation were 194 289 and 265 mcm respectively losses and water shortage crisis in 1995 were less considered due to more precipitation and less cultivation area than two other years also according to the spatial distribution map of et and et pef the maximum values of them in all three years were related to urmia miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh and sarab subbasins temporal and spatial changes in et and as a consequence et pef were resulted from natural and anthropogenic factors one of the most important anthropogenic factors was agricultural development plan including the crop pattern and cultivation area the elevated cultivation area over the three years and choosing crop patterns with water based crops such as sugar beet and orchards caused further et pef in the basin the cultivation area of the mentioned crops in 2014 compared to 1995 changed to approximately 18 and 97 4 thousand hectares respectively and consequently et pef of them also increased to 126 and 662 mcm respectively due to the limited water resources in ulrb the crop pattern had to move towards crops with lower water requirements moreover since part of the crop water requirement is provided by the effective precipitation the use of precipitation during the growing season had to be maximized in the crop pattern rainfed crop water requirement are supplied by effective precipitation and there is no irrigation on these lands for example according to the cultivation of wheat and barley 75 as rainfed these products can provide a large amount of water requirement with effective precipitation therefore the greater use of the effective precipitation is the appropriate way in order to reduce agricultural consumption and increase products natural factors such as changes in climatic and meteorological parameters also intensified the water shortage crisis in the region so that eto during the last 26 years 1989 2014 always had an increasing trend this result indicates that the changes in natural and climatic factors in long term led to the dramatic increase in the potential of evapotranspiration the change of the climatic parameters in the subbasins of urmia maragheh a part of the miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh and sarab were statistically significant finally review of these factors suggests that all climatic factors and human agricultural activities in the basin led to increase in agricultural water consumption therefore it is necessary to take appropriate measures to control the cultivation area replace the cultivation of the crops required less water with water intensive ones and reduce evapotranspiration 
11221,urmia lake river basin ulrb is one of the most important habitats in the world and one of the major agricultural regions in iran on average the ratio of irrigation to evapotranspiration in this basin is more than 73 investigating the irrigation water requirement pattern changes and the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration during the basin development period on a regional scale play important roles in understanding the basin situation in this study the actual evapotranspiration has been estimated by sebal model by estimating the precipitation distribution in the basin the agricultural irrigation water requirement pattern has been calculated using the land use map in 1995 2010 and 2014 in the total agricultural lands and in its 7 major subbasins where et changes from 369 to 1000 mm the maximum irrigation water consumption were 535 million cubic meters in urmia subbasin 2010 and then 469 million cubic meters in miandoab subbasin 2014 while its average was 2108 million cubic meters in the basin furthermore the maximum and minimum levels of evapotranspiration pattern in the total agricultural lands were 765 and 555 mm in 2010 and 1995 respectively this study included 1 a comparison between regional irrigation water requirement in the basin and 2 investigating the causes of including natural and anthropogenic changes in the amount of irrigation water consumption over the years the study approach provided a simple but powerful assessment to describe the irrigation water consumption pattern in the subbasins using the minimum ground data and to identify the water management strategies in basin agriculture and climate changes keywords urmia lake river basin ulrb irrigation water requirement evapotranspiration sebal natural and anthropogenic factors 1 introduction water resources are one of the most important assets for growth and development of societies according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao approximately 70 of the water consumed globally is being used in agriculture 11 in urban and 19 in industrial systems aquastat 2016 being the largest water consumer agricultural sector will be even more challenged to increase its products by more than 50 percent by 2030 to provide the food for an increased population oecd 2017 at the same time available water resources are reduced in the face of elevated human activity and natural forces altogether providing enough water for the agricultural sector is of the major concerns and needs more attention by scientists and decision makers iran is located in one of the hot and dry regions of the world the high water consumption in agricultural sector upsets water resource balance in many of its basins urmia lake river basin ulrb is one of the most important basins in iran which is faced with several environmental issues in the last two decades the level of the urmia lake has been continuously declining from 1995 to 2015 ulrp 2015 increased water consumptions in different sectors especially by the agricultural sector has been recognized as one of the main factors in diminishing water level in the urmia lake hassanzadeh et al 2012 these changes have a direct impact on the livelihood of more than 5 million people residing in the neighboring regions and severely threaten the agricultural productivity in the agriculturally rich regions of the ulrb one of the key elements in handling the current crisis in the ulrb is water consumption management especially in the agricultural sector thus numerous studies have been conducted in the basin to estimate the existing water consumption and evaluate the potential of both surface and underground water resources in order to present strategies for reducing basin scale agricultural water consumption according to the studies the average irrigation water consumption in the agricultural sector was estimated to be more than 7600 cubic meters per hectare in 1994 1995 jamab 1998 irrigation water consumption in agricultural sector of the ulrb in 2001 2002 and 2013 2014 were estimated to be more than 5700 jamab 2005 and about 5800 yekom 2016 cubic meters per hectare respectively the important aspect of these studies has been using mean precipitation and actual evapotranspiration to calculate the irrigation water consumption considering the local competitions and high development in the region excessive burden was imposed on the water use capacity of the basin and damaged performance of the system it is estimated that agricultural sector is responsible for more than 85 of the water consumptions in the ulrb agricultural sector mahab ghodss 2013 one of the difficulties in estimating the water consumption arises when different crops with distinct growth rates exist within a region with the similar weather conditions in the basin moreover extensive data requirement including irrigation efficiency method and water transfer coefficients adds to complexity of the water consumption estimation limited access to the required data led scientists to use the remote sensing technology in estimating the water consumptions at the basin scale remote sensing techniques was widely used in assessing the environmental issues anderson et al 2011 jung et al 2006 masoner et al 2003 yang et al 2012 numerous studies have used remotely sensed data to estimate the water balance at the basin scale elhag et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 these methods provided both the possibility of spatial analysis of water consumption changes cai and sharma 2010 muthuwatta et al 2010 and the representation of evapotranspiration distribution maes and steppe 2012 vinukollu et al 2011 with the development of remote sensing technologies several methods were developed to estimate the water consumption in the agricultural sector many studies computed irrigation water consumption from the difference between two parameters of crop evapotranspiration et and effective precipitation pef in the region ir etc efp castaño et al 2010 isidoro et al 2004 merriam et al 1999 in addition various models have been developed based on satellite images to evaluate the evapotranspiration which is one of the most important components of the water consumption estimation in the agricultural sector actual evapotranspiration eta estimation methods are divided into two general categories i single source and ii two sources single source methods treat evaporation e and transpiration t as a single factor i e evapotranspiration et while two source methods use independent factors for e and t in the single source models it is assumed that the entire surface is influenced by temperature and humidity nishida et al 2003 thus only aerodynamic resistance in water heat transfer process is used on the other hand two source models use several distinct resistance factors for plants and soil some of the popular two source methods are two source energy balance method tseb kustas and norman 1996 norman et al 1995 and simpliﬁed two source energy balance stseb sánchez et al 2008 well known one source methods are surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen 2000 bastiaanssen et al 1998 mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 sebal model has gained popularity due to its simplicity need for minimum ground based measurements and providing an automatic internal calibration in the analysis of satellite image liou and kar 2014 sebal is designed for calculating the segmentation and energy on a regional scale bastiaanssen et al 1998 one of the main input data for the sebal model is the geo referenced satellite images including images from a set of different bands i e visible infrared and thermal sebal model has been used to calculate the eta across a range of land uses in nansi lake wetland in china sun et al 2011 this study showed the ability of sebal model in estimating the spatial eta in spite of little ground based weather data over the large areas sun et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 2005 determined the accuracy of the sebal model under different climatic conditions at the basin and farm scales the typical accuracies achieved on a farm and seasonal scales were 85 and 95 respectively while the annual accuracy for large basins was on average 96 bastiaanssen et al 2005 moreover batra et al 2006 showed that the et values obtained from modis images agreed well with the ground measurements with a correlation coefficient of around 0 96 due to the lack of the ground measurement and inconsistency between the data used for estimation of water consumption in the previous studies in the ulrb there is no agreement on the amount of water uses in the agricultural sector and its changes over the time in addition rates of precipitation and evapotranspiration are generally not known and do not have a proper spatial coverage in this study eta and precipitation rates in years 1995 2010 and 2014 were estimated to evaluate changes in irrigation water consumption in the ulrb the year 1995 was selected as a baseline condition as the lake was in its highest level over the past 20 years the year 2010 was chosen as a highly stressed year in the basin in last two decades in terms of the reduced precipitation and elevated agricultural water consumption and finally the year 2014 was selected as a representative condition in the recent years to estimate the actual evapotranspiration the sebal model was used along with the modis images finally the possible causes of changes in irrigation water consumption in the selected years were analyzed based on the climate factors long and short term changes in climatic parameters and anthropogenic factors changes in the crop type and cultivation area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ulrb is located northwest of iran between 44 13 47 54 e and 35 40 38 29 n fig 1 with an area of 52 000 square kilometers fathian et al 2016 this basin is a typical closed basin that all rainfall drains in its central part urmia lake urmia lake is the largest lake in iran and is considered one of the world s largest hyper saline water bodies fathian et al 2015 the ulrb covers a variety of different climate conditions mean precipitation in the basin varies from around 200 mm in the north western regions and areas surrounding the lake to more than 850 mm in the western and north western regions and the southern highlands and long term mean temperature of ulrb varies from less than 3 c to over 13 c mahab ghodss 2013 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration at stations located in different areas of urmia lake river basin varies from the minimum 930 mm to the maximum 1513 mm mahab ghodss 2012 the water requirement of urmia lake river basin is supplied from two main sources including the surface rivers dams diversions etc and groundwater resources wells springs and qanats water rights in ulrb include four sections such as environmental drinking industrial and agricultural rights the agricultural sector the largest consumer of water resources in ulrb consumes about 4 3 billion cubic meters of the basin resources per year approximately 2 424 million cubic meters of which comes from rivers dams and diversions allocations 56 and 1867 million cubic meters comes from wells springs and qantas in the basin 44 mahab ghodss consulting engineering company 2013 agricultural sector uses about 85 percent of water consumed in the basin mahab ghodss 2013 in order to study the consumption of the agricultural sector in the study area seven sub catchments including sarab miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh urmia tabriz saeinghale and maragheh were selected as the main agricultural lands of the basin for the analysis fig 1 these seven subbasins contain more than 60 percent of the irrigated areas of the basin and played an important role in the region s agriculture and thus water consumption major crops in the study areas are wheat barley sugar beet alfalfa apple and grape recently the crop pattern in urmia lake river basin has changed and water based crops such as alfalfa sugar beet and orchards have been cultivated more intensively 2 2 irrigation water requirement the irrigation water requirement u is defined as the depth of irrigation water that is required to produce healthy crops masoner et al 2003 since the estimated precipitation in this study was on average less than about 260 mm hot and dry climate stored soil moisture was not considered to evaluate u the precipitation calculation method is fully explained in section 2 4 furthermore u is calculated by subtracting crop evapotranspiration et from the amount of water available to the crop through natural precipitation pef masoner et al 2003 1 u e t p e f the volume of irrigation water consumptions is calculated by multiplying the agricultural land area by u depth of irrigation water consumption in mm 2 3 evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration in the selected three years 1995 2010 and 2014 on annual and monthly scales in ulrb were estimated using sebal model sebal model has been applied using satellite images and meteorological data to estimate the surface energy balance in this method latent heat flux for each pixel of the images is estimated for the time of every satellite overpass and monthly and daily latent heat flux are composed subsequently allen et al 2002 by 2 λ e t r n g h where λet is the latent heat flux w m 2 rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m 2 g is soil heat flux w m 2 and h is sensible heat flux to the air w m 2 the net radiation flux is computed by subtracting outgoing radiant fluxes from incoming radiant fluxes the net radiation flux at the surface rn is given in the following equation subsequently allen et al 2002 3 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where r s is the incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 r l is the incoming longwave radiation w m 2 r l is the outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 α is the surface albedo dimensionless and ε0 is the surface thermal emissivity dimensionless to estimate the soil heat flux in sebal model the ratio g rn using the empirical equation 4 is computed bastiaanssen 2000 4 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 n d v i 4 where ts is the surface temperature k and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index sensible heat flux based on the theory of mass transfer of heat and momentum between the surface and the area near surface and aerodynamic resistance are estimated it is computed using the following equation allen et al 2002 5 h ρ c p d t r a h where ρ is air density kg m 3 cp is air specific heat 1004 j kg 1 k 1 dt k is the temperature difference between two specific heights and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m 1 according to allen et al 2002 dt were considered for 0 1 m and 2 m in this study finally an instantaneous evapotranspiration depth is computed as 6 e t i n s t 3600 λ e t λ ρ w where etinst is the instantaneous et mm hr 1 3600 is the time conversion factor and λ is the latent heat of vaporization or the heat absorbed when a kilogram of water evaporates j kg 1 to estimate the actual evapotranspiration both ground and satellite data were required ground data used in this study were meteorological data including daily mean minimum and maximum temperature c the number of sunshine hours h relative humidity and wind speed m s 1 in addition to ground data a number of modis products were also used to evaluate the evapotranspiration in years 2010 and 2014 they included mcd15a3 lai vegetation index with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 4 days mod11l2 land surface temperature with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of daily and mod13a2 ndvi vegetation index with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 16 days reverb 2017 to calculate et avhrr images with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of daily were used in 1995 noaa 2017 since vegetation does not change considerably within a month one or two images seem to be sufficient as a representative condition of the whole month therefore 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and 4 day leaf area index lai products were used in this study but at the same time as land surface temperature variation cannot be neglected during a month the daily product was used to calculate evapotranspiration according to these reasons the modis sensor includes daily 4 day and 16 day products 2 4 precipitation numerous methods exist to interpolate ground data and produce the precipitation map the kriging group method was chosen as the most appropriate interpolation methods for precipitation data li and heap 2011 mair and fares 2010 one of the advantages of kriging group method is the possibility of including the secondary data such as weather radar data height etc carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 li and heap 2011 which helped in improved precipitation estimations in order to select the most appropriate method of kriging group error of both kriging and co kriging methods were compared through a cross validation examined error indicators include slope mean root mean square error rmse and average standard error ase the co kriging method was selected as the appropriate method after assessing the error indicators the data used in estimating the precipitation were monthly precipitation data of 25 synoptic stations chbmet 2017 and 129 rain gauges wrm 2017 in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 moreover since ulrb has been classified as a mountainous basin and the number of rain gauges has been limited the digital elevation map was used as a secondary data to improve the accuracy of spatial estimations goovaerts 2000 as such since the trmm that is one of the research satellite launched to increase the understanding of spatial and temporal precipitation patterns in tropical regions in collaboration with japan and america in 1997 huffman and bolvin 2013 and ground based precipitation data had the same pattern monthly trmm data for the years 2010 and 2014 were used as the secondary data ges disc 2016 to achieve the higher confidence level of the rain and synoptic data the stations which had poor quality were removed based on ghajarnia et al 2015 since the existence of normal distribution for the hydrographic data in statistical interpolation methods is the main condition of using these data alexandersson 1986 the evaluation of the data distribution and its normalization were done by gs software in this study moreover to estimate the effective precipitation the fao s suggested table which shows the ratio between precipitation and effective precipitation was used fao 2017 according to this table coefficient of 0 66 was used to calculate the effective precipitation 2 5 land use in this study the purpose of producing the land use map has been assessing the changes of the cultivation area of the irrigated lands including farms and orchards to obtain land use maps an object oriented classification was emoployed frohn et al 2009 lewinski 2007 mitri and gitas 2002 therfore eight frames of landsat satellite images were selected and the images have been segmented using the multiresolution segmentation algorithm then four classes were defined rangeland irrigated agricultural lands farms and orchards water bodies wasteland and salt lands in this classification classes were divided based on the mean standard deviation maximum difference between each class values of normalized vegetation index ndvi for each cover and their spectral characteristics to prepare the land use map for the year 1995 and 2010 satellite images of landsat 5 t m and for 2014 satellite images of landsat 8 were used usgs 2017 in this way images of june july and may were utilized as the land was at the maximum cultivation level due to the lack of access to the image in 1995 the year 1998 the nearest year to 1995 had to be substituted in addition to satellite images ndvi was also used as the secondary data to improve the resolution of various phenomena to assess the accuracy of the land use map 100 test samples in different classes were extracted from high resolution satellite images google earth for the years 2010 and 2014 then by comparing the samples with land use map overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were obtained for the classified map the overall accuracy of the map was determined by dividing pixels of the error matrix classified properly to the total number of pixels in the matrix furthermore due to the fragmentation of satellite images discrete multivariate techniques were used to evaluate their accuracy kappa coefficient is one of the multivariate statistical parameters which assess the accuracy between the classified map and the reference data this data shown by the original diameter and chance agreement in the form of columns and rows kappa value of greater than 0 8 indicates very high accuracy of the classified map values between 0 4 and 0 8 represents moderate accuracy and that below 0 4 indicates low accuracy of the map 2 6 analysis of irrigation water consumption changes to study the changes in irrigation water consumption the reference evapotranspiration eto is estimated according to the proposed fao penman monteith equation eto that is dependent on only climatic factors indicates the potential of the reference crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions of accessing to water resources allen et al 1998 the temporal pattern of eto was investigated to see if significant changes were observed in the annual eto in the long term 1989 2014 moreover the areas with the statistically different means and variances of annual eto were also specified since considerable changes were observed in the time series analysis of the statistical significant difference between at least two time periods was essential therefore the period from 1989 to 2014 was divided into two 13 year periods long term from 1989 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2014 differences were assessed using analysis of variance mehod anova f test statistic for 95 confidence level in order to find areas with statistically significant difference in the eto the f test statistic was performed for each station individually finally probability value p value map was spatially computed with idw interpolation method with a power of 2 and cell size of 1000 m in the ulrb to calculate the eto based on fao penman monteith equation meteorological data mean temperature c relative humidity wind speed m s 1 and the number of sunshine hours h from 15 synoptic stations in the period from 1989 to 2014 were used chbmet 2017 to determine the role of human activities in the irrigation water consumption the crop pattern and the changes in cultivation area were also studied for the years 1995 2010 and 2014 ulrp 2015 agriculture jahad 2015 3 result and discussion 3 1 validation of precipitation and land use results the results of cross validation error indicators of kriging and co kriging methods are presented in table 1 according to this table although errors of these two methods do not have any significant differences the co kriging method offers a better performance to evaluate the accuracy of land use map the results have been compared with the samples extracted from high resolution satellite images google earth for the years 2010 and 2014 kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of the map were 0 98 and 99 23 in 2014 and were 0 96 and 97 94 in 2010 respectively 3 2 spatial and temporal changes in et and et pef annual spatial distribution of et and et pef in ulrb in the three years 1995 2010 and 2014 is presented in fig 2 the results of et precipitation et pef and cultivation area on an annual scale in agricultural lands are also summarized in table 2 the minimum and maximum values of et and et pef were observed in wastelands and agricultural lands respectively according to fig 2 et and et pef have showed an increase in the agricultural lands and a decrease in rangelands in the 1995 to 2010 period while water consumptions decreased in the agricultural lands and increased in rangelands during 2010 to 2014 this means that water consumption in the basin has been increased in non irrigational areas the reason is the considerably expansion of rain fed farms and the decline of irrigated farms in the year 2014 compared to 2010 it was expected that the cultivation area would increase from 1995 to 2014 but increase in the agricultural water consumption and consequently dramatic decline in water resources make ulrp implement some projects such as blocking some unauthorized wells and reducing irrigation water allocations which led to decline in the cultivation area among the study subbasins the highest values of et occure in urmia subbasin and then miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh subbasins in addition to urmia miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh subbasins major water consumption also occures in sarab located in north eastern part of the lake urmia and miandoab subbasins are two of the most important subbasins due to the maximum cultivation area and high et and et pef these subbasins contain around 16 22 of total water consumption of farms and 13 19 of the cultivation area according to fig 2 urmia lake had its maximum surface area in 1995 its surface area was dramatically declined in 2010 and 2014 particularly in southern part of the lake as the water body shrunk the lake s surrounding salt land area has increased considerably therefore it is essential to control and limit the increasing trend in water consumption as one of the factors affecting the reduction of the lake s inflow in the study area particularly urmia and miandoab subbasins according to table 2 on average et for irrigated farms in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 were 555 765 and 736 mm and et pef were 360 596 and 563 mm respectively the highest et and et pef occur in 2010 followed by 2014 the ratio of effective precipitation to et for the year 1995 is 0 35 which indicates that 35 of the et total amount of water consumed by the plant through either rainfall or irrigation occurred is provided by precipitation this ratio for the years 2010 and 2014 is estimated to be 22 and 24 respectively this shows that the share of precipitation in satisfying the plant water requirement in 1995 is higher than two other analysis years thus is considered relatively wet in 2014 and 2010 about 75 to 80 of the required water for agriculture is provided by irrigation this proportion is observed throughout all subbasins the cultivation area shows 11 increase from 1995 to 2010 and a 3 decrease from 2010 to 2014 subsequently et pef increases about one billion and 171 million cubic meters mcm within 15 years 1995 2010 and decreases 204 mcm in the second four years 2014 to 2010 fig 3 shows the volume of irrigation water consumption for each subbasin individually over the three analysis years et pef values in 1995 2010 and 2014 are 1393 2566 and 2364 mcm respectively having the 60 of the total cultivation are of the entire basin these subbains constitute 69 68 and 66 of total agricultural irrigation water consumption in the three analysis years respectively miandoab and urmia subbasins have higher water uses and thus higher priority in planning for water consumption reduction and irrigation policies 3 3 natural and anthropogenic factors affecting agricultural irrigation water consumption according to the results of the anova the p value with the amount of 0 003 is less than the probability level of 0 05 therefore there is the statistical significant difference between the annual eto values of the two periods of time and this difference is significant at a certainty level of 99 eto increased about 256 mm 25 in 2010 compared to 1995 and declined about 26 mm 2 compared to 2014 it should be noted that the ratio of eto changes was almost 2 in 2010 compared to 2014 and 25 in 2010 compared to 1995 therefore eto did not show many changes in 2010 and 2014 but at the same time it had significant changes in 2010 and 2014 compared to 1995 that could be justified by the test results one of the reasons for this could be successive droughts in 1998 2001 it was analyzed by anova f test statistic and concluded that there was a significant increase in the reference evapotranspiration from 1995 to 2014 according to the p value map fig 4 the areas shown in red indicate areas where the significance was at a probability level of 0 05 and white areas represent areas with no significant differences these red areas show a significant difference in et0 from 1989 to 2014 and consequently more severe and meaningful climatic changes than other areas in other words the potential of evapotranspiration in these areas increased these results show that the spatial distribution in urmia maragheh part of miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh and sarab subbasins have had significant differences around agricultural areas and have changed over the past 26 years 2001 2014 compared to 1989 2001 to study irrigation water consumption changes in the agricultural lands of ulrb due to human activities crop pattern and cultivation area of crops such as cereals wheat and barley alfalfa sugar beet and orchards were considered table 3 according to this table about 30 50 of the cultivation area was devoted to the cereals then about 18 45 and 18 to 30 were devoted to orchards and alfalfa respectively cereals as a crop with the largest cultivation area and the other crops with high water demand were studied fig 5 shows the volume of irrigation water consumption and its change of percentage for each crop individually over three years et pef caused by the cultivation of cereals and alfalfa in the three years 1995 2014 ha d a declining trend and in 2014 compared to 1995 fell 185 35 mcm decline in the first 15 years and 150 mcm decline in the second four years and 226 mcm 82 mcm of decline in the first 15 years and 144 mcm of decline in the second four years also the cultivation area for the water based crops such as sugar beet and orchards had an increasing trend for the three years so that in 2014 compared to 1995 changed about 18 and 97 4 thousand hectares respectively and subsequently the amount of their et pef increased 126 and 662 mcm respectively in total the amount of irrigation water consumption of the mentioned crops in the total agricultural lands in 1995 2010 and 2014 were obtained 1710 2133 and 2087 mcm respectively from 1995 to 2014 22 percent 377 mcm increased from this amount a 24 percent increase 423 mcm was from 1995 to 2010 and a 2 percent decline was 45 mcm from 2010 to 2014 4 summary and conclusion water use data and accessibility to it in the basin are very important for evaluation management and development of water resource projects especially in arid and semi arid regions the purpose of this study was monitoring and evaluating of spatial and temporal changes in et pef in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 in urmia basin and its major agricultural lands including urmia miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh sarab tabriz maragheh and saeinghale subbasins in addition human activities and natural factors affecting these changes were also evaluated to estimate et pef estimation of parameters like cultivation area precipitation and et were required cultivation area farms and orchards in 1995 2010 and 2014 using the land use map made by landsat satellite images and object oriented classification method were estimated 387 5 430 67 and 419 5 thousand hectares respectively the mean basin precipitation using the interpolation of the ground and satellite data co kriging in 1995 2010 and 2014 were 297 256 and 261 mm respectively the spatial distribution map of et was produced using sebal model and avhrr modis images on monthly scale on average evapotranspiration values of irrigated agricultural lands in the years 1995 2010 and 2014 were estimated 555 765 and 736 mm respectively considering the effective precipitation over the agricultural lands et pef in the years mentioned above were calculated 1393 2566 and 2364 mcm and standard deviation were 194 289 and 265 mcm respectively losses and water shortage crisis in 1995 were less considered due to more precipitation and less cultivation area than two other years also according to the spatial distribution map of et and et pef the maximum values of them in all three years were related to urmia miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh and sarab subbasins temporal and spatial changes in et and as a consequence et pef were resulted from natural and anthropogenic factors one of the most important anthropogenic factors was agricultural development plan including the crop pattern and cultivation area the elevated cultivation area over the three years and choosing crop patterns with water based crops such as sugar beet and orchards caused further et pef in the basin the cultivation area of the mentioned crops in 2014 compared to 1995 changed to approximately 18 and 97 4 thousand hectares respectively and consequently et pef of them also increased to 126 and 662 mcm respectively due to the limited water resources in ulrb the crop pattern had to move towards crops with lower water requirements moreover since part of the crop water requirement is provided by the effective precipitation the use of precipitation during the growing season had to be maximized in the crop pattern rainfed crop water requirement are supplied by effective precipitation and there is no irrigation on these lands for example according to the cultivation of wheat and barley 75 as rainfed these products can provide a large amount of water requirement with effective precipitation therefore the greater use of the effective precipitation is the appropriate way in order to reduce agricultural consumption and increase products natural factors such as changes in climatic and meteorological parameters also intensified the water shortage crisis in the region so that eto during the last 26 years 1989 2014 always had an increasing trend this result indicates that the changes in natural and climatic factors in long term led to the dramatic increase in the potential of evapotranspiration the change of the climatic parameters in the subbasins of urmia maragheh a part of the miandoab naghdeh oshnavieh and sarab were statistically significant finally review of these factors suggests that all climatic factors and human agricultural activities in the basin led to increase in agricultural water consumption therefore it is necessary to take appropriate measures to control the cultivation area replace the cultivation of the crops required less water with water intensive ones and reduce evapotranspiration 
11222,a field experiment was conducted in the southern gully region of the loess plateau to study the effects of mulching measures on spring maize yield and nitrate accumulation in dryland areas under traditional tillage conditions the study was performed to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area the four treatments were non mulching ck plastic film mulching during the growth period pm1 plastic film mulching during the fallow period pm2 and straw mulching jm after 13 years of continuous application the yield of spring maize the nitrogen uptake by plants and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured the results revealed that soil moisture content and water storage capacity of the three soil mulching treatments were all higher than those of the non mulching treatment soil water storage at a depth of 0 300 cm in the jm pm1 and pm2 treatments was increased by 11 8 10 6 and 8 8 respectively compared with the ck treatment compared with the ck treatment the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize the yield enhancement effect of the pm1 treatment was the most significant with a yield of 1 1 mg ha 1 and an increase of 26 72 in addition to the jm treatment the accumulation of soil nitrate at a depth of 0 300 cm in the pm1 and pm2 treatments was less than that of the ck treatment but the largest increase in soil nitrate 80 20 in the jm treatment was observed at a depth of 0 100 cm the results suggest that in the rainfed agriculture in the southern loess plateau mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage capacity pm1 and pm2 treatments could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the deeper soil profile and the three mulching measures could slow down the deep accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent keywords spring maize straw mulching plastic film mulching nitrate nitrogen 1 introduction in china about 21 7 of the total land area is located in the semi arid region where the annual precipitation is in the range of 250 550 mm and the crop water requirement is in the range of 300 600 mm li 2007 annual precipitation shows large variations from year to year and uneven distribution within seasons in general about 60 70 of the yearly rainfall is concentrated during the months of june september wang et al 2012 and thus in dryland farming systems water shortage is usually the limiting factor for crop growth li et al 2009 sietz et al 2011 in the loess plateau straw mulching and plastic film mulching are the two common practices that are widely used in crop production particularly in maize production lin et al 2016 many studies have confirmed that plastic film mulching can reduce water vapor transfer from the soil li et al 1999 li et al 2013 and can increase soil temperature by reducing heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground wu et al 2016 studies have indicated that mulching is conducive to crop growth as it improves the soil water content and soil temperature in dryland agriculture cook et al 2006 nitrogen is essential for plant growth and viability and therefore high yielding crops such as maize zea mays l are frequently treated with large amounts of n fertilizer to reach optimal yields jia et al 2014 according to the china agricultural database for 2013 the average county level maize yields in semi arid northern and northwestern china ranged from 4 9 to 7 8 mg ha 1 the n fertilizer application rates however were as high as 225 330 kg n ha 1 in farmers fields liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 much higher than the required range of n 97 141 kg ha 1 for maize hou et al 2012 however a higher n fertilizer input usually leads to nitrate nitrogen residue in the soil cui et al 2008 furthermore nitrate nitrogen residue can leach down into the deep soil or be lost by other ways owing to limited irrigation and precipitation nitrate leaching in cultivated lands of northwestern china has been underestimated or even ignored for many years yang et al 2015 therefore efforts to harvest more rainfall to increase soil water storage and to optimize n management to achieve higher crop yields have always been considered key steps in the sustainable development of dryland agriculture he et al 2016 however the research on the transformation of soil nitrogen has mainly focused on the winter wheat system and the wheat summer maize cropping system gao et al 2009 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 understanding the accumulation and utilization of plant n under mulching conditions is essential to help guide further improvements in crop yield and n management strategies of dryland agriculture therefore we performed a location fixed field experiment in a dryland area of the loess plateau using spring maize as the research object to determine the effects of different mulching measures on nitrate leaching in the soil and changes in soil water content 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted at the changwu experimental station 35 12 n 107 40 e and altitude 1206 m on the loess plateau in changwu county of shaanxi province china the climate is temperate semi arid with a mean annual air temperature of 9 1 2 3 c a mean monthly maximum temperature of 22 c july and a mean monthly minimum temperature of 7 c january the average annual sunshine duration is 2230 h with more than 171 frost free days the mean annual precipitation from 1990 to 2016 was 571 74 mm of which approximately 55 fell during the growing season between july and september the rainfall during the experimental period was measured using an automatic weather station changwu experimental station meteorological observatory ws std1 england at the experimental site according to the usda textural classification system the soil has a silty loam texture that is derived from loess with a deep and even soil profile the soil water content and wilting moisture in the 0 10 m loess section were 21 16 0 86 and 7 46 0 65 mass water content respectively and the soil bulk density was 1 23 1 44 g cm 3 wang et al 2015 the basic properties of the 0 20 cm soil layer are presented in table 1 the precipitation and average temperature during the test in 2016 are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment started in 2003 with a total of four treatments the treatments used were a control with no mulching ck plastic film mulching during the growth period pm1 plastic film mulching during the fallow period pm2 and straw mulching jm the ck treatment was not mulched throughout the year the pm1 treatment was mulched with plastic film during the growth period the pm2 treatment was mulched with plastic film only during the fallow period and the mulch cleared before sowing and was kept without mulching during the growth period in the jm treatment when the corn was harvested all of the straw was mulched evenly and the straw was closed when the corn was sown and was placed between the rows each treatment was replicated three times in 35 m2 plots 7 m 5 m in a randomized complete block design the test crop was a spring ripening corn variety pioneer 335 a planting pattern of alternating wide 60 cm and narrow 35 cm row spacing was used for each treatment the test plastic film used was 70 cm wide 0 015 mm thick polyethylene film fertilizers n 150 kg ha 1 and p2o5 75 kg ha 1 were spread over the soil surface and incorporated into the 0 20 cm soil layer using a rotary cultivator before sowing from 2003 to 2016 the management of the experimental site was as described above the spring corn was planted in late april and harvested in late september every year 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 grain yield at the harvest stage in 2016 we measured the yield of spring maize according to the method outlined below each plot was harvested for more than one third of the corn ear present after air drying the collected samples were threshed and the grain was weighed sub samples approximately 100 g of the air dried grain were dried to a constant weight in a fan oven at 75 c to estimate the grain water content the maize grain yield for each plot adjusted to a moisture content of 14 which was recorded on a per plot basis was converted to kilograms per hectare for statistical analysis 2 3 2 soil water content and nitrate nitrogen content determination at the harvest stage in 2016 we measured the soil water content according to the method described below three soil cores at depths of 0 100 cm with 10 cm increments and at depths of 100 300 cm with 20 cm increments were collected with an auger inner diameter 4 cm from each plot at harvest soil from the same layer in each plot was merged and 500 g of thoroughly mixed soil was collected as a sample for the soil analyses the soil water content of each sample was determined gravimetrically after oven drying at 105 c for 24 h at the harvest stage in 2007 and 2016 we measured the nitrate nitrogen content in the soil profile from 0 to 300 cm according to the method described below because changes in the ammonium nitrogen content of the soil in the dry land were quite small we only measured the nitrate nitrogen content in the soil soil nitrate n was extracted from 5 g of fresh soil with 50 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl and the nitrate content was measured by a hydrazine sulfate colorimetric method using a high resolution digital colorimeter 2 3 3 plant sample collection and determination three representative plants were collected from the center of each plot the plants were weighed fresh weight placed together into a paper bag kept at 105 c for 30 minutes then dried at 75 c to a constant weight after determining the dry matter weight the dried samples were crushed through a 60 mesh sieve followed by h2so4 h2o2 digestion and boiling plant nitrogen determination followed the method of kjeldahl 2 4 data analysis 1 soil water storage sws in the profile was considered to be the total storage in all sampled layers in the plot and was calculated using the following formula zhao et al 2014 sws mm swg p g cm 3 h mm where ρ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 swg is the soil water content in the corresponding soil layer and h is the soil

anova procedure and statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical package multiple comparisons of annual mean values were made using least significant difference lsd methods in all analyses a p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of mulching measures on soil moisture at harvest stage soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile at harvest in 2016 is shown in fig 2 in the four treatments soil water content mainly changed within the 0 120 cm soil layer indicating that spring maize mainly used the soil moisture within the range of 0 120 cm spring maize roots absorbed water in the upper 80 cm soil layer resulting in greater soil water variation as more than 80 of the plant root system is located in the upper layer 50 cm of soil jiang et al 2013 gao et al 2014 in the soil layers deeper than 120 cm there was little change in soil water content in the four treatments soil water content in the other mulching treatments except for the pm1 treatment was higher than in the soil profile for the ck treatment soil water content of the pm1 treatment at the 160 cm soil depth and below 160 cm depth was much lower than in the 140 cm and above 140 cm soil layers the overall results indicated that mulching could increase soil water content previous studies zhang et al 2007 zribi et al 2015 had shown that mulching could increase soil water content by reducing ineffective evaporation and raising the soil s deeper water to the crop available layer straw mulching also helps to reduce ineffective evaporation and improve soil moisture zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile for three mulching treatments at harvest was ordered as jm pm2 pm1 and this was related to the different movement of soil moisture under the three treatments the soil surface in the pm1 treatment was exposed during the fallow period thereby increasing the loss of soil water the surface of the land was in a semi mulching state during the growth period and the rainfall from may to june at the test site was low the plant thus consumed relatively large amounts of water resulting in high soil water loss however during july and august when the rainfall increased the leaf area of the spring maize plants increased blocking most of the rainfall meaning that the soil moisture in the pm1 plot was not replenished the jm and pm2 treatment s resulted in less water loss due to increased surface mulching during the fallow period and increased rainfall infiltration during the early spring maize growth period therefore the soil profile moisture content for the pm1 treatment was lower than that of the other mulching treatments soil water storage in the harvest period ranged from 713 to 797 mm in the 0 300 cm depth range and the amount of water storage was the in the order of jm pm2 pm1 ck table 2 the water storage of jm pm2 and pm1 treatments was increased by 11 7 10 6 and 6 2 respectively compared to the ck treatment indicating that the jm treatment had the strongest effect on soil water storage in addition the water storage level observed with the three soil mulching treatments during harvest increased from shallow to deep while the soil water storage at 60 120 cm in the ck treatment was lower than that of 0 60 cm and the soil water storage in the ck treatment was lower than in the mulching treatments zhang et al 2010 tested the planting and harvesting of maize under different plastic film mulching treatments in the arid highlands of the northern weibei upland their results showed that different types of plastic mulching had the same influence on soil water content the surface water content and soil water storage were significantly increased compared to non mulching li et al 2016a b studied spring maize in heyang shaanxi province and showed that straw mulching provided greater water conservation the above results suggest that mulching the ground can effectively increase the water storage of the soil during the harvest stage while non mulching treatments will increase the loss of soil water and reduce the soil water storage at the harvest stage 3 2 profile distribution and accumulation of soil nitrate under mulching measures nitrate nitrogen data from the soil profile at harvest showed that the two plastic film mulching measures significantly reduced nitrate nitrogen content in the soil profile fig 3 the content of no3 n in the pm2 treatment decreased across the entire profile the content of no3 n in pm1 fluctuated within the profile the peak appeared at a depth of 140 cm 7 63 mg kg 1 the ck treatment had two accumulation peaks within the entire profile the first accumulation peak was at 60 cm where the nitrate content was 42 36 mg kg 1 the second accumulation peak was at 180 cm with a nitrate content of 15 27 mg kg 1 the nitrate content in the jm treatment in the depth range of 0 50 cm was much higher than that in the corresponding depth range in the ck treatment with an accumulation peak at 40 cm 63 01 mg kg 1 in the below 50 cm soil layer nitrate nitrogen concentration in the jm treatment declined to levels less than in the ck treatment at 120 cm soil depth in the same experiment the peak value for the ck treatment increased from 30 9 mg kg 1 in 2007 yang 2009 to 42 36 mg kg 1 and a new peak formed at a depth of 180 cm in 2007 the peak depth for the jm treatment was 60 cm the content of soil nitrate nitrogen was 30 9 mg kg 1 and at the same depth the nitrate nitrogen content was 31 95 mg kg 1 in 2016 the peak for the pm1 treatment varied from 5 8 mg kg 1 at 60 cm to 7 63 mg kg 1 at 140 cm compared to the ck treatment soil nitrate nitrogen changed little from 2007 to 2016 in the pm1 and jm treatments on one hand mulching has the benefit of improving soil physical conditions including the protection of topsoil stability de silva and cook 2003 such changes in the soil environment are good for crop root growth and root strength resulting in increased absorption of soil water and nutrients clark et al 2003 on the other hand mulching prevents the direct vertical infiltration of precipitation from the surface of the soil and most of the water can only infiltrate the trenches via lateral movement this can increase the upward movement of water on the plastic film ridge reducing the migration of nitrogen to the deeper layers zhang et al 2012 therefore mulching measures can reduce the nitrogen content of the soil profile table 3 lists the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profile at a depth range of 0 300 cm during the harvest period in 2016 the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the different treatments was ordered as jm ck pm1 pm2 nitrate n accumulation at 100 200 cm within the three mulching treatments was lower than in the ck treatment indicating that mulching cultivation on the soil surface can significantly reduce the soil profile nitrate accumulation compared with the data from 2007 yang 2009 nitrate n accumulation in the soil profile 0 300 cm depth in the ck pm1 and jm treatments increased by 123 47 kg ha 1 79 25 kg ha 1 and 389 57 kg ha 1 respectively however the increment in nitrate content of 80 20 in the jm treatment occurred in the depth range of 0 100 cm indicating that straw mulching could significantly increase the accumulation of nitrate in the upper soil layer based on the distribution of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profiles at harvest stage fig 3 we concluded that all of the mulching measures could effectively reduce the leaching and accumulation of nitrate in deeper soil layers zhang et al 2009 found that the residual nitrate nitrogen in the soil was significantly increased when the nitrogen application rate was higher than 150 kg ha 1 with or without straw mulching the accumulation peak occurred within the 0 200 cm soil depth section with straw mulching compared to the non mulching peak at a depth of approximately 40 cm in our experiment the nitrogen application rate was 150 kg ha 1 the soil nitrate nitrogen content and accumulation in the range of 0 50 cm depth with straw mulching was significantly higher than in the non mulching treatment and the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the 0 100 cm depth section with straw mulching was significantly greater than in the other treatments while the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the range of 100 200 cm depth in the straw mulching treatment was less than that in the corresponding non mulching treatment the results showed that straw mulching could significantly increase nitrate nitrogen content in the soil surface without causing downward leaching some studies have shown that straw mulching can significantly increase the nitrate nitrogen content of the soil surface promote the supply of nitrogen reduce the residual nitrate nitrogen and reduce the loss from leaching wang et al 2014 he et al 2016 as reported by dong et al 2018 compared with the ck treatment the concentration of soil organic carbon under the straw mulching treatment was increased by 16 9 at the 0 10 cm soil depth compared with the ck treatment the soil c n ratio was increased under the straw mulching treatment by 6 2 p 0 05 this was mainly because straw decomposition could release a substantial amount of doc increasing labile organic c and n and thus alleviating nutrient limitation of the microbes chan et al 2002 chen et al 2009 li et al 2016a b xie et al 2017 for the above reasons we believe that straw mulching can promote microbial activity and increase the mineralization of soil nitrogen by changing the organic matter status of the soil surface 3 3 yield and n uptake of spring maize under mulching measures plastic film mulching has significantly increased the maize yield in the loess plateau zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 different effects of straw mulching on spring maize yield have been reported some studies have shown that the low temperature effect due to straw mulching in early spring maize leads to a decrease in yield zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 however wang et al 2011 showed that straw mulching increased yield by 45 67 compared with no mulching and film mulching increased yield by 47 24 in the present experiment plastic film mulching increased yield by 23 72 compared with the control treatment in our experiments mulching significantly increased biomasses and grain yield in spring maize compared to non mulching table 4 after harvesting in 2016 the aboveground biomasses of all treatments were ordered as pm1 jm pm2 ck among the treatments used the biomasses in pm1 and ck were significantly different p 0 05 the biomass of the former was increased by 28 05 compared with that of the ck treatment the biomass in the jm treatment was increased by 11 13 compared with that of the ck treatment the yield for the pm1 treatment was the greatest at 1 13 mg ha 1 compared to the ck treatment the yield in the pm1 treatment was increased by 26 72 the yields in the jm and pm2 treatments were higher than that for the ck treatment by 9 2 and 5 respectively the biomass and grain yield in the pm1 treatment were significantly higher than those of the jm and pm2 treatments p 0 05 the nhi indicates the efficiency with which the crop utilizes the acquired n for grain production compared with the control treatment the plant nitrogen uptake and the grain nitrogen uptake were all greater than those of the ck treatment except for pm2 indicating that the mulching cultivation of the spring maize increased the nitrogen uptake by the spring maize plants meanwhile each mulching nitrogen index was higher than the control treatment indicating a higher nitrogen content in the leaves and stems of plants in the control treatment in the controls more nitrogen is used for vegetative growth mulching allows plants to absorb more nitrogen that can be transferred to the grain for reproductive growth previous studies have found that soil mulching significantly increased maize n uptake efficiency and utilization efficiency compared with non mulching treatments and the grain yield and total n uptake increase may decrease the nitrate nitrogen residue in soil liu et al 2015 the nhi indicates the efficiency with which the crop utilizes the acquired n for grain production compared with the control treatment the plant nitrogen uptake and the grain nitrogen uptake were all greater than those of the ck treatment except for pm2 treatment indicating that the mulching cultivation of the spring maize increased the nitrogen uptake by the spring maize plants meanwhile each mulching nitrogen index was higher than that of the control treatment indicating a higher nitrogen content in the leaves and stems of the controls in the controls more nitrogen is used for vegetative growth mulching allows plants to absorb more nitrogen and to transfer more to the grain for reproductive growth 4 conclusion in rainfed agriculture in the southern gully region of loess plateau mulching measures effectively increased the soil water content within the 0 120 cm soil layer and increased water storage at 0 300 cm soil profile compared with non mulching the continuous mulching practice may effectively promote crop development and growth increasing the aboveground biomass and grain yields plastic film mulching during the growth period is the best way to increase the yield of corn in the present study yield was increased by 23 72 compared with non mulching controls plastic film mulching significantly reduced the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen at 0 300 cm soil profile compared with non mulching straw mulching increased the soil nitrate nitrogen content in the upper 50 cm layer but it reduced the soil nitrate nitrogen content at depth greater than 50 cm compared with non mulching this study revealed the soil nitrate nitrogen distribution and deep accumulation pattern in a rainfed agricultural area its results provide scientific guidance for reasonable fertilization and farming practices in future in this area acknowledgments this research was supported by national

11222,a field experiment was conducted in the southern gully region of the loess plateau to study the effects of mulching measures on spring maize yield and nitrate accumulation in dryland areas under traditional tillage conditions the study was performed to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area the four treatments were non mulching ck plastic film mulching during the growth period pm1 plastic film mulching during the fallow period pm2 and straw mulching jm after 13 years of continuous application the yield of spring maize the nitrogen uptake by plants and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured the results revealed that soil moisture content and water storage capacity of the three soil mulching treatments were all higher than those of the non mulching treatment soil water storage at a depth of 0 300 cm in the jm pm1 and pm2 treatments was increased by 11 8 10 6 and 8 8 respectively compared with the ck treatment compared with the ck treatment the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize the yield enhancement effect of the pm1 treatment was the most significant with a yield of 1 1 mg ha 1 and an increase of 26 72 in addition to the jm treatment the accumulation of soil nitrate at a depth of 0 300 cm in the pm1 and pm2 treatments was less than that of the ck treatment but the largest increase in soil nitrate 80 20 in the jm treatment was observed at a depth of 0 100 cm the results suggest that in the rainfed agriculture in the southern loess plateau mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage capacity pm1 and pm2 treatments could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the deeper soil profile and the three mulching measures could slow down the deep accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent keywords spring maize straw mulching plastic film mulching nitrate nitrogen 1 introduction in china about 21 7 of the total land area is located in the semi arid region where the annual precipitation is in the range of 250 550 mm and the crop water requirement is in the range of 300 600 mm li 2007 annual precipitation shows large variations from year to year and uneven distribution within seasons in general about 60 70 of the yearly rainfall is concentrated during the months of june september wang et al 2012 and thus in dryland farming systems water shortage is usually the limiting factor for crop growth li et al 2009 sietz et al 2011 in the loess plateau straw mulching and plastic film mulching are the two common practices that are widely used in crop production particularly in maize production lin et al 2016 many studies have confirmed that plastic film mulching can reduce water vapor transfer from the soil li et al 1999 li et al 2013 and can increase soil temperature by reducing heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground wu et al 2016 studies have indicated that mulching is conducive to crop growth as it improves the soil water content and soil temperature in dryland agriculture cook et al 2006 nitrogen is essential for plant growth and viability and therefore high yielding crops such as maize zea mays l are frequently treated with large amounts of n fertilizer to reach optimal yields jia et al 2014 according to the china agricultural database for 2013 the average county level maize yields in semi arid northern and northwestern china ranged from 4 9 to 7 8 mg ha 1 the n fertilizer application rates however were as high as 225 330 kg n ha 1 in farmers fields liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 much higher than the required range of n 97 141 kg ha 1 for maize hou et al 2012 however a higher n fertilizer input usually leads to nitrate nitrogen residue in the soil cui et al 2008 furthermore nitrate nitrogen residue can leach down into the deep soil or be lost by other ways owing to limited irrigation and precipitation nitrate leaching in cultivated lands of northwestern china has been underestimated or even ignored for many years yang et al 2015 therefore efforts to harvest more rainfall to increase soil water storage and to optimize n management to achieve higher crop yields have always been considered key steps in the sustainable development of dryland agriculture he et al 2016 however the research on the transformation of soil nitrogen has mainly focused on the winter wheat system and the wheat summer maize cropping system gao et al 2009 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 understanding the accumulation and utilization of plant n under mulching conditions is essential to help guide further improvements in crop yield and n management strategies of dryland agriculture therefore we performed a location fixed field experiment in a dryland area of the loess plateau using spring maize as the research object to determine the effects of different mulching measures on nitrate leaching in the soil and changes in soil water content 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted at the changwu experimental station 35 12 n 107 40 e and altitude 1206 m on the loess plateau in changwu county of shaanxi province china the climate is temperate semi arid with a mean annual air temperature of 9 1 2 3 c a mean monthly maximum temperature of 22 c july and a mean monthly minimum temperature of 7 c january the average annual sunshine duration is 2230 h with more than 171 frost free days the mean annual precipitation from 1990 to 2016 was 571 74 mm of which approximately 55 fell during the growing season between july and september the rainfall during the experimental period was measured using an automatic weather station changwu experimental station meteorological observatory ws std1 england at the experimental site according to the usda textural classification system the soil has a silty loam texture that is derived from loess with a deep and even soil profile the soil water content and wilting moisture in the 0 10 m loess section were 21 16 0 86 and 7 46 0 65 mass water content respectively and the soil bulk density was 1 23 1 44 g cm 3 wang et al 2015 the basic properties of the 0 20 cm soil layer are presented in table 1 the precipitation and average temperature during the test in 2016 are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment started in 2003 with a total of four treatments the treatments used were a control with no mulching ck plastic film mulching during the growth period pm1 plastic film mulching during the fallow period pm2 and straw mulching jm the ck treatment was not mulched throughout the year the pm1 treatment was mulched with plastic film during the growth period the pm2 treatment was mulched with plastic film only during the fallow period and the mulch cleared before sowing and was kept without mulching during the growth period in the jm treatment when the corn was harvested all of the straw was mulched evenly and the straw was closed when the corn was sown and was placed between the rows each treatment was replicated three times in 35 m2 plots 7 m 5 m in a randomized complete block design the test crop was a spring ripening corn variety pioneer 335 a planting pattern of alternating wide 60 cm and narrow 35 cm row spacing was used for each treatment the test plastic film used was 70 cm wide 0 015 mm thick polyethylene film fertilizers n 150 kg ha 1 and p2o5 75 kg ha 1 were spread over the soil surface and incorporated into the 0 20 cm soil layer using a rotary cultivator before sowing from 2003 to 2016 the management of the experimental site was as described above the spring corn was planted in late april and harvested in late september every year 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 grain yield at the harvest stage in 2016 we measured the yield of spring maize according to the method outlined below each plot was harvested for more than one third of the corn ear present after air drying the collected samples were threshed and the grain was weighed sub samples approximately 100 g of the air dried grain were dried to a constant weight in a fan oven at 75 c to estimate the grain water content the maize grain yield for each plot adjusted to a moisture content of 14 which was recorded on a per plot basis was converted to kilograms per hectare for statistical analysis 2 3 2 soil water content and nitrate nitrogen content determination at the harvest stage in 2016 we measured the soil water content according to the method described below three soil cores at depths of 0 100 cm with 10 cm increments and at depths of 100 300 cm with 20 cm increments were collected with an auger inner diameter 4 cm from each plot at harvest soil from the same layer in each plot was merged and 500 g of thoroughly mixed soil was collected as a sample for the soil analyses the soil water content of each sample was determined gravimetrically after oven drying at 105 c for 24 h at the harvest stage in 2007 and 2016 we measured the nitrate nitrogen content in the soil profile from 0 to 300 cm according to the method described below because changes in the ammonium nitrogen content of the soil in the dry land were quite small we only measured the nitrate nitrogen content in the soil soil nitrate n was extracted from 5 g of fresh soil with 50 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl and the nitrate content was measured by a hydrazine sulfate colorimetric method using a high resolution digital colorimeter 2 3 3 plant sample collection and determination three representative plants were collected from the center of each plot the plants were weighed fresh weight placed together into a paper bag kept at 105 c for 30 minutes then dried at 75 c to a constant weight after determining the dry matter weight the dried samples were crushed through a 60 mesh sieve followed by h2so4 h2o2 digestion and boiling plant nitrogen determination followed the method of kjeldahl 2 4 data analysis 1 soil water storage sws in the profile was considered to be the total storage in all sampled layers in the plot and was calculated using the following formula zhao et al 2014 sws mm swg p g cm 3 h mm where ρ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 swg is the soil water content in the corresponding soil layer and h is the soil

anova procedure and statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical package multiple comparisons of annual mean values were made using least significant difference lsd methods in all analyses a p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of mulching measures on soil moisture at harvest stage soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile at harvest in 2016 is shown in fig 2 in the four treatments soil water content mainly changed within the 0 120 cm soil layer indicating that spring maize mainly used the soil moisture within the range of 0 120 cm spring maize roots absorbed water in the upper 80 cm soil layer resulting in greater soil water variation as more than 80 of the plant root system is located in the upper layer 50 cm of soil jiang et al 2013 gao et al 2014 in the soil layers deeper than 120 cm there was little change in soil water content in the four treatments soil water content in the other mulching treatments except for the pm1 treatment was higher than in the soil profile for the ck treatment soil water content of the pm1 treatment at the 160 cm soil depth and below 160 cm depth was much lower than in the 140 cm and above 140 cm soil layers the overall results indicated that mulching could increase soil water content previous studies zhang et al 2007 zribi et al 2015 had shown that mulching could increase soil water content by reducing ineffective evaporation and raising the soil s deeper water to the crop available layer straw mulching also helps to reduce ineffective evaporation and improve soil moisture zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil profile for three mulching treatments at harvest was ordered as jm pm2 pm1 and this was related to the different movement of soil moisture under the three treatments the soil surface in the pm1 treatment was exposed during the fallow period thereby increasing the loss of soil water the surface of the land was in a semi mulching state during the growth period and the rainfall from may to june at the test site was low the plant thus consumed relatively large amounts of water resulting in high soil water loss however during july and august when the rainfall increased the leaf area of the spring maize plants increased blocking most of the rainfall meaning that the soil moisture in the pm1 plot was not replenished the jm and pm2 treatment s resulted in less water loss due to increased surface mulching during the fallow period and increased rainfall infiltration during the early spring maize growth period therefore the soil profile moisture content for the pm1 treatment was lower than that of the other mulching treatments soil water storage in the harvest period ranged from 713 to 797 mm in the 0 300 cm depth range and the amount of water storage was the in the order of jm pm2 pm1 ck table 2 the water storage of jm pm2 and pm1 treatments was increased by 11 7 10 6 and 6 2 respectively compared to the ck treatment indicating that the jm treatment had the strongest effect on soil water storage in addition the water storage level observed with the three soil mulching treatments during harvest increased from shallow to deep while the soil water storage at 60 120 cm in the ck treatment was lower than that of 0 60 cm and the soil water storage in the ck treatment was lower than in the mulching treatments zhang et al 2010 tested the planting and harvesting of maize under different plastic film mulching treatments in the arid highlands of the northern weibei upland their results showed that different types of plastic mulching had the same influence on soil water content the surface water content and soil water storage were significantly increased compared to non mulching li et al 2016a b studied spring maize in heyang shaanxi province and showed that straw mulching provided greater water conservation the above results suggest that mulching the ground can effectively increase the water storage of the soil during the harvest stage while non mulching treatments will increase the loss of soil water and reduce the soil water storage at the harvest stage 3 2 profile distribution and accumulation of soil nitrate under mulching measures nitrate nitrogen data from the soil profile at harvest showed that the two plastic film mulching measures significantly reduced nitrate nitrogen content in the soil profile fig 3 the content of no3 n in the pm2 treatment decreased across the entire profile the content of no3 n in pm1 fluctuated within the profile the peak appeared at a depth of 140 cm 7 63 mg kg 1 the ck treatment had two accumulation peaks within the entire profile the first accumulation peak was at 60 cm where the nitrate content was 42 36 mg kg 1 the second accumulation peak was at 180 cm with a nitrate content of 15 27 mg kg 1 the nitrate content in the jm treatment in the depth range of 0 50 cm was much higher than that in the corresponding depth range in the ck treatment with an accumulation peak at 40 cm 63 01 mg kg 1 in the below 50 cm soil layer nitrate nitrogen concentration in the jm treatment declined to levels less than in the ck treatment at 120 cm soil depth in the same experiment the peak value for the ck treatment increased from 30 9 mg kg 1 in 2007 yang 2009 to 42 36 mg kg 1 and a new peak formed at a depth of 180 cm in 2007 the peak depth for the jm treatment was 60 cm the content of soil nitrate nitrogen was 30 9 mg kg 1 and at the same depth the nitrate nitrogen content was 31 95 mg kg 1 in 2016 the peak for the pm1 treatment varied from 5 8 mg kg 1 at 60 cm to 7 63 mg kg 1 at 140 cm compared to the ck treatment soil nitrate nitrogen changed little from 2007 to 2016 in the pm1 and jm treatments on one hand mulching has the benefit of improving soil physical conditions including the protection of topsoil stability de silva and cook 2003 such changes in the soil environment are good for crop root growth and root strength resulting in increased absorption of soil water and nutrients clark et al 2003 on the other hand mulching prevents the direct vertical infiltration of precipitation from the surface of the soil and most of the water can only infiltrate the trenches via lateral movement this can increase the upward movement of water on the plastic film ridge reducing the migration of nitrogen to the deeper layers zhang et al 2012 therefore mulching measures can reduce the nitrogen content of the soil profile table 3 lists the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profile at a depth range of 0 300 cm during the harvest period in 2016 the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the different treatments was ordered as jm ck pm1 pm2 nitrate n accumulation at 100 200 cm within the three mulching treatments was lower than in the ck treatment indicating that mulching cultivation on the soil surface can significantly reduce the soil profile nitrate accumulation compared with the data from 2007 yang 2009 nitrate n accumulation in the soil profile 0 300 cm depth in the ck pm1 and jm treatments increased by 123 47 kg ha 1 79 25 kg ha 1 and 389 57 kg ha 1 respectively however the increment in nitrate content of 80 20 in the jm treatment occurred in the depth range of 0 100 cm indicating that straw mulching could significantly increase the accumulation of nitrate in the upper soil layer based on the distribution of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profiles at harvest stage fig 3 we concluded that all of the mulching measures could effectively reduce the leaching and accumulation of nitrate in deeper soil layers zhang et al 2009 found that the residual nitrate nitrogen in the soil was significantly increased when the nitrogen application rate was higher than 150 kg ha 1 with or without straw mulching the accumulation peak occurred within the 0 200 cm soil depth section with straw mulching compared to the non mulching peak at a depth of approximately 40 cm in our experiment the nitrogen application rate was 150 kg ha 1 the soil nitrate nitrogen content and accumulation in the range of 0 50 cm depth with straw mulching was significantly higher than in the non mulching treatment and the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the 0 100 cm depth section with straw mulching was significantly greater than in the other treatments while the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the range of 100 200 cm depth in the straw mulching treatment was less than that in the corresponding non mulching treatment the results showed that straw mulching could significantly increase nitrate nitrogen content in the soil surface without causing downward leaching some studies have shown that straw mulching can significantly increase the nitrate nitrogen content of the soil surface promote the supply of nitrogen reduce the residual nitrate nitrogen and reduce the loss from leaching wang et al 2014 he et al 2016 as reported by dong et al 2018 compared with the ck treatment the concentration of soil organic carbon under the straw mulching treatment was increased by 16 9 at the 0 10 cm soil depth compared with the ck treatment the soil c n ratio was increased under the straw mulching treatment by 6 2 p 0 05 this was mainly because straw decomposition could release a substantial amount of doc increasing labile organic c and n and thus alleviating nutrient limitation of the microbes chan et al 2002 chen et al 2009 li et al 2016a b xie et al 2017 for the above reasons we believe that straw mulching can promote microbial activity and increase the mineralization of soil nitrogen by changing the organic matter status of the soil surface 3 3 yield and n uptake of spring maize under mulching measures plastic film mulching has significantly increased the maize yield in the loess plateau zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 different effects of straw mulching on spring maize yield have been reported some studies have shown that the low temperature effect due to straw mulching in early spring maize leads to a decrease in yield zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 however wang et al 2011 showed that straw mulching increased yield by 45 67 compared with no mulching and film mulching increased yield by 47 24 in the present experiment plastic film mulching increased yield by 23 72 compared with the control treatment in our experiments mulching significantly increased biomasses and grain yield in spring maize compared to non mulching table 4 after harvesting in 2016 the aboveground biomasses of all treatments were ordered as pm1 jm pm2 ck among the treatments used the biomasses in pm1 and ck were significantly different p 0 05 the biomass of the former was increased by 28 05 compared with that of the ck treatment the biomass in the jm treatment was increased by 11 13 compared with that of the ck treatment the yield for the pm1 treatment was the greatest at 1 13 mg ha 1 compared to the ck treatment the yield in the pm1 treatment was increased by 26 72 the yields in the jm and pm2 treatments were higher than that for the ck treatment by 9 2 and 5 respectively the biomass and grain yield in the pm1 treatment were significantly higher than those of the jm and pm2 treatments p 0 05 the nhi indicates the efficiency with which the crop utilizes the acquired n for grain production compared with the control treatment the plant nitrogen uptake and the grain nitrogen uptake were all greater than those of the ck treatment except for pm2 indicating that the mulching cultivation of the spring maize increased the nitrogen uptake by the spring maize plants meanwhile each mulching nitrogen index was higher than the control treatment indicating a higher nitrogen content in the leaves and stems of plants in the control treatment in the controls more nitrogen is used for vegetative growth mulching allows plants to absorb more nitrogen that can be transferred to the grain for reproductive growth previous studies have found that soil mulching significantly increased maize n uptake efficiency and utilization efficiency compared with non mulching treatments and the grain yield and total n uptake increase may decrease the nitrate nitrogen residue in soil liu et al 2015 the nhi indicates the efficiency with which the crop utilizes the acquired n for grain production compared with the control treatment the plant nitrogen uptake and the grain nitrogen uptake were all greater than those of the ck treatment except for pm2 treatment indicating that the mulching cultivation of the spring maize increased the nitrogen uptake by the spring maize plants meanwhile each mulching nitrogen index was higher than that of the control treatment indicating a higher nitrogen content in the leaves and stems of the controls in the controls more nitrogen is used for vegetative growth mulching allows plants to absorb more nitrogen and to transfer more to the grain for reproductive growth 4 conclusion in rainfed agriculture in the southern gully region of loess plateau mulching measures effectively increased the soil water content within the 0 120 cm soil layer and increased water storage at 0 300 cm soil profile compared with non mulching the continuous mulching practice may effectively promote crop development and growth increasing the aboveground biomass and grain yields plastic film mulching during the growth period is the best way to increase the yield of corn in the present study yield was increased by 23 72 compared with non mulching controls plastic film mulching significantly reduced the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen at 0 300 cm soil profile compared with non mulching straw mulching increased the soil nitrate nitrogen content in the upper 50 cm layer but it reduced the soil nitrate nitrogen content at depth greater than 50 cm compared with non mulching this study revealed the soil nitrate nitrogen distribution and deep accumulation pattern in a rainfed agricultural area its results provide scientific guidance for reasonable fertilization and farming practices in future in this area acknowledgments this research was supported by national

drought risk potted soybean water deficit experiments with different irrigation treatments during two seasons 2015 and 2016 were conducted in china s huaibei plain s shaped soybean drought loss sensitivity curves at four growth periods were established and the sensitivity of seed formation to water deficit during different stages was quantitatively compared the results indicated that the negative effects of water deficit during the flowering podding and seed filling stages on yield formation were greater than those during the branching and seedling stages similarly aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight both reached the minimum when soybeans encountered a severe water deficit during the seed filling stage according to the parameters of the sensitivity curve the seed yield loss was the greatest when soybeans experienced severe drought stress during the flowering podding stage in addition soybean tolerance to drought during the seedling stage was relatively weak moreover the sensitivity at each growth period varied with water deficit intensity if there was a mild water defict soybean yield formation was more sensitive to the deficit when it occurred during the seedling stage however if the deficit was relatively serious yield formation became more sensitive when it happened during the flowering podding stage therefore it is crucial to strictly control the water deficit intensity during the seedling stage and ensure an adequate water supply during the reproductive growth period especially during the flowering and pod enlargement stage for guaranteeing a high soybean yield keywords agricultural drought risk curve assessment sensitivity to water deficit drought loss vulnerability risk formation process 1 introduction drought is a natural phenomenon consisting of a long term water deficit at any link in the hydrologic cycle and it becomes a disaster only when it generates negative impacts on the growth of crops and vegetations the production and the life of humans or the function of the ecological environment dai et al 2004 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007 wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 however drought is difficult to study because of its complexity chang et al 2016 yin et al 2014 moreover with global climate change and local drying tendencies drought has been occurring frequently around the world and its adverse effects are simultaneously being aggravated fontaine and steinemann 2009 mishra and singh 2011 drought is a serious natural disaster that severely affects agricultural production and directly threatens national food security in china leng et al 2015 the average annual grain losses caused by drought reached up to 25 9 billion kilograms during 1990 2014 mwrc the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2014 which was close to the annual food requirement for 60 million people qin et al 2015 in recent years extreme droughts have occurred more frequently such as the winter spring drought in southwest china during 2009 2010 and the summer drought in the huai river basin in june 2012 in short china is subject to an increasing drought risk with a changing environment chang et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 risk assessment is an effective means for managing extreme weather and climate events ipcc 2012 an accurate understanding and quantitative assessment of drought risk can improve the capacity to cope with drought disasters and thus reduce agricultural loss wilhite et al 2007 from the perspective of natural disaster system theory shi 2002 disaster risk r can be considered a complex system that consists of disaster inducing factor hazard h and disaster effected body vulnerability v expressed as r f h v dalezios et al 2014 un isdr united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2004 yue et al 2018 furthermore many scholars and institutions consistently agree that vulnerability is made up of three basic components sensitivity exposure and the capacity to cope with adverse effects adger 2006 smit and wandel 2006 specific to agricultural drought crop drought loss vulnerability v can also be expressed through a compound function of crop drought loss sensitivity s crop exposure to a drought environment e and anthropogenic measures to alleviate drought intensity or decrease crop losses for instance by determining effective irrigation amount and time during a drought period a jin et al 2016 however as the most foundational element for building vulnerability function and an essential link converting drought event to grain losses wu et al 2017 the connotation and quantified method of sensitivity have not been explicitly expressed which limits the quantitative assessment and control of agricultural drought risk wang et al 2013 therefore it is fundamental to accurately define and evaluate crop drought loss sensitivity menoni et al 2012 un isdr 2004 yin et al 2014 crop drought loss sensitivity should be an attribute of crop itself it reflects the response of crop growth to drought stress many studies have established the relationship between water consumption or crop evapotranspiration at each growth stage and crop yield based on a crop water production function method and then compared the sensitivity of crop yield formation to water deficit during different stages through sensitivity coefficients igbadun et al 2007 smilovic et al 2016 however the responses of crop growth to different degrees of water deficit during a given stage are not the same this method may not be able to reflect the variation of sensitivity with the deficit intensity based on the coefficients alone a damage curve has been used to quantitatively evaluate the disaster losses under different hazard intensities and can provide a reference for assessing sensitivity recently some scholars have established a quantitative relationship between drought intensity and the corresponding crop yield loss for evaluating crop drought loss vulnerability jia et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yin et al 2014 these vulnerability curves have led to a breakthrough in agricultural drought risk assessment but there have been no studies of sensitivity curves in addition the existing vulnerability curves were established by setting assumed drought or irrigation scenarios and simulating crop yield formation through a crop model nevertheless actual crop growth process under drought stress are complex and should be further clarified to this end it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate crop drought loss sensitivity based on damage curves and practical crop water deficit experiments soybean glycine max l merrill is an important food and oil crop in china liu et al 2008 and also a substantial source of high quality protein and fat for humans wei et al 2015 with the development of the economy and improvements in living conditions the demand for soybeans has gradually increased meanwhile it is likely that a serious water scarcity period will develop in the near future water deficit negatively affects soybean production and the magnitude is not only determined by the deficit intensity but is also related to the growth stage when the deficit occurs dogan et al 2007 sincik et al 2008 huaibei plain is a leading production region for high protein soybean in china and soybeans are primarily planted in the summer however the huaibei plain is located in a typical semi arid and sub humid monsoon region with non uniform spatial and temporal precipitation distributions in addition the temperatures in the summer are high thus agricultural drought occurs frequently during the soybean growth period in this area therefore identifying the sensitivity of soybean yield formation to water deficit at each growth period based on a sensitivity curve is important for formulating reasonable irrigation schedules and effective measures to reduce soybean production loss caused by drought in this study to provide sufficient samples of actual soybean growth losses under various drought patterns for building sensitivity curves two seasonal potted soybean experiments with different irrigation conditions at each single growth stage were conducted in the huaibei plain to 1 evaluate the effects of water deficit at each stage on soybean yield characteristics 2 establish the quantitative relationship between the accumulated water deficit intensity and the corresponding seed yield loss rate for each stage creating a soybean drought loss sensitivity curve and 3 quantitatively compare the sensitivity of soybean seed formation to a given water deficit intensity during different growth stages based on the sensitivity curves 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in pots at the xinmaqiao agricultural irrigation research station water resources research institute of anhui province and huaihe river commission p r china which is located in bengbu north of the huai river latitude 33 09 n longitude 117 22 e altitude 19 7 m fig 1 this research site has a typical northern subtropical and warm temperate transition zone climate the annual precipitation is unevenly distributed over the years and drought disasters are common in this area the experiments were both implemented from june to september in 2015 and 2016 and the actual monthly climatic conditions during these periods are shown in table 1 2 2 crop management soybeans were planted in pots with an upper diameter of 28 cm a bottom diameter of 20 cm and a height of 27 cm with 15 kg of air dried soil added to every empty pot in the 2015 season however in 2016 the upper diameter bottom diameter and height of the pots were changed to 31 cm 23 cm and 27 cm respectively while the amount of air dried soil increased to 17 kg all empty pots were weighed before loading the air dried soil the experimental soil was collected from a field tillage layer at this station and was a typical shajiang black soil from the huaibei plain its upper layer 0 50 cm characteristics are shown in table 2 to ensure the germination of the soybean seeds the soil water content in each pot was irrigated to field capacity after sowing along with 4 g of compound fertilizer n 15 p2o5 15 k2o 15 all soybean pots were placed in an open environment under a movable shed that was closed when precipitation occurred fig 1 the soil water decreased with the soybean evapotranspiration and was supplied only by irrigation during the experimental period except for irrigation other crop management practices such as weeding and pest control were the same for all pot samples during the 2015 season soybean seeds cv zhonghuang 13 were sown on june 20 and did not all germinate until july 3 then irrigation treatments were implemented on july 4 and soybeans were harvested on september 20 in 2016 the same seeds were sown on june 29 and treatments were conducted from july 15 to september 27 according to the soybean planting density in field around the huaibei plain each pot retained three plants combining relevant studies on soybean growth stages desclaux et al 2000 dogan et al 2007 with years of practical soybean growth records in this station the soybean whole growth period was divided into four stages in both seasons table 3 2 3 experimental design in the experiments nine irrigation treatments eight deficit irrigation treatments and one full irrigation treatment were conducted for both seasons table 4 in order to assess and compare the influences of drought stress at different periods on soybean production deficit irrigation at each single growth stage was designed moreover irrigation treatments were implemented by setting different lower limits of soil water content in the pots during four stages based on the previous research desclaux et al 2000 sincik et al 2008 and years of crop deficit irrigation experiments in this station three lower limits of soil water content were set which corresponded to no water deficit 75 of field capacity slight water deficit 55 of field capacity and serious water deficit 35 of field capacity respectively in addition to reflect the response of soybean growth to water deficit process to be close to the actual irrigation in crop production and to guarantee soybean survival soybeans were irrigated to 90 of field capacity once the soil water dropped below the lower limit chen et al 2013 the irrigation amount and times during each soybean growth stage under different irrigation treatments are shown in table 5 in detail slight and serious water deficits were set up during the soybean seedling stage stage i the branching stage stage ii the flowering podding stage stage iii and the seed filling stage stage iv and were referred to as t1 t8 no water deficit was set up during the whole growth period which was referred to as ck for both seasons tables 3 and 4 considering the influence of soybean growth on calculating soil water content the plant weight at the end of the previous stage should be subtracted from the pot weight during the current stage accordingly except for the soybean pots used to measure the yield characteristics at harvest five replications for t1 t8 during both seasons fifteen and five replications for ck in the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively additional pots were arranged for measuring the plant weight at the end of stages i ii and iii specifically three entire plants in a pot were taken out from five replications and weighed at the end of each stage in ck for t1 t6 the plants were taken out and weighed only from the stage of water deficit however the plant weights at the end of each stage before the water deficit in t3 t8 were replaced by the corresponding results in ck therefore in both seasons a total of twenty replications for t1 and t2 fifteen replications for t3 and t4 ten replications for t5 and t6 and five replications for t7 and t8 were set respectively in addition there were respectively thirty and twenty replications in total for ck in the 2015 and 2016 seasons during the two seasons soybean pots were both arranged in a completely randomized experimental design fig 1 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 pot weight wj is the weight of a soybean pot on day j after seed germination kg which was measured with an electronic balance yp30kn shanghai sunny hengping scientific instrument co ltd china all pots were weighed at 6 p m from seed germination to plant harvest 2 4 2 soil water content the soil water content in each soybean pot was calculated according to its weight as follows 1 θ j b w j 1 w s w p i j w s 2 θ j e w j w s w p w s 3 θ j θ j b θ j e 2 where θj b is the soil water content in a soybean pot at the beginning of day j immediately after irrigation g g 1 of soil dry weight θj e is the soil water content at the end of day j when weighing the pot g g 1 of soil dry weight θj is the mean soil water content on day j g g 1 of soil dry weight w s is the weight of air dried soil that was added to the pot before planting kg w p is the weight of an empty pot kg and ij is the irrigation amount for the pot on day j kg to reduce the error caused by the weight of soybean plant in the soil water content calculation three entire plants in a pot were taken out from five replications and weighed with an electronic balance td30k 0 1 tianjin balance instrument co ltd china at the end of stages i ii and iii respectively then the average plant weight of these five results was subtracted from the pot weight during the corresponding next stage 2 4 3 irrigation amount whether the soybean plants needed to be irrigated was determined by comparing the soil water content in a pot and its corresponding lower limit the irrigation amount was calculated as follows 4 i j 0 θ j 1 e θ lm 90 θ f c θ j 1 e w s θ j 1 e θ lm where θ fc is the soil water at field capacity g g 1 of soil dry weight θj 1 e is the soil water content in a pot at the end of day j 1 g g 1 of soil dry weight and θ lm is the lower limit of soil water content for irrigation treatment of the pot g g 1 of soil dry weight in this experiment soybean plants were irrigated to 90 of θ fc on day j when θj 1 e was lower than θ lm the irrigation amount was metered by measurement and implemented at 7 a m 2 4 4 crop evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration of soybean in each pot was calculated according to its weight and irrigation amount as follows 5 e t c j w j 1 i j w j where etc j is the evapotranspiration of soybean on day j it could be converted to millimeter mm from kilogram kg according to the density of water and the area at the top of the pot 2 4 5 seed yield and drought loss soybean seed yield aboveground biomass stem leaf pod and seed and seed number of three plants in each pot were measured at harvest time in both seasons and the 1000 seed weight was calculated seed yield and aboveground biomass were both measured with an electronic balance td30k 0 1 tianjin balance instrument co ltd china after drying in the sun seed yield loss caused by drought under each irrigation treatment was calculated as follows 6 l r i max y i y i max y i 100 where lri is the soybean seed yield drought loss rate in pot i yi is the seed yield in pot i t ha 1 and max yi is the maximum seed yield among all experimental pots t ha 1 2 4 6 data analysis statistical analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the effects of different irrigation treatments on soybean production differences between means were evaluated for significance using the least significant differences lsd test at p 0 05 level average values of seed yield aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight of all replications under each treatment were analyzed in the 2015 and 2016 seasons all statistical procedures were performed using version 3 3 2 of r software the r foundation for statistical computing austria the parameters in the soybean drought loss sensitivity curve equations were solved using an accelerating genetic algorithm aga in matlab version r2014a software the mathworks inc usa and the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to determine the goodness of fit 2 5 crop water deficit identification based on run theory in this study a crop water deficit event was considered to occur once the soil water content was lower than the lower limit of the most suitable value for crop growth combining with the run theory nam et al 2015 two thresholds θ ms and θ ls that represented the most and least suitable soil water contents for crop growth were set respectively and the detailed process of crop water deficit identification is shown in fig 2 fig 2 represents an example with three crop water deficit events during the crop growth period and the shaded area indicates the water deficit intensity of each event correspondingly a crop water deficit index cwd was proposed to quantitatively describe the deficit intensity in this study based on the soil water deficit index swd patanè and cosentino 2010 combining with the identification process in fig 2 the cwd was calculated as follows 7 c w d j 1 θ j θ ls θ ms θ j θ ms θ ls θ ls θ j θ ms 0 θ j θ ms 8 a c w d j 1 n c w d j where cwdj is the crop water deficit intensity on day j during a given growth stage acwd is the accumulated crop water deficit intensity during this stage and n is the number of days at this stage referring to relevant experimental designs and research achievements chen et al 2013 sincik et al 2008 and years of crop deficit irrigation experiments in this station it was found that the water condition in the soil could be highly suitable for crop growth when the soil water content merely reached 75 of θ fc not 100 in addition the plants could hardly absorb water from soil when the soil water content was below the wilting point therefore θ ls and θ ms in eq 7 were set at θ wp the soil water at wilting point g g 1 of soil dry weight and 75 of θ fc in this study respectively cwd ranged between 0 when θ was higher than or equal to 75 of θ fc and 1 when θ was lower than or equal to θ wp and the larger the value of cwd the more serious the crop water deficit 2 6 crop drought loss sensitivity curve in this study the crop drought loss sensitivity was studied from the perspective of drought stress during a single crop growth stage and then the sensitivity function at a given stage was described as the quantitative relationship between the crop water deficit intensity during this stage and the corresponding crop growth loss in a completely exposed environment and without any anthropogenic measures to reduce crop losses such as irrigation during a drought period furthermore the size of the crop growth sensitivity to a given degree of water deficit was the loss under this deficit intensity obviously this sensitivity varied with the drought intensity during the crop growth period which differed from the sensitivity coefficient in the crop water production function in addition the relationship between sensitivity and vulnerability is shown in fig 3 assuming that the crop was fully exposed to a drought environment and irrigation was the main anthropogenic measure the vulnerability function at a given stage should be the relationship between the crop water deficit intensity during this stage without irrigation and the crop growth loss in a given irrigation scheme therefore the vulnerability function reflected the decreased crop losses due to the irrigation relative to the sensitivity function under the same deficit intensity in other words the vulnerability function could be considered as a set of sensitivity functions in various irrigation patterns referring to the formation mechanism of drought risk jin et al 2016 shi 2002 and the current vulnerability curve research jia et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yin et al 2014 a soybean drought loss sensitivity curve at a given growth stage was established to fit the accumulated crop water deficit intensity acwd at this stage and the corresponding seed yield loss rate lr based on the logistic function in this study the sensitivity curve equation at a given stage was expressed as follows 9 l r a c w d l r max 1 α ex p β a c w d where lr acwd is the soybean seed yield loss rate function that varies with the accumulated crop water deficit intensity at a given stage that is the soybean drought loss sensitivity curve lrmax α and β are the parameters of sensitivity curve lrmax represents the maximum loss rate under drought conditions on the premise of plant survival α lrmax lr 0 1 lr 0 is the seed yield loss rate caused by other random factors rather than drought and it indicates the extent of variation in seed yield loss and β reflects the speed to reach lrmax where the larger the value of β the faster the speed chen et al 2015 expatiated a three phase s shaped logistic damage curve to quantitatively assess water induced disaster losses therefore based on this curve and relevant research on other natural hazard damage curves colombi et al 2008 dutta et al 2003 lee and rosowsky 2005 a three phase s shaped soybean drought loss sensitivity curve at a given growth stage was proposed and is shown in fig 4 there were three inflection points that depicted the variations of the sensitivity curve and they divided the curve into three phases a inflection point a was the point at which the change rate of the slope of the sensitivity curve was the largest or the increasing speed of lr grew the fastest this point was referred to as the drought disaster inducing point from point a lr rapidly increased along with acwd and the influence of drought began to spread therefore point a was an important indication for drought warnings according to the logistic function the third derivative at point a was zero therefore the corresponding acwd was calculated as follows 10 acw d a ln 2 3 α β b inflection point b was the point at which the slope of the sensitivity curve was the largest and indicated the fastest increasing speed of lr therefore this point was called the drought disaster breaking point at point b lr reached 50 of lrmax it was vital to avoid attaining acwdb during this period providing a reference for developing an irrigation strategy to reduce drought loss the second derivative at point b was zero therefore the corresponding acwd was calculated as follows 11 acw d b ln α β c inflection point c was the point at which the increasing speed of lr decreased the fastest and this point was called the drought disaster ceasing point when the increasing speed of lr became very small the crop water deficit intensity and its effect on seed formation were both close to their respective upper limits for guaranteeing the soybeans survival similarly the third derivative at point c was also zero but the corresponding acwd was obtained as follows 12 acw d c ln 2 3 α β 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop water deficit cwd fig 5 shows the daily trends of crop water deficit cwd and irrigation during each soybean growth stage under different irrigation treatments in the 2015 and 2016 seasons cwd increased with a decrease in soil water content reflecting the daily water deficit during the soybean growth process and the higher the cwd the more serious the deficit at each stage cwd was the largest under a serious water deficit condition the soil water content gradually decreased to the lower limit with the soybean evapotranspiration then it increased to 90 of θ fc after irrigation and the cwd changed accordingly moreover the average days required for reaching the lower limit of soil water content for serious water deficit conditions during four growth stages were obviously longer table 6 cwd during stages iii and iv fluctuated more frequently especially in ck treatment cwd was related to the soybean water consumption soybean evapotranspiration under a no water deficit condition was larger than those under drought conditions table 6 in addition the average daily evapotranspiration of soybean during the reproductive growth phase stages iii and iv in this study was relatively stronger than that during the vegetative growth phase stages i and ii table 6 the soil water content in ck was frequently lower than 75 of θ fc and the corresponding cwd was not equal to 0 due to strong soybean evapotranspiration table 6 in addition the soil water content occasionally started to increase although it had not reached the lower limit especially under a serious water deficit condition during stages iii and iv t6 and t8 this was because the soybean plants which had wilted for three or four days were watered to 90 of θ fc to ensure their survival in this study similar results were found by chen et al 2013 in a solar greenhouse study and patanè and cosentino 2010 in an open field experiment patanè and cosentino 2010 used a soil water deficit index swd to quantify the water deficit intensity during the tomato growth period however the cwd in this study further indicated that the most suitable soil water content for crop growth did not have to be θ fc but could range from 75 of θ fc to θ fc montoya et al 2017 wei et al 2015 in other words a crop water deficit event occurred when the soil water content was below 75 of θ fc rather than θ fc 3 2 yield characteristics table 7 shows the soybean yield characteristics under different irrigation treatments in the 2015 and 2016 seasons there were significant differences in seed yield among treatments for both seasons p 0 001 the water deficit negatively affected the soybean seed formation and the seed yield loss increased with acwd at each growth stage for example compared to ck the seed yield was reduced by 13 0 and 17 7 in t3 the average acwd values were 3 24 and 2 17 for the two seasons and the values were 23 4 and 43 3 respectively in t4 the average acwd values were 8 85 and 6 01 table 7 similarly sincik et al 2008 found that the full irrigation treatment had the highest soybean seed yield while the deficit irrigation treatments 25 50 and 75 of full irrigation treatments resulted in a 11 7 27 4 reduction in field studies in addition earlier studies also reported that water stress throughout the soybean growth period would cause seed decreases under field conditions dogan et al 2007 egli and bruening 2004 however the overall seed yield loss caused by a water deficit during different growth stages differed greatly compared to ck the seed yield was reduced by 14 2 2015 season and 28 0 2016 season the average reduction in t1 and t2 18 2 and 30 5 the average reduction in t3 and t4 53 1 and 56 2 the average reduction in t5 and t6 and 50 1 and 45 2 the average reduction in t7 and t8 when the plants were subjected to a deficit at stages i ii iii and iv obviously the negative effects of drought stress during stages iii and iv on soybean seed formation were relatively greater these results were in agreement with dogan et al 2007 who reported that the soybean yield reductions without irrigation at the stages of full seed beginning of pod formation and beginning of seed formation were 50 33 and 31 respectively of those with full irrigation in a field circumstance correspondingly in our study stage iii consisted of the flowering and pod enlargement processes and stage iv corresponded to the seed filling period similar results were also reported by desclaux et al 2000 in a pot study and foroud et al 1993 in a field experiment those studies found that soybeans at the reproductive period had a greater potential production sensitivity to water deficit while deficit at the vegetative period did not significantly affect the yield components in addition the order of seed yield loss under the same water deficit conditions during different stages was not constant it changed with the degree of deficit for instance compared to ck the seed yield declined by 24 3 in t5 which was lower than that in t7 however the yield was reduced by 81 9 in t6 which was obviously higher than that in t8 during the 2015 season similarly in 2016 the seed yield was reduced by 17 7 in t3 which was less than that in t1 while it declined by 43 2 in t4 which was larger than that in t2 table 7 therefore to reasonably compare the effects of a water deficit on soybean seed formation during different growth stages it is necessary to calculate the seed yield loss under the same deficit intensity there were also significant differences in aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight among treatments for the two seasons p 0 001 and their drought losses both increased with acwd the aboveground biomass under water deficit conditions during stage iv were both the lowest in 2015 and 2016 and declined by 38 7 and 36 6 the average decline in t7 and t8 compared to ck similarly the 1000 seed weight under drought stress during stage iv was the smallest for both seasons which were reduced by 31 5 and 31 6 compared to ck dogan et al 2007 found that the soybean biomass and 1000 seed weight under no irrigation during the stage of full seed declined by 33 0 and 13 4 compared with full irrigation in a field environment however these two reductions were lower than those observed in our study which may be due to the different degrees of water deficit or different soybean cultivars meanwhile our finding was consistent with that of desclaux et al 2000 who discovered that there was no clear single seed weight reduction when soybeans encountered two levels of drought stress irrigation was withheld until the soil water content in pot reached either 30 or 50 of plant available water during all growth periods except for the seed filling stage 3 3 soybean drought loss sensitivity curves during four growth stages in this study three linear logarithmic and s shaped logistic functions were used to fit the quantitative relationship between acwd at each soybean growth stage and the corresponding lr the results are shown in fig 6 and the functional parameters are listed in table 8 the r 2 of the s shaped curves during the four stages were relatively higher and this curve had a clear physical meaning therefore it was more suitable to depict the variations of soybean seed yield loss with drought intensity furthermore the yield loss under different intensities during each stage could be quantitatively assessed based on the logistic functional equations in table 8 although some scholars have established the vulnerability curves through a crop model jia et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yin et al 2014 the curve in this study further clarifies and quantifies the sensitivity from the perspective of a practical crop water deficit experiment moreover as an application of the three phase damage curve in agricultural drought field based on the research of chen et al 2015 this sensitivity curve can be used as a transition function to build vulnerability and then loss risk curves there were similar variations in s shaped sensitivity curves during the same growth stage for the two seasons the largest lrmax values among all stages for both seasons was observed during stage iii 83 87 and 74 49 in table 8 this finding implied that the seed yield loss was the greatest if the soybeans experienced a serious water deficit at stage iii therefore it was necessary to guarantee the water supply at this period the lowest lrmax values were achieved at stage i 22 33 and 38 44 which indicated that the yield loss was relatively small if the plants suffered from a severe water deficit during stage i this finding was consistent with the studies that found a moderate water deficit during the soybean vegetative growth phase for a short time would not reduce the yield components by desclaux et al 2000 in a pot experiment and oya et al 2004 in a field environment in addition the highest β values were found during stage i 1 89 and 1 56 implying that the yield loss rate would approach the lrmax of this stage if the soybeans suffered from very slight drought stress in other words the tolerance to drought for seed formation during stage i was relatively weak thus the water deficit intensity should be strictly controlled if deficit irrigation was conducted during this period the smallest β values were observed at stage iv 0 60 and 0 69 meaning that the tolerance to drought at this stage was relatively strong taking the sensitivity curve at stage ii in the 2015 season fig 6a as an example in the initial phase the increasing speed of lr grew slowly until acwd reached 1 28 acwda table 9 from point a the curve entered the developing phase and the speed increased sharply indicating that the negative impact of drought stress at this stage on seed formation expanded quickly the maximum speed was achieved when acwd reached 2 63 acwdb and the corresponding lr was equal to 13 84 50 of lrmax lrmax 27 67 in table 8 next the increasing speed of lr decreased gradually and the curve entered the declining phase when acwd reached 3 99 acwdc 3 4 comparison of soybean seed formation sensitivity to water deficit during different growth stages fig 7 shows the soybean seed yield drought loss sensitivity curves during four single growth stages in the 2015 and 2016 seasons according to the conception of sensitivity in this study the sensitivity of soybean seed formation to water deficit at a given stage varied with the deficit intensity therefore to quantitatively compare the sensitivity during different growth periods it was necessary to contrast the amount of lr on the sensitivity curves at the four stages under the same acwd there were two major boundaries on the sensitivity curves in the 2015 season fig 7a when acwd was less than 1 86 lr at stage i was equal to that at stage iii when acwd reached 1 86 lr at stage i was the largest among the four stages under the same acwd and the seed yield loss or sensitivity ranked from large to small was in the order of stage i stage iii stage iv and stage ii however when acwd was greater than 3 66 lr at stage i was equal to that at stage iv when acwd reached 3 66 lr at stage iii became the largest and the order changed to stage iii stage iv stage ii and stage i similarly there were also two main boundaries in the 2016 season fig 7b and the sequence of sensitivity from large to small was stage i stage iii stage ii and stage iv when acwd was less than 2 75 lr at stage i was equal to that at stage iii when acwd approached 2 75 however the sequence became stage iii stage iv stage ii and stage i when acwd was higher than 5 37 lr at stage ii was equal to that at stage iv when acwd approached 5 37 our findings of soybean yield formation sensitivity to water deficit were basically in agreement with wang et al 2014 who studied the sensitivity based on a soybean pot experiment and the jensen model which is a static crop water production function however the sensitivity in our study was defined for a given water deficit intensity the sensitivity results for both seasons were mostly consistent if there was a mild water deficit soybean seed formation was more sensitive to the deficit when it occurred during stage i but if the deficit was relatively serious seed formation became more sensitive when it happened during stage iii however seed formation was not highly sensitive to water deficit during stage ii whatever the deficit degree similarly many studies under field conditions have reported that soybeans are more susceptible to water deficit during the beginning of flowering through the beginning of seed formation dogan et al 2007 foroud et al 1993 moreover early drought during the vegetative period primarily decreases the biomass and internode length desclaux et al 2000 drought during the flowering stage reduces the number of pods and seed size and seed size will significantly decline if drought occurs in the late flowering and pod filling stages egli and bruening 2004 oya et al 2004 the degree of seed yield loss caused by a slight water deficit during the seedling stage was serious probably because the soybean tolerance to drought at this period may be relatively weak therefore measures for protecting seeds from severe drought stress at the seedling stage should be implemented in actual soybean production in addition soybeans may be able to recover from the stress during the seedling stage and return to normal growth after re watering during the next stages which guarantees the seed yield soybeans may have a certain level of tolerance to drought after normal growth at the seedling stage therefore mild drought stress during the next stages will not significantly affect the yield formation nevertheless at the flowering and pod enlargement stage stage iii in our study soybean vegetative and reproductive growth both proceed and water consumption approaches the maximum xu et al 2003 the pod and seed formation will be seriously obstructed if the plants encounter a severe water deficit therefore it is vital to ensure the water supply during this period for a high yield 4 conclusions water deficit negatively affected soybean seed formation and seed yield loss increased with the accumulated crop water deficit intensity during each growth stage however the loss caused by a water deficit at different stages differed greatly the effects of drought stress during the flowering podding and the seed filling stages on yield formation were greater than those during the branching and seedling stages similarly the losses of aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight also increased with the deficit intensity and they both reached their respective maximum when soybeans suffered from a severe water deficit during the seed filling stage s shaped logistic soybean drought loss sensitivity curves during four growth stages were established to fit the quantitative relationship between the accumulated crop water deficit intensity acwd at a given stage and the corresponding seed yield loss rate lr according to the curve parameters the negative impact on seed formation was the greatest when soybeans encountered severe drought stress during the flowering podding stage therefore it was necessary to guarantee the water supply at this period in addition when soybeans suffered from a slight water deficit at the seedling stage the seed yield loss approached the maximum for ensuring plant survival during this period therefore soybean tolerance to drought during the seedling stage was relatively weak and the deficit intensity should be strictly controlled if deficit irrigation is conducted at this stage the sensitivity of soybean seed formation to water deficit during different stages was quantitatively assessed by comparing the lr on the sensitivity curves under the same acwd the sensitivity at each growth period varied with water deficit intensity if there was a mild water deficit soybean yield formation was more sensitive to the deficit when it occurred during the seedling stage but if the defict was relatively serious yield formation became more sensitive when it happened during the flowering podding stage however seed formation was not highly sensitive to water deficit during the branching stage in conclusion the sensitivity results suggested that it is crucial to strictly control the water deficit intensity during the seedling stage and ensure an adequate water supply during the reproductive growth period especially during the flowering and pod enlargement stage for guaranteeing a high soybean yield the results obtained in this pot experiment should be further evaluated under field conditions when soil water content can be controlled accurately especially for severe drought pattern declarations of interest

hefei 230009 china school of civil engineering hefei university of technology hefei 230009 china corresponding author crop drought loss sensitivity assessment is fundamental for managing agricultural drought risk potted soybean water deficit experiments with different irrigation treatments during two seasons 2015 and 2016 were conducted in china s huaibei plain s shaped soybean drought loss sensitivity curves at four growth periods were established and the sensitivity of seed formation to water deficit during different stages was quantitatively compared the results indicated that the negative effects of water deficit during the flowering podding and seed filling stages on yield formation were greater than those during the branching and seedling stages similarly aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight both reached the minimum when soybeans encountered a severe water deficit during the seed filling stage according to the parameters of the sensitivity curve the seed yield loss was the greatest when soybeans experienced severe drought stress during the flowering podding stage in addition soybean tolerance to drought during the seedling stage was relatively weak moreover the sensitivity at each growth period varied with water deficit intensity if there was a mild water defict soybean yield formation was more sensitive to the deficit when it occurred during the seedling stage however if the deficit was relatively serious yield formation became more sensitive when it happened during the flowering podding stage therefore it is crucial to strictly control the water deficit intensity during the seedling stage and ensure an adequate water supply during the reproductive growth period especially during the flowering and pod enlargement stage for guaranteeing a high soybean yield keywords agricultural drought risk curve assessment sensitivity to water deficit drought loss vulnerability risk formation process 1 introduction drought is a natural phenomenon consisting of a long term water deficit at any link in the hydrologic cycle and it becomes a disaster only when it generates negative impacts on the growth of crops and vegetations the production and the life of humans or the function of the ecological environment dai et al 2004 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007 wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 however drought is difficult to study because of its complexity chang et al 2016 yin et al 2014 moreover with global climate change and local drying tendencies drought has been occurring frequently around the world and its adverse effects are simultaneously being aggravated fontaine and steinemann 2009 mishra and singh 2011 drought is a serious natural disaster that severely affects agricultural production and directly threatens national food security in china leng et al 2015 the average annual grain losses caused by drought reached up to 25 9 billion kilograms during 1990 2014 mwrc the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2014 which was close to the annual food requirement for 60 million people qin et al 2015 in recent years extreme droughts have occurred more frequently such as the winter spring drought in southwest china during 2009 2010 and the summer drought in the huai river basin in june 2012 in short china is subject to an increasing drought risk with a changing environment chang et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 risk assessment is an effective means for managing extreme weather and climate events ipcc 2012 an accurate understanding and quantitative assessment of drought risk can improve the capacity to cope with drought disasters and thus reduce agricultural loss wilhite et al 2007 from the perspective of natural disaster system theory shi 2002 disaster risk r can be considered a complex system that consists of disaster inducing factor hazard h and disaster effected body vulnerability v expressed as r f h v dalezios et al 2014 un isdr united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2004 yue et al 2018 furthermore many scholars and institutions consistently agree that vulnerability is made up of three basic components sensitivity exposure and the capacity to cope with adverse effects adger 2006 smit and wandel 2006 specific to agricultural drought crop drought loss vulnerability v can also be expressed through a compound function of crop drought loss sensitivity s crop exposure to a drought environment e and anthropogenic measures to alleviate drought intensity or decrease crop losses for instance by determining effective irrigation amount and time during a drought period a jin et al 2016 however as the most foundational element for building vulnerability function and an essential link converting drought event to grain losses wu et al 2017 the connotation and quantified method of sensitivity have not been explicitly expressed which limits the quantitative assessment and control of agricultural drought risk wang et al 2013 therefore it is fundamental to accurately define and evaluate crop drought loss sensitivity menoni et al 2012 un isdr 2004 yin et al 2014 crop drought loss sensitivity should be an attribute of crop itself it reflects the response of crop growth to drought stress many studies have established the relationship between water consumption or crop evapotranspiration at each growth stage and crop yield based on a crop water production function method and then compared the sensitivity of crop yield formation to water deficit during different stages through sensitivity coefficients igbadun et al 2007 smilovic et al 2016 however the responses of crop growth to different degrees of water deficit during a given stage are not the same this method may not be able to reflect the variation of sensitivity with the deficit intensity based on the coefficients alone a damage curve has been used to quantitatively evaluate the disaster losses under different hazard intensities and can provide a reference for assessing sensitivity recently some scholars have established a quantitative relationship between drought intensity and the corresponding crop yield loss for evaluating crop drought loss vulnerability jia et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yin et al 2014 these vulnerability curves have led to a breakthrough in agricultural drought risk assessment but there have been no studies of sensitivity curves in addition the existing vulnerability curves were established by setting assumed drought or irrigation scenarios and simulating crop yield formation through a crop model nevertheless actual crop growth process under drought stress are complex and should be further clarified to this end it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate crop drought loss sensitivity based on damage curves and practical crop water deficit experiments soybean glycine max l merrill is an important food and oil crop in china liu et al 2008 and also a substantial source of high quality protein and fat for humans wei et al 2015 with the development of the economy and improvements in living conditions the demand for soybeans has gradually increased meanwhile it is likely that a serious water scarcity period will develop in the near future water deficit negatively affects soybean production and the magnitude is not only determined by the deficit intensity but is also related to the growth stage when the deficit occurs dogan et al 2007 sincik et al 2008 huaibei plain is a leading production region for high protein soybean in china and soybeans are primarily planted in the summer however the huaibei plain is located in a typical semi arid and sub humid monsoon region with non uniform spatial and temporal precipitation distributions in addition the temperatures in the summer are high thus agricultural drought occurs frequently during the soybean growth period in this area therefore identifying the sensitivity of soybean yield formation to water deficit at each growth period based on a sensitivity curve is important for formulating reasonable irrigation schedules and effective measures to reduce soybean production loss caused by drought in this study to provide sufficient samples of actual soybean growth losses under various drought patterns for building sensitivity curves two seasonal potted soybean experiments with different irrigation conditions at each single growth stage were conducted in the huaibei plain to 1 evaluate the effects of water deficit at each stage on soybean yield characteristics 2 establish the quantitative relationship between the accumulated water deficit intensity and the corresponding seed yield loss rate for each stage creating a soybean drought loss sensitivity curve and 3 quantitatively compare the sensitivity of soybean seed formation to a given water deficit intensity during different growth stages based on the sensitivity curves 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in pots at the xinmaqiao agricultural irrigation research station water resources research institute of anhui province and huaihe river commission p r china which is located in bengbu north of the huai river latitude 33 09 n longitude 117 22 e altitude 19 7 m fig 1 this research site has a typical northern subtropical and warm temperate transition zone climate the annual precipitation is unevenly distributed over the years and drought disasters are common in this area the experiments were both implemented from june to september in 2015 and 2016 and the actual monthly climatic conditions during these periods are shown in table 1 2 2 crop management soybeans were planted in pots with an upper diameter of 28 cm a bottom diameter of 20 cm and a height of 27 cm with 15 kg of air dried soil added to every empty pot in the 2015 season however in 2016 the upper diameter bottom diameter and height of the pots were changed to 31 cm 23 cm and 27 cm respectively while the amount of air dried soil increased to 17 kg all empty pots were weighed before loading the air dried soil the experimental soil was collected from a field tillage layer at this station and was a typical shajiang black soil from the huaibei plain its upper layer 0 50 cm characteristics are shown in table 2 to ensure the germination of the soybean seeds the soil water content in each pot was irrigated to field capacity after sowing along with 4 g of compound fertilizer n 15 p2o5 15 k2o 15 all soybean pots were placed in an open environment under a movable shed that was closed when precipitation occurred fig 1 the soil water decreased with the soybean evapotranspiration and was supplied only by irrigation during the experimental period except for irrigation other crop management practices such as weeding and pest control were the same for all pot samples during the 2015 season soybean seeds cv zhonghuang 13 were sown on june 20 and did not all germinate until july 3 then irrigation treatments were implemented on july 4 and soybeans were harvested on september 20 in 2016 the same seeds were sown on june 29 and treatments were conducted from july 15 to september 27 according to the soybean planting density in field around the huaibei plain each pot retained three plants combining relevant studies on soybean growth stages desclaux et al 2000 dogan et al 2007 with years of practical soybean growth records in this station the soybean whole growth period was divided into four stages in both seasons table 3 2 3 experimental design in the experiments nine irrigation treatments eight deficit irrigation treatments and one full irrigation treatment were conducted for both seasons table 4 in order to assess and compare the influences of drought stress at different periods on soybean production deficit irrigation at each single growth stage was designed moreover irrigation treatments were implemented by setting different lower limits of soil water content in the pots during four stages based on the previous research desclaux et al 2000 sincik et al 2008 and years of crop deficit irrigation experiments in this station three lower limits of soil water content were set which corresponded to no water deficit 75 of field capacity slight water deficit 55 of field capacity and serious water deficit 35 of field capacity respectively in addition to reflect the response of soybean growth to water deficit process to be close to the actual irrigation in crop production and to guarantee soybean survival soybeans were irrigated to 90 of field capacity once the soil water dropped below the lower limit chen et al 2013 the irrigation amount and times during each soybean growth stage under different irrigation treatments are shown in table 5 in detail slight and serious water deficits were set up during the soybean seedling stage stage i the branching stage stage ii the flowering podding stage stage iii and the seed filling stage stage iv and were referred to as t1 t8 no water deficit was set up during the whole growth period which was referred to as ck for both seasons tables 3 and 4 considering the influence of soybean growth on calculating soil water content the plant weight at the end of the previous stage should be subtracted from the pot weight during the current stage accordingly except for the soybean pots used to measure the yield characteristics at harvest five replications for t1 t8 during both seasons fifteen and five replications for ck in the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively additional pots were arranged for measuring the plant weight at the end of stages i ii and iii specifically three entire plants in a pot were taken out from five replications and weighed at the end of each stage in ck for t1 t6 the plants were taken out and weighed only from the stage of water deficit however the plant weights at the end of each stage before the water deficit in t3 t8 were replaced by the corresponding results in ck therefore in both seasons a total of twenty replications for t1 and t2 fifteen replications for t3 and t4 ten replications for t5 and t6 and five replications for t7 and t8 were set respectively in addition there were respectively thirty and twenty replications in total for ck in the 2015 and 2016 seasons during the two seasons soybean pots were both arranged in a completely randomized experimental design fig 1 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 pot weight wj is the weight of a soybean pot on day j after seed germination kg which was measured with an electronic balance yp30kn shanghai sunny hengping scientific instrument co ltd china all pots were weighed at 6 p m from seed germination to plant harvest 2 4 2 soil water content the soil water content in each soybean pot was calculated according to its weight as follows 1 θ j b w j 1 w s w p i j w s 2 θ j e w j w s w p w s 3 θ j θ j b θ j e 2 where θj b is the soil water content in a soybean pot at the beginning of day j immediately after irrigation g g 1 of soil dry weight θj e is the soil water content at the end of day j when weighing the pot g g 1 of soil dry weight θj is the mean soil water content on day j g g 1 of soil dry weight w s is the weight of air dried soil that was added to the pot before planting kg w p is the weight of an empty pot kg and ij is the irrigation amount for the pot on day j kg to reduce the error caused by the weight of soybean plant in the soil water content calculation three entire plants in a pot were taken out from five replications and weighed with an electronic balance td30k 0 1 tianjin balance instrument co ltd china at the end of stages i ii and iii respectively then the average plant weight of these five results was subtracted from the pot weight during the corresponding next stage 2 4 3 irrigation amount whether the soybean plants needed to be irrigated was determined by comparing the soil water content in a pot and its corresponding lower limit the irrigation amount was calculated as follows 4 i j 0 θ j 1 e θ lm 90 θ f c θ j 1 e w s θ j 1 e θ lm where θ fc is the soil water at field capacity g g 1 of soil dry weight θj 1 e is the soil water content in a pot at the end of day j 1 g g 1 of soil dry weight and θ lm is the lower limit of soil water content for irrigation treatment of the pot g g 1 of soil dry weight in this experiment soybean plants were irrigated to 90 of θ fc on day j when θj 1 e was lower than θ lm the irrigation amount was metered by measurement and implemented at 7 a m 2 4 4 crop evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration of soybean in each pot was calculated according to its weight and irrigation amount as follows 5 e t c j w j 1 i j w j where etc j is the evapotranspiration of soybean on day j it could be converted to millimeter mm from kilogram kg according to the density of water and the area at the top of the pot 2 4 5 seed yield and drought loss soybean seed yield aboveground biomass stem leaf pod and seed and seed number of three plants in each pot were measured at harvest time in both seasons and the 1000 seed weight was calculated seed yield and aboveground biomass were both measured with an electronic balance td30k 0 1 tianjin balance instrument co ltd china after drying in the sun seed yield loss caused by drought under each irrigation treatment was calculated as follows 6 l r i max y i y i max y i 100 where lri is the soybean seed yield drought loss rate in pot i yi is the seed yield in pot i t ha 1 and max yi is the maximum seed yield among all experimental pots t ha 1 2 4 6 data analysis statistical analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the effects of different irrigation treatments on soybean production differences between means were evaluated for significance using the least significant differences lsd test at p 0 05 level average values of seed yield aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight of all replications under each treatment were analyzed in the 2015 and 2016 seasons all statistical procedures were performed using version 3 3 2 of r software the r foundation for statistical computing austria the parameters in the soybean drought loss sensitivity curve equations were solved using an accelerating genetic algorithm aga in matlab version r2014a software the mathworks inc usa and the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to determine the goodness of fit 2 5 crop water deficit identification based on run theory in this study a crop water deficit event was considered to occur once the soil water content was lower than the lower limit of the most suitable value for crop growth combining with the run theory nam et al 2015 two thresholds θ ms and θ ls that represented the most and least suitable soil water contents for crop growth were set respectively and the detailed process of crop water deficit identification is shown in fig 2 fig 2 represents an example with three crop water deficit events during the crop growth period and the shaded area indicates the water deficit intensity of each event correspondingly a crop water deficit index cwd was proposed to quantitatively describe the deficit intensity in this study based on the soil water deficit index swd patanè and cosentino 2010 combining with the identification process in fig 2 the cwd was calculated as follows 7 c w d j 1 θ j θ ls θ ms θ j θ ms θ ls θ ls θ j θ ms 0 θ j θ ms 8 a c w d j 1 n c w d j where cwdj is the crop water deficit intensity on day j during a given growth stage acwd is the accumulated crop water deficit intensity during this stage and n is the number of days at this stage referring to relevant experimental designs and research achievements chen et al 2013 sincik et al 2008 and years of crop deficit irrigation experiments in this station it was found that the water condition in the soil could be highly suitable for crop growth when the soil water content merely reached 75 of θ fc not 100 in addition the plants could hardly absorb water from soil when the soil water content was below the wilting point therefore θ ls and θ ms in eq 7 were set at θ wp the soil water at wilting point g g 1 of soil dry weight and 75 of θ fc in this study respectively cwd ranged between 0 when θ was higher than or equal to 75 of θ fc and 1 when θ was lower than or equal to θ wp and the larger the value of cwd the more serious the crop water deficit 2 6 crop drought loss sensitivity curve in this study the crop drought loss sensitivity was studied from the perspective of drought stress during a single crop growth stage and then the sensitivity function at a given stage was described as the quantitative relationship between the crop water deficit intensity during this stage and the corresponding crop growth loss in a completely exposed environment and without any anthropogenic measures to reduce crop losses such as irrigation during a drought period furthermore the size of the crop growth sensitivity to a given degree of water deficit was the loss under this deficit intensity obviously this sensitivity varied with the drought intensity during the crop growth period which differed from the sensitivity coefficient in the crop water production function in addition the relationship between sensitivity and vulnerability is shown in fig 3 assuming that the crop was fully exposed to a drought environment and irrigation was the main anthropogenic measure the vulnerability function at a given stage should be the relationship between the crop water deficit intensity during this stage without irrigation and the crop growth loss in a given irrigation scheme therefore the vulnerability function reflected the decreased crop losses due to the irrigation relative to the sensitivity function under the same deficit intensity in other words the vulnerability function could be considered as a set of sensitivity functions in various irrigation patterns referring to the formation mechanism of drought risk jin et al 2016 shi 2002 and the current vulnerability curve research jia et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yin et al 2014 a soybean drought loss sensitivity curve at a given growth stage was established to fit the accumulated crop water deficit intensity acwd at this stage and the corresponding seed yield loss rate lr based on the logistic function in this study the sensitivity curve equation at a given stage was expressed as follows 9 l r a c w d l r max 1 α ex p β a c w d where lr acwd is the soybean seed yield loss rate function that varies with the accumulated crop water deficit intensity at a given stage that is the soybean drought loss sensitivity curve lrmax α and β are the parameters of sensitivity curve lrmax represents the maximum loss rate under drought conditions on the premise of plant survival α lrmax lr 0 1 lr 0 is the seed yield loss rate caused by other random factors rather than drought and it indicates the extent of variation in seed yield loss and β reflects the speed to reach lrmax where the larger the value of β the faster the speed chen et al 2015 expatiated a three phase s shaped logistic damage curve to quantitatively assess water induced disaster losses therefore based on this curve and relevant research on other natural hazard damage curves colombi et al 2008 dutta et al 2003 lee and rosowsky 2005 a three phase s shaped soybean drought loss sensitivity curve at a given growth stage was proposed and is shown in fig 4 there were three inflection points that depicted the variations of the sensitivity curve and they divided the curve into three phases a inflection point a was the point at which the change rate of the slope of the sensitivity curve was the largest or the increasing speed of lr grew the fastest this point was referred to as the drought disaster inducing point from point a lr rapidly increased along with acwd and the influence of drought began to spread therefore point a was an important indication for drought warnings according to the logistic function the third derivative at point a was zero therefore the corresponding acwd was calculated as follows 10 acw d a ln 2 3 α β b inflection point b was the point at which the slope of the sensitivity curve was the largest and indicated the fastest increasing speed of lr therefore this point was called the drought disaster breaking point at point b lr reached 50 of lrmax it was vital to avoid attaining acwdb during this period providing a reference for developing an irrigation strategy to reduce drought loss the second derivative at point b was zero therefore the corresponding acwd was calculated as follows 11 acw d b ln α β c inflection point c was the point at which the increasing speed of lr decreased the fastest and this point was called the drought disaster ceasing point when the increasing speed of lr became very small the crop water deficit intensity and its effect on seed formation were both close to their respective upper limits for guaranteeing the soybeans survival similarly the third derivative at point c was also zero but the corresponding acwd was obtained as follows 12 acw d c ln 2 3 α β 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop water deficit cwd fig 5 shows the daily trends of crop water deficit cwd and irrigation during each soybean growth stage under different irrigation treatments in the 2015 and 2016 seasons cwd increased with a decrease in soil water content reflecting the daily water deficit during the soybean growth process and the higher the cwd the more serious the deficit at each stage cwd was the largest under a serious water deficit condition the soil water content gradually decreased to the lower limit with the soybean evapotranspiration then it increased to 90 of θ fc after irrigation and the cwd changed accordingly moreover the average days required for reaching the lower limit of soil water content for serious water deficit conditions during four growth stages were obviously longer table 6 cwd during stages iii and iv fluctuated more frequently especially in ck treatment cwd was related to the soybean water consumption soybean evapotranspiration under a no water deficit condition was larger than those under drought conditions table 6 in addition the average daily evapotranspiration of soybean during the reproductive growth phase stages iii and iv in this study was relatively stronger than that during the vegetative growth phase stages i and ii table 6 the soil water content in ck was frequently lower than 75 of θ fc and the corresponding cwd was not equal to 0 due to strong soybean evapotranspiration table 6 in addition the soil water content occasionally started to increase although it had not reached the lower limit especially under a serious water deficit condition during stages iii and iv t6 and t8 this was because the soybean plants which had wilted for three or four days were watered to 90 of θ fc to ensure their survival in this study similar results were found by chen et al 2013 in a solar greenhouse study and patanè and cosentino 2010 in an open field experiment patanè and cosentino 2010 used a soil water deficit index swd to quantify the water deficit intensity during the tomato growth period however the cwd in this study further indicated that the most suitable soil water content for crop growth did not have to be θ fc but could range from 75 of θ fc to θ fc montoya et al 2017 wei et al 2015 in other words a crop water deficit event occurred when the soil water content was below 75 of θ fc rather than θ fc 3 2 yield characteristics table 7 shows the soybean yield characteristics under different irrigation treatments in the 2015 and 2016 seasons there were significant differences in seed yield among treatments for both seasons p 0 001 the water deficit negatively affected the soybean seed formation and the seed yield loss increased with acwd at each growth stage for example compared to ck the seed yield was reduced by 13 0 and 17 7 in t3 the average acwd values were 3 24 and 2 17 for the two seasons and the values were 23 4 and 43 3 respectively in t4 the average acwd values were 8 85 and 6 01 table 7 similarly sincik et al 2008 found that the full irrigation treatment had the highest soybean seed yield while the deficit irrigation treatments 25 50 and 75 of full irrigation treatments resulted in a 11 7 27 4 reduction in field studies in addition earlier studies also reported that water stress throughout the soybean growth period would cause seed decreases under field conditions dogan et al 2007 egli and bruening 2004 however the overall seed yield loss caused by a water deficit during different growth stages differed greatly compared to ck the seed yield was reduced by 14 2 2015 season and 28 0 2016 season the average reduction in t1 and t2 18 2 and 30 5 the average reduction in t3 and t4 53 1 and 56 2 the average reduction in t5 and t6 and 50 1 and 45 2 the average reduction in t7 and t8 when the plants were subjected to a deficit at stages i ii iii and iv obviously the negative effects of drought stress during stages iii and iv on soybean seed formation were relatively greater these results were in agreement with dogan et al 2007 who reported that the soybean yield reductions without irrigation at the stages of full seed beginning of pod formation and beginning of seed formation were 50 33 and 31 respectively of those with full irrigation in a field circumstance correspondingly in our study stage iii consisted of the flowering and pod enlargement processes and stage iv corresponded to the seed filling period similar results were also reported by desclaux et al 2000 in a pot study and foroud et al 1993 in a field experiment those studies found that soybeans at the reproductive period had a greater potential production sensitivity to water deficit while deficit at the vegetative period did not significantly affect the yield components in addition the order of seed yield loss under the same water deficit conditions during different stages was not constant it changed with the degree of deficit for instance compared to ck the seed yield declined by 24 3 in t5 which was lower than that in t7 however the yield was reduced by 81 9 in t6 which was obviously higher than that in t8 during the 2015 season similarly in 2016 the seed yield was reduced by 17 7 in t3 which was less than that in t1 while it declined by 43 2 in t4 which was larger than that in t2 table 7 therefore to reasonably compare the effects of a water deficit on soybean seed formation during different growth stages it is necessary to calculate the seed yield loss under the same deficit intensity there were also significant differences in aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight among treatments for the two seasons p 0 001 and their drought losses both increased with acwd the aboveground biomass under water deficit conditions during stage iv were both the lowest in 2015 and 2016 and declined by 38 7 and 36 6 the average decline in t7 and t8 compared to ck similarly the 1000 seed weight under drought stress during stage iv was the smallest for both seasons which were reduced by 31 5 and 31 6 compared to ck dogan et al 2007 found that the soybean biomass and 1000 seed weight under no irrigation during the stage of full seed declined by 33 0 and 13 4 compared with full irrigation in a field environment however these two reductions were lower than those observed in our study which may be due to the different degrees of water deficit or different soybean cultivars meanwhile our finding was consistent with that of desclaux et al 2000 who discovered that there was no clear single seed weight reduction when soybeans encountered two levels of drought stress irrigation was withheld until the soil water content in pot reached either 30 or 50 of plant available water during all growth periods except for the seed filling stage 3 3 soybean drought loss sensitivity curves during four growth stages in this study three linear logarithmic and s shaped logistic functions were used to fit the quantitative relationship between acwd at each soybean growth stage and the corresponding lr the results are shown in fig 6 and the functional parameters are listed in table 8 the r 2 of the s shaped curves during the four stages were relatively higher and this curve had a clear physical meaning therefore it was more suitable to depict the variations of soybean seed yield loss with drought intensity furthermore the yield loss under different intensities during each stage could be quantitatively assessed based on the logistic functional equations in table 8 although some scholars have established the vulnerability curves through a crop model jia et al 2012 wang et al 2013 yin et al 2014 the curve in this study further clarifies and quantifies the sensitivity from the perspective of a practical crop water deficit experiment moreover as an application of the three phase damage curve in agricultural drought field based on the research of chen et al 2015 this sensitivity curve can be used as a transition function to build vulnerability and then loss risk curves there were similar variations in s shaped sensitivity curves during the same growth stage for the two seasons the largest lrmax values among all stages for both seasons was observed during stage iii 83 87 and 74 49 in table 8 this finding implied that the seed yield loss was the greatest if the soybeans experienced a serious water deficit at stage iii therefore it was necessary to guarantee the water supply at this period the lowest lrmax values were achieved at stage i 22 33 and 38 44 which indicated that the yield loss was relatively small if the plants suffered from a severe water deficit during stage i this finding was consistent with the studies that found a moderate water deficit during the soybean vegetative growth phase for a short time would not reduce the yield components by desclaux et al 2000 in a pot experiment and oya et al 2004 in a field environment in addition the highest β values were found during stage i 1 89 and 1 56 implying that the yield loss rate would approach the lrmax of this stage if the soybeans suffered from very slight drought stress in other words the tolerance to drought for seed formation during stage i was relatively weak thus the water deficit intensity should be strictly controlled if deficit irrigation was conducted during this period the smallest β values were observed at stage iv 0 60 and 0 69 meaning that the tolerance to drought at this stage was relatively strong taking the sensitivity curve at stage ii in the 2015 season fig 6a as an example in the initial phase the increasing speed of lr grew slowly until acwd reached 1 28 acwda table 9 from point a the curve entered the developing phase and the speed increased sharply indicating that the negative impact of drought stress at this stage on seed formation expanded quickly the maximum speed was achieved when acwd reached 2 63 acwdb and the corresponding lr was equal to 13 84 50 of lrmax lrmax 27 67 in table 8 next the increasing speed of lr decreased gradually and the curve entered the declining phase when acwd reached 3 99 acwdc 3 4 comparison of soybean seed formation sensitivity to water deficit during different growth stages fig 7 shows the soybean seed yield drought loss sensitivity curves during four single growth stages in the 2015 and 2016 seasons according to the conception of sensitivity in this study the sensitivity of soybean seed formation to water deficit at a given stage varied with the deficit intensity therefore to quantitatively compare the sensitivity during different growth periods it was necessary to contrast the amount of lr on the sensitivity curves at the four stages under the same acwd there were two major boundaries on the sensitivity curves in the 2015 season fig 7a when acwd was less than 1 86 lr at stage i was equal to that at stage iii when acwd reached 1 86 lr at stage i was the largest among the four stages under the same acwd and the seed yield loss or sensitivity ranked from large to small was in the order of stage i stage iii stage iv and stage ii however when acwd was greater than 3 66 lr at stage i was equal to that at stage iv when acwd reached 3 66 lr at stage iii became the largest and the order changed to stage iii stage iv stage ii and stage i similarly there were also two main boundaries in the 2016 season fig 7b and the sequence of sensitivity from large to small was stage i stage iii stage ii and stage iv when acwd was less than 2 75 lr at stage i was equal to that at stage iii when acwd approached 2 75 however the sequence became stage iii stage iv stage ii and stage i when acwd was higher than 5 37 lr at stage ii was equal to that at stage iv when acwd approached 5 37 our findings of soybean yield formation sensitivity to water deficit were basically in agreement with wang et al 2014 who studied the sensitivity based on a soybean pot experiment and the jensen model which is a static crop water production function however the sensitivity in our study was defined for a given water deficit intensity the sensitivity results for both seasons were mostly consistent if there was a mild water deficit soybean seed formation was more sensitive to the deficit when it occurred during stage i but if the deficit was relatively serious seed formation became more sensitive when it happened during stage iii however seed formation was not highly sensitive to water deficit during stage ii whatever the deficit degree similarly many studies under field conditions have reported that soybeans are more susceptible to water deficit during the beginning of flowering through the beginning of seed formation dogan et al 2007 foroud et al 1993 moreover early drought during the vegetative period primarily decreases the biomass and internode length desclaux et al 2000 drought during the flowering stage reduces the number of pods and seed size and seed size will significantly decline if drought occurs in the late flowering and pod filling stages egli and bruening 2004 oya et al 2004 the degree of seed yield loss caused by a slight water deficit during the seedling stage was serious probably because the soybean tolerance to drought at this period may be relatively weak therefore measures for protecting seeds from severe drought stress at the seedling stage should be implemented in actual soybean production in addition soybeans may be able to recover from the stress during the seedling stage and return to normal growth after re watering during the next stages which guarantees the seed yield soybeans may have a certain level of tolerance to drought after normal growth at the seedling stage therefore mild drought stress during the next stages will not significantly affect the yield formation nevertheless at the flowering and pod enlargement stage stage iii in our study soybean vegetative and reproductive growth both proceed and water consumption approaches the maximum xu et al 2003 the pod and seed formation will be seriously obstructed if the plants encounter a severe water deficit therefore it is vital to ensure the water supply during this period for a high yield 4 conclusions water deficit negatively affected soybean seed formation and seed yield loss increased with the accumulated crop water deficit intensity during each growth stage however the loss caused by a water deficit at different stages differed greatly the effects of drought stress during the flowering podding and the seed filling stages on yield formation were greater than those during the branching and seedling stages similarly the losses of aboveground biomass and 1000 seed weight also increased with the deficit intensity and they both reached their respective maximum when soybeans suffered from a severe water deficit during the seed filling stage s shaped logistic soybean drought loss sensitivity curves during four growth stages were established to fit the quantitative relationship between the accumulated crop water deficit intensity acwd at a given stage and the corresponding seed yield loss rate lr according to the curve parameters the negative impact on seed formation was the greatest when soybeans encountered severe drought stress during the flowering podding stage therefore it was necessary to guarantee the water supply at this period in addition when soybeans suffered from a slight water deficit at the seedling stage the seed yield loss approached the maximum for ensuring plant survival during this period therefore soybean tolerance to drought during the seedling stage was relatively weak and the deficit intensity should be strictly controlled if deficit irrigation is conducted at this stage the sensitivity of soybean seed formation to water deficit during different stages was quantitatively assessed by comparing the lr on the sensitivity curves under the same acwd the sensitivity at each growth period varied with water deficit intensity if there was a mild water deficit soybean yield formation was more sensitive to the deficit when it occurred during the seedling stage but if the defict was relatively serious yield formation became more sensitive when it happened during the flowering podding stage however seed formation was not highly sensitive to water deficit during the branching stage in conclusion the sensitivity results suggested that it is crucial to strictly control the water deficit intensity during the seedling stage and ensure an adequate water supply during the reproductive growth period especially during the flowering and pod enlargement stage for guaranteeing a high soybean yield the results obtained in this pot experiment should be further evaluated under field conditions when soil water content can be controlled accurately especially for severe drought pattern declarations of interest

11224,introducing low quality water to micro irrigation system comes up with higher risk of emitter clogging and affects its practical applications in fields assessment of major components growth process of clogging substances and its influence on clogging to reveal the clogging mechanism become unavoidable a drip irrigation experiment with four irrigation and flushing treatments was conducted to study the chemical precipitates dynamic variations of chemical precipitates in clogging substances 8 types of flat emitters subjected and clogging samples were collected when emitter clogging degrees reached 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 respectively x ray diffractometer was applied to identify the mineral components the results showed that both chemical and physical clogging occurred in all 4 operation modes and the primary chemical precipitates such as quartz and silicate muscovite alkali feldspar chlorite and carbonate dolomite calcite were found in emitter clogging substances at the end of the experiment their quantity accounted for more than 98 flushing treatment would slow down the accumulation of clogging substances in emitters although mixing these two water sources in same volume was equal to reduce the sediment and salinity concentrations to a half the clogging degrees did not reduce as much as expected on the other hand positive linear correlations were observed between all three kinds of chemical precipitates and the clogging degrees in which relative radius a1 2 l and mean velocity of flow path cross section v showed significant impact and thus affected the dynamic growth of chemical precipitates in clogging substances keywords micro irrigation clogging chemical precipitation high sediment water surface saline water 1 introduction emitter is the sensitive component of the drip irrigation system due to its narrow flow path sized 0 5 1 2 mm to meet the energy dissipation requirements consequently vulnerable to be clogged if the water source contains particles chemical precipitations dissolved organic matter microorganisms and other impurities megh 2012 madramootto and morrison 2013 however using low quality water including high sediment water surface saline water reclaimed water and micro polluted surface water has become an effective way to overcome the water scarcity especially in china s northwestern arid region yellow river water and other high sediment water are commonly used for irrigation the high sediment content or higher ca2 and mg2 loads in the low quality water are easy to couple with the microorganisms organic matters and resulted in drip irrigation emitter clogging emitter clogging would directly affect the irrigation uniformity and the service life of system li et al 2009 liu and huang 2009 zhou et al 2016 therefore understanding the mechanism of drip irrigation emitter clogging using low quality water sources is critical to control the formation of clogging substances effectively among multiple factors water quality is the most important factor that directly affect clogging substances growth and the chemical precipitates varied dramatically when applying different water sources taylor et al 1995 bozkurt and ozekici 2006 shinde et al 2012 different studies had explored the mechanisms of emitter clogging those were typically regarded as physical taylor et al 1995 bounoua et al 2016 chemical pitts et al 1990 zhangzhong et al 2016 and biological zhou et al 2013 2017 clogging using different types of water among them chemical clogging was considered to be the most difficult to be controlled due to the diversity of ions and various coupling effects earlier studies demonstrated the clogging with high sediment drip irrigation is a typical physical clogging bounoua et al 2016 however there are multiply ions in water source co3 2 po4 3 so4 2 sio3 2 oh fe3 fe2 mn2 ca2 s2 etc and they can easily interact and form chemical precipitates feigin et al 1991 tried to explore the correlations between ca2 and mg2 precipitations and chemical clogging and reported that the irrigation water with higher ca2 and mg2 loads were more likely to cause chemical clogging yet no conclusion whether chemical clogging occurred in drip irrigation system using water with high sediments therefore it is important to identify the chemical precipitates and figure out the clogging mechanism and influential pathway based on these the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the dynamic variation of chemical precipitates in the clogging substances in the drip irrigation system using water with high sediment and salt loads 2 reveal the mechanism of chemical precipitates and their impacts on the clogging process through the quantitative correlations and influential path established 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a field experiment with four operation modes was conducted at the irrigation experimental station located at ulanbuhe arid area in bayinaoer inner mongolia china 106 98 e 40 39 n the four operation irrigation and flushing treatments included high sediment water from yellow river without hsw and with hsw f lateral flushing surface saline water brought in from a local lake with lateral flushing ssw f and mixing these two water sources in equal volume ratio with lateral flushing mxw f table 1 the laterals were flushed every 60 h with constant flushing velocity of 0 45 m s controlling by the precise adjusting valves and the flushing was applied with same water as water source used in each operation mode four chamber of drip irrigation testing systems running simultaneously were set up for four different operation modes fig 1 each operation system consisted of two subunits and each subunit had four layers each chamber was capable to examine eight type of emitters table 2 at the same time the 15 m long and 16 mm in internal diameter drip lines were used in addition every drip line was facilitated with eight replicates which were later used for sampling at different operation time the emitters along the laterals at constant spacing of 30 cm were marked no 1 50 from the inlet to the outlet of the lateral to keep the inlet pressure at 0 1 mpa the shunt principle was adopted to control the water supply the system was operated from july 1 2015 to october 3 2015 the system was accumulatively operated for 855 h 9 h per day on daily schedule of 7 00 am 12 00 pm and 2 00 pm 6 00 pm the water temperature was recorded daily at 10 00 am using thermometer type o 264wt range 10 300 accuracy 1 between 10 and 100 manufacturer dretec japan and the results are shown in fig 2 2 2 sampling and testing methods the weighing method was applied to measure the outflow of each emitter every 36 h along with the water temperature and then the outflow data were calibrated by temperature modification model as equation 1 pei et al 2014 1 q i t q t i 57 35 x 28 24 100 t i 20 10 q i 0 where q i t indicates the outflows after the temperature modification l h 1 q i 0 indicates the initial outflow targeted to be tested at 20 iso 2003 which is measured before the experiment l h 1 x is the flow index of the emitters which is offered by the manufacturer or measured before the experiment ti is the water temperature tested q t i indicates the outflow tested under ti l h 1 then the dra was calculated using equation 2 to represent emitter clogging degree cd which was calculated with equation 3 2 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 3 cd 100 dra where n is the number of emitters tested and the other parameters are the same with those in equation 1 when dra reduced to 95 90 85 80 75 70 60 50 of the initial flow one lateral with the most similar dra in each operation mode was selected for sampling and 5 emitters closed to the targeted clogging degree were cut off from the head no 1 10 middle no 21 30 and tail part no 41 50 of the drip lines respectively in total 15 emitter samples were put in the bags and 20 ml deionized water was added to remove the clogging substances for 60 min using the ultrasonic cleaner manufacture chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz the solid phrase acquired in bottom was dried out and then grinded evenly and tested by the x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance to get the polycrystalline diffraction patterns the diffractometer worked with voltage of 40 kv and electric current of 40 ma cu was applied as the target and the wave length was 1 5406 å then the patterns were analyzed by the topas software to obtain the mineral contents and components of the clogging substances 2 3 statistical analysis according to the results of zhou et al 2017 the average cross sectional velocity v was significantly correlated to anti clogging ability of emitter in this paper we integrated two dimensionless parameters w d and a1 2 l based on the combination of geometrical parameters including flow path length l width w depth d cross sectional area a then the pearson analysis was applied to study the correlations among these three parameters chemical precipitations including quartz silicate and carbonate and clogging degrees meanwhile analysis of variance anova was conducted to explore the differences among different types of water sources applied path analysis is an important statistic method to study the correlations among multiple independent variables x1 x2 xp and the responsive variable y and the correlation coefficients are divided into direct impact and indirect impact bhatt 1973 han et al 2003 in this paper the path analysis method was used to study the effects of the dimensionless parameters w d and a1 2 l on primary chemical precipitates meanwhile multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to eliminate the possible multicollinearity between w d and a1 2 l based on the variance inflation factor vif calculated during these processes the significance thresholds of the independent variables were determined at p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively the regression and statistical analysis were carried out using spss ver 20 0 ibm analytics 3 results 3 1 primary chemical precipitates in emitter clogging substances fe1 emitter was exemplified to analyze the polycrystalline diffraction patterns of emitter clogging substances table 3 and the primary precipitates of emitter clogging substances were quartz sio2 muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0 66 o10 oh 2 alkalifeldspar knaalsi3o8 chlorite mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 aragonite caco3 o dolomite camgco3 calcite caco3 r the contents of quartz and muscovite were 43 7 and 10 5 in hsw mode and they also showed high proportions in hsw f mode being 36 8 and 16 2 however in ssw and mxw modes the primary chemical precipitates changed to aragonite and quartz and their proportions were 52 4 16 4 and 36 3 20 4 respectively in all four operating modes the content of sodium chloride and magnetite were less than 1 whose impacts were not considered in the following discussions all the 7 types of mineral components showed linear correlations with the clogging degree table 3 and the first 4 components passed the significant test while partial of the latter three components reach the significant level p 0 05 due to the limitation of precise identification methods and the transformation between different substances the chemical precipitates were divided into quartz silicate and carbonate according to the main chemical elements 3 2 dynamic variations of primary chemical precipitates and their impacts on the clogging degree the dynamic variations of the three primary chemical precipitates that continuously accumulate within emitters as the system operated on daily basis are shown in figs 3 5 according to the average growth rate the whole period could be divided into slow growth stage 0 420 h and rapid growth stage 420 800 h in hsw operation mode quartz accumulation rate was fastest with the average growth rate of 15 4 and the quantity was reached 36 0 200 4 gm 2 which was 50 0 higher than those of silicate and carbonate this was mainly because of its higher sediment content and the silicon minerals became the primary clogging substances in hsw f operation mode the quartz silicate and carbonate varied within 60 8 148 2 gm 2 56 9 154 8 gm 2 43 9 83 2 gm 2 respectively which equaled to 30 3 73 9 32 9 89 5 48 9 92 6 of those in hsw operation mode indeed lateral flushing delayed the chemical precipitates accumulation on the other hand due to the high salinity chemical precipitations occurred more easily in ssw f operation mode at the end of operation the carbonate contents reached 63 0 323 2 gm 2 and the average growth rates were 81 0 and 54 8 larger than the quartz and silicate contents after mixing two water sources the carbonate contents in the mxw f operation mode reduced to 38 4 242 4 gm 2 which were only 60 6 83 9 of those in the ssw f and the average growth rate decreased to 73 8 of that in the ssw f similarly the quartz and silicate contents were merely 30 7 48 8 of those in hsw f while the average growth rate lowered by 32 0 however their total continuous still reached 82 8 and 83 7 of those in hsw f and ssw f respectively without obvious difference according to the anova results obtained in table 4 quartz silicate and carbonate contents showed significantly differences among three different water treatments p 0 05 however lateral flushing treatment did showed significant impact on the accumulation of these three types of chemical precipitates as the anova results between hsw and hsw f treatments failed to reach the significant level p 0 05 on the other hand the three primary chemical precipitates all showed significant positive linear correlations with emitter clogging degrees table 5 3 3 correlations among the primary mineral components considering that the experiment was carried out at temperatures between 15 c and 22 c and at a pressure of 100 kpa sio2 was hard to form in the emitters and it mainly came from the water source therefore taking quartz as the independent variable the accumulation process of silicate and carbonate as dependent variables are plotted in fig 6 the significant linear relations were observed among silicate and quartz contents which indicated a stable variation ratio of silicate content as the system operated the stable variation ratio further revealed that silicate was basically homologous with quartz as they both originated from the water source rather than resulting from chemical reactions during the system operating on the other hand the carbonate content showed significant exponential pattern with quartz content its variation ratio gradually increased with longer operating period therefore carbonate was not only transferred from the water source but also increased due to the chemical reactions 4 discussions 4 1 correlations among primary chemical precipitates of emitter clogging substance the results in this paper demonstrated that the primary chemical precipitates including quartz silicate and carbonate all accumulated continuously under the hsw and hsw f operation modes but varied in proportions their average proportions in water resource were 29 7 47 7 20 1 and both increased to 41 1 37 2 21 7 and 38 9 36 1 25 0 respectively meanwhile silicate showed significant linear correlation with quartz while carbonate had significant exponential pattern with quartz these results confirmed the occurrence of chemical clogging both in hsw and hsw f modes apart from physical clogging in fact there was also biological clogging under these two conditions and different components of clogging substances were more likely to interact gao et al 2011 wang et al 2014 meanwhile the biological excretion could catalyze the chemical precipitations and thus enhancing the physical and chemical clogging process therefore the lateral flushing could effectively reduce the deposition of clogging substances by washing the sediment agglomeration and adhesion materials out of the drip irrigation system and thus effectively delaying the clogging process in ssw f mode as there were multiple ions such as mg2 ca2 hco3 co3 2 etc the carbonate was generated easily when water ph was high table 1 undoubtedly chemical precipitation was the determinant factor in emitter clogging at the end of the operation the average proportions of quartz silicate and carbonate were 12 9 26 1 and 61 0 respectively after mixing high sediment water and surface saline water mxw f their average proportions changed to 28 0 20 1 and 51 9 respectively the proportion of quartz was lower than that in hsw f and the proportion of carbonate increased their proportions were on the contrary when compared with those in ssw f considering the linear correlations between their proportions and emitter clogging degrees the clogging issue did not slow down as expected this was mainly because the biological clogging probably enhanced due to the evolution of original microbial communities and possibly promoted the coupling effect of physical and chemical clogging however we did not test the amount of quartz silicate and carbonate in the water source to further analyze the correlations and coupling effects 4 2 correlations between chemical precipitates and emitter geometrical parameters furthermore the clogging process was found closely related to the structure parameters of emitters bucks et al 1979 taylor et al 1995 the correlations between the primary chemical precipitates including quartz silicate and carbonate and the emitter flow path parameters are shown in table 6 it is indicated that three primary chemical precipitates were all negatively correlated with the flow path depth d the relative radius a1 2 l width depth ratio w d the initial outflow q and the mean velocity at flow path cross section v besides positive correlations were obtained between these three chemical precipitates and flow path width w and length l although it is not included in table 6 therefore the influential path of a1 2 l and v on the formation of primary chemical precipitates was further studied by the path analysis method the results in table 7 demonstrate that v had significant directly impacts on the sio2 ca2 and mg2 deposition as bi reached 0 81 and 0 82 respectively although the direct contribution of a1 2 l failed in the significance test its indirect contribution rijbj were 0 63 and 0 64 respectively obviously a1 2 l affects the formation of the primary chemical precipitates by affecting v therefore v showed much larger decision coefficient r2 i and determined the formation of the main precipitating materials the results also explained the reason why the emitter fe1 and fe7 which had larger v and a1 2 l had the smallest contents of mineral components in conclusion the results from present experiment acquired some meaningful results however we still need to further explore the proportion of the physical chemical and possibly biological clogging as well as their coupling effects on the drip irrigation emitter clogging process in addition as the primary chemical precipitates of clogging substances varied obviously under the three water sources in this paper studies with a fully controllable treatment are needed 5 conclusions the primary chemical precipitates of emitter clogging substances were quartz silicate muscovite alkali feldspar and chlorite and carbonate aragonite dolomite and calcite and their total quantity were more than 98 of the clogging substances lateral flushing could effectively reduce the accumulation of physical clogging and chemical precipitation and reducing the clogging risk under the conditions of three kinds of water sources hsw ssw and mxw the content of each mineral component showed significant linear increasing trend with the system operation silicate and carbonate contents had linear and exponential correlations with quartz respectively although the sediment and salt contents could be reduced both in water source and clogging substances mixing hsw and ssw would accelerate the coupling interaction between physical and chemical clogging and possibly aggravating biological clogging and the risk of drip irrigation emitter clogging the structure of emitter flow path had obvious impacts on the formation of the chemical precipitates and the overall clogging substances a1 2 l and v were the most important parameters to affect the formation of chemical precipitates of the clogging substances with the detection of the mineral categories and main components in the clogging substances the efficiency of alkaline and acid treatments could be well improved acknowledgements we are grateful for

end of the operation the average proportions of quartz silicate and carbonate were 12 9 26 1 and 61 0 respectively after mixing high sediment water and surface saline water mxw f their average proportions changed to 28 0 20 1 and 51 9 respectively the proportion of quartz was lower than that in hsw f and the proportion of carbonate increased their proportions were on the contrary when compared with those in ssw f considering the linear correlations between their proportions and emitter clogging degrees the clogging issue did not slow down as expected this was mainly because the biological clogging probably enhanced due to the evolution of original microbial communities and possibly promoted the coupling effect of physical and chemical clogging however we did not test the amount of quartz silicate and carbonate in the water source to further analyze the correlations and coupling effects 4 2 correlations between chemical precipitates and emitter geometrical parameters furthermore the clogging process was found closely related to the structure parameters of emitters bucks et al 1979 taylor et al 1995 the correlations between the primary chemical precipitates including quartz silicate and carbonate and the emitter flow path parameters are shown in table 6 it is indicated that three primary chemical precipitates were all negatively correlated with the flow path depth d the relative radius a1 2 l width depth ratio w d the initial outflow q and the mean velocity at flow path cross section v besides positive correlations were obtained between these three chemical precipitates and flow path width w and length l although it is not included in table 6 therefore the influential path of a1 2 l and v on the formation of primary chemical precipitates was further studied by the path analysis method the results in table 7 demonstrate that v had significant directly impacts on the sio2 ca2 and mg2 deposition as bi reached 0 81 and 0 82 respectively although the direct contribution of a1 2 l failed in the significance test its indirect contribution rijbj were 0 63 and 0 64 respectively obviously a1 2 l affects the formation of the primary chemical precipitates by affecting v therefore v showed much larger decision coefficient r2 i and determined the formation of the main precipitating materials the results also explained the reason why the emitter fe1 and fe7 which had larger v and a1 2 l had the smallest contents of mineral components in conclusion the results from present experiment acquired some meaningful results however we still need to further explore the proportion of the physical chemical and possibly biological clogging as well as their coupling effects on the drip irrigation emitter clogging process in addition as the primary chemical precipitates of clogging substances varied obviously under the three water sources in this paper studies with a fully controllable treatment are needed 5 conclusions the primary chemical precipitates of emitter clogging substances were quartz silicate muscovite alkali feldspar and chlorite and carbonate aragonite dolomite and calcite and their total quantity were more than 98 of the clogging substances lateral flushing could effectively reduce the accumulation of physical clogging and chemical precipitation and reducing the clogging risk under the conditions of three kinds of water sources hsw ssw and mxw the content of each mineral component showed significant linear increasing trend with the system operation silicate and carbonate contents had linear and exponential correlations with quartz respectively although the sediment and salt contents could be reduced both in water source and clogging substances mixing hsw and ssw would accelerate the coupling interaction between physical and chemical clogging and possibly aggravating biological clogging and the risk of drip irrigation emitter clogging the structure of emitter flow path had obvious impacts on the formation of the chemical precipitates and the overall clogging substances a1 2 l and v were the most important parameters to affect the formation of chemical precipitates of the clogging substances with the detection of the mineral categories and main components in the clogging substances the efficiency of alkaline and acid treatments could be well improved acknowledgements we are grateful for
