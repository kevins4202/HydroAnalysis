21925,simulation of a ship s roll motion through equation based approaches requires restoring moment added mass moment of inertia and damping coefficients accurate estimation of these coefficients enhances the prediction of ship roll response at a resonance condition however the magnitude of these coefficients in regular beam seas and close to a resonance condition is unknown the present study adopts numerical and experimental simulations to investigate the effects of different wave heights and wave frequencies on ship motion characteristics the motion characteristics results from numerical simulations are compared against experimental measurements and a good correlation is achieved the restoring moment in dynamic conditions is calculated and compared to the hydrostatic restoring moment the dynamic restoring moment is greater than the hydrostatic restoring moment for some wave frequencies and smaller for other wave frequencies the magnitudes of roll damping and added mass moment of inertia coefficients are calculated at different wave heights and frequencies and the results yield that there is quite a nonlinear relationship between the roll hydrodynamic coefficients and roll motion characteristics keywords motion characteristics added mass moment of inertia damping coefficient restoring moment resonance cfd 1 introduction reducing motions of a ship in a seaway is considered paramount in the ship design process roll motion is highly nonlinear and controlling its development reinforces the safety level and habitability calculating nonlinear roll damping and added mass moment of inertia coefficients are crucial for accurate prediction of roll motion in real sea conditions to date the most common approaches for estimating these coefficients are empirical formulas model tests or using secondary data from the model tests the potential theory based methods have also been used to assess ship motions they can simulate a ship s motions with reasonable accuracy except for the roll motion that is because of overlooking the viscosity effects particularly at frequencies close to the roll natural frequency of a ship where the ship could potentially experience large roll motion both experimental and some of numerical methods consider the viscous flow effects around the body and hence promising to estimate these coefficients nowadays the focus has changed towards experimental and numerical simulations especially the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the literature review consists of two sections including previous works on the calculation of roll damping and added mass moment of inertia 1 1 damping calculation many researchers presented significant analysis and discussion on the subject of damping na et al 2002 carried out experimental simulations based on a harmonic force roll motion technique to calculate the damping coefficient of a rectangular box in an attempt to simulate the harmonic force roll motion of a floating production storage and offloading fpso yi hsiang et al 2005 conducted a 2d cfd to compute roll added mass moment of inertia and damping terms yu and kinnas 2009 employed a 2d incompressible navier stokes solver to study the roll damping in two conditions of a rounded bilge box and a sharp corner bilge box the exciting moment was applied to the model free in roll motion it was observed that a sharp corner bilge box produces a larger amplitude roll damping and the relation between the variation of roll moment and roll angle is nonlinear due to viscosity effects in a similar study thiagarajan and braddock 2010 accomplished experimental and numerical studies of an fpso model in a forced roll motion technique using a 1 350 scaled ship model it was found that the numerical simulations based on the free surface random vortex method fsrvm have a good correlation with the experimental results they concluded that the amplitude of damping is a function of roll angular velocity and width of the bilge keel they also proposed an equation based on the relation between damping ratio the width of the bilge keel and barge beam considering few assumptions in terms of nonlinearity irkal et al 2016 investigated the flow field around the model during free oscillation tests using cfd and piv methods they pointed out that the roll damping coefficient of the model in the bare hull condition is linear whereas the roll damping of the fully appended condition is strongly nonlinear considering the effect of forward speed in quantifying the roll damping wilson et al 2006 used cfd method to simulate roll decay of a surface combatant in different froude numbers the calculated roll damping coefficients for low froude number were in good agreement with experimental measurements while the results of high froude number had a 20 deviation yang et al 2013 performed numerical simulations to compute the roll damping for both roll decay and forced rolling of david taylor model basin model dtmb 5512 and s60 hull in different froude numbers they found that the roll amplitude and forward speed have more influence on the roll damping compared to the frequency of excitation gao and vassalos 2011 conducted numerical simulations for roll decay of dtmb 5415 in intact and damaged condition the model was equipped with bilge keels where the calculated roll damping was smaller than the model tests results begovic et al 2015 carried out cfd simulations using star ccm to calculate the roll damping of dtmb 5415 using a roll decay technique for both intact and damaged conditions the results were compared against experimental measurement where a reasonable accuracy was achieved in the recent study mancini et al 2018 carried out roll decay tests using numerical and experimental simulations to calculate the roll damping coefficients for the numerical uncertainty analysis the grid convergence index was used instead of the correlation factor method because the solutions were not close to the asymptotic range zhou et al 2015 performed numerical and model test measurements to compute the roll damping of four different ship models using the roll decay technique at froude number zero the simulation results had a good correlation with the experimental measurements one of the limitations in using the roll decay technique is inaccuracy to estimate the roll damping coefficient of large roll motions especially in forward speed the alternative method is the harmonic excited roll motion herm technique proposed by blume 1979 which appears a better solution to calculate the roll damping coefficient this method is based on exciting the model at its resonance frequency the main drawback of this technique is the long simulation time to measure the resonance frequency another disadvantage is the dependency of roll damping coefficient on maximum roll angle metacentric height and heel angle each of these items should be recorded and could be subject to the errors therefore the uncertainty of blume s method is high handschel and abdel maksoud 2014 presented an improved herm technique to estimate the damping coefficient for a range of frequencies very close to the resonance frequency they measured the phase shift between the exciting moments and the roll angles for other than 90 the advantages of this method are twofold the measuring time reduces to the range of roll decay and no further modification is required for the test set up in another approach wassermann et al 2016 conducted several model tests based on the roll decay and herm technique to calculate the roll damping of a post panamax container ship model they introduced different approaches for roll damping calculation without additional filtering curve fitting and offset manipulation for the recorded time series oliva remola et al 2018 carried out the herm technique by shifting a mass harmonically inside the model in the y direction to excite the model different masses were utilised to generate different roll angles for the same roll angle the calculated roll damping from herm technique was smaller than the roll decay method that is because the roll damping is calculated when the roll angle reaches a steady condition in the herm technique while in the roll decay the roll damping is calculated in a transient condition kianejad et al 2019c and s s kianejad et al 2018c conducted numerical simulations based on the herm technique to calculate roll damping of a post panamax container ship in model scale and full scale they also investigated the effects of froude numbers and degrees of freedom dof the full scale demonstrated relatively smaller roll damping because the impact of viscous effects on the roll damping is smaller in a high reynolds number they also pointed out that increasing the froude number and reducing the dof increase the roll damping somayajula and falzarano 2017 introduced an advanced system of identification to estimate frequency dependent roll damping from the results of experimental measurements in irregular waves the proposed method predicts the roll motion of the model precisely in comparison to the potential flow and empirical methods 1 2 added mass moment of inertia calculation the magnitude of the roll added mass moment of inertia is estimated to vary between 10 and 25 percent of the roll mass moment of inertia for displacement ships based on the potential flow approaches bikdash et al 1994 grinnaert et al 2016 schumacher et al 2016 taylan 2003 wright and marshfield 1979 for many years the work of bhattacharyya 1978 remained a reliable reference who performed analytical and experimental simulations to estimate the roll added mass moment of inertia he concluded that the roll added mass moment of inertia of a ship is about 20 of the roll mass moment of inertia one of the earlier investigations of added mass moment of inertia was carried out by salvesen et al 1970 who utilised the strip theory method to calculate 2d sectional added mass in roll motion which was expanded to 3d added mass moment of inertia by taking integration over the length of a ship later on das et al 2006 used a 2d sectional concept but applied the frank close fit method due to limitations of strip theory in accounting the impact of viscosity and turbulent flow around a ship especially in the roll motion subramanian 2012 applied an empirical correction to include the viscous effects jaouen et al 2011 carried out cfd simulations on a ship hull section to consider the viscous effects they submerged the model to remove the restoring moment and calculated the roll added mass moment of inertia using fourier series discusser et al 2014 used the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method to capture the flow behaviours around the model for calculating the added mass judge 2010 conducted a series of model tests at different forced roll angles forward speeds and excitation frequencies they observed that variation of frequency at the high range has a negligible impact on the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia while at a low frequency range the magnitude is dependent on the frequency and forward speed judge and judge 2013 also calculated the roll added mass moment of inertia of a planning hull based on the forced roll oscillation and investigated the impact of the forward speed and the roll amplitude they observed that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia is independent of the roll amplitude whereas increasing the forward speed reduces roll added mass magnitude in recent years kianejad et al 2019b and kianejad et al 2017 proposed a method based on the herm technique to compute the roll added mass moment of inertia of a post panamax container ship using cfd simulations they found out that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients of a bare hull model is smaller than the fully appended model it was also found that the full scale ship has a smaller added mass moment of inertia due to a smaller phase shift and angular acceleration they noticed that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia depends on the forward speed roll angle and excitation frequency it appears that accuracy in estimation of the roll damping and added mass moment of inertia has a significant effect in the prediction of a ship motions for a range of frequencies close to the resonance frequency while the magnitude of these coefficients is unknown in wave conditions in this study cfd simulations and experimental measurements were performed for 35 cases in regular beam sea conditions to investigate the influence of five wave heights 0 025 0 05 0 075 0 1 and 0 125 m at seven wave frequencies from 0 57 to 0 69 hz with intervals of 0 02 hz close to the natural frequency of the model upon validation of the developed cfd model against experimental model tests the roll exciting and restoring moments were computed using cfd simulations since calculation through experimental measurements is not feasible in the next step the roll added mass moment of inertia and roll damping coefficients were calculated 2 model geometry in this study a model of bulk carrier ship froude s scale factor 1 100 is adopted to compute the magnitude of roll exciting and restoring moments as well as the roll damping and added mass moment of inertia coefficients the main particulars of the model are shown in table 1 the model had no appendages and was tested in regular beam sea conditions with no forward speed 3 experimental measurements the model tests were conducted in the towing tank with 100 m length 3 55 m width and 1 8 m depth the water depth was 1 5 m at the australian maritime college university of tasmania the towing tank s depth varies in one side of the towing tank shown in fig 1 a close to the beach while remains constant for the entire length of the tank including in the location of the model test set up a hydraulically driven wavemaker located at one end of the towing tank was used to produce regular waves a computer program was used to control the wavemaker paddle to produce a range of waves with different heights and frequencies a large beach is placed at the other end of the towing tank to minimise the wave reflections fig 1 illustrates the model position in the towing tank in a beam sea condition at an encounter angle of 90 to the regular waves to monitor the wave height and wave frequency of the produced waves four resistive type wave probes named as wp0 wp3 were utilised an optical motion tracking system qualisys with seven cameras was employed to capture the translational and rotational motions of the model as well as the roll angular velocity and roll angular acceleration the centre of gravity of the model was set as a reference for the motion characteristics calculation via three passive markers attached to the model it can be seen in fig 1 b c the model was restrained by ropes to decrease the sway and yaw motions the ropes were threaded through pulleys fig 1 c at both sides of the tank and were restrained by 1 kg weights using lighter weights increases the sway motion and makes challenge in capturing data by the qualisys system and using heavier weights decreases the sway motion which could decrease the roll motion kianejad et al 2019a kianejad et al 2018b the other sides of the ropes were attached to the bow and stern of the model via eye hooks the ropes were attached to the model at the free surface to reduce their impacts on the heave and pitch motions waves push the model in the flow direction and impose yaw angle because of the underwater asymmetric projected area with respect to the centre of gravity the ropes attached to the weights work as springs and counteract the wave force in y direction to bring the model into the initial position all devices were synchronised and the data was captured at 200 hz for both the wave probes and qualisys system 4 numerical modelling the following sections discuss the details of the numerical simulation method selected for this study 4 1 governing equations and physics modelling the numerical simulations were carried out using star ccm the software resolves integral forms of rans equations based on the finite volume method and a transient approach was selected as the simulation is a function of time the solver utilises the averaged continuity and momentum equations these equations for incompressible flow in terms of tensor form and cartesian coordinates are as follows ferziger et al 1997 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ uu p g x ρ μ u ρ τ in the cartesian coordinates u u v w represent time averaged velocity fields and is the gradient operator ρ is the density of water and air with a constant value for each one during the simulations p and g represent the time averaged pressure and gravitational acceleration respectively τ and μ are the reynolds tensor and the dynamic viscosity a predictor corrector method is employed to make a correlation between continuity and momentum equations the turbulence models are required to provide closure of the rans equations in a turbulent flow and to address the uncertainty of the stress tensor hence the sst and k omega turbulence model was selected the volume of fluid vof approach has been used for modelling of the free surface the free surface in calm water and wave condition changes during the simulation so that the second order convection scheme was selected to capture a sharp interface among phases the volume of fraction γ was utilised to track the fluids the magnitude of volume of fraction for the air and water phases is 0 and 1 respectively and a mixture of two fluids has an intermediate value the volume fraction distribution is modelled by the equations below 3 γ t u γ u r γ 1 γ 0 the last term of equation 3 is a compression term which reduces the smearing of interface and u r is the relative velocity the variation of ρ and μ can be calculated by 4 ρ γ ρ w a t e r 1 γ ρ a i r 5 μ γ μ w a t e r 1 γ μ a i r the implicit solver utilises the segregated flow model to solve the governing equations where convection terms were discretised by the second order upwind scheme and the simple algorithm was selected throughout the solution the model was free in 6dof to simulate the ship s motion like a real condition at sea thus the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi approach was used to feed the solver to compute different forces and moments which are acting on the model courant number cfl was utilised to choose a suitable time step and it should be less than 0 5 for the free surface to have numerical accuracy the maximum cfl for free surface and around the model was about 0 1 the convergence criteria of e 5 and 7 inner iterations per time step were considered the force from the waves in the y direction is large enough and the model experiences the sway motion when the model has sway motion it moves the weights on the other hand the weights try to bring the model to the initial position the y component of rope tension is a negligible force and cannot bring the model to the initial location especially for the larger wave heights hence four 10 n a summation of the weight force 9 8 n and a small value for pulleys frictions forces were applied to the model as shown in fig 2 at the free surface to reduce the sway and yaw motions when the model has positive or negative sway motions the forces with red and green arrows respectively act on the model to bring it back to the initial location as the simulations were set in beam sea condition with long crested regular waves and the moments generated by restraining forces were not considered the yaw and pitch motions are negligible the motions of the model are studied in section 6 1 4 2 mesh structure and generation selecting a suitable size of the domain reduces the simulation time and increases the accuracy of the results in this study the domain size was selected based on practical guidelines for ship cfd applications proposed by ittc 2011 where the inlet boundary is placed at 2 5 lpp upstream of the model while the outlet is placed at 4 lpp downstream of the model the top and bottom boundaries are located at 0 5 lpp and 1 lpp from the model respectively to avoid boundary effects on the simulation results the side boundaries are positioned at 0 4 lpp from the model in order to capture large motions the overset mesh approach was employed this approach consists of two regions including overset and background the overset region surrounds and moves with the body inside the motionless background mesh hadzic 2006 the size of the mesh inside the overset region was refined enough to capture the boundary layer flow separation during body motion wave making and vortices around the body four types of meshers were used to produce the mesh including trimmed prism layer surface and automatic surface repair meshers the trimmed mesher creates a high quality mesh while the prism layer mesh was utilised to generate orthogonal prismatic mesh next to the body to capture the velocity gradient and boundary layer the surface remesher was used to enhance the quality of the surface to create volume mesh finally the automatic surface repair was used to refine the geometry problems that remained after surface remeshing the size of cells inside the overset region is smaller than in the background region the cell size in the overset region and the background were matched using an overlap volumetric block to prevent divergence the mesh at the free surface was generated based on practical guidelines for ship cfd applications ittc 2011 according to these recommendations for regular wave conditions at least 40 cells per wavelength and 20 cells for the vertical direction of the free surface were considered the size of cells around the model was decreased to 40 of the basic cell size of the overset region 0 006 m is the base size and 15 inflation layers were generated by a stretching ratio of 1 3 using prism layer mesher to capture the boundary layer and flow separation around the body the all y wall treatment was used which is a hybrid method and emulates the low y wall treatment y 1 for fine meshes and high y wall treatment for coarse meshes they value is less than 1 to ensure the selected mesh configuration can compute the pressure and shear forces precisely fig 3 shows illustrations of the computation mesh details on the mesh sensitivity and uncertainty are provided in section 5 4 3 boundary and initial conditions to reduce the running time and boost the accuracy of simulation results suitable initial and boundary conditions were selected the velocity inlet boundary condition was set in upstream inlet of the model while the pressure outlet boundary was set in downstream outlet to prevent any backflow the top and bottom were set as velocity inlet kianejad et al 2019b cd adapco 2017 while the side walls were set as a wall like the model tests the magnitude of initial and boundary flow velocity at each velocity inlet boundary condition was set as a fifth order wave stokes wave condition the initial hydrostatic pressure of the fifth order wave stokes wave was set for the outlet boundary for the lager wave heights the wave profile in crest and trough is different and usually has a sharper crest and a wider trough the fifth order stokes wave produces more realistic regular waves like the one obtained for the model tests hence the fifth order waves were generated in this study the vof wave forcing method was applied at inlet and outlet boundaries to decrease the simulation time without compromising the results the solution of 3d navier stokes equations at forcing length region 3 m from each boundary peric 2018 is forced towards a simplified theory such as a theoretical solution or simplified numerical solution where the momentum sources are used not phase and turbulence sources as the 3d navier stokes equations are solving just at the vicinity of the model the simulation time decreases by setting the vof wave forcing method at the inlet and outlet boundaries propagating waves at the upstream decreases and better waves were produced in another attempt the inlet and outlet boundaries were extended by 1 lpp 2 5 1 lpp and 4 1 lpp to investigate the effect of domain size the results were quite similar compared with the original location of inlet and outlet boundaries 5 experimental uncertainty according to kim and hermansky 2014 the uncertainty of experimental measurements should be quantified to assess the quality of results the experimental uncertainty consists of type a and type b based on the iso gum s method the type a uncertainty is based on the repeatability of measurements and is manifested in experimental variance 6 s 2 q k 1 n 1 j 1 n q j q 2 where n is the number of repeated realizations and q j is the value from a single measurement q represents the mean value of the measured data the experimental standard deviation is defined as a positive square root of variance the standard type a uncertainty of a repeated measurement is computed by the equation below 7 s q s q k n the end to end multiple test run approach is a common approach of the repeatability of the measurement in this regard all influential parameters on measurement should be taken into account to reduce the magnitude of type a uncertainty the number of repeats should be large enough and generally 10 repeats are acceptable as the computation of uncertainty for all realizations is time consuming and costly uncertainty calculation for a couple of realizations is suitable hence the repeats should be carefully selected the type b uncertainty is defined by u i 2 and or u i which could be specified based on the variance and standard deviation the geometry of model measuring devices calibration and installation of devices data processing and presenting are the main sources of the type b uncertainty the accuracy of qualisys system and wave probe as measuring devices was chosen as sources of the type b uncertainty and remains constant throughout an experiment the total standard uncertainty of a measured value containing the type a and type b uncertainties can be computed by the equation below 8 u y i 1 n s 2 q j 1 k u 2 x 1 2 in the present study the uncertainty calculation was conducted in cases with a wave height of 0 125 m and different frequencies as shown in table 2 and table 3 the type b uncertainty is the same for different frequencies as it is related to the precision of measuring devices whereas the type a uncertainty is related to repeatability of the motion characteristics recordings when a model is excited at its natural frequency the variation of motion characteristics in different cycles is smaller compared to the frequencies far from the natural frequencies kianejad et al 2019a it can be seen in table 2 where the variations of motion characteristics are larger for lower frequencies 0 57 and 0 59 hz and the variations for frequencies of 0 65 and 0 67 hz are smaller as they are closer to the natural frequency of the model therefore the total standard uncertainty at a wave frequency of 0 57 hz is larger than the other cases while the total standard uncertainties are smaller for frequencies of 0 65 and 0 67 hz 6 numerical uncertainty analysis prior to commencing the simulations for different cases it is necessary to specify the uncertainty in simulation results to ensure the numerical approach simulates the physics accurately according to the verification method advised by stern et al 2001 numerical uncertainty u sn consists of iterative convergence uncertainty u i grid spacing uncertainty u g and time step uncertainty u t given in the following equation 9 u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 the simulation at a wave height of 0 125 m and a frequency of 0 65 hz was selected to compute the numerical uncertainty the grid spacing uncertainty of different mesh configurations was performed based on a richardson extrapolation kianejad et al 2018a three different mesh configurations with a refinement ratio of r g 2 were considered and the number of meshes for each case is shown in table 4 the simulation was based on coarse medium and fine mesh configurations shown by s 3 s 2 and s 1 respectively the variation of simulation results is calculated by the following equations 10 ε g 32 s 3 s 2 11 ε g 21 s 2 s 1 12 r g ε g 21 ε g 32 the numerical convergence ratio was calculated using equation 12 according to the convergence ratio four typical conditions can be predicted i monotonic convergence 0 r g 1 ii oscillatory convergence r g 0 r g 1 iii monotonic divergence r g 1 and iv oscillatory divergence r g 0 r g 1 numerical uncertainty in cases iii and iv cannot be computed because of divergence for case ii uncertainty can be computed based on bounding error with upper limit s u and lower limit s l by using the equation below 13 u g 1 2 s u s l in case i the generalised richardson extrapolation should be adopted to compute the numerical error δ r e g 1 and order of accuracy p g as shown in the equations below 14 δ r e g 1 ε g 21 r g p g 1 15 p g ln ε g 32 ε g 21 ln r g the correction factor c g which is defined in the equation below determines the method of uncertainty calculation p gest is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy 16 c g r g p g 1 r g p g e s t 1 if the c g is close to 1 the solutions are close to the asymptotic range and the numerical error δ sn benchmark result s c and uncertainty u gc can be computed from the following set of equations stern et al 2006 17 δ s n c g δ r e g 1 18 s c s δ s n 19 u g c 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 if the value of cg is greater than 1 the solutions are far from the asymptotic range and the numerical uncertainty should be computed by 20 u g 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 2 1 c g 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 the time step and iterative uncertainties were calculated in a similar procedure the other two sources of total uncertainty were considered in the fine cases to calculate the uncertainty from each of time step grid spacing and number of iterations the time step uncertainty analysis was started from δt t 28 with a refinement ratio of 2 r t 2 while for the iterative uncertainty which was based on the number of iterations starting from iteration number of 6 e 4 s 3 6e4 a refinement ratio of 2 was considered the numerical simulation results for different mesh configurations time steps number of iterations experimental measurements and the magnitude of uncertainties are presented in tables 5 7 fig 4 shows the time traces of simulation results against experimental measurements and it can be seen that there is a good correlation between them the magnitude of iterative uncertainties is negligible while the grid spacing uncertainty is the largest one accounting for 6 28 for the sway motion the simulation results for the fine mesh configuration and the smallest time step were closer to the experiment hence further simulations were performed based on the fine mesh configuration and smallest time step the validation uncertainty u υ can be calculated by equation 21 where u d is the experimental uncertainty the absolute comparison error e is the difference between the numerical and experimental measurements the absolute comparison error should be less than the validation uncertainty to validate the simulation results against experimental measurements 21 u υ u s n 2 u d 2 it can be seen in table 8 that the magnitude of validation uncertainty for all cases is larger than the magnitude of absolute error and therefore validation is confirmed the case of 0 1 m wave height and a wave frequency of 0 65 hz was chosen to investigate the influence of turbulence model and sidewall effects on the simulation results and to ensure the reliability of the selected numerical approach the simulations results are shown in table 9 the simulations were performed by a cluster with 140 cpus and the simulation time of the k epsilon turbulence model 19 h was lower than the sst and k omega turbulence model 24 h whereas the simulation results had larger discrepancies compared to the experimental measurements as the sst and k omega turbulence model generates more accurate results it was chosen for the rest of simulations both walls were positioned at 1 5 l from the model to investigate the effects of sidewalls on simulation results the numerical set up was the same for the original and new wall positions the simulation results in table 9 and fig 5 confirm that the wall effects are negligible since the simulations were conducted in beam sea condition and the width of the model is relatively small and the interaction between fluid and walls has a negligible impact on the model responses hence the original position of the side walls was considered for the rest of simulations to reduce the simulation time 7 results and discussion the motion amplitudes predicted using cfd are compared to the experimental measurements for various wave heights and wave frequencies the exciting moment and restoring moments are calculated and the latter is compared against the restoring moment corresponding to the hydrostatic condition the non dimensional roll damping and added mass moment of inertia are calculated when the model is located in crest and trough of a wave in the following sections the model in the crest and trough conditions reflect that the model is located in the first or second half of one period of a wave 7 1 motion characteristics the motion characteristics of the ship model including roll angle roll angular velocity roll angular acceleration and heave motion for different wave heights and wave frequencies are shown in fig 6 in general there is a good correlation between numerical cfd and experimental fluid dynamics efd results for each one of the motion characteristics two figures are presented where the left hand figures a d are recorded when the model was in the trough of a wave and the right side e h for the crest condition it is apparent that increasing the wave height increases the roll angle however the responses of the model to the different wave heights and wave frequencies are nonlinear for the smaller wave heights of 0 025 and 0 050 m increasing the wave frequency increases the roll angle to reach the maximum value at a wave frequency of 0 65 hz which is very close to the natural frequency of the model however reduction in the roll angle is apparent beyond this wave frequency at the larger wave heights of 0 1 and 0 125 m increasing the wave frequency increases the roll angle and the maximum roll angle occurs at a frequency of 0 67 hz and a further increase of the wave frequency slightly decreases the roll angle this is because the natural frequency of the model varies depends on the roll angle kianejad et al 2019b h enshaei and k 2018 when the magnitude of total roll mass moment of inertia and roll restoring moment is equal and in opposite direction a roll resonance condition occurs because only the roll damping opposes the exciting moment and the model experiences larger roll angle kianejad et al 2019a increasing the wave height roll angle increases the magnitude of roll restoring moment hence a higher excitation wave frequency is needed to produce a larger magnitude of total mass moment of inertia to cancel the restoring moment therefore increasing the wave height roll angle shifts the resonance frequency towards a higher value kianejad et al 2020 the roll angular velocity and acceleration have the same trends as the roll angle the maximum values occur at the resonance condition and their magnitudes decline at wave frequencies away from the resonance the magnitude of roll angular velocity and acceleration is larger at a higher frequency for the same roll angle at wave height 0 025 and 0 050 m due to larger excitation frequency it was observed that the magnitudes of roll angles for the crest and trough conditions are the same for smaller wave heights because the wave profile is the same for the crest and trough conditions fig 7 while for the larger wave heights the wave crest is sharper and the wave trough is wider the amplitude of roll angle in trough conditions are more significant than crest conditions especially for higher wave frequencies on the other hand the magnitude of roll angular acceleration of the model at the crest condition is larger as the roll velocity changes are larger because of the sharper wave crest the heave amplitude for the crest and trough conditions are almost the same for the smaller wave heights while at larger wave height 0 125 m increasing the wave frequency slightly increases the heave motion magnitude as the wave steepness increases 7 2 roll exciting and restoring moments calculations the magnitude of restoring moment depends on heave motion of the model and the location of a wave s crest and trough with respect to the model the upward buoyancy force which is defined as a product of the total pressure and projection of the underwater model area in the z direction varies based on the heave motion of the model fig 8 shows the heave motion of the model for various roll angles at different wave frequencies in the wave height of 0 1 m the variations of the upward buoyancy versus roll angle at different wave frequencies for two wave heights are shown in fig 9 for the higher wave frequencies the model has the maximum and minimum roll angles when it is located in the trough and crest of the wave respectively whereas for the lower frequencies the model experiences maximum and minimum roll angles when it has small heave motion therefore the upward buoyancy variation for lower frequencies is smaller than higher frequencies the variation in the wave height of 0 05 m is smaller because the wave has similar profile in trough and crest conditions while for the wave height of 0 1 m stokes wave the model has larger upward buoyancy when it is in the trough of a wave compared with being in the crest condition the upward buoyancy variation for the wave frequency of 0 67 hz is about 110 n which has a significant impact on the magnitude of restoring moment the magnitude of restoring moment m r e s is computed by equation 22 where c f and c b in fig 10 are the centre of floatation and centre of buoyancy several field functions user define functions were used to monitor c b and c f with respect to the centre of gravity and they were recorded in each time step the centre of buoyancy is the centroid of instant underwater volume or buoyancy force and can be calculated in each axis the centre of floatation is the centre of instant waterplane area in this study the intersection of water free surface and the model is a closed line waterplane area and its centroid c f was calculated using field function it can be seen in fig 10 d 1 is the distance between centres of floatation and buoyancy while d 2 is the distance between centres of floatation and gravity c g f by and w are upward buoyancy force and weight of the model the vertical component of dynamic pressure which is negligible was considered in the restoring moment calculation along with upward buoyancy force 22 m re s f b y d 1 w d 2 another influential parameter on the magnitude of restoring moment is the location of a wave with respect to the model fig 11 shows the position of the waves with respect to the model at different roll angles for two wave frequencies at a wave height of 0 1 m the red line represents the free surface in a calm water condition to compare the free surface alterations in the dynamic and hydrostatic conditions the restoring moment values for different roll angles at the hydrostatic condition were calculated by cfd simulations and the results were similar to the results obtained by maxsurf stability software version 20 the restoring moments versus roll angles at different wave frequencies and two wave heights are shown in fig 12 at the wave frequency of 0 69 hz and 12 5 degrees of roll angle a portion of buoyancy moves towards the low side hence by increasing the distance between centres of buoyancy and gravity the restoring moment increases compared to the calm water condition fig 12 b whereas the magnitude of restoring moment at the same roll angle and a wave frequency of 0 57 hz is smaller than restoring moment in the calm water this is because a part of buoyancy moves from the low side to the opposite side and the distance between the centres of buoyancy and gravity decreases the restoring moment for positive roll angles in trough condition is larger than negative roll angles in crest condition due to the greater magnitude of upward buoyancy force and larger distance between the centres of buoyancy and gravity even at zero roll angle the model has restoring moment due to the wave position fig 11 and the restoring moment acts as an exciting moment to impose roll angle in the opposite direction the magnitude of restoring moment for the same roll angle for the wave heights of 0 05 and 0 1 m is different because of different upward buoyancies and wave positions the exciting moments m e x c 44 induced on the model from the waves are calculated by the following equation as can be seen in fig 10 b where f l and d are the lateral force resultant of horizontal buoyancy force f bx and dynamic pressure force from the wave and its lever to the centre of floatation as no bilge keels were attached to the model the magnitude of dynamic pressure was small it means both static and total pressures were captured during simulations and the difference was negligible 23 m e x c 44 f l d the magnitudes of the exciting moments for various roll angles at different wave frequencies and a wave height of 0 1 m are shown in fig 8 as the half cycle of a wave trough to crest was selected to investigate the roll exciting and restoring moments the magnitude of exciting moment is positive and in the next cycle crest to trough is negative as the lateral force has negative sign the exciting moment has maximum value when the model has zero heave motion because the slope of the free surface at the zero wave elevation is maximum for the positive roll angles the exciting moment contributes to increase the roll angle while for the negative roll angles it opposes the roll angle development increasing the wave height increases the variation and magnitude of exciting and restoring moments as mentioned above the magnitude of roll restoring moment varies at different wave heights and frequencies even for the same roll angle thus considering the restoring moment from the hydrostatic calculation increases the discrepancies of the simulations 7 3 roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient the equation of rotational motions including roll in a body local system regarding the centre of gravity is cd adapco 2017 24 i d ω d t ω i ω m m p m v where i and ω represent the tensor of mass moment of inertia and angular velocity of the model m is the moment on the model and indices of p and v are the pressure and viscous parts by restraining the model in sway and yaw motion the magnitude of these motions was decreased however the model remains free in 6 dof and different motions influence on other motions the focus of this study is calculation of the roll motion coefficients hence the 6 dof equations of motion can be simplified into a 1 dof equation as below where the hydrodynamic coefficients are still under the influence of the all motions 25 i 44 δ i 44 ϕ 4 n 44 ϕ 4 s 44 ϕ 4 m e x c 44 in the equation above i 44 and δ i 44 are the roll mass and added mass moment of inertia coefficients n 44 and s 44 represent the roll damping and restoring coefficients respectively there are linear and nonlinear relations between the hydrodynamic coefficients and roll motion characteristics as can be seen in figs 12 and 13 the model reaches the steady state condition after a couple of cycles and maintains the same amplitude of roll motion characteristics in the following cycles the computation of roll motion coefficients was conducted for a couple of cycles which had the same amplitude of roll motion characteristics when the model has maximum or minimum roll angle in the trough and crest of a wave the angular velocity of the model is almost zero the damping moment is negligible and the roll added mass moment of inertia could be computed by equation 25 kianejad et al 2019b as the other moments including the exciting moment restoring moment and roll mass moment of inertia are known over the simulation s time fig 8 the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients at different wave heights and frequencies both for the trough a and crest b conditions are shown in fig 13 it is made non dimensional dividing by the roll mass moment of inertia the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients for different wave heights at lower wave frequencies has smaller differences because the conditions are far from the resonance condition while the differences increase at higher wave frequencies as the model at the larger wave heights experiences the resonance at higher frequencies the coefficients at smaller wave heights and higher wave frequencies are larger because of the smaller induced acceleration while the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia moments are greater at the larger wave heights the added mass moment of inertia in calm water condition has positive sign and exciting moment and total mass moment of inertia contributes to increase the roll motion while damping and restoring moment oppose the roll motion development kianejad et al 2019a at a resonance frequency the magnitude of total mass moment of inertia and restoring moment is equal and in opposite direction hence the model experiences maximum roll angle while for the same exciting moment and at low and high excitation frequencies these moments cannot counteract each other and the model generates smaller roll motion the magnitudes of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients at lower wave frequencies are negative which implies that they act against the roll motion development it is mainly because of the location of the model with respect to the wave as well as smaller acceleration of the model shown in fig 8 at a frequency of 0 57 hz fig 8 a the model experiences maximum roll angle when it has smallest heave motion compared with other frequencies it means the model is far from the crest and trough and the rate of flow velocity changes acceleration of the flow around the model is more significant fig 14 compared with the acceleration induced by the model and in the opposite direction of the model rolling increasing the wave frequency fig 8 increases the model acceleration and the model has maximum roll angle at larger heave motion while the flow acceleration value decreases compared with the model acceleration hence by increasing the wave frequency up to 0 63 hz the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia decreases at higher wave frequencies the model experiences the maximum minimum roll angle at the trough and crest conditions where the flow acceleration induced by the model is dominant and the flow velocity variation is small the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient at low wave frequencies for the model in trough and crest conditions have the similar values whereas for the larger wave heights and higher wave frequencies the crest conditions have smaller values because of the larger acceleration larger moment of roll mass moment of inertia 7 4 roll damping coefficient the roll damping is calculated using equation 26 when the roll angle is small the roll damping moment is maximum and the corresponding restoring exciting and virtual mass moment of inertia moments were calculated as explained in the previous sections it was assumed in each case that there is a linear relationship between the roll damping coefficient and roll angular velocity while it has been shown by several researchers that there are both linear and nonlinear relationships between them based on the method proposed by oliva remola et al 2018 and irkal et al 2019 and using fitting curve functions the linear and nonlinear parts of the roll damping can be computed from the computed roll damping coefficient considering the linear relationship with the roll angular velocity regardless of the roll damping calculation technique a polynomial expansion of the roll angle or roll angular velocity can be used to approximate the roll damping coefficient oliva remola et al 2018 including linear and nonlinear parts which is not the focus of this study the roll damping coefficient can be non dimensional by equation 27 reed 2011 the roll damping coefficients for various wave frequencies at various wave heights for the trough left hand and crest right hand conditions are shown in fig 15 26 n 44 m e x c 44 i 44 δ i 44 ϕ 4 s 44 ϕ 4 ϕ 4 27 b 44 n 44 ρ b w l 2 b w l 2 g it can be seen that there is a nonlinear relation between the magnitude of roll damping the wave height and wave frequency increasing the wave height increases the magnitude of roll damping both for the crest and trough conditions because the viscous effect which is a significant part of total roll damping increases for smaller wave heights increasing the wave frequency increases the roll damping to reach a peak and declines after that since the frequency moves away from the resonance condition in contrast for the larger wave heights where the higher wave frequencies are closer to the natural frequency of the model increasing the wave frequency increases the magnitude of roll damping coefficients because of the larger exciting moment from waves the magnitude of roll damping at lower wave frequencies for both the trough and crest have similar values due to the model is far from resonance and the magnitudes of exciting moment and restoring moment are small while for the higher frequencies the crest condition fig 15 b has large values due to the greater excitation moment from a larger free surface slope fig 16 shows the variation of roll damping versus the roll angular velocity increasing the roll velocity increases the magnitude of roll damping however the rate of increase for the larger wave height is greater it means the nonlinearity of roll damping increases it can be seen that the nonlinearity for the trough condition fig 16 a is smaller than crest condition fig 16 b for the larger wave heights and that is mainly because of wider trough and variation of angular velocity is relatively smaller as above the magnitude of hydrodynamic coefficients in regular beam sea conditions are different compared to the still water condition and this should be taken into account to improve ship roll motion prediction 8 concluding remarks numerical and experimental simulations were conducted in regular beam sea conditions to investigate the influence of wave height and frequency on ship motion characteristics and roll hydrodynamic coefficients in general increasing the wave height increases the roll motion while the model experiences the maximum roll motion around the resonance frequency as at smaller wave heights the motion characteristics are the same as the surface elevation both in trough and crest are the same at higher wave heights the wave has a wider trough and sharper crest hence the model remains more time in trough condition so the induced roll angle is larger on the other hand the model has larger roll angular acceleration in crest condition the magnitude of restoring moment in a dynamic condition can be either smaller or larger than the hydrostatic condition depending on the magnitude of buoyancy force and the position of the wave with respect to the model the model has a larger restoring moment when it is in a trough condition due to the larger buoyancy force and larger distance between the centres of buoyancy and gravity at lower wave frequencies the magnitude of restoring moment in the dynamic condition is smaller than the hydrostatic condition however at higher wave frequencies the magnitude of restoring moment in the dynamic condition is larger the exciting moment form waves on the model in one half cycle is positive and turns into negative in the next half cycle which has its maximum value at a surface elevation of zero due to maximum slope of the free surface the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient varies at different wave frequencies at a low wave frequency it has a negative value which resists the roll motion because of the flow acceleration around the model is dominant and in the opposite direction of the model rolling motion while at higher wave frequencies the coefficients are positive and contribute to the roll motion development although the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients at different wave heights are the same at some frequencies the magnitudes of their moments are higher around the resonance frequency and larger wave height it was observed that there is a nonlinear relationship between the magnitude of roll damping and wave height and frequency the roll damping coefficient around the resonance frequency is larger than other frequencies and the magnitude of roll damping increases by increasing the wave height the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of calculating roll added

21925,simulation of a ship s roll motion through equation based approaches requires restoring moment added mass moment of inertia and damping coefficients accurate estimation of these coefficients enhances the prediction of ship roll response at a resonance condition however the magnitude of these coefficients in regular beam seas and close to a resonance condition is unknown the present study adopts numerical and experimental simulations to investigate the effects of different wave heights and wave frequencies on ship motion characteristics the motion characteristics results from numerical simulations are compared against experimental measurements and a good correlation is achieved the restoring moment in dynamic conditions is calculated and compared to the hydrostatic restoring moment the dynamic restoring moment is greater than the hydrostatic restoring moment for some wave frequencies and smaller for other wave frequencies the magnitudes of roll damping and added mass moment of inertia coefficients are calculated at different wave heights and frequencies and the results yield that there is quite a nonlinear relationship between the roll hydrodynamic coefficients and roll motion characteristics keywords motion characteristics added mass moment of inertia damping coefficient restoring moment resonance cfd 1 introduction reducing motions of a ship in a seaway is considered paramount in the ship design process roll motion is highly nonlinear and controlling its development reinforces the safety level and habitability calculating nonlinear roll damping and added mass moment of inertia coefficients are crucial for accurate prediction of roll motion in real sea conditions to date the most common approaches for estimating these coefficients are empirical formulas model tests or using secondary data from the model tests the potential theory based methods have also been used to assess ship motions they can simulate a ship s motions with reasonable accuracy except for the roll motion that is because of overlooking the viscosity effects particularly at frequencies close to the roll natural frequency of a ship where the ship could potentially experience large roll motion both experimental and some of numerical methods consider the viscous flow effects around the body and hence promising to estimate these coefficients nowadays the focus has changed towards experimental and numerical simulations especially the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the literature review consists of two sections including previous works on the calculation of roll damping and added mass moment of inertia 1 1 damping calculation many researchers presented significant analysis and discussion on the subject of damping na et al 2002 carried out experimental simulations based on a harmonic force roll motion technique to calculate the damping coefficient of a rectangular box in an attempt to simulate the harmonic force roll motion of a floating production storage and offloading fpso yi hsiang et al 2005 conducted a 2d cfd to compute roll added mass moment of inertia and damping terms yu and kinnas 2009 employed a 2d incompressible navier stokes solver to study the roll damping in two conditions of a rounded bilge box and a sharp corner bilge box the exciting moment was applied to the model free in roll motion it was observed that a sharp corner bilge box produces a larger amplitude roll damping and the relation between the variation of roll moment and roll angle is nonlinear due to viscosity effects in a similar study thiagarajan and braddock 2010 accomplished experimental and numerical studies of an fpso model in a forced roll motion technique using a 1 350 scaled ship model it was found that the numerical simulations based on the free surface random vortex method fsrvm have a good correlation with the experimental results they concluded that the amplitude of damping is a function of roll angular velocity and width of the bilge keel they also proposed an equation based on the relation between damping ratio the width of the bilge keel and barge beam considering few assumptions in terms of nonlinearity irkal et al 2016 investigated the flow field around the model during free oscillation tests using cfd and piv methods they pointed out that the roll damping coefficient of the model in the bare hull condition is linear whereas the roll damping of the fully appended condition is strongly nonlinear considering the effect of forward speed in quantifying the roll damping wilson et al 2006 used cfd method to simulate roll decay of a surface combatant in different froude numbers the calculated roll damping coefficients for low froude number were in good agreement with experimental measurements while the results of high froude number had a 20 deviation yang et al 2013 performed numerical simulations to compute the roll damping for both roll decay and forced rolling of david taylor model basin model dtmb 5512 and s60 hull in different froude numbers they found that the roll amplitude and forward speed have more influence on the roll damping compared to the frequency of excitation gao and vassalos 2011 conducted numerical simulations for roll decay of dtmb 5415 in intact and damaged condition the model was equipped with bilge keels where the calculated roll damping was smaller than the model tests results begovic et al 2015 carried out cfd simulations using star ccm to calculate the roll damping of dtmb 5415 using a roll decay technique for both intact and damaged conditions the results were compared against experimental measurement where a reasonable accuracy was achieved in the recent study mancini et al 2018 carried out roll decay tests using numerical and experimental simulations to calculate the roll damping coefficients for the numerical uncertainty analysis the grid convergence index was used instead of the correlation factor method because the solutions were not close to the asymptotic range zhou et al 2015 performed numerical and model test measurements to compute the roll damping of four different ship models using the roll decay technique at froude number zero the simulation results had a good correlation with the experimental measurements one of the limitations in using the roll decay technique is inaccuracy to estimate the roll damping coefficient of large roll motions especially in forward speed the alternative method is the harmonic excited roll motion herm technique proposed by blume 1979 which appears a better solution to calculate the roll damping coefficient this method is based on exciting the model at its resonance frequency the main drawback of this technique is the long simulation time to measure the resonance frequency another disadvantage is the dependency of roll damping coefficient on maximum roll angle metacentric height and heel angle each of these items should be recorded and could be subject to the errors therefore the uncertainty of blume s method is high handschel and abdel maksoud 2014 presented an improved herm technique to estimate the damping coefficient for a range of frequencies very close to the resonance frequency they measured the phase shift between the exciting moments and the roll angles for other than 90 the advantages of this method are twofold the measuring time reduces to the range of roll decay and no further modification is required for the test set up in another approach wassermann et al 2016 conducted several model tests based on the roll decay and herm technique to calculate the roll damping of a post panamax container ship model they introduced different approaches for roll damping calculation without additional filtering curve fitting and offset manipulation for the recorded time series oliva remola et al 2018 carried out the herm technique by shifting a mass harmonically inside the model in the y direction to excite the model different masses were utilised to generate different roll angles for the same roll angle the calculated roll damping from herm technique was smaller than the roll decay method that is because the roll damping is calculated when the roll angle reaches a steady condition in the herm technique while in the roll decay the roll damping is calculated in a transient condition kianejad et al 2019c and s s kianejad et al 2018c conducted numerical simulations based on the herm technique to calculate roll damping of a post panamax container ship in model scale and full scale they also investigated the effects of froude numbers and degrees of freedom dof the full scale demonstrated relatively smaller roll damping because the impact of viscous effects on the roll damping is smaller in a high reynolds number they also pointed out that increasing the froude number and reducing the dof increase the roll damping somayajula and falzarano 2017 introduced an advanced system of identification to estimate frequency dependent roll damping from the results of experimental measurements in irregular waves the proposed method predicts the roll motion of the model precisely in comparison to the potential flow and empirical methods 1 2 added mass moment of inertia calculation the magnitude of the roll added mass moment of inertia is estimated to vary between 10 and 25 percent of the roll mass moment of inertia for displacement ships based on the potential flow approaches bikdash et al 1994 grinnaert et al 2016 schumacher et al 2016 taylan 2003 wright and marshfield 1979 for many years the work of bhattacharyya 1978 remained a reliable reference who performed analytical and experimental simulations to estimate the roll added mass moment of inertia he concluded that the roll added mass moment of inertia of a ship is about 20 of the roll mass moment of inertia one of the earlier investigations of added mass moment of inertia was carried out by salvesen et al 1970 who utilised the strip theory method to calculate 2d sectional added mass in roll motion which was expanded to 3d added mass moment of inertia by taking integration over the length of a ship later on das et al 2006 used a 2d sectional concept but applied the frank close fit method due to limitations of strip theory in accounting the impact of viscosity and turbulent flow around a ship especially in the roll motion subramanian 2012 applied an empirical correction to include the viscous effects jaouen et al 2011 carried out cfd simulations on a ship hull section to consider the viscous effects they submerged the model to remove the restoring moment and calculated the roll added mass moment of inertia using fourier series discusser et al 2014 used the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method to capture the flow behaviours around the model for calculating the added mass judge 2010 conducted a series of model tests at different forced roll angles forward speeds and excitation frequencies they observed that variation of frequency at the high range has a negligible impact on the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia while at a low frequency range the magnitude is dependent on the frequency and forward speed judge and judge 2013 also calculated the roll added mass moment of inertia of a planning hull based on the forced roll oscillation and investigated the impact of the forward speed and the roll amplitude they observed that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia is independent of the roll amplitude whereas increasing the forward speed reduces roll added mass magnitude in recent years kianejad et al 2019b and kianejad et al 2017 proposed a method based on the herm technique to compute the roll added mass moment of inertia of a post panamax container ship using cfd simulations they found out that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients of a bare hull model is smaller than the fully appended model it was also found that the full scale ship has a smaller added mass moment of inertia due to a smaller phase shift and angular acceleration they noticed that the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia depends on the forward speed roll angle and excitation frequency it appears that accuracy in estimation of the roll damping and added mass moment of inertia has a significant effect in the prediction of a ship motions for a range of frequencies close to the resonance frequency while the magnitude of these coefficients is unknown in wave conditions in this study cfd simulations and experimental measurements were performed for 35 cases in regular beam sea conditions to investigate the influence of five wave heights 0 025 0 05 0 075 0 1 and 0 125 m at seven wave frequencies from 0 57 to 0 69 hz with intervals of 0 02 hz close to the natural frequency of the model upon validation of the developed cfd model against experimental model tests the roll exciting and restoring moments were computed using cfd simulations since calculation through experimental measurements is not feasible in the next step the roll added mass moment of inertia and roll damping coefficients were calculated 2 model geometry in this study a model of bulk carrier ship froude s scale factor 1 100 is adopted to compute the magnitude of roll exciting and restoring moments as well as the roll damping and added mass moment of inertia coefficients the main particulars of the model are shown in table 1 the model had no appendages and was tested in regular beam sea conditions with no forward speed 3 experimental measurements the model tests were conducted in the towing tank with 100 m length 3 55 m width and 1 8 m depth the water depth was 1 5 m at the australian maritime college university of tasmania the towing tank s depth varies in one side of the towing tank shown in fig 1 a close to the beach while remains constant for the entire length of the tank including in the location of the model test set up a hydraulically driven wavemaker located at one end of the towing tank was used to produce regular waves a computer program was used to control the wavemaker paddle to produce a range of waves with different heights and frequencies a large beach is placed at the other end of the towing tank to minimise the wave reflections fig 1 illustrates the model position in the towing tank in a beam sea condition at an encounter angle of 90 to the regular waves to monitor the wave height and wave frequency of the produced waves four resistive type wave probes named as wp0 wp3 were utilised an optical motion tracking system qualisys with seven cameras was employed to capture the translational and rotational motions of the model as well as the roll angular velocity and roll angular acceleration the centre of gravity of the model was set as a reference for the motion characteristics calculation via three passive markers attached to the model it can be seen in fig 1 b c the model was restrained by ropes to decrease the sway and yaw motions the ropes were threaded through pulleys fig 1 c at both sides of the tank and were restrained by 1 kg weights using lighter weights increases the sway motion and makes challenge in capturing data by the qualisys system and using heavier weights decreases the sway motion which could decrease the roll motion kianejad et al 2019a kianejad et al 2018b the other sides of the ropes were attached to the bow and stern of the model via eye hooks the ropes were attached to the model at the free surface to reduce their impacts on the heave and pitch motions waves push the model in the flow direction and impose yaw angle because of the underwater asymmetric projected area with respect to the centre of gravity the ropes attached to the weights work as springs and counteract the wave force in y direction to bring the model into the initial position all devices were synchronised and the data was captured at 200 hz for both the wave probes and qualisys system 4 numerical modelling the following sections discuss the details of the numerical simulation method selected for this study 4 1 governing equations and physics modelling the numerical simulations were carried out using star ccm the software resolves integral forms of rans equations based on the finite volume method and a transient approach was selected as the simulation is a function of time the solver utilises the averaged continuity and momentum equations these equations for incompressible flow in terms of tensor form and cartesian coordinates are as follows ferziger et al 1997 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ uu p g x ρ μ u ρ τ in the cartesian coordinates u u v w represent time averaged velocity fields and is the gradient operator ρ is the density of water and air with a constant value for each one during the simulations p and g represent the time averaged pressure and gravitational acceleration respectively τ and μ are the reynolds tensor and the dynamic viscosity a predictor corrector method is employed to make a correlation between continuity and momentum equations the turbulence models are required to provide closure of the rans equations in a turbulent flow and to address the uncertainty of the stress tensor hence the sst and k omega turbulence model was selected the volume of fluid vof approach has been used for modelling of the free surface the free surface in calm water and wave condition changes during the simulation so that the second order convection scheme was selected to capture a sharp interface among phases the volume of fraction γ was utilised to track the fluids the magnitude of volume of fraction for the air and water phases is 0 and 1 respectively and a mixture of two fluids has an intermediate value the volume fraction distribution is modelled by the equations below 3 γ t u γ u r γ 1 γ 0 the last term of equation 3 is a compression term which reduces the smearing of interface and u r is the relative velocity the variation of ρ and μ can be calculated by 4 ρ γ ρ w a t e r 1 γ ρ a i r 5 μ γ μ w a t e r 1 γ μ a i r the implicit solver utilises the segregated flow model to solve the governing equations where convection terms were discretised by the second order upwind scheme and the simple algorithm was selected throughout the solution the model was free in 6dof to simulate the ship s motion like a real condition at sea thus the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi approach was used to feed the solver to compute different forces and moments which are acting on the model courant number cfl was utilised to choose a suitable time step and it should be less than 0 5 for the free surface to have numerical accuracy the maximum cfl for free surface and around the model was about 0 1 the convergence criteria of e 5 and 7 inner iterations per time step were considered the force from the waves in the y direction is large enough and the model experiences the sway motion when the model has sway motion it moves the weights on the other hand the weights try to bring the model to the initial position the y component of rope tension is a negligible force and cannot bring the model to the initial location especially for the larger wave heights hence four 10 n a summation of the weight force 9 8 n and a small value for pulleys frictions forces were applied to the model as shown in fig 2 at the free surface to reduce the sway and yaw motions when the model has positive or negative sway motions the forces with red and green arrows respectively act on the model to bring it back to the initial location as the simulations were set in beam sea condition with long crested regular waves and the moments generated by restraining forces were not considered the yaw and pitch motions are negligible the motions of the model are studied in section 6 1 4 2 mesh structure and generation selecting a suitable size of the domain reduces the simulation time and increases the accuracy of the results in this study the domain size was selected based on practical guidelines for ship cfd applications proposed by ittc 2011 where the inlet boundary is placed at 2 5 lpp upstream of the model while the outlet is placed at 4 lpp downstream of the model the top and bottom boundaries are located at 0 5 lpp and 1 lpp from the model respectively to avoid boundary effects on the simulation results the side boundaries are positioned at 0 4 lpp from the model in order to capture large motions the overset mesh approach was employed this approach consists of two regions including overset and background the overset region surrounds and moves with the body inside the motionless background mesh hadzic 2006 the size of the mesh inside the overset region was refined enough to capture the boundary layer flow separation during body motion wave making and vortices around the body four types of meshers were used to produce the mesh including trimmed prism layer surface and automatic surface repair meshers the trimmed mesher creates a high quality mesh while the prism layer mesh was utilised to generate orthogonal prismatic mesh next to the body to capture the velocity gradient and boundary layer the surface remesher was used to enhance the quality of the surface to create volume mesh finally the automatic surface repair was used to refine the geometry problems that remained after surface remeshing the size of cells inside the overset region is smaller than in the background region the cell size in the overset region and the background were matched using an overlap volumetric block to prevent divergence the mesh at the free surface was generated based on practical guidelines for ship cfd applications ittc 2011 according to these recommendations for regular wave conditions at least 40 cells per wavelength and 20 cells for the vertical direction of the free surface were considered the size of cells around the model was decreased to 40 of the basic cell size of the overset region 0 006 m is the base size and 15 inflation layers were generated by a stretching ratio of 1 3 using prism layer mesher to capture the boundary layer and flow separation around the body the all y wall treatment was used which is a hybrid method and emulates the low y wall treatment y 1 for fine meshes and high y wall treatment for coarse meshes they value is less than 1 to ensure the selected mesh configuration can compute the pressure and shear forces precisely fig 3 shows illustrations of the computation mesh details on the mesh sensitivity and uncertainty are provided in section 5 4 3 boundary and initial conditions to reduce the running time and boost the accuracy of simulation results suitable initial and boundary conditions were selected the velocity inlet boundary condition was set in upstream inlet of the model while the pressure outlet boundary was set in downstream outlet to prevent any backflow the top and bottom were set as velocity inlet kianejad et al 2019b cd adapco 2017 while the side walls were set as a wall like the model tests the magnitude of initial and boundary flow velocity at each velocity inlet boundary condition was set as a fifth order wave stokes wave condition the initial hydrostatic pressure of the fifth order wave stokes wave was set for the outlet boundary for the lager wave heights the wave profile in crest and trough is different and usually has a sharper crest and a wider trough the fifth order stokes wave produces more realistic regular waves like the one obtained for the model tests hence the fifth order waves were generated in this study the vof wave forcing method was applied at inlet and outlet boundaries to decrease the simulation time without compromising the results the solution of 3d navier stokes equations at forcing length region 3 m from each boundary peric 2018 is forced towards a simplified theory such as a theoretical solution or simplified numerical solution where the momentum sources are used not phase and turbulence sources as the 3d navier stokes equations are solving just at the vicinity of the model the simulation time decreases by setting the vof wave forcing method at the inlet and outlet boundaries propagating waves at the upstream decreases and better waves were produced in another attempt the inlet and outlet boundaries were extended by 1 lpp 2 5 1 lpp and 4 1 lpp to investigate the effect of domain size the results were quite similar compared with the original location of inlet and outlet boundaries 5 experimental uncertainty according to kim and hermansky 2014 the uncertainty of experimental measurements should be quantified to assess the quality of results the experimental uncertainty consists of type a and type b based on the iso gum s method the type a uncertainty is based on the repeatability of measurements and is manifested in experimental variance 6 s 2 q k 1 n 1 j 1 n q j q 2 where n is the number of repeated realizations and q j is the value from a single measurement q represents the mean value of the measured data the experimental standard deviation is defined as a positive square root of variance the standard type a uncertainty of a repeated measurement is computed by the equation below 7 s q s q k n the end to end multiple test run approach is a common approach of the repeatability of the measurement in this regard all influential parameters on measurement should be taken into account to reduce the magnitude of type a uncertainty the number of repeats should be large enough and generally 10 repeats are acceptable as the computation of uncertainty for all realizations is time consuming and costly uncertainty calculation for a couple of realizations is suitable hence the repeats should be carefully selected the type b uncertainty is defined by u i 2 and or u i which could be specified based on the variance and standard deviation the geometry of model measuring devices calibration and installation of devices data processing and presenting are the main sources of the type b uncertainty the accuracy of qualisys system and wave probe as measuring devices was chosen as sources of the type b uncertainty and remains constant throughout an experiment the total standard uncertainty of a measured value containing the type a and type b uncertainties can be computed by the equation below 8 u y i 1 n s 2 q j 1 k u 2 x 1 2 in the present study the uncertainty calculation was conducted in cases with a wave height of 0 125 m and different frequencies as shown in table 2 and table 3 the type b uncertainty is the same for different frequencies as it is related to the precision of measuring devices whereas the type a uncertainty is related to repeatability of the motion characteristics recordings when a model is excited at its natural frequency the variation of motion characteristics in different cycles is smaller compared to the frequencies far from the natural frequencies kianejad et al 2019a it can be seen in table 2 where the variations of motion characteristics are larger for lower frequencies 0 57 and 0 59 hz and the variations for frequencies of 0 65 and 0 67 hz are smaller as they are closer to the natural frequency of the model therefore the total standard uncertainty at a wave frequency of 0 57 hz is larger than the other cases while the total standard uncertainties are smaller for frequencies of 0 65 and 0 67 hz 6 numerical uncertainty analysis prior to commencing the simulations for different cases it is necessary to specify the uncertainty in simulation results to ensure the numerical approach simulates the physics accurately according to the verification method advised by stern et al 2001 numerical uncertainty u sn consists of iterative convergence uncertainty u i grid spacing uncertainty u g and time step uncertainty u t given in the following equation 9 u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 the simulation at a wave height of 0 125 m and a frequency of 0 65 hz was selected to compute the numerical uncertainty the grid spacing uncertainty of different mesh configurations was performed based on a richardson extrapolation kianejad et al 2018a three different mesh configurations with a refinement ratio of r g 2 were considered and the number of meshes for each case is shown in table 4 the simulation was based on coarse medium and fine mesh configurations shown by s 3 s 2 and s 1 respectively the variation of simulation results is calculated by the following equations 10 ε g 32 s 3 s 2 11 ε g 21 s 2 s 1 12 r g ε g 21 ε g 32 the numerical convergence ratio was calculated using equation 12 according to the convergence ratio four typical conditions can be predicted i monotonic convergence 0 r g 1 ii oscillatory convergence r g 0 r g 1 iii monotonic divergence r g 1 and iv oscillatory divergence r g 0 r g 1 numerical uncertainty in cases iii and iv cannot be computed because of divergence for case ii uncertainty can be computed based on bounding error with upper limit s u and lower limit s l by using the equation below 13 u g 1 2 s u s l in case i the generalised richardson extrapolation should be adopted to compute the numerical error δ r e g 1 and order of accuracy p g as shown in the equations below 14 δ r e g 1 ε g 21 r g p g 1 15 p g ln ε g 32 ε g 21 ln r g the correction factor c g which is defined in the equation below determines the method of uncertainty calculation p gest is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy 16 c g r g p g 1 r g p g e s t 1 if the c g is close to 1 the solutions are close to the asymptotic range and the numerical error δ

c g δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 if the value of cg is greater than 1 the solutions are far from the asymptotic range and the numerical uncertainty should be computed by 20 u g 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 2 1 c g 1 δ r e g 1 1 c g 0 125 the time step and iterative uncertainties were calculated in a similar procedure the other two sources of total uncertainty were considered in the fine cases to calculate the uncertainty from each of time step grid spacing and number of iterations the time step uncertainty analysis was started from δt t 28 with a refinement ratio of 2 r t 2 while for the iterative uncertainty which was based on the number of iterations starting from iteration number of 6 e 4 s 3 6e4 a refinement ratio of 2 was considered the numerical simulation results for different mesh configurations time steps number of iterations experimental measurements and the magnitude of uncertainties are presented in tables 5 7 fig 4 shows the time traces of simulation results against experimental measurements and it can be seen that there is a good correlation between them the magnitude of iterative uncertainties is negligible while the grid spacing uncertainty is the largest one accounting for 6 28 for the sway motion the simulation results for the fine mesh configuration and the smallest time step were closer to the experiment hence further simulations were performed based on the fine mesh configuration and smallest time step the validation uncertainty u υ can be calculated by equation 21 where u d is the experimental uncertainty the absolute comparison error e is the difference between the numerical and experimental measurements the absolute comparison error should be less than the validation uncertainty to validate the simulation results against experimental measurements 21 u υ u s n 2 u d 2 it can be seen in table 8 that the magnitude of validation uncertainty for all cases is larger than the magnitude of absolute error and therefore validation is confirmed the case of 0 1 m wave height and a wave frequency of 0 65 hz was chosen to investigate the influence of turbulence model and sidewall effects on the simulation results and to ensure the reliability of the selected numerical approach the simulations results are shown in table 9 the simulations were performed by a cluster with 140 cpus and the simulation time of the k epsilon turbulence model 19 h was lower than the sst and k omega turbulence model 24 h whereas the simulation results had larger discrepancies compared to the experimental measurements as the sst and k omega turbulence model generates more accurate results it was chosen for the rest of simulations both walls were positioned at 1 5 l from the model to investigate the effects of sidewalls on simulation results the numerical set up was the same for the original and new wall positions the simulation results in table 9 and fig 5 confirm that the wall effects are negligible since the simulations were conducted in beam sea condition and the width of the model is relatively small and the interaction between fluid and walls has a negligible impact on the model responses hence the original position of the side walls was considered for the rest of simulations to reduce the simulation time 7 results and discussion the motion amplitudes predicted using cfd are compared to the experimental measurements for various wave heights and wave frequencies the exciting moment and restoring moments are calculated and the latter is compared against the restoring moment corresponding to the hydrostatic condition the non dimensional roll damping and added mass moment of inertia are calculated when the model is located in crest and trough of a wave in the following sections the model in the crest and trough conditions reflect that the model is located in the first or second half of one period of a wave 7 1 motion characteristics the motion characteristics of the ship model including roll angle roll angular velocity roll angular acceleration and heave motion for different wave heights and wave frequencies are shown in fig 6 in general there is a good correlation between numerical cfd and experimental fluid dynamics efd results for each one of the motion characteristics two figures are presented where the left hand figures a d are recorded when the model was in the trough of a wave and the right side e h for the crest condition it is apparent that increasing the wave height increases the roll angle however the responses of the model to the different wave heights and wave frequencies are nonlinear for the smaller wave heights of 0 025 and 0 050 m increasing the wave frequency increases the roll angle to reach the maximum value at a wave frequency of 0 65 hz which is very close to the natural frequency of the model however reduction in the roll angle is apparent beyond this wave frequency at the larger wave heights of 0 1 and 0 125 m increasing the wave frequency increases the roll angle and the maximum roll angle occurs at a frequency of 0 67 hz and a further increase of the wave frequency slightly decreases the roll angle this is because the natural frequency of the model varies depends on the roll angle kianejad et al 2019b h enshaei and k 2018 when the magnitude of total roll mass moment of inertia and roll restoring moment is equal and in opposite direction a roll resonance condition occurs because only the roll damping opposes the exciting moment and the model experiences larger roll angle kianejad et al 2019a increasing the wave height roll angle increases the magnitude of roll restoring moment hence a higher excitation wave frequency is needed to produce a larger magnitude of total mass moment of inertia to cancel the restoring moment therefore increasing the wave height roll angle shifts the resonance frequency towards a higher value kianejad et al 2020 the roll angular velocity and acceleration have the same trends as the roll angle the maximum values occur at the resonance condition and their magnitudes decline at wave frequencies away from the resonance the magnitude of roll angular velocity and acceleration is larger at a higher frequency for the same roll angle at wave height 0 025 and 0 050 m due to larger excitation frequency it was observed that the magnitudes of roll angles for the crest and trough conditions are the same for smaller wave heights because the wave profile is the same for the crest and trough conditions fig 7 while for the larger wave heights the wave crest is sharper and the wave trough is wider the amplitude of roll angle in trough conditions are more significant than crest conditions especially for higher wave frequencies on the other hand the magnitude of roll angular acceleration of the model at the crest condition is larger as the roll velocity changes are larger because of the sharper wave crest the heave amplitude for the crest and trough conditions are almost the same for the smaller wave heights while at larger wave height 0 125 m increasing the wave frequency slightly increases the heave motion magnitude as the wave steepness increases 7 2 roll exciting and restoring moments calculations the magnitude of restoring moment depends on heave motion of the model and the location of a wave s crest and trough with respect to the model the upward buoyancy force which is defined as a product of the total pressure and projection of the underwater model area in the z direction varies based on the heave motion of the model fig 8 shows the heave motion of the model for various roll angles at different wave frequencies in the wave height of 0 1 m the variations of the upward buoyancy versus roll angle at different wave frequencies for two wave heights are shown in fig 9 for the higher wave frequencies the model has the maximum and minimum roll angles when it is located in the trough and crest of the wave respectively whereas for the lower frequencies the model experiences maximum and minimum roll angles when it has small heave motion therefore the upward buoyancy variation for lower frequencies is smaller than higher frequencies the variation in the wave height of 0 05 m is smaller because the wave has similar profile in trough and crest conditions while for the wave height of 0 1 m stokes wave the model has larger upward buoyancy when it is in the trough of a wave compared with being in the crest condition the upward buoyancy variation for the wave frequency of 0 67 hz is about 110 n which has a significant impact on the magnitude of restoring moment the magnitude of restoring moment m r e s is computed by equation 22 where c f and c b in fig 10 are the centre of floatation and centre of buoyancy several field functions user define functions were used to monitor c b and c f with respect to the centre of gravity and they were recorded in each time step the centre of buoyancy is the centroid of instant underwater volume or buoyancy force and can be calculated in each axis the centre of floatation is the centre of instant waterplane area in this study the intersection of water free surface and the model is a closed line waterplane area and its centroid c f was calculated using field function it can be seen in fig 10 d 1 is the distance between centres of floatation and buoyancy while d 2 is the distance between centres of floatation and gravity c g f by and w are upward buoyancy force and weight of the model the vertical component of dynamic pressure which is negligible was considered in the restoring moment calculation along with upward buoyancy force 22 m re s f b y d 1 w d 2 another influential parameter on the magnitude of restoring moment is the location of a wave with respect to the model fig 11 shows the position of the waves with respect to the model at different roll angles for two wave frequencies at a wave height of 0 1 m the red line represents the free surface in a calm water condition to compare the free surface alterations in the dynamic and hydrostatic conditions the restoring moment values for different roll angles at the hydrostatic condition were calculated by cfd simulations and the results were similar to the results obtained by maxsurf stability software version 20 the restoring moments versus roll angles at different wave frequencies and two wave heights are shown in fig 12 at the wave frequency of 0 69 hz and 12 5 degrees of roll angle a portion of buoyancy moves towards the low side hence by increasing the distance between centres of buoyancy and gravity the restoring moment increases compared to the calm water condition fig 12 b whereas the magnitude of restoring moment at the same roll angle and a wave frequency of 0 57 hz is smaller than restoring moment in the calm water this is because a part of buoyancy moves from the low side to the opposite side and the distance between the centres of buoyancy and gravity decreases the restoring moment for positive roll angles in trough condition is larger than negative roll angles in crest condition due to the greater magnitude of upward buoyancy force and larger distance between the centres of buoyancy and gravity even at zero roll angle the model has restoring moment due to the wave position fig 11 and the restoring moment acts as an exciting moment to impose roll angle in the opposite direction the magnitude of restoring moment for the same roll angle for the wave heights of 0 05 and 0 1 m is different because of different upward buoyancies and wave positions the exciting moments m e x c 44 induced on the model from the waves are calculated by the following equation as can be seen in fig 10 b where f l and d are the lateral force resultant of horizontal buoyancy force f bx and dynamic pressure force from the wave and its lever to the centre of floatation as no bilge keels were attached to the model the magnitude of dynamic pressure was small it means both static and total pressures were captured during simulations and the difference was negligible 23 m e x c 44 f l d the magnitudes of the exciting moments for various roll angles at different wave frequencies and a wave height of 0 1 m are shown in fig 8 as the half cycle of a wave trough to crest was selected to investigate the roll exciting and restoring moments the magnitude of exciting moment is positive and in the next cycle crest to trough is negative as the lateral force has negative sign the exciting moment has maximum value when the model has zero heave motion because the slope of the free surface at the zero wave elevation is maximum for the positive roll angles the exciting moment contributes to increase the roll angle while for the negative roll angles it opposes the roll angle development increasing the wave height increases the variation and magnitude of exciting and restoring moments as mentioned above the magnitude of roll restoring moment varies at different wave heights and frequencies even for the same roll angle thus considering the restoring moment from the hydrostatic calculation increases the discrepancies of the simulations 7 3 roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient the equation of rotational motions including roll in a body local system regarding the centre of gravity is cd adapco 2017 24 i d ω d t ω i ω m m p m v where i and ω represent the tensor of mass moment of inertia and angular velocity of the model m is the moment on the model and indices of p and v are the pressure and viscous parts by restraining the model in sway and yaw motion the magnitude of these motions was decreased however the model remains free in 6 dof and different motions influence on other motions the focus of this study is calculation of the roll motion coefficients hence the 6 dof equations of motion can be simplified into a 1 dof equation as below where the hydrodynamic coefficients are still under the influence of the all motions 25 i 44 δ i 44 ϕ 4 n 44 ϕ 4 s 44 ϕ 4 m e x c 44 in the equation above i 44 and δ i 44 are the roll mass and added mass moment of inertia coefficients n 44 and s 44 represent the roll damping and restoring coefficients respectively there are linear and nonlinear relations between the hydrodynamic coefficients and roll motion characteristics as can be seen in figs 12 and 13 the model reaches the steady state condition after a couple of cycles and maintains the same amplitude of roll motion characteristics in the following cycles the computation of roll motion coefficients was conducted for a couple of cycles which had the same amplitude of roll motion characteristics when the model has maximum or minimum roll angle in the trough and crest of a wave the angular velocity of the model is almost zero the damping moment is negligible and the roll added mass moment of inertia could be computed by equation 25 kianejad et al 2019b as the other moments including the exciting moment restoring moment and roll mass moment of inertia are known over the simulation s time fig 8 the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients at different wave heights and frequencies both for the trough a and crest b conditions are shown in fig 13 it is made non dimensional dividing by the roll mass moment of inertia the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients for different wave heights at lower wave frequencies has smaller differences because the conditions are far from the resonance condition while the differences increase at higher wave frequencies as the model at the larger wave heights experiences the resonance at higher frequencies the coefficients at smaller wave heights and higher wave frequencies are larger because of the smaller induced acceleration while the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia moments are greater at the larger wave heights the added mass moment of inertia in calm water condition has positive sign and exciting moment and total mass moment of inertia contributes to increase the roll motion while damping and restoring moment oppose the roll motion development kianejad et al 2019a at a resonance frequency the magnitude of total mass moment of inertia and restoring moment is equal and in opposite direction hence the model experiences maximum roll angle while for the same exciting moment and at low and high excitation frequencies these moments cannot counteract each other and the model generates smaller roll motion the magnitudes of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients at lower wave frequencies are negative which implies that they act against the roll motion development it is mainly because of the location of the model with respect to the wave as well as smaller acceleration of the model shown in fig 8 at a frequency of 0 57 hz fig 8 a the model experiences maximum roll angle when it has smallest heave motion compared with other frequencies it means the model is far from the crest and trough and the rate of flow velocity changes acceleration of the flow around the model is more significant fig 14 compared with the acceleration induced by the model and in the opposite direction of the model rolling increasing the wave frequency fig 8 increases the model acceleration and the model has maximum roll angle at larger heave motion while the flow acceleration value decreases compared with the model acceleration hence by increasing the wave frequency up to 0 63 hz the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia decreases at higher wave frequencies the model experiences the maximum minimum roll angle at the trough and crest conditions where the flow acceleration induced by the model is dominant and the flow velocity variation is small the roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient at low wave frequencies for the model in trough and crest conditions have the similar values whereas for the larger wave heights and higher wave frequencies the crest conditions have smaller values because of the larger acceleration larger moment of roll mass moment of inertia 7 4 roll damping coefficient the roll damping is calculated using equation 26 when the roll angle is small the roll damping moment is maximum and the corresponding restoring exciting and virtual mass moment of inertia moments were calculated as explained in the previous sections it was assumed in each case that there is a linear relationship between the roll damping coefficient and roll angular velocity while it has been shown by several researchers that there are both linear and nonlinear relationships between them based on the method proposed by oliva remola et al 2018 and irkal et al 2019 and using fitting curve functions the linear and nonlinear parts of the roll damping can be computed from the computed roll damping coefficient considering the linear relationship with the roll angular velocity regardless of the roll damping calculation technique a polynomial expansion of the roll angle or roll angular velocity can be used to approximate the roll damping coefficient oliva remola et al 2018 including linear and nonlinear parts which is not the focus of this study the roll damping coefficient can be non dimensional by equation 27 reed 2011 the roll damping coefficients for various wave frequencies at various wave heights for the trough left hand and crest right hand conditions are shown in fig 15 26 n 44 m e x c 44 i 44 δ i 44 ϕ 4 s 44 ϕ 4 ϕ 4 27 b 44 n 44 ρ b w l 2 b w l 2 g it can be seen that there is a nonlinear relation between the magnitude of roll damping the wave height and wave frequency increasing the wave height increases the magnitude of roll damping both for the crest and trough conditions because the viscous effect which is a significant part of total roll damping increases for smaller wave heights increasing the wave frequency increases the roll damping to reach a peak and declines after that since the frequency moves away from the resonance condition in contrast for the larger wave heights where the higher wave frequencies are closer to the natural frequency of the model increasing the wave frequency increases the magnitude of roll damping coefficients because of the larger exciting moment from waves the magnitude of roll damping at lower wave frequencies for both the trough and crest have similar values due to the model is far from resonance and the magnitudes of exciting moment and restoring moment are small while for the higher frequencies the crest condition fig 15 b has large values due to the greater excitation moment from a larger free surface slope fig 16 shows the variation of roll damping versus the roll angular velocity increasing the roll velocity increases the magnitude of roll damping however the rate of increase for the larger wave height is greater it means the nonlinearity of roll damping increases it can be seen that the nonlinearity for the trough condition fig 16 a is smaller than crest condition fig 16 b for the larger wave heights and that is mainly because of wider trough and variation of angular velocity is relatively smaller as above the magnitude of hydrodynamic coefficients in regular beam sea conditions are different compared to the still water condition and this should be taken into account to improve ship roll motion prediction 8 concluding remarks numerical and experimental simulations were conducted in regular beam sea conditions to investigate the influence of wave height and frequency on ship motion characteristics and roll hydrodynamic coefficients in general increasing the wave height increases the roll motion while the model experiences the maximum roll motion around the resonance frequency as at smaller wave heights the motion characteristics are the same as the surface elevation both in trough and crest are the same at higher wave heights the wave has a wider trough and sharper crest hence the model remains more time in trough condition so the induced roll angle is larger on the other hand the model has larger roll angular acceleration in crest condition the magnitude of restoring moment in a dynamic condition can be either smaller or larger than the hydrostatic condition depending on the magnitude of buoyancy force and the position of the wave with respect to the model the model has a larger restoring moment when it is in a trough condition due to the larger buoyancy force and larger distance between the centres of buoyancy and gravity at lower wave frequencies the magnitude of restoring moment in the dynamic condition is smaller than the hydrostatic condition however at higher wave frequencies the magnitude of restoring moment in the dynamic condition is larger the exciting moment form waves on the model in one half cycle is positive and turns into negative in the next half cycle which has its maximum value at a surface elevation of zero due to maximum slope of the free surface the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficient varies at different wave frequencies at a low wave frequency it has a negative value which resists the roll motion because of the flow acceleration around the model is dominant and in the opposite direction of the model rolling motion while at higher wave frequencies the coefficients are positive and contribute to the roll motion development although the magnitude of roll added mass moment of inertia coefficients at different wave heights are the same at some frequencies the magnitudes of their moments are higher around the resonance frequency and larger wave height it was observed that there is a nonlinear relationship between the magnitude of roll damping and wave height and frequency the roll damping coefficient around the resonance frequency is larger than other frequencies and the magnitude of roll damping increases by increasing the wave height the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of calculating roll added mass moment of inertia roll damping roll restoring moment and roll exciting moment using a dynamic approach to provide an accurate assessment of a ship roll behaviours credit authorship contribution

that associated to pipes without imperfections recently some attempts dehrouyeh semnani et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2019 have been done to determine the effect of geometric imperfection on the stability and nonlinear vibration of nano and micropipes conveying fluid from the literature review it is found that the influences of geometric imperfections on dynamics of fluid conveying fg pipes have not been investigated so far hence the effect of eccentricity imperfection induced by improper manufacturing processes on the stability and vibration behaviors of fg pipes conveying fluid is studied in this paper certainly this investigation is important in the conveying fluid pipe research area both eccentric and concentric homogenous and fg pipes are investigated a power law distribution is assumed for the material properties variation along the radial direction of the fg pipes finite element formulation of the fluid structure interaction problem is used based on the timoshenko beam theory finally the behavior of piping systems with different magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection is investigated and discussed in details 2 functionally graded fluid conveying pipe

assumed as follow 23 q ξ τ r e q ξ e i ω τ where ω q ξ are the dimensionless circular frequency and the amplitude of harmonically varying field variable respectively the eigenvalue equation of the motion equation is obtained by introducing eq 23 into eq 22 24 ω 2 m i ω c k q ξ 0 finally the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the system are calculated by solving the above equation 4 numerical results and discussions numerical results for fluid conveying homogenous and fg pipes with and without eccentricity imperfection are presented in the three following subsections the dimensionless circular frequency ω ωl 2 m f m p e 1 j p and the dimensionless flow velocity u vl m f e 1 j p are defined to present the numerical results mass ratio of the pipe is also defined by the relation β m f m f m p where m f and m p are mass per unit length of fluid and pipe respectively the effects of an eccentricity as a geometric imperfection on the first four eigenfrequencies of the system are discussed in details in all numerical results the pipe length inner and outer radii the density of fluid conveying in the pipeline are selected to be l 1010 mm r i 9 8 mm r o 13 mm ρf 1000 kg m3 fig 1 respectively firstly the straight pipe with zero eccentricity has been modeled based on the both euler bernoulli and timoshenko beam theories to validate the numerical results the obtained results are presented in table 1 and fig 4 a and b the results are also compared with those presented by zare et al 2017 based on the euler bernoulli beam theory variations of the real and imaginary parts of dimensionless first four frequencies with dimensionless fluid velocity are shown the values of dimensionless frequencies for fluid fill pipe u 0 are in excellent agreement with those given by zare et al 2017 table 1 also it is concluded from fig 4 that the first divergence re stabilization of 1st mode and the first coupled mode flutter hamiltonian type between 1st and 2nd modes occur at u 5 9341 u 7 9575 and u 8 0850 respectively these values are accurate enough comparing to the values predicted by using euler bernoulli beam theory given in zare et al 2017 which are 6 284 8 989 and 9 295 respectively 4 1 the homogenous pipe with eccentricity imperfection in this section the obtained results for homogenous imperfect pipe with different eccentricity magnitudes young modulus e 70 gpa shear modulus g 26 gpa and mass density ρ 2700 k g m 3 are presented in this state the corresponding mass parameters for different eccentricity parameter e are presented in table 2 fig 5 a and b shows the variations of real part r e ω and imaginary part i m ω of first four complex eigenfrequencies with non dimensional flow velocity u for the pipe with eccentricity magnitude e 0 4 in this case the boundaries of the pipe cross section are shown in the solid black circles in the figure it is seen that the values of first four eigenfrequencies at stationary fluid state u 0 are 21 0903 53 9153 97 2972 and 147 5928 respectively by increasing the velocity of fluid flow all frequencies decrease the real part of first dimensionless frequency vanishes at u 6 0575 that shows the 1st mode divergence of the system as shown in fig 5 b at higher velocities the imaginary part of the first mode becomes nonzero and then comebacks to the zero magnitude at u 8 1234 this phenomenon is known as the re stabilization of the system s first mode the combination of the first and second modes is happen at u 8 2547 and a coupled mode flutter via a hamiltonian hopf bifurcation is created this coupled mode flutter maintains until u 10 0842 whereas the second and the third modes become combined similarly at critical flow velocity u 11 6161 the 3rd and 4th mode are combined and a couple mode flutter is created variations of the real and imaginary parts of eigenfrequencies of the pipes with eccentricity magnitude e 0 6 and 0 8 are plotted in figs 6 7 a b all of important points including 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter 2nd and 3rd coupled mode flutters are indicated in these figures for case e 0 6 fig 6 a and b the first mode divergence and re stabilization occur at u 6 2275 and u 8 3457 respectively a coupled mode flutter hamiltonian type between the 1st and 2nd modes take places at u 8 5184 at u 10 3640 the coupled mode flutter between the two first modes are terminated and another coupled mode flutter between the second and third modes is generated the second divergence of the first mode happens at u 10 8003 for the eccentricity magnitude e 0 8 considered in fig 7 a and b the 1st mode divergence occurred at u 6 4886 and u 8 7091 respectively comparing figs 6 7 a b shows that the critical velocity of fluid flow associated to different phenomena in the physics of conveying fluid pipe including divergence and flutter increases by increasing the magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection summary of the obtained results for the pipes with different magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection is shown in fig 8 in this figure the variations of 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter velocities with imperfection magnitude e are plotted different stability regions are also determined in the figure as seen the critical velocity of fluid flow for the divergence re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter increases by increasing the magnitude of pipe eccentricity imperfection fig 9 a and b compares the real and imaginary parts of first four eigenfrequencies of the pipe with and without eccentricity imperfection e 0 0 8 all details of modes variations are shown it is seen that for the case e 0 8 the values of first four eigenfrequencies at stationary fluid state u 0 are 22 0914 56 4738 101 9130 and 154 5923 respectively which are higher than those associated to the perfect pipe e 0 also it is seen that all physical phenomena in eccentric pipe including 1st mode divergence 1st mode restabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode 2nd and 3rd coupled mode occur at higher critical flow velocity the real part variations of the first and second dimensionless eigenfrequencies of the eccentric pipe are shown in fig 10 a and b in terms of the dimensionless fluid velocity u and the eccentricity imperfection it is seen that the eccentricity magnitude has a significant effect on the 1st mode divergence of the system and increasing e will increase the critical velocity of fluid flow for the 1st mode divergence of the system moreover by increasing the value of the eccentricity the critical flow velocity corresponding to the re stabilization points of the 1st mode are also increased in other words a pipe with higher magnitude of eccentricity can provide a higher critical flow velocity for the divergence form fig 10 b it can be also concluded that the eccentricity magnitude has a significant effect on the 2nd variation 4 2 the fg pipe without eccentricity imperfection in this section the analysis is conducted for the perfect fg pipe with continuously graded variation of mechanical properties a power law distribution equation 3 for variation of the fgm composition is considered it is obvious that when the power law exponent n 0 and n the pipe becomes a homogenous pipe with the inside surface material and the outside surface material respectively the properties values for the inside and the outside constituents materials are as follows 25 ceramic a l 2 o 3 ρ a l 2 o 3 3960 k g m 3 e a l 2 o 3 393 g p a g a l 2 o 3 157 gpa metal al ρ a l 2700 k g m 3 e a l 70 gpa g a l 26 gpa table 3 shows the effect of power index n on the mass ratio β m f and m p variations of real and imaginary parts of the first four eigenfrequencies with respect to flow velocity and power law exponent are depicted in figs 11 13 a b the corresponding mass ratio for n 1 5 10 are 0 2857 0 3136 0 3203 respectively it is found that the rate of eigenfrequencies changes increases with increasing the power law exponent these figures show that for power index n 1 5 a n d 10 when the flow velocity reaches u 10 3039 u 7 4304 and u 6 7502 the real part of the first complex frequency vanishes and subsequently it remains zero and the first eigenfrequency becomes pure imaginary value furthermore it is seen that the flow velocity for first mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd couped mode flutter 2nd and 3rd couple mode flutter and 3rd and 4th couple mode flutter decreases with increasing the power law index the real and imaginary parts variations of the first eigenfrequency versus the power law exponent and flow velocity are compared in fig 14 a and b a non linear relationship between the critical flow velocity and power law index is observed it means that when the power law is smaller than n 10 the critical velocity of fluid flow decreases with higher rate with increasing the power law index however for high magnitudes of power law exponent n 10 this influence is small so it is found that the small values of power law exponent have a significant influence on the initiation of pipe conveying fluid divergence behavior variations of the first four complex eigenfrequencies for power indices n 5 10 versus flow velocity are depicted in fig 15 a and b it is shown that the 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter 2nd and 3rd coupled mode flutter and 3rd and 4th coupled mode flutter for power law index n 5 occurs at higher critical flow velocity in comparison with the power law index n 10 summary of the obtained results for conveying fluid fg perfect pipe is shown in fig 16 versus the power law exponent variations of 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter velocities are plotted as seen the critical flow velocity for divergence re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter decreases by increasing the power law exponent 4 3 the fg pipe with eccentricity imperfection the effect of eccentricity imperfection on the dimensionless eigenfrequencies of functionally graded pipe is discussed here the fg pipe is assumed to be constituted of materials same as considered in the previous section in figs 17 18 a b the effects of eccentricity as a geometric imperfection on the complex eigenfrequencies are shown the power law index is assumed to be n 1 the mass parameters of the problem are shown in table 4 the obtained results for the first eigenfrequencies of the fg pipes with different eccentricity values are compared in fig 19 a and b it is concluded that the critical velocity associated to the 1st mode divergence and 1st mode re stabilization increases with the increase of the eccentricity imperfection moreover in comparison with homogenous pipe fig 10 a the eccentricity imperfection shows a higher effect on the critical flow velocity of the fgm pipe 5 conclusions as a novelty the influence of eccentricity e as a geometric imperfection caused by the improper manufacturing process on the dynamic characteristics of fluid conveying homogenous and fg pipes is examined in this paper for the fg pipe the variation of material properties is assumed to be based on a power law distribution through the radial direction the piping systems with different magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection are studied for this purpose the governing equations of the fluid structure interaction problem are derived based on the timoshenko beam theory using the hamilton s principle subsequently the finite element formulation of the system is presented the results for conveying fluid pipe with different values of eccentricity imperfection and power law exponent are obtained numerical results showed that the magnitude of eccentricity imperfection has a significant effect on the variations of pipe eigenfrequencies the imperfection changes the critical flow velocities of the system and the higher eccentricity magnitudes result the higher critical flow velocities of the system for fg pipes the rate of eigenfrequencies variations increases with increasing the power law exponent for fg pipe the critical flow velocities associated to the 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter 2nd and 3rd coupled mode flutter and 3rd and 4th coupled mode flutter decrease with increasing the power law exponent n when the power law is smaller than n 10 the critical velocity of fluid flow decreases with higher rate with increasing the power law index however for high magnitudes of power law exponent n 10 this influence is small the small values of power law exponent have a significant influence on the initiation of pipe conveying fluid divergence behavior the eccentricity imperfection has a higher effect on the critical flow velocities of the fg pipe in comparison with the homogenous pipe the presented results provide a better insight to the application of imperfect pipelines in different systems such as oil pipelines heat exchangers and micro fluidic devices also this investigation is expected to provide a guideline for the future studies on the other types of geometric imperfection in the pipeline systems author statement this paper has been prepared individually by the author declaration of competing interest none

that associated to pipes without imperfections recently some attempts dehrouyeh semnani et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2019 have been done to determine the effect of geometric imperfection on the stability and nonlinear vibration of nano and micropipes conveying fluid from the literature review it is found that the influences of geometric imperfections on dynamics of fluid conveying fg pipes have not been investigated so far hence the effect of eccentricity imperfection induced by improper manufacturing processes on the stability and vibration behaviors of fg pipes conveying fluid is studied in this paper certainly this investigation is important in the conveying fluid pipe research area both eccentric and concentric homogenous and fg pipes are investigated a power law

the global system is obtained as 22 m q ˆ c q ˆ k q ˆ 0 the equation 22 must be solved to determine mode shapes and natural frequencies of convey fluid pipe the solution of the equation 22 can be assumed as follow 23 q ξ τ r e q ξ e i ω τ where ω q ξ are the dimensionless circular frequency and the amplitude of harmonically varying field variable respectively the eigenvalue equation of the motion equation is obtained by introducing eq 23 into eq 22 24 ω 2 m i ω c k q ξ 0 finally the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the system are calculated by solving the above equation 4 numerical results and discussions numerical results for fluid conveying homogenous and fg pipes with and without eccentricity imperfection are presented in the three following subsections the dimensionless circular frequency ω ωl 2 m f m p e 1 j p and the dimensionless flow velocity u vl m f e 1 j p are defined to present the numerical results mass ratio of the pipe is also defined by the relation β m f m f m p where m f and m p are mass per unit length of fluid and pipe respectively the effects of an eccentricity as a geometric imperfection on the first four eigenfrequencies of the system are discussed in details in all numerical results the pipe length inner and outer radii the density of fluid conveying in the pipeline are selected to be l 1010 mm r i 9 8 mm r o 13 mm ρf 1000 kg m3 fig 1 respectively firstly the straight pipe with zero eccentricity has been modeled based on the both euler bernoulli and timoshenko beam theories to validate the numerical results the obtained results are presented in table 1 and fig 4 a and b the results are also compared with those presented by zare et al 2017 based on the euler bernoulli beam theory variations of the real and imaginary parts of dimensionless first four frequencies with dimensionless fluid velocity are shown the values of dimensionless frequencies for fluid fill pipe u 0 are in excellent agreement with those given by zare et al 2017 table 1 also it is concluded from fig 4 that the first divergence re stabilization of 1st mode and the first coupled mode flutter hamiltonian type between 1st and 2nd modes occur at u 5 9341 u 7 9575 and u 8 0850 respectively these values are accurate enough comparing to the values predicted by using euler bernoulli beam theory given in zare et al 2017 which are 6 284 8 989 and 9 295 respectively 4 1 the homogenous pipe with eccentricity imperfection in this section the obtained results for homogenous imperfect pipe with different eccentricity magnitudes young modulus e 70 gpa shear modulus g 26 gpa and mass density ρ 2700 k g m 3 are presented in this state the corresponding mass parameters for different eccentricity parameter e are presented in table 2 fig 5 a and b shows the variations of real part r e ω and imaginary part i m ω of first four complex eigenfrequencies with non dimensional flow velocity u for the pipe with eccentricity magnitude e 0 4 in this case the boundaries of the pipe cross section are shown in the solid black circles in the figure it is seen that the values of first four eigenfrequencies at stationary fluid state u 0 are 21 0903 53 9153 97 2972 and 147 5928 respectively by increasing the velocity of fluid flow all frequencies decrease the real part of first dimensionless frequency vanishes at u 6 0575 that shows the 1st mode divergence of the system as shown in fig 5 b at higher velocities the imaginary part of the first mode becomes nonzero and then comebacks to the zero magnitude at u 8 1234 this phenomenon is known as the re stabilization of the system s first mode the combination of the first and second modes is happen at u 8 2547 and a coupled mode flutter via a hamiltonian hopf bifurcation is created this coupled mode flutter maintains until u 10 0842 whereas the second and the third modes become combined similarly at critical flow velocity u 11 6161 the 3rd and 4th mode are combined and a couple mode flutter is created variations of the real and imaginary parts of eigenfrequencies of the pipes with eccentricity magnitude e 0 6 and 0 8 are plotted in figs 6 7 a b all of important points including 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter 2nd and 3rd coupled mode flutters are indicated in these figures for case e 0 6 fig 6 a and b the first mode divergence and re stabilization occur at u 6 2275 and u 8 3457 respectively a coupled mode flutter hamiltonian type between the 1st and 2nd modes take places at u 8 5184 at u 10 3640 the coupled mode flutter between the two first modes are terminated and another coupled mode flutter between the second and third modes is generated the second divergence of the first mode happens at u 10 8003 for the eccentricity magnitude e 0 8 considered in fig 7 a and b the 1st mode divergence occurred at u 6 4886 and u 8 7091 respectively comparing figs 6 7 a b shows that the critical velocity of fluid flow associated to different phenomena in the physics of conveying fluid pipe including divergence and flutter increases by increasing the magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection summary of the obtained results for the pipes with different magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection is shown in fig 8 in this figure the variations of 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter velocities with imperfection magnitude e are plotted different stability regions are also determined in the figure as seen the critical velocity of fluid flow for the divergence re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter increases by increasing the magnitude of pipe eccentricity imperfection fig 9 a and b compares the real and imaginary parts of first four eigenfrequencies of the pipe with and without eccentricity imperfection e 0 0 8 all details of modes variations are shown it is seen that for the case e 0 8 the values of first four eigenfrequencies at stationary fluid state u 0 are 22 0914 56 4738 101 9130 and 154 5923 respectively which are higher than those associated to the perfect pipe e 0 also it is seen that all physical phenomena in eccentric pipe including 1st mode divergence 1st mode restabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode 2nd and 3rd coupled mode occur at higher critical flow velocity the real part variations of the first and second dimensionless eigenfrequencies of the eccentric pipe are shown in fig 10 a and b in terms of the dimensionless fluid velocity u and the eccentricity imperfection it is seen that the eccentricity magnitude has a significant effect on the 1st mode divergence of the system and increasing e will increase the critical velocity of fluid flow for the 1st mode divergence of the system moreover by increasing the value of the eccentricity the critical flow velocity corresponding to the re stabilization points of the 1st mode are also increased in other words a pipe with higher magnitude of eccentricity can provide a higher critical flow velocity for the divergence form fig 10 b it can be also concluded that the eccentricity magnitude has a significant effect on the 2nd variation 4 2 the fg pipe without eccentricity imperfection in this section the analysis is conducted for the perfect fg pipe with continuously graded variation of mechanical properties a power law distribution equation 3 for variation of the fgm composition is considered it is obvious that when the power law exponent n 0 and n the pipe becomes a homogenous pipe with the inside surface material and the outside surface material respectively the properties values for the inside and the outside constituents materials are as follows 25 ceramic a l 2 o 3 ρ a l 2 o 3 3960 k g m 3 e a l 2 o 3 393 g p a g a l 2 o 3 157 gpa metal al ρ a l 2700 k g m 3 e a l 70 gpa g a l 26 gpa table 3 shows the effect of power index n on the mass ratio β m f and m p variations of real and imaginary parts of the first four eigenfrequencies with respect to flow velocity and power law exponent are depicted in figs 11 13 a b the corresponding mass ratio for n 1 5 10 are 0 2857 0 3136 0 3203 respectively it is found that the rate of eigenfrequencies changes increases with increasing the power law exponent these figures show that for power index n 1 5 a n d 10 when the flow velocity reaches u 10 3039 u 7 4304 and u 6 7502 the real part of the first complex frequency vanishes and subsequently it remains zero and the first eigenfrequency becomes pure imaginary value furthermore it is seen that the flow velocity for first mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd couped mode flutter 2nd and 3rd couple mode flutter and 3rd and 4th couple mode flutter decreases with increasing the power law index the real and imaginary parts variations of the first eigenfrequency versus the power law exponent and flow velocity are compared in fig 14 a and b a non linear relationship between the critical flow velocity and power law index is observed it means that when the power law is smaller than n 10 the critical velocity of fluid flow decreases with higher rate with increasing the power law index however for high magnitudes of power law exponent n 10 this influence is small so it is found that the small values of power law exponent have a significant influence on the initiation of pipe conveying fluid divergence behavior variations of the first four complex eigenfrequencies for power indices n 5 10 versus flow velocity are depicted in fig 15 a and b it is shown that the 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter 2nd and 3rd coupled mode flutter and 3rd and 4th coupled mode flutter for power law index n 5 occurs at higher critical flow velocity in comparison with the power law index n 10 summary of the obtained results for conveying fluid fg perfect pipe is shown in fig 16 versus the power law exponent variations of 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter velocities are plotted as seen the critical flow velocity for divergence re stabilization and 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter decreases by increasing the power law exponent 4 3 the fg pipe with eccentricity imperfection the effect of eccentricity imperfection on the dimensionless eigenfrequencies of functionally graded pipe is discussed here the fg pipe is assumed to be constituted of materials same as considered in the previous section in figs 17 18 a b the effects of eccentricity as a geometric imperfection on the complex eigenfrequencies are shown the power law index is assumed to be n 1 the mass parameters of the problem are shown in table 4 the obtained results for the first eigenfrequencies of the fg pipes with different eccentricity values are compared in fig 19 a and b it is concluded that the critical velocity associated to the 1st mode divergence and 1st mode re stabilization increases with the increase of the eccentricity imperfection moreover in comparison with homogenous pipe fig 10 a the eccentricity imperfection shows a higher effect on the critical flow velocity of the fgm pipe 5 conclusions as a novelty the influence of eccentricity e as a geometric imperfection caused by the improper manufacturing process on the dynamic characteristics of fluid conveying homogenous and fg pipes is examined in this paper for the fg pipe the variation of material properties is assumed to be based on a power law distribution through the radial direction the piping systems with different magnitudes of eccentricity imperfection are studied for this purpose the governing equations of the fluid structure interaction problem are derived based on the timoshenko beam theory using the hamilton s principle subsequently the finite element formulation of the system is presented the results for conveying fluid pipe with different values of eccentricity imperfection and power law exponent are obtained numerical results showed that the magnitude of eccentricity imperfection has a significant effect on the variations of pipe eigenfrequencies the imperfection changes the critical flow velocities of the system and the higher eccentricity magnitudes result the higher critical flow velocities of the system for fg pipes the rate of eigenfrequencies variations increases with increasing the power law exponent for fg pipe the critical flow velocities associated to the 1st mode divergence 1st mode re stabilization 1st and 2nd coupled mode flutter 2nd and 3rd coupled mode flutter and 3rd and 4th coupled mode flutter decrease with increasing the power law exponent n when the power law is smaller than n 10 the critical velocity of fluid flow decreases with higher rate with increasing the power law index however for high magnitudes of power law exponent n 10 this influence is small the small values of power law exponent have a significant influence on the initiation of pipe conveying fluid divergence behavior the eccentricity imperfection has a higher effect on the critical flow velocities of the fg pipe in comparison with the homogenous pipe the presented results provide a better insight to the application of imperfect pipelines in different systems such as oil pipelines heat exchangers and micro fluidic devices also this investigation is expected to provide a guideline for the future studies on the other types of geometric imperfection in the pipeline systems author statement this paper has been prepared individually by the author declaration of competing interest none

introduction the anti explosion and anti impact capability of surface ships directly affects the vitality and attack capability of ships and is one of the important indexes to measure the combat performance of surface ships surface ships are vulnerable to underwater explosions although non contact explosion does not generally cause fatal blow to ships and serious damage to the local structure of hull various precision electronic instruments such as navigation and weapons systems are sensitive to the impact loading in the actual projects the impact resistance of electronic equipment is most sensitive to the change of spectral acceleration therefore it is of vital importance to predict the spectral acceleration of ships quickly and accurately in the preliminary design stage of ships to carry out the design of anti impact protection of structures and to change passive design into active design chenxie and jin boguo 2017 in the design stage of surface ships the impact resistance of ships is often checked by theoretical analysis numerical simulation and other technical means jun guo solved the classical multi degree of freedom vibration equation of equivalent hull beam model by taking the ship wall pressure modified by taylor plate theory as the solving load and obtained the impact dynamic bending moment by using the differential form of bending moment guo et al 2015 xiao wen li used the whiplike motion theory of ship girder and empirical mode decomposition method to reasonably extend the simulation data of cabin section to the whole ship guo 2017 jie cui and ye li et al used abaqus a general finite element software to simulate the impact response characteristics of ships under impact loading and analyzed the distribution regularities of the longitudinal impact spectrum value of the whole ship and the distribution of the impact environment along the vertical direction cuiye et al 2015 theory forecast methods are commonly used at the beginning of the ship design for its faster forecast speed but the precision is relatively low the simulation method based on finite element method is generally used after the design is completed although this method has better prediction accuracy it needs to create the complex finite element model and spends a lot of computation cost meanwhile its forecast speed is relatively slow in the stage of design optimization and adjustment the ship shock environment still calls for effective prediction method guo and yang 2019 yao and guo 2009 at present some scholars have carried out preliminary exploration and research on the mining of large scale data of ship structural performance mei ting wang et al used pso ols and other algorithms to optimize the structure of rbf neural network and took 16 extracted sound source data parameters as input variables to predict the noise of ship cabin guo 2019 feng 2009 however in the aspect of ship impact environment few scholars use appropriate intelligent methods to conduct corresponding data mining research probabilistic neural network combined with radial basis function rbf neural network and classical probability density estimation principle is a feedforward neural network based on statistical principle its nonlinear learning process can be implemented in a linear learning algorithm the advantage of its simple structure and high classification accuracy make it particularly appropriate depict the highly nonlinear characteristics of ship shock environment therefore this paper studies the impact environment of surface ships under the action of underwater non contact explosion based on probabilistic neural network by analyzing the change rule and development trend of main structural parameters of modern ships keil 1961 this study develops a parameterized modeling program and rapidly establishes a number of ship models to generate large number of reasonably distributed ship impact environment data through simulation method by taking main

network model is built and trained the network parameters are optimized through the genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm after the completion of the training model of unknown ships under the given conditions the impact environment is forecast and analyzed 2 working mechanism of probabilistic neural network and optimization algorithm probabilistic neural network architecture is a four

as objects and use randomization techniques to guide efficient search of a coded parameter space wang 2003 its main features are the direct operation of structural objects with inherent implicit parallelism and better global optimization ability the algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 2 the genetic algorithm can be expressed by the following mathematical model 4 sga c e p 0 n φ γ ψ t where c

optimization problem then the mean square error of sample data is taken as the fitness function and the optimal solution of a single smoothing factor is formed through continuous reproduction until the desired termination condition is met 2 3 particle swarm optimization particle swarm optimization pso is an evolutionary algorithm based on group iteration which has high accuracy fast convergence simple code and few required parameters wang 2017 the algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 3 based on particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the global optimal solution of pnn network with smoother

parent ship model the finite element model can be created by the main parameters of the input model and the calculation and result extraction of various setting conditions are quickly carried out and the creation cycle of the training database is shortened and the quantity of the database sample size is greatly improved 3 1 ship parametric rapid modeling ship design method in this section parent ship transform method is used the most simple and intuitive method is the ratio transformation method which is shown in 7 7 x i y i z i x 0 i y 0 i z 0 i λ 0 0 0 β 0 0 0 γ i 1 2 n where x i y i z i is

performance is similar 3 2 rapid modeling program design of ship parameterization rapid parametric modeling of the ship is divided into three parts including the definition of hull materials and section properties the establishment of the hull geometric model and the finite element model qu et al 2018 the first part is to define three kinds of cross sections in the form of profile structure including the t section steel angle steel and flat steel the second part is to create the outer panel the double bottom the deck and the bulkhead the third part is to create the parts collection sections cutting meshing size unit attribute and the unit attribute of external flow field the finite element model and the automatic modeling process are shown in fig 4 and shown in fig 5 3 3 construction of training database of ship impact environment 3 3 1 settings of working conditions the definition of the coordinate system is shown in fig 6 in engineering application the impact factor is usually used to simplify the relationship between impact environment attack degree and geometric scale in this paper keel impact factor is adopted and the specific formula is shown in formula 9 9 c w r 2 1 sin α 2 where w is the quality of the cartridge α is the angle of attack of explosion r1 and r2 are the detonation distances as shown in fig 7 in shock environment calculation each ship has 90 working conditions including the attack angle of 30 60 and 90 as shown in table 1 impact factor ranges from 0 3 to 1 the charge quality is set to 1000 kg blasting center is located below the midship section 3 3 2 setting of training sample data in order to investigate the input of typical parts of the hull under impact loading a number of assessment points should be set at suitable positions of the hull in this paper about 400 500 examination points are uniformly arranged in the inner bottom plate and each deck time history curve of the shock load is shown in fig 8 and time history acceleration curve of each point is used as the finite element calculation output as shown in fig 9 the design spectrum is introduced to describe the impact environment guo 2010 xie et al 2017 the training data of ship impact environment includes input parameters and output parameters in this paper the input parameters are set with a total of 11 dimensions including three parts the main scale of the ship the working condition parameters and the position of the measuring point the output parameter is the designed spectral acceleration and all the specific parameters are shown in table 2 4 factors affecting the effectiveness of training the normalization method and database are tested by using the probability neural network of single smoothing factor respectively to determine the best normalization method and training database 4 1 normalization processing of training data data normalization is an important problem in the expression of feature vectors in data mining when different features are listed together it is easy to cause the decimals in absolute value to be eaten up by large numbers chen and chu 2009 therefore data should be normalized before training common data normalization methods include the following deviation standardization 10 y i x i x min x max x min 1 i n in the formula x m a x is the maximum value of the sample data x m i n is the minimum value of the sample data standard deviation standardization 11 y i x i μ σ 1 i n in the formula μ is the mean of all sample data and σ is the standard deviation for all sample data nonlinear normalization 12 y i 1 1 e x i 1 i n in order to ensure the richness of training parameters this paper divides each parameter into 10 intervals and adopts the latin hypercube method to sample the data we sample 1000 sets of data in the database and preprocess the data in provided three methods the data processing effect is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from the diagram the deviation standardization and the standard deviation standardization can maintain the diversity of training feature dimension data while the sigmoid function selected in nonlinear normalization causes a large number of sample points to be mapped to 0 and 1 and results a decrease in the degree of differentiation between a large number of sample data it will reduce the sensitivity of the network to the original characteristics of the data in the figure the deviation standardization and nonlinear normalization are good to constrain the sample data to interval 0 1 and the standard deviation standardization has a large interval length which will greatly increase the difficulty of the network parameter adjustment and also bring some challenges to the network optimization in order to compare the influence of different data normalization methods on the prediction accuracy of the model the following experiments are designed 200 sets of data in the 1000 groups of samples were randomly selected as training sample data and 10 groups were randomly chosen as forecast data the data were preprocessed by three normalized methods probabilistic network with a single smoothing factor is applied to train and forecast the data smoothing factor σ is designed as 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 respectively fig 11 a fig 11 b and 11 c show relative error of the three data preprocessing methods fig 11 d shows the average relative error of model training as can be seen from fig 11 and table 3 under the condition of three smoothing factors the average relative error of deviation standardization is between 33 43 the average relative error of standard deviation standardization is between 54 73 and the average relative error of nonlinear normalization is between 79 92 among them the prediction accuracy of the nonlinear normalization is the lowest with deviation standardization the best and the standard deviation standardization the second it is mainly because the deviation standardization can better constrain the range of data dimension interval and ensure its diversity and standard deviation standardization has a slightly worse data constraint ability resulting in slightly worse network fitting accuracy while nonlinear normalization maps a large amount of data to 0 and 1 this weakens the diversity of data types and reduces the classification effect of probabilistic neural networks 4 2 effect of sample quantity on impact environment training the number of samples has a great influence on the training accuracy too few samples are not representative which cannot make an accurate forecast of the impact environment nevertheless too many samples will increase the training cost and lead to excessive fitting phenomenon georgiouet al 2006 take one of ships as the research object with the smoothing factor σ 1 10 feature points selected evenly on every deck of the hull set the starting sample number to 500 and gradually add 1500 training data on this basis the training effect of the model is verified with the test model containing 100 samples the mean square root error of spectral acceleration prediction is shown in fig 12 in addition in the process of network iteration root mean square error is adopted here as the evaluation function and the formula is 13 r s m e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i 2 n where x o b s i is the true value of each forecast data x m o d e l i is the predicted value of each training model n is the number of prediction points as can be seen from the figure the relative error of training does not decrease with the increase of the samples number comparing the three groups of training data 1000 groups were added to the training data that is when the total data of the training samples reached 1500 groups a relatively small and stable root mean square error value was obtained therefore when the training data and test data are allocated 85 95 of the data can be selected as the training set too little data set is difficult to reflect the complex relationship which cannot achieve the training effect while too large training set may lead to excessive fitting phenomenon 5 pnn network training based on intelligent algorithm probabilistic neural network has strong fault tolerance and adaptive learning ability but the selection of smoothing coefficient directly affects the performance of the network wang 2007 yang et al 1998 at present the traditional probability network with a single smoothing coefficient and the improved probability network with multiple smoothing parameters are mainly used through the corresponding optimization algorithm both single and multiple smoothing factors are optimized to improve the prediction accuracy of the network 5 1 pnn network training based on single smoothing factor 5 1 1 network process design this section bases on the genetic algorithm to optimize smoothing factor processing and uses sample data to forecast the root mean square error as the fitness value of the evaluation of network optimization effect wu 2012 the network design process is specific as shown in fig 13 5 1 2 determination of crossover rate and mutation rate 5 1 2 1 cross in this paper binary coding is adopted to represent each chromosome as a string composed of 0 and 1 this paper then uses double point crossing to randomly select two intersections on the chromosome and then exchanges the substrings between the intersections to obtain two new individuals when p c r a n d the chromosomes are crossed as shown in fig 14 when p c r a n d no update is made 5 1 2 2 variation mutation is the substitution of the gene values on some gene sites in the chromosome sequence with other alleles on the gene site to form a new individual in this paper when p m r a n d the chromosome is mutated to change the 0 in the binary number to 1 1 to 0 when p m r a n d no mutation is updated the crossover rate p c and mutation rate p m of the algorithm have a great influence on the optimization of the network the search ability of the algorithm increases with the increase of the value of crossover rate p c but the increase of p c will interfere with the condition that the group remains excellent the optimization speed of the algorithm will slow down with p c decreasing which will lead to the slow production of the new individual usually the value of p c is between 0 4 0 99 the goal of mutation is to maintain the diversity of group species the ability of the algorithm to produce offspring increases with the increase of the mutation rate p m but there may be many undesirable situations when the p m slowly becomes smaller the production capacity of the population will become weaker usually the value of p m is between 0 001 0 1 srinivas and patnaik 2002 through a large number of experiments junqi li studied the crossover rate and mutation rate of the genetic algorithm which was determined by randomly selecting the values of p c and p m and compared and verified the experimental results li and shi 2003 experiments show that when p c is between 0 6 and 0 7 p m is between 0 02 and 0 03 the optimization performance of the algorithm will be significantly enhanced set p c to 0 65 p m to 0 025 and randomly select 200 sets of data in the database as training samples 30 sets of data as test samples adopt deviation standardization to do the data normalization the probabilistic neural network with single smoothing factor is used to train and forecast the data as shown in fig 15 when it iterates to 18 times all the algorithms are able to converge to the optimal fitness value of 42 12 the best smoothing factor σ 0 12 is obtained 5 1 3 effect of population size on convergence performance the selection of population size has a great impact on the convergence of the algorithm with the other parameters unchanged and population size set to 20 30 40 50 respectively the probability network of single smoothing factor is used to train the randomly selected 200 groups of data in the database the 50 sets of data distributed along the longitudinal direction of the ship on deck 1 were also predicted the average results of population convergence are shown in fig 16 as can be seen from fig 16 when np population size is 20 the convergence capacity is the worst there is a lack of population diversity in the late iteration and the phenomenon of search stagnation with the increase of np the later the time point of search stagnation occurs and the better the global optimization ability of the algorithm is in addition when np is greater than 40 the convergence curve of the algorithm of different np is very close that is the increase of np has little effect on the convergence ability for computational cost reasons the population size of this paper is set to 40 5 1 4 the influence of selection strategy on convergence performance traditional selection strategies include roulette random selection without playback and tournament selection strategies different selection strategies will have an important impact on the performance of the algorithm the following is an experiment to compare the influence of three different selection strategies on network performance optimization randomly select 400 sets of data from the database use 40 sets of measuring points on deck 2 as test data set population size to 40 and the other parameters remain unchanged the population convergence of the average results as shown in fig 17 as can be seen from fig 17 the roulette selection converges rapidly but the search stagnation occurs after 30 iterations random selection without playback is carried out according to the survival expectation of each individual in the next generation group its convergence rate is slightly slower than the other two selection methods but its global search ability is stronger the convergence speed and global optimization ability of tournament selection are superior in the three selection strategies 5 1 5 impact environment forecast based on the above experimental analysis this paper selects the best performing parameters and algorithm selection strategy and predicts the measuring points of the 4th ship 1 deck 2 deck and 3 deck along the length distribution the results are shown in fig 18 and table 4 as can be seen from fig 17 and table 4 the average error of the spectral acceleration pre predicted value between the ship s decks along the length distribution point is between 20 25 although the structure of the network is relatively simple and fewer parameters are affected each mode layer neuron adopts the same smoothing factor which cannot reflect the difference of all training samples and limit the further improvement of the prediction accuracy 5 2 pso pnn training based on multi smoothing factor 5 2 1 network process design this section proposes that the smoothing factor of the pattern layer neurons connected by the same summation layer is set to the same value the smoothing factors of the pattern layer neurons corresponding to the different summation layers are set to different values and the smoothing factors of the connections of different summation layers of the pnn network are trained by the particle swarm algorithm it can not only reflect the relationship between the same model training samples but also highlight the differences between different patterns of training samples berthold and diamond 1998 the network design process is specific as shown in fig 19 5 2 2 algorithm basic parameter settings 5 2 2 1 particle number limit generally the particle number of particle swarm algorithm does not have a definite value which often needs to be considered synthetically according to the complexity of the actual problem it is necessary to ensure that the network has sufficient number of particles and the ability to search the optimal value globally taking into account the computational time and the complexity of the algorithm liu et al 2008 wengweng zhang conducted functional optimization experiments on four different population sizes of 20 40 60 and 80 and found that in most cases when the population size was less than 40 the population size had a greater impact on the algorithm when the population size exceeds 40 the algorithm is no longer sensitive to the population size considering the reliability of the algorithm the number of particles is set to 40 according to the number of neurons in different mode layers zhangwang 2010 5 2 2 2 learning factor learning factors c 1 and c 2 can measure the relationship between the extreme value of the particle itself and the global extremum so as to determine the stochastic acceleration of the particle movement usually if the value of c 1 is bigger than c 2 it will cause the particle to leap out of the search space from the search range instead it will be easier to converge to the local minimum fan et al 2016 kennedy and eberhart suggested that c 1 c 2 then after testing suganthan proved that when c 1 c 2 2 a better solution would be produced therefore the two values were taken as equal suganthan 1999 in this paper the values of c 1 and c 2 were evaluated according to the above related literatures 5 2 2 3 maximum speed the maximum speed limit v m a x is set in order to make the particle step suitable for the iterative process excessive step length will make it easy for particles to miss the global optimal value and too small a step will make the particle prone to precocious thus converging to the local optimal value peer et al 2003 in a comprehensive consideration this paper takes the maximum velocity limit of particles to v m a x 1 2 after testing the pso pnn network has good optimization ability and convergence speed under the maximum speed limit take the 300 groups data of no 3 ship as training example with the number of network particles set to 400 the learning factor c 1 c 2 2 and the maximum speed limit v m a x 1 2 the particle swarm algorithm with stochastic weight optimization is used for the prediction test as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 fig 20 shows the smoothing coefficients of 19 different categories of neurons in the network with iterative variation fig 20 shows the variation of the mean square root error of the network with the number of iterations from figs 16 17 and 21 compared with the single smooth factor the network s mean square error of multiple smoothing factors still decreases significantly after more than 10 iterations and gradually becomes stable after more than 40 iterations the mean square error of single smoothing factor network stays in the range of 40 50 while the multi smooth factor interval converges between 30 and 40 because of the higher precision the network structure has more ideal convergence speed and is more difficult to fall into the local minimum the above parameter setting values will be used as some basic parameter values by the algorithm during network training 5 2 3 effect of inertial weight on convergence performance proper selection of inertial weight ωis the key to improve search efficiency and algorithm accuracy shi and eberhart 1998 common optimization methods are as follows 5 2 3 1 adaptive weight method the nonlinear dynamic inertial weight factor of the adaptive weight method is shown in the formula 5 1 14 ω ω min ω max ω min f f min f a v g f min f f a v g ω max f f a v g in the formula f is the current target function value of the particle f a v g is the average of all current particles and f m i n is the minimum target value for all current particles ω m a x is the maximum value of inertial weight ω m i n is the minimum of inertial weight 5 2 3 2 stochastic weight method the stochastic weight method sets the inertial weight ω to the random number which overcomes the problem that cannot converge to the optimal solution due to the linear decrement of ω the inertial weight formula of stochastic weight method is as 15 ω μ σ n 0 1 μ μ min μ max μ min rand 0 1 in the formula n 0 1 is the random number of the standard state distribution μ m a x represents the maximum value of the average value of random weight μ m i n represents the minimum value of the average value of random weight σ represents the variance of the mean of the random weights 5 2 3 3 linear decrement weight method the linear decrement weight method mainly aims at the phenomenon that the algorithm is precocious and the oscillation near the global optimal solution in the later stage of the algorithm its inertial weight formula is as 16 ω ω max t ω max ω min t max in the formula ω m a x is the maximum value of the inertial weight ω m i n is the minimum value of the inertial weight t is the current number of iterations three kinds of inertial weight optimization methods are compared below mean square error mse is used as fitness function fitness the number of particles is set to 400 the maximum flight speed of the particle is set to 1 2 the maximum number of iterations is set to 50 times the initial weight factor is set to 0 5 and the learning factors c 1 and c 2 are set to 2 the learning factors c 1 and c 2 are set as 2 in addition in the adaptive weight method ω m a x is set as 1 and ω m i n is set as 0 4 in the linear decreasing weight method μ m a x is set as 1 μ m i n is set as 0 4 σ is set as 0 5 in linear decreasing weight method ω m a x is set to 1 and ω m i n is set to 0 4 the inertial weight of the pso pnn network is optimized by the above three methods prediction of spectral acceleration of 50 randomly selected assessment points on the deck of number 3 ship the changing trend of its mean square root error with iteration is shown in fig 22 the above three inertial weight optimization methods are compared among which the stochastic weighting method converges quickly but it is caught in the local solution after 11 iterations the fitting accuracy is relatively poor this method can be selected when the data volume is large which is helpful to save the calculation time the linear diminishing weight method has strong global search ability however it found a relatively excellent solution in the 47th iteration the adaptive weight method and the linear diminishing weight method have similar convergence speed but the adaptive weight global search ability is stronger in summary taking into account the time and efficiency of optimization this paper selects the adaptive weight method to optimize the inertial weight of particle swarm algorithm 5 2 4 impact environmental forecast through the above experimental analysis the parameter values of particle swarm algorithm and the inertial weight method are selected the probability network based on multi smoothing coefficient is used to predict the impact environment of ship 4 results are shown in fig 23 and table 5 as can be seen from fig 23 and table 5 by optimizing the algorithm with different smoothing factors for different modes of neurons the prediction accuracy of pnn network can be further improved the average error of three decks prediction is between 9 15 and the prediction accuracy is increased by 10 compared with the 20 25 of single smoothing factor the multi smoothing factor probabilistic neural network based on particle swarm algorithm has fast convergence speed and few controlled parameters and has strong applicability in the field of ship impact environment prediction 6 conclusions the conclusions are as follows 1 one of the key problems for the establishment of enough data of ship structure is the lack of sample size however the exploration in this paper shows that the highly automated and fast modeling of complex structures like ships can be realized based on the parent ship transformation method and parametric modeling technology the modeling efficiency can be improved by 7 8 times compared with the traditional technology on this basis it is expected to further improve the establishment of large scale database of ship structure by deeply developing the method of parent ship transformation 2 in view of the characteristics of training parameters such as multiple input dimensions single output complex data structure and discrete distribution this paper finds that the deviation standardization method can map the training data to 0 1 broadly which avoids the large span of variable interval and preserve the diversity of various variable data moreover it can enhance the network s perception of parameter changes and greatly improve the accuracy of network prediction in addition this method has some reference value for the preprocessing of some similar complex data in other fields 3 in this paper two different pnn network models of single smoothing factor and multi smoothing factor are established and optimized respectively by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization by comparison the performance of the improved multi smoothing factor network model is better than that of the single smooth smoothing factor network and the average error of its prediction is about 10 lower than that of the single smoothing factor network the average error of the overall prediction is about 10 15 this model can have reference value for the impact

21927,the selection of the smoothing coefficient of the probabilistic neural network directly affects the performance of the network traditionally all the mode layer neurons use a uniform smoothing coefficient and then the optimal smoothing parameters suitable for this problem are searched by the optimization algorithm in this study the smoothing coefficients of the mode layer neurons connected by the same summation layer are set to the same value which not only reflects the relationship between the training samples of the same pattern but also highlights the difference between the training samples of different modes two probabilistic neural network models are applied to the ship impact environment prediction respectively the results show that the classification effect of multiple smoothing factors is further improved than the single smoothing factor network keywords ship impact environment prediction probabilistic neural network smoothing coefficient optimization algorithm 1 introduction the anti explosion and anti impact capability of surface ships directly affects the vitality and attack capability of ships and is one of the important indexes to measure the combat performance of surface ships surface ships are vulnerable to underwater explosions although non contact explosion does not generally cause fatal blow to ships and serious damage to the local structure of hull various precision electronic instruments such as navigation and weapons systems are sensitive to the impact loading in the actual projects the impact resistance of electronic equipment is most sensitive to the change of spectral acceleration therefore it is of vital importance to predict the spectral acceleration of ships quickly and accurately in the preliminary design stage of ships to carry out the design of anti impact protection of structures and to change passive design into active design chenxie and jin boguo 2017 in the design stage of surface ships the impact resistance of ships is often checked by theoretical analysis numerical simulation and other technical means jun guo solved the classical multi degree of freedom vibration equation of equivalent hull beam model by taking the ship wall pressure modified by taylor plate theory as the solving load and obtained the impact dynamic bending moment by using the differential form of bending moment guo et al 2015 xiao wen li used the whiplike motion theory of ship girder and empirical mode decomposition method to reasonably extend the simulation data of cabin section to the whole ship guo 2017 jie cui and ye li et al used abaqus a general finite element software to simulate the impact response characteristics of ships under impact loading and analyzed the distribution regularities of the longitudinal impact spectrum value of the whole ship and the distribution of the impact environment along the vertical direction cuiye et al 2015 theory forecast methods are commonly used at the beginning of the ship design for its faster forecast speed but the precision is relatively low the simulation method based on finite element method is generally used after the design is completed although this method has better prediction accuracy it needs to create the complex finite element model and spends a lot of computation cost meanwhile its forecast speed is relatively slow in the stage of design optimization and adjustment the ship shock environment still calls for effective prediction method guo and yang 2019 yao and guo 2009 at present some scholars have carried out preliminary exploration and research on the mining of large scale data of ship structural performance mei ting wang et al used pso ols and other algorithms to optimize the structure of rbf neural network and took 16 extracted sound source data parameters as input variables to predict the noise of ship cabin guo 2019 feng 2009 however in the aspect of ship impact environment few scholars use appropriate intelligent methods to conduct corresponding data mining research probabilistic neural network combined with radial basis function rbf neural network and classical probability density estimation principle is a feedforward neural network based on statistical principle its nonlinear learning process can be implemented in a linear learning algorithm the advantage of its simple structure and high classification accuracy make it particularly appropriate depict the highly nonlinear characteristics of ship shock environment therefore this paper studies the impact environment of surface ships under the action of underwater non contact explosion based on probabilistic neural network by analyzing the change rule and development trend of main structural parameters of modern ships keil 1961 this study develops a parameterized modeling program and rapidly establishes a number of ship models to generate large number of reasonably distributed ship impact environment data through simulation method by taking main dimension parameters of ships setting parameters of working condition and parameters of testing point positions as input parameters and taking the spectral acceleration as the output parameters pnn network model is built and trained the network parameters are optimized through the genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm after the completion of the training model of unknown ships under the given conditions the impact environment is forecast and analyzed 2 working mechanism of probabilistic neural network and optimization algorithm probabilistic neural network architecture is a four layer neuron network model of the structure suitable smoothing parameters on the probabilistic neural network are very important based on the genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm different smoothing parameters are discussed in this paper sejnoha 2019 jin 2016 2 1 probabilistic neural network pnn network structure consists of four layers ma 2015 including input layer sample layer sum layer and output layer as shown in fig 1 the first layer is the input layer and the number of neurons is the same as the dimension of the input vector x the second layer is the sample layer and the relationship between the jth neuron in ith sample and the input vector is shown in equation 1 1 ϕ i j x 1 2 π 1 2 σ d e x x i j x x i j t σ 2 where x i j is the center of each neuron node in the sample layer σ is the smoothing factor and d is the total number of neurons in the sample layer the third layer is the summation layer which takes the average of samples of the same class in the sample layer as shown in equation 2 l is the number of neurons in class i sample 2 v i 1 l j 1 l ϕ i j the last layer is the output layer and the category with the largest probability in the summation layer is the output result the output result in this paper is spectral acceleration as shown in formula 3 3 y argmax v i 2 2 genetic algorithm genetic algorithms take all individuals in a population as objects and use randomization techniques to guide efficient search of a coded parameter space wang 2003 its main features are the direct operation of structural objects with inherent implicit parallelism and better global optimization ability the algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 2 the genetic algorithm can be expressed by the following mathematical model 4 sga c e p 0 n φ γ ψ t where c stands for individual coding mode e represents the individual fitness evaluation function p 0 represents the initial population n represents the population size φ represents selection operator γ represents crossover operator ψ is the mutation operator t is the condition for stopping the algorithm in this paper the genetic algorithm is applied to the single plane slip factor network optimization problem then the mean square error of sample data is taken as the fitness function and the optimal solution of a single smoothing factor is formed through continuous reproduction until the desired termination condition is met 2 3 particle swarm optimization particle swarm optimization pso is an evolutionary algorithm based on group iteration which has high accuracy fast convergence simple code and few required parameters wang 2017 the algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 3 based on particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the global optimal solution of pnn network with smoother factor is obtained and all the particles in the same d dimension are searched mean square error mse is used to evaluate the current position of the particles along with the continuous renewal of iteration best position p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d of particles i and best location p g p g 1 p g 2 p g d of all the particles are recorded the velocity iteration formula of particle i is shown in formula 5 and position update formula is shown in formula 6 5 v i d k 1 ω v i d k c 1 r 1 p i d k x i d k c 2 r 2 p g d k x i d k 6 x i d k 1 x i d k v i d k 1 where ω is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are the learning factors r 1 and r 2 are the random numbers within the interval 0 1 to enhance the randomness of the search v i d k is the d dimensional component of the velocity vector of particle i after the k th iteration x i d k is the d dimensional component of the position vector of particle i after the k th iteration 3 establishment of ship impact environment training database based on the parent ship model the finite element model can be created by the main parameters of the input model and the calculation and result extraction of various setting conditions are quickly carried out and the creation cycle of the training database is shortened and the quantity of the database sample size is greatly improved 3 1 ship parametric rapid modeling ship design method in this section parent ship transform method is used the most simple and intuitive method is the ratio transformation method which is shown in 7 7 x i y i z i x 0 i y 0 i z 0 i λ 0 0 0 β 0 0 0 γ i 1 2 n where x i y i z i is the coordinate value of any point of the designed ship fx is the coordinate value of the corresponding point of the parent ship λ β γ are the transformation coefficients n is the total number of all chosen points zeng 2005 proportional transformation is a linear transformation method and the relationship between the main dimensions of ships is shown in equation 8 l λ l 0 b β l b 0 d γ d 0 d γ d 0

performance is similar 3 2 rapid modeling program design of ship parameterization rapid parametric modeling of the ship is divided into three parts including the definition of hull materials and section properties the establishment of the hull geometric model and the finite element model qu et al 2018 the first part is to define three kinds of cross sections in the form of profile structure including the t section steel angle steel and flat steel the second part is to create the outer panel the double bottom the deck and the bulkhead the third part is to create the parts collection sections cutting meshing size unit attribute and the unit attribute of external flow field the finite element model and the automatic modeling process are shown in fig 4 and shown in fig 5 3 3 construction of training database of ship impact environment 3 3 1 settings of working conditions the definition of the coordinate system is shown in fig 6 in engineering application the impact factor is usually used to simplify the relationship between impact environment attack degree and geometric scale in this paper keel impact factor is adopted and the specific formula is shown in formula 9 9 c w r 2 1 sin α 2 where w is the quality of the cartridge α is the angle of attack of explosion r1 and r2 are the detonation distances as shown in fig 7 in shock environment calculation each ship has 90 working conditions including the attack angle of 30 60 and 90 as shown in table 1 impact factor ranges from 0 3 to 1 the charge quality is set to 1000 kg blasting center is located below the midship section 3 3 2 setting of training sample data in order to investigate the input of typical parts of the hull under impact loading a number of assessment points should be set at suitable positions of the hull in this paper about 400 500 examination points are uniformly arranged in the inner bottom plate and each deck time history curve of the shock load is shown in fig 8 and time history acceleration curve of each point is used as the finite element calculation output as shown in fig 9 the design spectrum is introduced to describe the impact environment guo 2010 xie et al 2017 the training data of ship impact environment includes input parameters and output parameters in this paper the input parameters are set with a total of 11 dimensions including three parts the main scale of the ship the working condition parameters and the position of the measuring point the output parameter is the designed spectral acceleration and all the specific parameters are shown in table 2 4 factors affecting the effectiveness of training the normalization method and database are tested by using the probability neural network of single smoothing factor respectively to determine the best normalization method and training database 4 1 normalization processing of training data data normalization is an important problem in the expression of feature vectors in data mining when different features are listed together it is easy to cause the decimals in absolute value to be eaten up by large numbers chen and chu 2009 therefore data should be normalized before training common data normalization methods include the following deviation standardization 10 y i x i x min x max x min 1 i n in the formula x m a x is the maximum value of the sample data x m i n is the minimum value of the sample data standard deviation standardization 11 y i x i μ σ 1 i n in the formula μ is the mean of all sample data and σ is the standard deviation for all sample data nonlinear normalization 12 y i 1 1 e x i 1 i n in order to ensure the richness of training parameters this paper divides each parameter into 10 intervals and adopts the latin hypercube method to sample the data we sample 1000 sets of data in the database and preprocess the data in provided three methods the data processing effect is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from the diagram the deviation standardization and the standard deviation standardization can maintain the diversity of training feature dimension data while the sigmoid function selected in nonlinear normalization causes a large number of sample points to be mapped to 0 and 1 and results a decrease in the degree of differentiation between a large number of sample data it will reduce the sensitivity of the network to the original characteristics of the data in the figure the deviation standardization and nonlinear normalization are good to constrain the sample data to interval 0 1 and the standard deviation standardization has a large interval length which will greatly increase the difficulty of the network parameter adjustment and also bring some challenges to the network optimization in order to compare the influence of different data normalization methods on the prediction accuracy of the model the following experiments are designed 200 sets of data in the 1000 groups of samples were randomly selected as training sample data and 10 groups were randomly chosen as forecast data the data were preprocessed by three normalized methods probabilistic network with a single smoothing factor is applied to train and forecast the data smoothing factor σ is designed as 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 respectively fig 11 a fig 11 b and 11 c show relative error of the three data preprocessing methods fig 11 d shows the average relative error of model training as can be seen from fig 11 and table 3 under the condition of three smoothing factors the average relative error of deviation standardization is between 33 43 the average relative error of standard deviation standardization is between 54 73 and the average relative error of nonlinear normalization is between 79 92 among them the prediction accuracy of the nonlinear normalization is the lowest with deviation standardization the best and the standard deviation standardization the second it is mainly because the deviation standardization can better constrain the range of data dimension interval and ensure its diversity and standard deviation standardization has a slightly worse data constraint ability resulting in slightly worse network fitting accuracy while nonlinear normalization maps a large amount of data to 0 and 1 this weakens the diversity of data types and reduces the classification effect of probabilistic neural networks 4 2 effect of sample quantity on impact environment training the number of samples has a great influence on the training accuracy too few samples are not representative which cannot make an accurate forecast of the impact environment nevertheless too many samples will increase the training cost and lead to excessive fitting phenomenon georgiouet al 2006 take one of ships as the research object with the smoothing factor σ 1 10 feature points selected evenly on every deck of the hull set the starting sample number to 500 and gradually add 1500 training data on this basis the training effect of the model is verified with the test model containing 100 samples the mean square root error of spectral acceleration prediction is shown in fig 12 in addition in the process of network iteration root mean square error is adopted here as the evaluation function and the formula is 13 r s m e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i 2 n where x o b s i is the true value of each forecast data x m o d e l i is the predicted value of each training model n is the number of prediction points as can be seen from the figure the relative error of training does not decrease with the increase of the samples number comparing the three groups of training data 1000 groups were added to the training data that is when the total data of the training samples reached 1500 groups a relatively small and stable root mean square error value was obtained therefore when the training data and test data are allocated 85 95 of the data can be selected as the training set too little data set is difficult to reflect the complex relationship which cannot achieve the training effect while too large training set may lead to excessive fitting phenomenon 5 pnn network training based on intelligent algorithm probabilistic neural network has strong fault tolerance and adaptive learning ability but the selection of smoothing coefficient directly affects the performance of the network wang 2007 yang et al 1998 at present the traditional probability network with a single smoothing coefficient and the improved probability network with multiple smoothing parameters are mainly used through the corresponding optimization algorithm both single and multiple smoothing factors are optimized to improve the prediction accuracy of the network 5 1 pnn network training based on single smoothing factor 5 1 1 network process design this section bases on the genetic algorithm to optimize smoothing factor processing and uses sample data to forecast the root mean square error as the fitness value of the evaluation of network optimization effect wu 2012 the network design process is specific as shown in fig 13 5 1 2 determination of crossover rate and mutation rate 5 1 2 1 cross in this paper binary coding is adopted to represent each chromosome as a string composed of 0 and 1 this paper then uses double point crossing to randomly select two intersections on the chromosome and then exchanges the substrings between the intersections to obtain two new individuals when p c r a n d the chromosomes are crossed as shown in fig 14 when p c r a n d no update is made 5 1 2 2 variation mutation is the substitution of the gene values on some gene sites in the chromosome sequence with other alleles on the gene site to form a new individual in this paper when p m r a n d the chromosome is mutated to change the 0 in the binary number to 1 1 to 0 when p m r a n d no mutation is updated the crossover rate p c and mutation rate p m of the algorithm have a great influence on the optimization of the network the search ability of the algorithm increases with the increase of the value of crossover rate p c but the increase of p c will interfere with the condition that the group remains excellent the optimization speed of the algorithm will slow down with p c decreasing which will lead to the slow production of the new individual usually the value of p c is between 0 4 0 99 the goal of mutation is to maintain the diversity of group species the ability of the algorithm to produce offspring increases with the increase of the mutation rate p m but there may be many undesirable situations when the p m slowly becomes smaller the production capacity of the population will become weaker usually the value of p m is between 0 001 0 1 srinivas and patnaik 2002 through a large number of experiments junqi li studied the crossover rate and mutation rate of the genetic algorithm which was determined by randomly selecting the values of p c and p m and compared and verified the experimental results li and shi 2003 experiments show that when p c is between 0 6 and 0 7 p m is between 0 02 and 0 03 the optimization performance of the algorithm will be significantly enhanced set p c to 0 65 p m to 0 025 and randomly select 200 sets of data in the database as training samples 30 sets of data as test samples adopt deviation standardization to do the data normalization the probabilistic neural network with single smoothing factor is used to train and forecast the data as shown in fig 15 when it iterates to 18 times all the algorithms are able to converge to the optimal fitness value of 42 12 the best smoothing factor σ 0 12 is obtained 5 1 3 effect of population size on convergence performance the selection of population size has a great impact on the convergence of the algorithm with the other parameters unchanged and population size set to 20 30 40 50 respectively the probability network of single smoothing factor is used to train the randomly selected 200 groups of data in the database the 50 sets of data distributed along the longitudinal direction of the ship on deck 1 were also predicted the average results of population convergence are shown in fig 16 as can be seen from fig 16 when np population size is 20 the convergence capacity is the worst there is a lack of population diversity in the late iteration and the phenomenon of search stagnation with the increase of np the later the time point of search stagnation occurs and the better the global optimization ability of the algorithm is in addition when np is greater than 40 the convergence curve of the algorithm of different np is very close that is the increase of np has little effect on the convergence ability for computational cost reasons the population size of this paper is set to 40 5 1 4 the influence of selection strategy on convergence performance traditional selection strategies include roulette random selection without playback and tournament selection strategies different selection strategies will have an important impact on the performance of the algorithm the following is an experiment to compare the influence of three different selection strategies on network performance optimization randomly select 400 sets of data from the database use 40 sets of measuring points on deck 2 as test data set population size to 40 and the other parameters remain unchanged the population convergence of the average results as shown in fig 17 as can be seen from fig 17 the roulette selection converges rapidly but the search stagnation occurs after 30 iterations random selection without playback is carried out according to the survival expectation of each individual in the next generation group its convergence rate is slightly slower than the other two selection methods but its global search ability is stronger the convergence speed and global optimization ability of tournament selection are superior in the three selection strategies 5 1 5 impact environment forecast based on the above experimental analysis this paper selects the best performing parameters and algorithm selection strategy and predicts the measuring points of the 4th ship 1 deck 2 deck and 3 deck along the length distribution the results are shown in fig 18 and table 4 as can be seen from fig 17 and table 4 the average error of the spectral acceleration pre predicted value between the ship s decks along the length distribution point is between 20 25 although the structure of the network is relatively simple and fewer parameters are affected each mode layer neuron adopts the same smoothing factor which cannot reflect the difference of all training samples and limit the further improvement of the prediction accuracy 5 2 pso pnn training based on multi smoothing factor 5 2 1 network process design this section proposes that the smoothing factor of the pattern layer neurons connected by the same summation layer is set to the same value the smoothing factors of the pattern layer neurons corresponding to the different summation layers are set to different values and the smoothing factors of the connections of different summation layers of the pnn network are trained by the particle swarm algorithm it can not only reflect the relationship between the same model training samples but also highlight the differences between different patterns of training samples berthold and diamond 1998 the network design process is specific as shown in fig 19 5 2 2 algorithm basic parameter settings 5 2 2 1 particle number limit generally the particle number of particle swarm algorithm does not have a definite value which often needs to be considered synthetically according to the complexity of the actual problem it is necessary to ensure that the network has sufficient number of particles and the ability to search the optimal value globally taking into account the computational time and the complexity of the algorithm liu et al 2008 wengweng zhang conducted functional optimization experiments on four different population sizes of 20 40 60 and 80 and found that in most cases when the population size was less than 40 the population size had a greater impact on the algorithm when the population size exceeds 40 the algorithm is no longer sensitive to the population size considering the reliability of the algorithm the number of particles is set to 40 according to the number of neurons in different mode layers zhangwang 2010 5 2 2 2 learning factor learning factors c 1 and c 2 can measure the relationship between the extreme value of the particle itself and the global extremum so as to determine the stochastic acceleration of the particle movement usually if the value of c 1 is bigger than c 2 it will cause the particle to leap out of the search space from the search range instead it will be easier to converge to the local minimum fan et al 2016 kennedy and eberhart suggested that c 1 c 2 then after testing suganthan proved that when c 1 c 2 2 a better solution would be produced therefore the two values were taken as equal suganthan 1999 in this paper the values of c 1 and c 2 were evaluated according to the above related literatures 5 2 2 3 maximum speed the maximum speed limit v m a x is set in order to make the particle step suitable for the iterative process excessive step length will make it easy for particles to miss the global optimal value and too small a step will make the particle prone to precocious thus converging to the local optimal value peer et al 2003 in a comprehensive consideration this paper takes the maximum velocity limit of particles to v m a x 1 2 after testing the pso pnn network has good optimization ability and convergence speed under the maximum speed limit take the 300 groups data of no 3 ship as training example with the number of network particles set to 400 the learning factor c 1 c 2 2 and the maximum speed limit v m a x 1 2 the particle swarm algorithm with stochastic weight optimization is used for the prediction test as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 fig 20 shows the smoothing coefficients of 19 different categories of neurons in the network with iterative variation fig 20 shows the variation of the mean square root error of the network with the number of iterations from figs 16 17 and 21 compared with the single smooth factor the network s mean square error of multiple smoothing factors still decreases significantly after more than 10 iterations and gradually becomes stable after more than 40 iterations the mean square error of single smoothing factor network stays in the range of 40 50 while the multi smooth factor interval converges between 30 and 40 because of the higher precision the network structure has more ideal convergence speed and is more difficult to fall into the local minimum the above parameter setting values will be used as some basic parameter values by the algorithm during network training 5 2 3 effect of inertial weight on convergence performance proper selection of inertial weight ωis the key to improve search efficiency and algorithm accuracy shi and eberhart 1998 common optimization methods are as follows 5 2 3 1 adaptive weight method the nonlinear dynamic inertial weight factor of the adaptive weight method is shown in the formula 5 1 14 ω ω min ω max ω min f f min f a v g f min f f a v g ω max f f a v g in the formula f is the current target function value of the particle f a v g is the average of all current particles and f m i n is the minimum target value for all current particles ω m a x is the maximum value of inertial weight ω m i n is the minimum of inertial weight 5 2 3 2 stochastic weight method the stochastic weight method sets the inertial weight ω to the random number which overcomes the problem that cannot converge to the optimal solution due to the linear decrement of ω the inertial weight formula of stochastic weight method is as 15 ω μ σ n 0 1 μ μ min μ max μ min rand 0 1 in the formula n 0 1 is the random number of the standard state distribution μ m a x represents the maximum value of the average value of random weight μ m i n represents the minimum value of the average value of random weight σ represents the variance of the mean of the random weights 5 2 3 3 linear decrement weight method the linear decrement weight method mainly aims at the phenomenon that the algorithm is precocious and the oscillation near the global optimal solution in the later stage of the algorithm its inertial weight formula is as 16 ω ω max t ω max ω min t max in the formula ω m a x is the maximum value of the inertial weight ω m i n is the minimum value of the inertial weight t is the current number of iterations three kinds of inertial weight optimization methods are compared below mean square error mse is used as fitness function fitness the number of particles is set to 400 the maximum flight speed of the particle is set to 1 2 the maximum number of iterations is set to 50 times the initial weight factor is set to 0 5 and the learning factors c 1 and c 2 are set to 2 the learning factors c 1 and c 2 are set as 2 in addition in the adaptive weight method ω m a x is set as 1 and ω m i n is set as 0 4 in the linear decreasing weight method μ m a x is set as 1 μ m i n is set as 0 4 σ is set as 0 5 in linear decreasing weight method ω m a x is set to 1 and ω m i n is set to 0 4 the inertial weight of the pso pnn network is optimized by the above three methods prediction of spectral acceleration of 50 randomly selected assessment points on the deck of number 3 ship the changing trend of its mean square root error with iteration is shown in fig 22 the above three inertial weight optimization methods are compared among which the stochastic weighting method converges quickly but it is caught in the local solution after 11 iterations the fitting accuracy is relatively poor this method can be selected when the data volume is large which is helpful to save the calculation time the linear diminishing weight method has strong global search ability however it found a relatively excellent solution in the 47th iteration the adaptive weight method and the linear diminishing weight method have similar convergence speed but the adaptive weight global search ability is stronger in summary taking into account the time and efficiency of optimization this paper selects the adaptive weight method to optimize the inertial weight of particle swarm algorithm 5 2 4 impact environmental forecast through the above experimental analysis the parameter values of particle swarm algorithm and the inertial weight method are selected the probability network based on multi smoothing coefficient is used to predict the impact environment of ship 4 results are shown in fig 23 and table 5 as can be seen from fig 23 and table 5 by optimizing the algorithm with different smoothing factors for different modes of neurons the prediction accuracy of pnn network can be further improved the average error of three decks prediction is between 9 15 and the prediction accuracy is increased by 10 compared with the 20 25 of single smoothing factor the multi smoothing factor probabilistic neural network based on particle swarm algorithm has fast convergence speed and few controlled parameters and has strong applicability in the field of ship impact environment prediction 6 conclusions the conclusions are as follows 1 one of the key problems for the establishment of enough data of ship structure is the lack of sample size however the exploration in this paper shows that the highly automated and fast modeling of complex structures like ships can be realized based on the parent ship transformation method and parametric modeling technology the modeling efficiency can be improved by 7 8 times compared with the traditional technology on this basis it is expected to further improve the establishment of large scale database of ship structure by deeply developing the method of parent ship transformation 2 in view of the characteristics of training parameters such as multiple input dimensions single output complex data structure and discrete distribution this paper finds that the deviation standardization method can map the training data to 0 1 broadly which avoids the large span of variable interval and preserve the diversity of various variable data moreover it can enhance the network s perception of parameter changes and greatly improve the accuracy of network prediction in addition this method has some reference value for the preprocessing of some similar complex data in other fields 3 in this paper two different pnn network models of single smoothing factor and multi smoothing factor are established and optimized respectively by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization by comparison the performance of the improved multi smoothing factor network model is better than that of the single smooth smoothing factor network and the average error of its prediction is about 10 lower than that of the single smoothing factor network the average error of the overall prediction is about 10 15 this model can have reference value for the impact

21928,the arbitrary lagrange euler ale finite element method was used to simulate deformation and damage to a cylindrical shell water cylindrical shell cwc structure subjected to underwater explosion undex loading the experimental and computational results were in agreement illustrating the validity of the computational scheme in complex fluid structure interaction problems involving metals subjected to undex loading the dynamic process of undex loading can be divided into four stages based on the deformation of and damage to the cwc structures it was found that increasing the wall thickness of the inner and outer tubes and the thickness of the water sandwich significantly enhanced the overall protection provided by the cwc structure during undex loading when the sandwich was incompletely filled with water the inner tube of the structure wrinkled owing to the large pressure difference between water and air at the interface of the sandwich at a specific water filled ratio the large pressure difference inside the sandwich provided aggravated the deformation and damage of the cwc structure keywords cwc structures underwater explosion fluid structure coupling wall thickness numerical simulation 1 introduction cylindrical shell structures has been widely used in marine engineering such as in submarine oil pipelines offshore drilling platforms underwater vehicle warships and water circulation systems in nuclear facilities however the cylindrical shell structure may deform crack and perforate during an explosive impact and the antiknock ability will change significantly schuman 1964 1965 jiang and olson 1991 1993 yuen et al 2013 therefore the application of the composite structures to improve antiknock ability has become current research hotspot kong et al 2014 jing et al 2013 li et al 2014a b kumar et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 fatt et al 2012 ye et al 2017 extensive researches on thin walled structures impacted by underwater explosion have been conducted rajendran 2008 studied the reloading effects of non contact underwater explosion on planar plates gauch et al 2017 conducted the experiment on woven e glass epoxy roll wrapped cylinders subjected to near field underwater explosion undex the results shown that the application of a polyurea coating was effective for reducing damage in the cylinders gupta et al 2016 carried out an experimental study to explore the mechanisms of dynamic buckling instability in cylindrical structures with underwater explosive loadings and evaluated the effects of initial hydrostatic pressure coupled with a dynamic pressure pulse on the stability of metallic cylindrical shells qiankun et al 2011 presented numerical simulations of dynamic responses of a ship section to non contact underwater explosion wang et al 2014 investigated the dynamic response of ship structures to close in non contact undex with reasonable finite element models the coupled acoustic structure algorithm in abaqus explicit code having been utilized for the simulations fathallah et al 2015 carried out a numerical simulation to examine the behavior of optimized composite elliptical submersible pressure hull subjected to non contact underwater explosion xiao et al 2017 investigated the whipping response of a fluid filled cylindrical shell subjected to underwater explosion and analyzed the influence of the internal fluid on the whipping response through the numerical model liu et al 2017 used the second order doubly asymptotic approximations daa to analyze the external fluid structure interaction fsi effect on the outer fluid field with the outer plates and utilized cavitating acoustic finite element cafe to model the internal fsi effect which coincided well with tests hung et al 2009 investigated the linear and nonlinear dynamic responses of three cylindrical shell structures subjected to underwater small charge explosions in a 4 m 4 m 4 m water tank performing dynamic analyses with fem and compared the simulation with the test as indicated in the above many researches through the methods of experiment and numerical simulation on deformation and damage of the anti explosion composite structures such as double plated structure foam core cylindrical sandwich shells spherical sandwich shells fluid filled cylindrical shell et al have been done both the water filled structure and the multilayer shell structure were proved to be notably efficient in the anti explosion and structure protection and the combination of the two typical structure can further give full play to their advantages and it was notably meaningful to study the dynamic of the cylindrical shell water cylindrical shell cwc structure to undex nevertheless it appeared that few published studies existed that provided a numerical investigation of the dynamic response of the cylindrical shell water cylindrical shell cwc structure namely a composite system of co axial cylindrical shells couples by the inter shell fluid subjected to near field or contact underwater explosion it was important to study the dynamic response mechanism of cwc structure subjected to explosion loading analyze the deformation buckling failure and penetration failure of cwc structure it was of great theoretical significance and engineering application value for the safety assessment of cwc structure and the formulation of technical measures against the impact of explosion to study the deformation and damage of cwc structures a great deal of undex tests had been conducted and the experimental results were presented and discussed in a separate paper wu et al 2018 according to the experiments corresponding finite element simulations utilizing arbitrary lagrange euler formulation ale had been conducted in this paper the experimental data would validate the accuracy of the numerical method which predicted the response of cwc structures anti explosion and energy absorption capacity of specimens with disparate structural dimensions external diameter shell thickness and sandwich thickness the water filled ratio of the sandwich by the validated model 2 experiment description 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were performed in a column explosion tank of dimension of φ8 8 m3 see fig 1 simulating semi infinite water domain the experimental set up used to investigate the deformation and damage of cwc structure was shown in fig 2 the set up was composed of a steel bracket 1 cm thickness and 1m height and two quadrate fixed plate 6 cm thickness and 16 cm height which are all made of 45 steel the experimental specimens were set between the fixed plate and steel bracket which were bolted together around the edges in a zigzag fashion the explosive charges were set at a distance by the employment of pvc tubes fixed to the experimental setup stand off distance was defined as the distance between the end of the charge and the upper surface of the outer tube thin and being of low hardness the pvc tubes exerted little effect on the experimental results the experimental set up was put in the center of the explosion tank by a crane and the testing cwc and explosive charges were 4m away from the surface of water and side walls of the tank respectively the specimen is made of q235 steel the chemical and mechanical properties of which were depicted in table1 it used column 50g tnt charges 1 58 g cm3 with the dimension of φ34 35 mm3 as shown in fig 3 the cwc structure consisted of two co axial tubes the sandwich between them was filled with water naturally and there was no extra pressure or leakage in the water the outer tube was 1 02m long with an exposed length of 0 88m after installation the cavity between the two tubes was filled with water and the inner tube was hollowed a prefill valve was connected to the space between the top end of the inner and outer tube for the convenience of water injection placed on the normal line passing through the center of the outer tube of the cwc structure the charges were initiated at different stand off distance by an electric detonator these cwc structures had an identical external diameter of outer tube d 114 mm two different external diameters of inner tube d 89 mm 50 mm two different thickness of outer tube h 1 7 mm 2 75 mm and inner tube h 1 7 mm 2 75 mm for convenience all the specimens were denoted as follow d h d h as shown in fig 4 2 2 experimental results deformations and damages of partial cwc structures at different stand off distance were shown in fig 5 where r is the stand off distance the cross section deformation of the cwc structures were shown in fig 6 after charge initiation the shock wave of underwater explosion firstly acted on the upper part of the outer tube when the pressure in the impact point area exceeded the yield stress of the structure the severe local deformation was produced in the outer tube and extended to the axial and radial direction at the same time when the shock wave was coupled with the outer tube there was a negative pressure area near the outer tube because the sandwich of the structure was filled with water the intense plastic deformation of the outer tube caused by the instantaneous impact further led to the intense flow of the sandwich water along the initiation direction the incident shock wave in the water passed through the shell to form the transmission shock wave and acted on the surface of the inner shell to cause the plastic deformation of the inner shell due to the nearly incompressibility of the water medium the internal pressure of the sandwich increases significantly along with the deformation of the inner shell the inner shell can greatly weaken the directional flow of the sandwich water and thus significantly hinder the global deformation of the outer tube at the same time the external expansion pressure generated acted on the outer and inner shell of the structure according to the experimental results the deformation and damage modes of the cwc structures subjected to undex loadings can be divided into three main modes namely mode i local plastic deformation without global deformation or local plastic deformation with small global deformation mode ii coupling of local plastic deformation and large global deformation mode iii coupling of local cracking deformation and global deformation compared with single hollow tube cwc structures were difficult to penetrate completely and the explosion resistance of the structures was significantly improved when the middle sandwich layer was thinner and the inner tube had a smaller wall thickness the local plastic deformation area of the inner tube and the outer tube both increase first and then decrease with the standoff distance descending which is on account of the plastic work dissipated for the large global deformation and the formation of fractures however this trend was not synchronous between the inner tube and the outer tube what s more the thickness of sandwich water has a great influence on the deformation and damage of cwc structure under the same explosive loading the cwc structure with thick sandwich water had a larger and more concentrated local deformation area on both the inner tube and the outer tube before the formation of cracks and fragments the thicker the middle sandwich layer was the smaller the global deformation of the inner tube was while the larger the global deformation of the outer tube was the local deformation of cylindrical shell was greatly influenced by the change of the thickness of inner and outer tube when the thickness of the cylindrical shell was large the local deformation area of outer tube and inner tube is small 3 numerical model the numerical model was established by using commercial software ls dyna 971 with arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique and the numerical analysis of the cwc structure subjected to undex loadings was performed 3 1 finite element model for the local and global deformation of the two tubes were symmetric about x z and x y planes a quarter of symmetry finite element models was implemented in the element code as shown in fig 7 the numerical mode was composed by seven parts that represents outer tube inner tube closed end fixed plate water air and tnt charge simulating the damage effect of cwc structure in semi infinite water medium the sandwich between them was filled with water naturally and there was no extra pressure or leakage in the water since the fixed plate was bolted with the steel bracket and got no deformation in all the tests it can be treated as rigid body and simplified the early response of the cwc structure was concerned in this paper the limited water domain near the structure was built for shock wave propagation and fluid structure interaction the boundary surfaces of the external water domain are all set as non reflective boundaries lagrange mesh wherein the coordinates moved with the material was used to model the outer tube inner tube closed end and the fixed plate the water air and explosive domain adopted euler mesh which the grid and materials flowed through were fixed the boundary of the euler mesh was set as a non reflection boundary solid164 element and g cm μs unit were applied in this model to balance the numerical stability the accuracy of the fea results and the computational efficiency a convergence study was conducted a feature mesh size of 2 mm was determined to be optimal for the region that was less than 20 cm from the center of the inner and outer tube water air and tnt were modeled with element of 3 mm size and the other part meshed with solid element consisted of meshes that measured 5 mm the inner tube outer tube and the closed end shared nodes to transmit the acting force the fixed plate was simplified and considered to be fixed which left out the parts bolted with the bracket to prevent the penetration between the face of the cwc structure and the fixed plate the keyword contact automatic surface to surface with a contact static and a dynamic was adopted to account for the contacts within the outer tube closed end and the simplified fixed plate made up of the faces of the solids elements 3 2 material model the johnson cook j c model was not only frequently used for modeling large deformation or fracture of high temperatures large strains and high strain rate due to explosion or impact johnson et al 1985 but also adopted to model the metal components steel q235 of the cwc structures the equivalent stress σ y in this model was defined as follows 1 σ y a b ε p n 1 c ln ε 1 t m where a b c n and m are the j c material coefficients ε p is the effective plastic strain ε ε p ε 0 is the dimensionless effective strain and t is the homologous temperature defined by t t t r t m t r where the suffixes r and m represent room temperature and melting temperature respectively the johnson cook fracture criterion was obtained using the following formula 2 ε f d 1 d 2 exp d 3 σ 1 d 4 ln ε 1 d 5 t where d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 and d 5 are the material constant and ε f is the stress triaxiality ratio the johnson cook model was in terms of the concept of cumulative damage arising from the fracture the damage parameter d of the material element was expressed as 3 d δ ε ε f where δ ε is the increment of accumulated equivalent plastic strain that occurs during an integration cycle and ε f is the effective fracture strain at instant the jones wilkens lee jwl equation of state eos can model the pressure generated by high explosive material model mat high explosive burn such as tnt which had been widely used in engineering calculation lstc 2003 and can be written as 4 p a 1 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v b 1 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where p is the pressure a 1 r 1 b 1 r 2 and ω are the material constants v is the relative volume of detonation product and e is the specific energy with an initial value of e0 material type 9 of ls dyna mat null was employed for the simulation of air with the polynomial eos being adopted which defines the relationship between pressure density and internal energy the pressure was defined as follows 5 p γ 1 ρ ρ 0 e where ρ 0 is the current density ρ 1 292 10 3 g cm3 is initial air density γis the ratio of specific heat capacity ratio of air and e 0 0 25 is the initial internal energy per unit reference volume of gas to model water the grüneisen eos steinberg 1987 li et al 2014a b was applied which defines pressure for compressed materials as 6 p ρ 0 c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 2 μ 1 2 γ 0 a μ e and for expanded materials as 7 p ρ 0 c 2 μ γ 0 a μ e where c 1 65 km s is the intercept of the cubic shock velocity particle velocity v s v p curve s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the coefficients of the slope of the v s v p curve γ 0 0 25 is the gruneisen gamma e 0 0 is initial internal energy and ρ 0 1 00 g cm is the initial density the main material types and mechanical properities of q235 steel xiao 2010 water and tnt charge as well as the parameters of equations of state were listed in table2 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical approach the comparison with experimental data under situations with the same explosion impact loading was essential for demonstrating the validity of the numerical method adopted it was the comparison between the experimental and numerical final deformation which shown well agreement and both depicted the deformation characteristic of cwc structure such as local sunken global bending and the end distortion owing to the constraint from the fixed plate as shown in fig 8 the sunken nest generated by explosion impact loading can embody the extent of deformation and damage of the cwc structure as shown in fig 9 the deformation curves on cross section of experimental and numerical result were in agreement in which ot and it respectively represented outer tube and inner tube experimental and simulation data of the local and global deformation was shown in fig 10 the parameter δ l1 and δg1 separately represented the vertical distances from the middle point and the lowest point of the back zone to the highest point at both ends of the outer tube accordingly the parameter δ l2 and δ g2 respectively corresponded to the deformation parameters of the inner tube as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the simulation results about the data of the sunken nest were in agreement with the experimental results only some very small discrepancies were evident thus it seemed relatively adequate to use this model in a forthcoming optimization study of the cwc structure subjected to the undex loading 4 2 structural response process as shown in fig 12 in order to understand the response process of the cwc structure subjected to undex 12 elements nodes were selected in the axial and radial directions of the inner tube and the outer tube the positions of elements 1 2 3 and elements 4 5 6 corresponded to each other in the axial direction similarly the positions of elements 1 7 8 and elements 4 9 10 corresponded to each other in the circumferential direction elements 1 4 were respectively the center points of the upper surface of the inner and outer tubes and elements 11 12 were respectively the center points of the lower surface of the inner and outer shells the corresponding nodes were selected in each element position in order to make comparison the nodes were numbered from nodes 1 to nodes 12 figs 13 15 were respectively time history curves of element pressure and nodal velocity at different locations because the detonating charge was cylindrical charge the charge being large and close to the structure surface explosive distance r is small the detonation wave produced after initiation had obvious directional and cross distribution shape zhao et al 2008 which axial propagation velocity was greater than the radial propagation velocity in the process of shock wave propagation after explosive detonation the incident shock wave in water had a larger peak pressure in the axial direction according to the relationship between the pressure of incident shock wave and the propagation velocity of shock wave the water density because the shock wave attenuated rapidly and the surface of the outer tube was curved surface the incident shock wave was unevenly distributed on the surface of the structure for the surface of the inner tube enclosed by a water filled sandwich the dynamic response of the inner tube mainly comes from the action of the force transmitted by the water filled sandwich that is the transmitted shock wave as shown in fig 13 the head of shock wave reached the midpoint element 1 of the outer tube about 21μs after the charge initiation and its pressure jumped to the peak about 1 2 gpa at about 26μs the transmission shock wave acted on the inner shell of the structure after passing through the outer shell the time of transmission shock wave reaching the middle point of the inner tube element 4 was about 25μs after detonation and its peak value was about 0 575 gpa around 38μs the shock wave intensity near the initiation point was relatively large and each element pressure of the inner and outer tube decreased gradually along the axis direction as shown in fig 14 unlike the axial element pressure distribution the peak pressure of the inner and outer shell elements did not fully conform to the decreasing distribution along the circumferential direction with the initiation point of the outer shell the peak pressure of the outer shell element presented irregular distribution along the circumferential direction the maximum pressure peak value of element 7 was about 2 11 gpa which reflected the uneven stress distribution on the surface of the structure the surface deformation of the thin wall shell caused by this force state was similar to wrinkle the peak pressure of the inner shell had no regularity and there was no obvious secondary peak pressure the elements on the upper surface of the inner and outer shells elements 1 to 10 produced the peak value of secondary pressure at about 100 200μs after the incident transmitted shock wave impact the transmitted shock wave formed by the incident shock wave passing through the outer shell formed the reflected shock wave after the impact on the inner shell which carried out the secondary loading on the inner wall and outer wall of the shell and reflected the two peak velocities produced by the corresponding nodes as shown in fig 15 especially near the direct zone subjected to the shock wave impact the elements subjected to the reflected shock wave impact undergone a relatively obvious negative pressure of lasting 0 8 ms as shown in fig 13 the red dotted line section this was because the external flow field of the structure corresponding to this region and the shock wave pressure in the fluid filled sandwich were relatively large which made a slight cavitation effect in the water body mäkinen 1998 the stress state of the inner and outer shell elements changed from compression to tension which showed the rapid attenuation of the nodes velocity in the region after the second peak of velocity on the velocity time curve because of the surface characteristics of the structure cavitation effect occurred only in a very small area near the impact point and was relatively weak so there was no obvious reloading effect after the negative pressure section rajendran 2008 elements 11 and 12 were not directly impacted by the incident shock wave because they were located on the lower surface of the structure so the peak pressure was much smaller than that of other elements in the middle section of the circumference however there was also a peak pressure corresponding to the two shock wave loads at the initial stage of the structural response it produced a third peak pressure pm 0 13 gpa at 3198μs in element 12 similar to the first two peak pressures which reflected the vibration and resilience of the structure after plastic deformation due to the overall motion of the inner and outer tubes the fluid filled sandwich produced obviously oscillatory waves as shown in fig 15 jing et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 had respectively investigated the dynamic response of cylindrical sandwich shells and spherical sandwich shells subjected to external air explosion loadings with numerical simulation and classified the general dynamic process of structures into several stages according to different classified principles based on the previous studies and the deformation features of the structures in this work the dynamic process of the cwc structure can be divided into four stages namely stage i incident transmission shock wave coupling stage ii reflected shock wave coupling stage iii structural large plastic response stage ⅳ structural rebound and vibration combining the deformation of the cwc structure and stress cloud chart shown in fig 16 the response characteristics of each stage were summarized as follows 1 stage i 21μs 50μs the underwater explosion shock wave began to couple with the structure and the inner shell of the structure was impacted by the transmission shock wave in the liquid filled sandwich after the incident shock wave impacted the outer shell of the structure in the external flow field at this stage there was no obvious plastic deformation in the inner and outer tubes 2 stage ii 50μs 250μs the transmitted shock wave in the water filled sandwich reached the surface of the inner tube and formed a reflected shock wave which impacted the inner wall of the outer tube and then re reflected as a secondary reflection wave and impacted the outer wall of the inner tube the central sections of upper surfaces of the inner and outer tubes were rapidly compressed in the stage and began to produce locally plastic deformation 3 stage iii 250μs 2200μs after the coupling of the reflected shock wave and the inner and outer shell of the structure was completed the explosive middle face of the outer tube collapsed rapidly there was obvious local plastic deformation accompanied by the formation of sunken nest and the whole deformation coincided with the direction of load action due to the multiple loading of transmitted shock wave and reflected shock wave and the additional force produced by the collapse of the shell the deformation characteristics of the inner tube were similar to that of the outer tube at the same time about 2200μs the node velocity of the inner and outer tube decreased to 0 the displacement of the nodes reached the maximum and the local and overall plastic deformation basically finished 4 stage ⅳ 2200μs 5000μs due to the restraint of fixed frame the rapid attenuation of explosive impact loading and the increase of plastic deformation energy of structure the vibration and resilience of the inner and outer tube occurred under the action of residual stress and the whole deformation of the structure changed from plastic deformation to elastic plastic deformation 4 3 energy absorption characteristics 4 3 1 plastic dissipation process there was the energy curve of time history of the inner and outer tube during the deformation process as shown in fig 17 the total energy of the structure included the internal energy and kinetic energy the internal energy of the structure rose rapidly at the initial stage of the structural response due to undex loading and then gradually rose until it became stable corresponding to the two peak values of the velocity response the kinetic energy of the inner and outer tubes gradually decreased to zero after two increasing process and the total energy curves and the internal energy curves of the inner and outer tubes coincided eventually the internal energy stability of the outer tube was about 1340j and the internal energy stability of the inner tube was 1884j although the response stage i and stage ii toke up a relatively short time and only a small amount of local sunken deformation occurred in the inner and outer tubes the energy used for plastic deformation of the outer tube and the inner tube occupied 51 and 45 of the total plastic dissipation energy respectively this was because in the initial stage of structural response the inner and outer tubes were subjected to local high strength shock wave loading and appear dynamic instability and the material softening effect occurred there was produced a great strain in the impact region at a very short time shown in fig 18 accompanied by a rapid rise in temperature namely high temperature and high strain rate deformation therefore the initial stage of impact response was very important for the dynamic instability of the structure as for the cwc structure the inner tube deformation dissipated more plastic deformation energy accounting for about 58 4 3 2 influence of the tube thickness the main role of water filled sandwich in structural deformation was to establish the coupling relationship between the inner tube the outer tube and water as the transmission medium of shock wave and reflected shock wave and to influence the deformation of the inner and outer tube by providing the initial base pressure gao et al 2014 therefore the chemical energy transformed into structural internal energy after explosion and mainly existed in the form of plastic dissipation energy of inner and outer tubes plastic dissipation energy directly reflected the intensity of the tube deformation for the same size of tube the greater the plastic dissipation energy was indicating that the more severe the deformation of the tube was the weaker its ability to resist explosive shock was in view of the test conditions in this paper although the change of the shell thickness meant the change of the water filled layer thickness at the same time the change of the water filled layer could be neglected in compared with the whole thickness of the tube and the water filled layer fig 19 shown the comparison of plastic energy dissipation of cwc structures with different sizes when r 6 cm in which c1 represented d114 h1 7 d89 h2 75 c2 represented d114 h1 7 d50 h2 75 c3 represented d114 h1 7 d89 h1 7 c4 represented d114 h1 7 d50 h1 7 c5 represented d114 h2 75 d89 h2 75 c6 represented d114 h2 75 d50 h2 75 c7 represented d114 h2 75 d89 h1 7 c8 represented d114 h2 75 d50 h1 7 as far as the whole performance of the structure was concerned the increase of the thickness of the outer or the inner tube reduced the whole dissipation energy of the structure that is enhanced its overall explosion resistance the inner shell is thin and the energy absorption of the cwc structure is large the inner shell is thick whether the shell is thin or thick there is no significant difference in the overall energy absorption of the structure compared with c3 and c1 c1 had the largest decrease in overall absorptive plasticity reaching 36 compared with c5 and c1 c5 had slightly increased overall energy absorption levels although the shell thickness had increased by 1 05 mm 4 3 3 influence of sandwich water thickness when the cwc structure was impacted by underwater explosion it had a complex coupling effect with the water in the sandwich which made the inner and outer shell and the water sandwich form a whole and absorbed the underwater explosion impact energy together although the water sandwich resulted in the sudden increase of the local pressure of the structure which intensified the plastic deformation of the inner shell it also provided a huge support force for the shell to reduce the maximum deformation when the filled liquid layer of the structure is thick the local deformation area of the inner and outer shell of the structure can be better protected and the thicker filled liquid layer can more effectively convert the incident concentrated load to the uniform load the cwc structure can dissipate more blast energy to break the shell from energy absorption characteristics of the structure with the increase of water sandwich thickness the plastic energy dissipation of the inner tube the outer tube and the whole structure decreased in varying degrees it reflected that water medium alleviated the explosive damage effect of the inner tube the outer tube and the whole structure in the process of structural deformation and protected effectively them as far as the overall anti explosion performance of the structure was concerned the increase of the water thickness had the greatest influence on the structure with d114 h1 7 d89 h1 7 c3 compared with c4 and c3 the overall plastic energy dissipation of the structure with c4 decreases by 2077j the fall ratio was 41 2 which was due to the weakest overall protective performance of the structure with c3 due to the thinner inner and outer tube walls and the increase of water thickness could significantly improve the overall protective performance 4 4 influence of sandwich water height on structural response it existed working condition of partial liquid filled in the cwc structure in the engineering application the airspace provided the motion space for the liquid in the sandwich the inner tube the response of the outer tube and the whole structure of the cwc structure would be different from the full filling of the sandwich in order to study the influence of sandwich filled liquid condition on structural response the structure of c5 was selected for finite element analysis as shown in fig 20 the stand off distance was set at r 6 cm and r 10 cm and the sandwich water plane was defined as fh 0 cm when it reached the middle section height of the inner and outer tube four kinds of height conditions of sandwich water were set namely fh 0 cm fh 3 cm fh 4 75 cm fh 5 425 cm in which fh 5 425 cm corresponded to the sandwich fully filled the deformation process of cwc structure r 6 cm fh 0 cm shown in fig 21 compared with the sandwich completely filled with water initial response stage of the outer tube subjected to undex impact the sandwich of incompletely filled with water could not provide the base pressure to resist deformation in the center area of the initiation point because the upper part of which was air due to the lack of load transmission capacity of water medium on the explosion facing surface the area of the inner tube with high stress level was obviously smaller than that of outer tube with the propagation of stress wave in the outer tube to the area near the impact point and the action of water medium below the sandwich the high stress area in the inner tube gradually enlarged around t 150μs the upper center of the outer and inner tube began to form obvious local depression with the increase of the local deformation and the whole deformation of the outer and inner tube the sandwich water gradually exerted reaction force on the inner and outer tubes and the pressure difference between the sandwich water area and the air area caused the inner tube surface to wrinkle the deformation process of cwc structure r 6 cm fh 3 cm shown in fig 22 after the outer tube was subjected to the incident shock wave in the external water although the transmission shock wave of the inner tube was weakened to a certain extent by the air medium in the sandwich the higher pressure was formed in most areas of the inner tube in a relatively short time in the sandwich there was a huge pressure difference near the interface between the water and the air corresponding to the center of the blasting face which aggravated the uneven force distribution in the upper part of the inner tube and caused local wrinkles in the early response period of the inner tube with the intensified local and whole deformation of the inner and outer tubes the wrinkles became much obvious and some elements of the inner tube failure and local penetration occurred the final deformation section of the structure in eight working conditions shown in fig 23 the comparison shown that the outer tube did not wrinkle with the two explosive heights and the inner tube had obvious wrinkle when fh 0 cm and wrinkle and the failure of the element was accompanied when fh 3 cm for the cwc structure with completely liquid filled sandwich the wrinkle formed mainly in the outer shell due to its curved surface characteristics thin wall thickness and water filled layer the cwc structure of partial water filled sandwich formed mainly in the inner tube for the cwc structure d114 h2 75 d89 h2 75 partially filled with liquid in the sandwich the stress wave passed through the outer tube to the impact center of inner tube and the water sandwich which provided the inner tube with reference pressure to resist deformation and then the local deformation and the overall deformation of the inner tube increased the water level in the sandwich moved up and vibrated continuously and the inner tube folded under the huge pressure difference between the air and water medium in the sandwich when the water filled layer was in the middle height fh 3 cm the interface between the air domain and the water domain in the interlayer fluctuated most violently and the impact force acting on the inner tube changed the most and the fold of the inner tube was the most obvious as shown in fig 24 when the water filled layer was low fh 0 cm the local deformation of the inner and outer tube mainly occurred in the upper part of the filled liquid layer and the size of the exposed water surface of the inner shell is large the deformation of the inner tube dissipated most of the transmitted stress wave energy the huge pressure difference between the air and water medium in the interlayer became smaller and the fold of the inner shell was relatively small when the sandwich water interface was high fh 4 75 cm and fh 5 425 cm the deformations of the inner and outer tubes made the water near the impact point fill with the whole interlayer and the pressure equalization characteristics of the water medium appeared so the inner shell did not form obvious fold axial section deformation curves of the inner and outer tubes shown in fig 25 when r 6 cm with the increase of the sandwich water height the deformation of the local depression δ l1 and δ l2 of inner and outer tubes increased gradually and the sunken nest decreased gradually this was because with fh 4 75 cm or fh 5 425 cm the inner and outer tubes were subjected to the action of the sandwich water at the early stage of the response which made the local deformation more localized with fh 0 cm or fh 3 cm the early response characteristics of inner and outer tubes were similar to that of the hollow tube and the local deformation area was larger this rule was basically established when r 10 cm the local deformation of inner and outer tube was the smallest with fh 3 cm which was due to the drastic wrinkle deformation of the inner tube which made the central part of inner tube bulge obviously and produced a similar anti intuitive effect the pressure curves of time history of cwc structural elements under different water filled conditions shown in fig 26 and fig 27 when r 6 cm the explosive impact energy is larger and the explosive impact area of cwc structure is more localized when the shock wave reaches the surface of the structure there will be obvious reflection and flow around it when the water level of the sandwich is high the pressure time history curve of the axial element shows two obvious pressure peaks and the negative pressure zone is more likely to appear after the pressure attenuation the blue dotted line frame in fig 26 b it reflects that the center of the explosion facing surface of the outer tube is rapidly coupled with the liquid filled sandwich after being acted by the incident shock wave the peak pressure of the inner shell element gradually decreases in the axial direction and presents irregular distribution along the circumferential direction under different liquid filled conditions the peak pressure of the circumferential element is generally higher than that of the axial element and there is no obvious secondary peak pressure the uneven distribution of pressure will lead to stress concentration in some locations and form hinges to prevent further deformation of the circumferential shell when r 10 cm the explosive impact energy of cwc structure is relatively weak the pressure difference between the elements decreases the intensity of shell deformation decreases and the pressure on the axial element also shows a second peak but the intensity decreases which indicates that the deformation degree of the axial shell decreases the circumferential pressure distribution of the shell will also lead to stress concentration in part of the position forming a hinge which will lead to the larger pressure on both sides of the explosion center there was the abnormal variation of circumferential pressure of the inner tube under two blasting height with fh 3 cm the pressure curve of time history of element 9 shown obvious fluctuation when r 6 cm which reflected the violent pressure change during the formation of wrinkle the pressure curve of time history of element 9 did not attenuate immediately after the peak pressure when r 6 cm but formed a positive pressure platform which was related to the bulge of the inner tube center the plastic energy dissipation of cwc structure under different working conditions shown in fig 28 the comparison shown that with the increase of the height of the sandwich water the plastic energy dissipation of the inner tube the outer tube and the whole structure decreased gradually in the absence of drastic wrinkles in the inner tube it shown the higher the water filled rate of the sandwich in a certain range was the stronger the anti explosion protection capability of the whole structure was under certain water filled conditions such as fh 3 cm the damage effect of the structure may be stronger than that under low water filled rate it was due to the abnormal deformation of the inner and outer tubes caused by the huge pressure difference in the sandwich under a certain water filled rate which reduced the overall protection capacity of the structure 5 conclusion 1 experimental investigations were carried out on cwc structures subjected to underwater explosion loading the cwc structure can remarkably facilitate the structural explosion resistance capacity and it is very hard to get complete penetration it presented the dynamic response of the cwc structure subjected to undex loading by employing a numerical model validated compared with the experiment data of corresponding cwc structures the ale coupling model was able to capture the main trend of deformation and damage in the experiments in an adequate manner 2 based on the deformation and damage of the cwc structures in this work the dynamic process of which could be divided into four stages in the early stage of structural response plastic dissipation energy of the outer shell dominated however as far as the final deformation of the structure was concerned the inner shell deformation dissipated more plastic deformation energy the inner shell is thin and the energy absorption of the cwc structure is large the inner shell is thick whether the shell is thin or thick there is no significant difference in the overall energy absorption of the structure it had samller and more concentrated local deformation area on the inner tube and the outer tube with a thicker water the thicker filled liquid layer can more effectively convert the incident concentrated load to the uniform load the outer tube of thicker water sandwich shown bigger global deformation 3 the sandwich water filled ratio had great influence on the damage and deformation of cwc structure subjected to underwater explosion loading when the sandwich was incompletely filled with water the inner tube of the structure was wrinkled due to the large pressure difference between the water and the air at the interface of the sandwich under the condition of specific water filled ratio the damage and deformation of the cwc structure were stronger than that of the structure with high and low water filled ratio funding body national natural

21928,the arbitrary lagrange euler ale finite element method was used to simulate deformation and damage to a cylindrical shell water cylindrical shell cwc structure subjected to underwater explosion undex loading the experimental and computational results were in agreement illustrating the validity of the computational scheme in complex fluid structure interaction problems involving metals subjected to undex loading the dynamic process of undex loading can be divided into four stages based on the deformation of and damage to the cwc structures it was found that increasing the wall thickness of the inner and outer tubes and the thickness of the water sandwich significantly enhanced the overall protection provided by the cwc structure during undex loading when the sandwich was incompletely filled with water the inner tube of the structure wrinkled owing to the large pressure difference between water and air at the interface of the sandwich at a specific water filled ratio the large pressure difference inside the sandwich provided aggravated the deformation and damage of the cwc structure keywords cwc structures underwater explosion fluid structure coupling wall thickness numerical simulation 1 introduction cylindrical shell structures has been widely used in marine engineering such as in submarine oil pipelines offshore drilling platforms underwater vehicle warships and water circulation systems in nuclear facilities however the cylindrical shell structure may deform crack and perforate during an explosive impact and the antiknock ability will change significantly schuman 1964 1965 jiang and olson 1991 1993 yuen et al 2013 therefore the application of the composite structures to improve antiknock ability has become current research hotspot kong et

composite structures such as double plated structure foam core cylindrical sandwich shells spherical sandwich shells fluid filled cylindrical shell et al have been done both the water filled structure and the multilayer shell structure were proved to be notably efficient in the anti explosion and structure protection and the combination of the two typical structure can further give full play to their advantages and it was notably meaningful to study the dynamic of the cylindrical shell water cylindrical shell cwc structure to undex nevertheless it appeared that few published studies existed that provided a numerical investigation of the dynamic response of the cylindrical shell water cylindrical shell cwc structure namely a composite system of co axial cylindrical shells couples by the inter shell fluid subjected to near field or contact underwater explosion it was important to study the dynamic response mechanism of cwc structure subjected to explosion loading analyze the deformation buckling failure and penetration failure of cwc structure it was of great theoretical significance and engineering application value for the safety assessment of cwc structure and the formulation of technical measures against the impact of explosion to study the deformation and damage of cwc structures a great deal of undex tests had been conducted and the experimental results were presented and discussed in a separate paper wu et al 2018 according to the experiments corresponding finite element simulations utilizing arbitrary lagrange euler formulation ale had been conducted in this paper the experimental data would validate the accuracy of the numerical method which predicted the response of cwc structures anti explosion and energy absorption capacity of specimens with disparate structural dimensions external diameter shell thickness and sandwich thickness the water filled ratio of the sandwich by the validated model 2 experiment description 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were performed in a column explosion tank of dimension of φ8 8 m3 see fig 1 simulating semi infinite water domain the experimental set up used to investigate the deformation and damage of cwc structure was shown in fig 2 the set up was composed of a steel bracket 1 cm thickness and 1m height and two quadrate fixed plate 6 cm thickness and 16 cm height which are all made of 45 steel the experimental specimens were set between the fixed plate and steel bracket which were bolted together around the edges in a zigzag fashion the explosive charges were set at a distance by the employment of pvc tubes fixed to the experimental setup stand off distance was defined as the distance between the end of the charge and the upper surface of the outer tube thin and being of low hardness the pvc tubes exerted little effect on the experimental results the experimental set up was put in the center of the explosion tank by a crane and the testing cwc and explosive charges were 4m away from the surface of water and side walls of the tank respectively the specimen is made of q235 steel the chemical and mechanical properties of which were depicted in table1 it used column 50g tnt charges 1 58 g cm3 with the dimension of φ34 35 mm3 as shown in fig 3 the cwc structure consisted of two co axial tubes the sandwich between them was filled with water naturally and there was no extra pressure or leakage in the water the outer tube was 1 02m long with an exposed length of 0 88m after installation the cavity between the two tubes was filled with water and the inner tube was hollowed a prefill valve was connected to the space between the top end of the inner and outer tube for the convenience of water injection placed on the normal line passing through the center of the outer tube of the cwc structure the charges were initiated at different stand off distance by an electric detonator these cwc structures had an identical external diameter of outer tube d 114 mm two different external diameters of inner tube d 89 mm 50 mm two different thickness of outer tube h 1 7 mm 2 75 mm and inner tube h 1 7 mm 2 75 mm for convenience all the specimens were denoted as follow d h d h as shown in fig 4 2 2 experimental results deformations and damages of partial cwc structures at different stand off distance were shown in fig 5 where r is the stand off distance the cross section deformation of the cwc structures were shown in fig 6 after charge initiation the shock wave of underwater explosion firstly acted on the upper part of the outer tube when the pressure in the impact point area exceeded the yield stress of the structure the severe local deformation was produced in the outer tube and extended to the axial and radial direction at the same time when the shock wave was coupled with the outer tube there was a negative pressure area near the outer tube because the sandwich of the structure was filled with water the intense plastic deformation of the outer tube caused by the instantaneous impact further led to the intense flow of the sandwich water along the initiation direction the incident shock wave in the water passed through the shell to form the transmission shock wave and acted on the surface of the inner shell to cause the plastic deformation of the inner shell due to the nearly incompressibility of the water medium the internal pressure of the sandwich increases significantly along with the deformation of the inner shell the inner shell can greatly weaken the directional flow of the sandwich water and thus significantly hinder the global deformation of the outer tube at the same time the external expansion pressure generated acted on the outer and inner shell of the structure according to the experimental results the deformation and damage modes of the cwc structures subjected to undex loadings can be divided into three main modes namely mode i local plastic deformation without global deformation or local plastic deformation with small global deformation mode ii coupling of local plastic deformation and large global deformation mode iii coupling of local cracking deformation and global deformation compared with single hollow tube cwc structures were difficult to penetrate completely and the explosion resistance of the structures was significantly improved when the middle sandwich layer was thinner and the inner tube had a smaller wall thickness the local plastic deformation area of the inner tube and the outer tube both increase first and then decrease with the standoff distance descending which is on account of the plastic work dissipated for the large global deformation and the formation of fractures however this trend was not synchronous between the inner tube and the outer tube what s more the thickness of sandwich water has a great influence on the deformation and damage of cwc structure under the same explosive loading the cwc structure with thick sandwich water had a larger and more concentrated local deformation area on both the inner tube and the outer tube before the formation of cracks and fragments the thicker the middle sandwich layer was the smaller the global deformation of the inner tube was while the larger the global deformation of the outer tube was the local deformation of cylindrical shell was greatly influenced by the change of the thickness of inner and outer tube when the thickness of the cylindrical shell was large the local deformation area of outer tube and inner tube is small 3 numerical model the numerical model was established by using commercial software ls dyna 971 with arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique and the numerical analysis of the cwc structure subjected to undex loadings was performed 3 1 finite element model for the local and global deformation of the two tubes were symmetric about x z and x y planes a quarter of symmetry finite element models was implemented in the element code as shown in fig 7 the numerical mode was composed by seven parts that represents outer tube inner tube closed end fixed plate water air and tnt charge simulating the damage effect of cwc structure in semi infinite water medium the sandwich between them was filled with water naturally and there was no extra pressure or leakage in the water since the fixed plate was bolted with the steel bracket and got no deformation in all the tests it can be treated as rigid body and simplified the early response of the cwc structure was concerned in this paper the limited water domain near the structure was built for shock wave propagation and fluid structure interaction the boundary surfaces of the external water domain are all set as non reflective boundaries lagrange mesh wherein the coordinates moved with the material was used to model the outer tube inner tube closed end and the fixed plate the water air and explosive domain adopted euler mesh which the grid and materials flowed through were fixed the boundary of the euler mesh was set as a non reflection boundary solid164 element and g cm μs unit were applied in this model to balance the numerical stability the accuracy of the fea results and the computational efficiency a convergence study was conducted a feature mesh size of 2 mm was determined to be optimal for the region that was less than 20 cm from the center of the inner and outer tube water air and tnt were modeled with element of 3 mm size and the other part meshed with solid element consisted of meshes that measured 5 mm the inner tube outer tube and the closed end shared nodes to transmit the acting force the fixed plate was simplified and considered to be fixed which left out the parts bolted with the bracket to prevent the penetration between the face of the cwc structure and the fixed plate the keyword contact automatic surface to surface with a contact static and a dynamic was adopted to account for the contacts within the outer tube closed end and the simplified fixed plate made up of the faces of the solids elements 3 2 material model the johnson cook j c model was not only frequently used for modeling large deformation or fracture of high temperatures large strains and high strain rate due to explosion or impact johnson et al 1985 but also adopted to model the metal components steel q235 of the cwc structures the equivalent stress σ y in this model was defined as follows 1 σ y a b ε p n 1 c ln ε 1 t m where a b c n and m are the j c material coefficients ε p is the effective plastic strain ε ε p ε 0 is the dimensionless effective strain and t is the homologous temperature defined by t t t r t m t r where the suffixes r and m represent room temperature and melting temperature respectively the johnson cook fracture criterion was obtained using the following formula 2 ε f d 1 d 2 exp d 3 σ 1 d 4 ln ε 1 d 5 t where d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 and d 5 are the material constant and ε f is the stress triaxiality ratio the johnson cook model was in terms of the concept of cumulative damage arising from the fracture the damage parameter d of the material element was expressed as 3 d δ ε ε f where δ ε is the increment of accumulated equivalent plastic strain that occurs during an integration cycle and ε f is the effective fracture strain at instant the jones wilkens lee jwl equation of state eos can model the pressure generated by high explosive material model mat high explosive burn such as tnt which had been widely used in engineering calculation lstc 2003 and can be written as 4 p a 1 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v b 1 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where p is the pressure a 1 r 1 b 1 r 2 and ω are the material constants v is the relative volume of detonation product and e is the specific energy with an initial value of e0 material type 9 of ls dyna mat null was employed for the simulation of air with the polynomial eos being adopted which defines the relationship between pressure density and internal energy the pressure was defined as follows 5 p γ 1 ρ ρ 0 e where ρ 0 is the current density ρ 1 292 10 3 g cm3 is initial air density γis the ratio of specific heat capacity ratio of air and e 0 0 25 is the initial internal energy per unit reference volume of gas to model water the grüneisen eos steinberg 1987 li et al 2014a b was applied which defines pressure for compressed materials as 6 p ρ 0 c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 2 μ 1 2 γ 0 a μ e and for expanded materials as 7 p ρ 0 c 2 μ γ 0 a μ e where c 1 65 km s is the intercept of the cubic shock velocity particle velocity v s v p curve s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the coefficients of the slope of the v s v p curve γ 0 0 25 is the gruneisen gamma e 0 0 is initial internal energy and ρ 0 1 00 g cm is the initial density the main material types and mechanical properities of q235 steel xiao 2010 water and tnt charge as well as the parameters of equations of state were listed in table2 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical approach the comparison with experimental data under situations with the same explosion impact loading was essential for demonstrating the validity of the numerical method adopted it was the comparison between the experimental and numerical final deformation which shown well agreement and both depicted the deformation characteristic of cwc structure such as local sunken global bending and the end distortion owing to the constraint from the fixed plate as shown in fig 8 the sunken nest generated by explosion impact loading can embody the extent of deformation and damage of the cwc structure as shown in fig 9 the deformation curves on cross section of experimental and numerical result were in agreement in which ot and it respectively represented outer tube and inner tube experimental and simulation data of the local and global deformation was shown in fig 10 the parameter δ l1 and δg1 separately represented the vertical distances from the middle point and the lowest point of the back zone to the highest point at both ends of the outer tube accordingly the parameter δ l2 and δ g2 respectively corresponded to the deformation parameters of the inner tube as shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the simulation results about the data of the sunken nest were in agreement with the experimental results only some very small discrepancies were evident thus it seemed relatively adequate to use this model in a forthcoming optimization study of the cwc structure subjected to the undex loading 4 2 structural response process as shown in fig 12 in order to understand the response process of the cwc structure subjected to undex 12 elements nodes were selected in the axial and radial directions of the inner tube and the outer tube the positions of elements 1 2 3 and elements 4 5 6 corresponded to each other in the axial direction similarly the positions of elements 1 7 8 and elements 4 9 10 corresponded to each other in the circumferential direction elements 1 4 were respectively the center points of the upper surface of the inner and outer tubes and elements 11 12 were respectively the center points of the lower surface of the inner and outer shells the corresponding nodes were selected in each element position in order to make comparison the nodes were numbered from nodes 1 to nodes 12 figs 13 15 were respectively time history curves of element pressure and nodal velocity at different locations because the detonating charge was cylindrical charge the charge being large and close to the structure surface explosive distance r is small the detonation wave produced after initiation had obvious directional and cross distribution shape zhao et al 2008 which axial propagation velocity was greater than the radial propagation velocity in the process of shock wave propagation after explosive detonation the incident shock wave in water had a larger peak pressure in the axial direction according to the relationship between the pressure of incident shock wave and the propagation velocity of shock wave the water density because the shock wave attenuated rapidly and the surface of the outer tube was curved surface the incident shock wave was unevenly distributed on the surface of the structure for the surface of the inner tube enclosed by a water filled sandwich the dynamic response of the inner tube mainly comes from the action of the force transmitted by the water filled sandwich that is the transmitted shock wave as shown in fig 13 the head of shock wave reached the midpoint element 1 of the outer tube about 21μs after the charge initiation and its pressure jumped to the peak about 1 2 gpa at about 26μs the transmission shock wave acted on the inner shell of the structure after passing through the outer shell the time of transmission shock wave reaching the middle point of the inner tube element 4 was about 25μs after detonation and its peak value was about 0 575 gpa around 38μs the shock wave intensity near the initiation point was relatively large and each element pressure of the inner and outer tube decreased gradually along the axis direction as shown in fig 14 unlike the axial element pressure distribution the peak pressure of the inner and outer shell elements did not fully conform to the decreasing distribution along the circumferential direction with the initiation point of the outer shell the peak pressure of the outer shell element presented irregular distribution along the circumferential direction the maximum pressure peak value of element 7 was about 2 11 gpa which reflected the uneven stress distribution on the surface of the structure the surface deformation of the thin wall shell caused by this force state was similar to wrinkle the peak pressure of the inner shell had no regularity and there was no obvious secondary peak pressure the elements on the upper surface of the inner and outer shells elements 1 to 10 produced the peak value of secondary pressure at about 100 200μs after the incident transmitted shock wave impact the transmitted shock wave formed by the incident shock wave passing through the outer shell formed the reflected shock wave after the impact on the inner shell which carried out the secondary loading on the inner wall and outer wall of the shell and reflected the two peak velocities produced by the corresponding nodes as shown in fig 15 especially near the direct zone subjected to the shock wave impact the elements subjected to the reflected shock wave impact undergone a relatively obvious negative pressure of lasting 0 8 ms as shown in fig 13 the red dotted line section this was because the external flow field of the structure corresponding to this region and the shock wave pressure in the fluid filled sandwich were relatively large which made a slight cavitation effect in the water body mäkinen 1998 the stress state of the inner and outer shell elements changed from compression to tension which showed the rapid attenuation of the nodes velocity in the region after the second peak of velocity on the velocity time curve because of the surface characteristics of the structure cavitation effect occurred only in a very small area near the impact point and was relatively weak so there was no obvious reloading effect after the negative pressure section rajendran 2008 elements 11 and 12 were not directly impacted by the incident shock wave because they were located on the lower surface of the structure so the peak pressure was much smaller than that of other elements in the middle section of the circumference however there was also a peak pressure corresponding to the two shock wave loads at the initial stage of the structural response it produced a third peak pressure pm 0 13 gpa at 3198μs in element 12 similar to the first two peak pressures which reflected the vibration and resilience of the structure after plastic deformation due to the overall motion of the inner and outer tubes the fluid filled sandwich produced obviously oscillatory waves as shown in fig 15 jing et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 had respectively investigated the dynamic response of cylindrical sandwich shells and spherical sandwich shells subjected to external air explosion loadings with numerical simulation and classified the general dynamic process of structures into several stages according to different classified principles based on the previous studies and the deformation features of the structures in this work the dynamic process of the cwc structure can be divided into four stages namely stage i incident transmission shock wave coupling stage ii reflected shock wave coupling stage iii structural large plastic response stage ⅳ structural rebound and vibration combining the deformation of the cwc structure and stress cloud chart shown in fig 16 the response characteristics of each stage were summarized as follows 1 stage i 21μs 50μs the underwater explosion shock wave began to couple with the structure and the inner shell of the structure was impacted by the transmission shock wave in the liquid filled sandwich after the incident shock wave impacted the outer shell of the structure in the external flow field at this stage there was no obvious plastic deformation in the inner and outer tubes 2 stage ii 50μs 250μs the transmitted shock wave in the water filled sandwich reached the surface of the inner tube and formed a reflected shock wave which impacted the inner wall of the outer tube and then re reflected as a secondary reflection wave and impacted the outer wall of the inner tube the central sections of upper surfaces of the inner and outer tubes were rapidly compressed in the stage and began to produce locally plastic deformation 3 stage iii 250μs 2200μs after the coupling of the reflected shock wave and the inner and outer shell of the structure was completed the explosive middle face of the outer tube collapsed rapidly there was obvious local plastic deformation accompanied by the formation of sunken nest and the whole deformation coincided with the direction of load action due to the multiple loading of transmitted shock wave and reflected shock wave and the additional force produced by the collapse of the shell the deformation characteristics of the inner tube were similar to that of the outer tube at the same time about 2200μs the node velocity of the inner and outer tube decreased to 0 the displacement of the nodes reached the maximum and the local and overall plastic deformation basically finished 4 stage ⅳ 2200μs 5000μs due to the restraint of fixed frame the rapid attenuation of explosive impact loading and the increase of plastic deformation energy of structure the vibration and resilience of the inner and outer tube occurred under the action of residual stress and the whole deformation of the structure changed from plastic deformation to elastic plastic deformation 4 3 energy absorption characteristics 4 3 1 plastic dissipation process there was the energy curve of time history of the inner and outer tube during the deformation process as shown in fig 17 the total energy of the structure included the internal energy and kinetic energy the internal energy of the structure rose rapidly at the initial stage of the structural response due to undex loading and then gradually rose until it became stable corresponding to the two peak values of the velocity response the kinetic energy of the inner and outer tubes gradually decreased to zero after two increasing process and the total energy curves and the internal energy curves of the inner and outer tubes coincided eventually the internal energy stability of the outer tube was about 1340j and the internal energy stability of the inner tube was 1884j although the response stage i and stage ii toke up a relatively short time and only a small amount of local sunken deformation occurred in the inner and outer tubes the energy used for plastic deformation of the outer tube and the inner tube occupied 51 and 45 of the total plastic dissipation energy respectively this was because in the initial stage of structural response the inner and outer tubes were subjected to local high strength shock wave loading and appear dynamic instability and the material softening effect occurred there was produced a great strain in the impact region at a very short time shown in fig 18 accompanied by a rapid rise in temperature namely high temperature and high strain rate deformation therefore the initial stage of impact response was very important for the dynamic instability of the structure as for the cwc structure the inner tube deformation dissipated more plastic deformation energy accounting for about 58 4 3 2 influence of the tube thickness the main role of water filled sandwich in structural deformation was to establish the coupling relationship between the inner tube the outer tube and water as the transmission medium of shock wave and reflected shock wave and to influence the deformation of the inner and outer tube by providing the initial base pressure gao et al 2014 therefore the chemical energy transformed into structural internal energy after explosion and mainly existed in the form of plastic dissipation energy of inner and outer tubes plastic dissipation energy directly reflected the intensity of the tube deformation for the same size of tube the greater the plastic dissipation energy was indicating that the more severe the deformation of the tube was the weaker its ability to resist explosive shock was in view of the test conditions in this paper although the change of the shell thickness meant the change of the water filled layer thickness at the same time the change of the water filled layer could be neglected in compared with the whole thickness of the tube and the water filled layer fig 19 shown the comparison of plastic energy dissipation of cwc structures with different sizes when r 6 cm in which c1 represented d114 h1 7 d89 h2 75 c2 represented d114 h1 7 d50 h2 75 c3 represented d114 h1 7 d89 h1 7 c4 represented d114 h1 7 d50 h1 7 c5 represented d114 h2 75 d89 h2 75 c6 represented d114 h2 75 d50 h2 75 c7 represented d114 h2 75 d89 h1 7 c8 represented d114 h2 75 d50 h1 7 as far as the whole performance of the structure was concerned the increase of the thickness of the outer or the inner tube reduced the whole dissipation energy of the structure that is enhanced its overall explosion resistance the inner shell is thin and the energy absorption of the cwc structure is large the inner shell is thick whether the shell is thin or thick there is no significant difference in the overall energy absorption of the structure compared with c3 and c1 c1 had the largest decrease in overall absorptive plasticity reaching 36 compared with c5 and c1 c5 had slightly increased overall energy absorption levels although the shell thickness had increased by 1 05 mm 4 3 3 influence of sandwich water thickness when the cwc structure was impacted by underwater explosion it had a complex coupling effect with the water in the sandwich which made the inner and outer shell and the water sandwich form a whole and absorbed the underwater explosion impact energy together although the water sandwich resulted in the sudden increase of the local pressure of the structure which intensified the plastic deformation of the inner shell it also provided a huge support force for the shell to reduce the maximum deformation when the filled liquid layer of the structure is thick the local deformation area of the inner and outer shell of the structure can be better protected and the thicker filled liquid layer can more effectively convert the incident concentrated load to the uniform load the cwc structure can dissipate more blast energy to break the shell from energy absorption characteristics of the structure with the increase of water sandwich thickness the plastic energy dissipation of the inner tube the outer tube and the whole structure decreased in varying degrees it reflected that water medium alleviated the explosive damage effect of the inner tube the outer tube and the whole structure in the process of structural deformation and protected effectively them as far as the overall anti explosion performance of the structure was concerned the increase of the water thickness had the greatest influence on the structure with d114 h1 7 d89 h1 7 c3 compared with c4 and c3 the overall plastic energy dissipation of the structure with c4 decreases by 2077j the fall ratio was 41 2 which was due to the weakest overall protective performance of the structure with c3 due to the thinner inner and outer tube walls and the increase of water thickness could significantly improve the overall protective performance 4 4 influence of sandwich water height on structural response it existed working condition of partial liquid filled in the cwc structure in the engineering application the airspace provided the motion space for the liquid in the sandwich the inner tube the response of the outer tube and the whole structure of the cwc structure would be different from the full filling of the sandwich in order to study the influence of sandwich filled liquid condition on structural response the structure of c5 was selected for finite element analysis as shown in fig 20 the stand off distance was set at r 6 cm and r 10 cm and the sandwich water plane was defined as fh 0 cm when it reached the middle section height of the inner and outer tube four kinds of height conditions of sandwich water were set namely fh 0 cm fh 3 cm fh 4 75 cm fh 5 425 cm in which fh 5 425 cm corresponded to the sandwich fully filled the deformation process of cwc structure r 6 cm fh 0 cm shown in fig 21 compared with the sandwich completely filled with water initial response stage of the outer tube subjected to undex impact the sandwich of incompletely filled with water could not provide the base pressure to resist deformation in the center area of the initiation point because the upper part of which was air due to the lack of load transmission capacity of water medium on the explosion facing surface the area of the inner tube with high stress level was obviously smaller than that of outer tube with the propagation of stress wave in the outer tube to the area near the impact point and the action of water medium below the sandwich the high stress area in the inner tube gradually enlarged around t 150μs the upper center of the outer and inner tube began to form obvious local depression with the increase of the local deformation and the whole deformation of the outer and inner tube the sandwich water gradually exerted reaction force on the inner and outer tubes and the pressure difference between the sandwich water area and the air area caused the inner tube surface to wrinkle the deformation process of cwc structure r 6 cm fh 3 cm shown in fig 22 after the outer tube was subjected to the incident shock wave in the external water although the transmission shock wave of the inner tube was weakened to a certain extent by the air medium in the sandwich the higher pressure was formed in most areas of the inner tube in a relatively short time in the sandwich there was a huge pressure difference near the interface between the water and the air corresponding to the center of the blasting face which aggravated the uneven force distribution in the upper part of the inner tube and caused local wrinkles in the early response period of the inner tube with the intensified local and whole deformation of the inner and outer tubes the wrinkles became much obvious and some elements of the inner tube failure and local penetration occurred the final deformation section of the structure in eight working conditions shown in fig 23 the comparison shown that the outer tube did not wrinkle with the two explosive heights and the inner tube had obvious wrinkle when fh 0 cm and wrinkle and the failure of the element was accompanied when fh 3 cm for the cwc structure with completely liquid filled sandwich the wrinkle formed mainly in the outer shell due to its curved surface characteristics thin wall thickness and water filled layer the cwc structure of partial water filled sandwich formed mainly in the inner tube for the cwc structure d114 h2 75 d89 h2 75 partially filled with liquid in the sandwich the stress wave passed through the outer tube to the impact center of inner tube and the water sandwich which provided the inner tube with reference pressure to resist deformation and then the local deformation and the overall deformation of the inner tube increased the water level in the sandwich moved up and vibrated continuously and the inner tube folded under the huge pressure difference between the air and water medium in the sandwich when the water filled layer was in the middle height fh 3 cm the interface between the air domain and the water domain in the interlayer fluctuated most violently and the impact force acting on the inner tube changed the most and the fold of the inner tube was the most obvious as shown in fig 24 when the water filled layer was low fh 0 cm the local deformation of the inner and outer tube mainly occurred in the upper part of the filled liquid layer and the size of the exposed water surface of the inner shell is large the deformation of the inner tube dissipated most of the transmitted stress wave energy the huge pressure difference between the air and water medium in the interlayer became smaller and the fold of the inner shell was relatively small when the sandwich water interface was high fh 4 75 cm and fh 5 425 cm the deformations of the inner and outer tubes made the water near the impact point fill with the whole interlayer and the pressure equalization characteristics of the water medium appeared so the inner shell did not form obvious fold axial section deformation curves of the inner and outer tubes shown in fig 25 when r 6 cm with the increase of the sandwich water height the deformation of the local depression δ l1 and δ l2 of inner and outer tubes increased gradually and the sunken nest decreased gradually this was because with fh 4 75 cm or fh 5 425 cm the inner and outer tubes were subjected to the action of the sandwich water at the early stage of the response which made the local deformation more localized with fh 0 cm or fh 3 cm the early response characteristics of inner and outer tubes were similar to that of the hollow tube and the local deformation area was larger this rule was basically established when r 10 cm the local deformation of inner and outer tube was the smallest with fh 3 cm which was due to the drastic wrinkle deformation of the inner tube which made the central part of inner tube bulge obviously and produced a similar anti intuitive effect the pressure curves of time history of cwc structural elements under different water filled conditions shown in fig 26 and fig 27 when r 6 cm the explosive impact energy is larger and the explosive impact area of cwc structure is more localized when the shock wave reaches the surface of the structure there will be obvious reflection and flow around it when the water level of the sandwich is high the pressure time history curve of the axial element shows two obvious pressure peaks and the negative pressure zone is more likely to appear after the pressure attenuation the blue dotted line frame in fig 26 b it reflects that the center of the explosion facing surface of the outer tube is rapidly coupled with the liquid filled sandwich after being acted by the incident shock wave the peak pressure of the inner shell element gradually decreases in the axial direction and presents irregular distribution along the circumferential direction under different liquid filled conditions the peak pressure of the circumferential element is generally higher than that of the axial element and there is no obvious secondary peak pressure the uneven distribution of pressure will lead to stress concentration in some locations and form hinges to prevent further deformation of the circumferential shell when r 10 cm the explosive impact energy of cwc structure is relatively weak the pressure difference between the elements decreases the intensity of shell deformation decreases and the pressure on the axial element also shows a second peak but the intensity decreases which indicates that the deformation degree of the axial shell decreases the circumferential pressure distribution of the shell will also lead to stress concentration in part of the position forming a hinge which will lead to the larger pressure on both sides of the explosion center there was the abnormal variation of circumferential pressure of the inner tube under two blasting height with fh 3 cm the pressure curve of time history of element 9 shown obvious fluctuation when r 6 cm which reflected the violent pressure change during the formation of wrinkle the pressure curve of time history of element 9 did not attenuate immediately after the peak pressure when r 6 cm but formed a positive pressure platform which was related to the bulge of the inner tube center the plastic energy dissipation of cwc structure under different working conditions shown in fig 28 the comparison shown that with the increase of the height of the sandwich water the plastic energy dissipation of the inner tube the outer tube and the whole structure decreased gradually in the absence of drastic wrinkles in the inner tube it shown the higher the water filled rate of the sandwich in a certain range was the stronger the anti explosion protection capability of the whole structure was under certain water filled conditions such as fh 3 cm the damage effect of the structure may be stronger than that under low water filled rate it was due to the abnormal deformation of the inner and outer tubes caused by the huge pressure difference in the sandwich under a certain water filled rate which reduced the overall protection capacity of the structure 5 conclusion 1 experimental investigations were carried out on cwc structures subjected to underwater explosion loading the cwc structure can remarkably facilitate the structural explosion resistance capacity and it is very hard to get complete penetration it presented the dynamic response of the cwc structure subjected to undex loading by employing a numerical model validated compared with the experiment data of corresponding cwc structures the ale coupling model was able to capture the main trend of deformation and damage in the experiments in an adequate manner 2 based on the deformation and damage of the cwc structures in this work the dynamic process of which could be divided into four stages in the early stage of structural response plastic dissipation energy of the outer shell dominated however as far as the final deformation of the structure was concerned the inner shell deformation dissipated more plastic deformation energy the inner shell is thin and the energy absorption of the cwc structure is large the inner shell is thick whether the shell is thin or thick there is no significant difference in the overall energy absorption of the structure it had samller and more concentrated local deformation area on the inner tube and the outer tube with a thicker water the thicker filled liquid layer can more effectively convert the incident concentrated load to the uniform load the outer tube of thicker water sandwich shown bigger global deformation 3 the sandwich water filled ratio had great influence on the damage and deformation of cwc structure subjected to underwater explosion loading when the sandwich was incompletely filled with water the inner tube of the structure was wrinkled due to the large pressure difference between the water and the air at the interface of the sandwich under the condition of specific water filled ratio the damage and deformation of the cwc structure were stronger than that of the structure with high and low water filled ratio funding body national natural

bridges under extreme surge waves and should be instructive for future bridge design keywords extreme wave cnoidal wave bridge deck level set submerging depth 1 introduction extreme ocean surface waves generated during hurricanes or tsunamis can be devastating to coastal communities and infrastructures coastal bridges are common in coastal regions and are vulnerable to strong wind generated surges and waves during hurricanes the mean water level gradually increases as hurricanes approach the coast and can approach or even exceed the low chord of the support girders allowing the waves to strike the superstructure chen et al 2009 the forces generated by storm waves can be significant and easily displace the bridge superstructure or remove it from its supporting substructure for instance 44 bridges were substantially damaged during hurricane katrina 2005 in the gulf coast severely impacting the coastal transportation system padgett et al 2008 hurricane ike 2008 also resulted in significant impacts to the transportation systems in the houston galveston region of texas damaging 53 coastal bridges stearns and padgett 2012 during past few decades many efforts have been carried out to study the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under different types of surface waves the earliest attempt was made in the 1960s when el ghamry 1963 and french 1969 adopted solitary wave profile to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a plate under extreme surge waves research in this realm became more active after the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina 2005 extensive experimental works hayatdavoodi et al 2014 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 huang et al 2018 2019a 2019b fang et al 2019 and numerical studies xu and cai 2015 wei and dalrymple 2016 xu et al 2016 2018a cai et al 2017 qu et al 2017a were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of bridges subject to extreme waves effects of prominent factors i e wave height water depth and

cnoidal wave seiffert et al 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2017 and tsunami waves qu et al 2019a have been discussed for both rigid and movable bridge decks xu and cai 2015 cai et al 2017 recently huang et al 2018 2019a 2019b investigated the damage mechanisms of bridge decks with box girders under solitary and regular waves qu et al 2019a numerically investigated the hydrodynamic loads of a highway bridge deck under real world tsunami wave profile in a full scale using a newly developed coupled modeling system qu et al 2019b the vulnerability of floating bridges and their dynamics responses under extreme waves had also been systematically investigated in past few years cheng et al 2018 petersen et al 2019 overall these studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the damage mechanisms of bridge decks under extreme surges and waves however there is an increasingly urgent need to propose preventative methods to protect coastal bridges from wave induced damages for instance wei and dalrymple 2016 proposed using side roads to protect coastal bridges from tsunamis xu et al 2016 and qu et al 2017a 2018 investigated effects of installing air vents on the bridge deck for reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to coastal bridges due to relatively low construction costs flexibility and environmental friendliness mccartney 1985 floating breakwaters have been widely used to protect coastal infrastructures from extreme surges and waves by wave attenuation during hurricanes based on the type of mooring floating breakwaters can be classified into two main types i e vertical pile restrained and moored ning et al 2016 when the floating breakwater is restrained by piles it can only heave in the vertical direction moored floating breakwaters can move in six degrees of freedom 6dof in three dimensions 3d and 3dof in 2d under the limitation of the mooring system to make floating breakwater more durable at a low construction cost rectangular cross sections are predominantly used hales 1981 over the past few decades efficiency of box type floating breakwater in wave attenuation and wave energy harvesting have been extensively studied through theoretical analysis drimer et al 1992 zheng et al 2006 experimental works isaacson et al 1998 sannasiraj et al 1998 and numerical simulations diamantoulaki et al 2008 loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 in this paper the vertical pile restrained floating breakwater is proposed to protect the coastal bridge deck from strong ocean surface waves as an environmental friendly wave reduction device vertical pile restrained floating breakwaters can be easily installed and removed before and after a storm avoiding affecting normal navigation requirements and other coastal operations in this paper a high resolution numerical wave tank nwt based on the open source flow solver reef3d bihs 2010 is applied to numerically investigate performance of a floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to a bridge deck under the impacts of cnoidal waves cnoidal wave and solitary wave have been used as the typical wave models to study the complex flow field of extreme wave impinging coastal structures hayatdavoodi et al 2018 2019 and wave breaking processes qu et al 2017b sarfarz and pak 2019 liu et al 2019 ning et al 2019 shao et al 2019 the open source solver reef3d numerically solves the governing equations of the incompressible two phase flow on a staggered mesh and captures the interface between air and water using a high resolution level set method osher and sethian 1988 effects of prominent parameters i e wave height water depth submersion depth spacing distance and aspect ratio of breakwaters on the performance of floating breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to coastal bridge decks are numerically investigated the remainder of the paper is organized as follow section 2 describes the governing equations and corresponding numerical methods model validation

governing equations and numerical method the three dimensional reynolds averaged naiver stokes rans solver reef3d bihs 2010 has been used to calculate the unsteady incompressible viscous flow with a

3 k s interface between the air and water is resolved using a high resolution level set method the zero level set of a signed distance function ϕ x t is used to represent the interface between the air

if x is in air the transport of the level set function ϕ x t is described by the convection equation as 8 ϕ t u j ϕ x j 0 to avoid the level set function losing its signed distance property on convection and the conservation of mass the reinitialization procedure must be performed peng et al 1999 in the computation convection terms of the governing equations are discretized by applying the

automatically adjusted according to courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion uniform cartesian grid is implemented in reef3d with the local directional ghost cell immersed boundary method ibm berthelsen and faltinsen 2008 to represent the complex solid boundaries in our numerical wave tank the whole computational domain consists of relaxing working and numerical beach zones fig 1 the relaxation

the analytical values prescribed by wave theory the wave relaxing zone releases waves into the working zone of the tank the structures to be studied are placed in the working zone of the tank to absorb the waves reflected form the outlet of the computation domain the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are reduced to zero in a smooth manner bihs 2010 a non slip condition is applied at walls which include the channel bottom and deck surfaces a symmetry boundary condition is imposed on the top boundary of the computational domain neumann conditions with zero gradients are used for pressure at inlet outlet and walls in this paper the 2d mode of 6dof computation module of reef3d is applied for brevity the numerical methods regarding 6dof is not expressed here and readers are referred to lu 2017 for more information 3 model calibration 3 1 cnoidal waves impacting bridge deck the nwt used in this study is calibrated based on the experimental results from seiffert et al 2015 studying conidial waves impacting a model of bridge deck seiffert et al 2015 used a simplified bridge deck model at the scale of 1 35 experimental works were carried out in a 9 14 m long 0 1524 m wide and 0 155 m high flume in the computation the entire computational domain is 12 m in length and 0 15 m in height fig 2 still water depth is 0 071 m and ratio of the input wave height h to water depth h is 0 257 the incident wave period is 2 71 s girders of the bridge deck are submerged initially by 0 0142 m in water three wave gages wg1 wg2 and wg3 are placed along the computational domain as shown in fig 2a the geometric dimensions of model bridge deck are also plotted in fig 2b and are comparable to parameters used in other studies focusing on coastal bridge decks hayatdavoodi et al 2014 qu et al 2017a 2019a the span length of the bride deck is 0 1492 m to verify the sufficiency of mesh resolution for simulating conidial waves impacting the bridge deck results were computed on meshes with dx 0 003 0 006 0 012 m representing coarse medium and dense meshes respectively the hydrodynamic loads are calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress on the non slip walls of model bridge deck time series of water elevations recorded at three wave gages are plotted in fig 3 it is seen that the predicted water elevations are in good agreements with measurements it is also observed that wave amplitude can be somewhat reduced after conidial wave impinging coastal bridge deck as shown in fig 3b and c fig 4 shows that the predicted time series of horizontal and vertical components of the hydrodynamic load are in good agreements with experimental data in terms of peak magnitude and temporal evolution it also shows that the medium and dense meshes produce very similar results with respect to water elevation and hydrodynamic loads hence the resolution of the dense mesh is sufficient for the computation fig 5 depicts the snapshots of water velocity contours during the process of conidial waves impinging the bridge deck at different time instances it demonstrates that overtopping water propagates over the top of the deck after the wave crest impinged the bridge model overall the above comparisons indicate that reef3d can accurately capture the flow field and hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under the impact of conidial waves 3 2 regular wave impacting 2d floating breakwater this section investigates the 3dof motions i e surge heave and pitch motion of a 2d floating breakwater without any mooring system under the impact of regular waves predictions are compared to the measurements conducted by ren et al 2015 the computational layout is plotted in fig 6 the breakwater is 0 3 m wide and 0 2 m high although the experimental work is performed in a 3d flume the computational domain can be treated as 2d due to the small gaps between the breakwater and flume sidewalls the breakwater is initially located 7 m downward from the inlet of the domain with its centroid at the still water level the density of the breakwater ρ f b is 500 kg m 3 in the computation the still water depth h is 0 4 m input wave height h is 0 04 m and wave period t is 1 2 s three sets of meshes are used to verify the sufficiency of mesh resolution coarse medium and dense meshes have resolutions of dx 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m respectively fig 7 depicts the time series of water elevation and different types of motion of the breakwater it is seen that the predictions are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data although there are some discrepancies between predictions and measurements especially with respect to the pitch motion those discrepancies may be attributed to damping effects from vortices shedding from walls of the breakwater ren et al 2015 overall the computational capability of reef3d in predicting the 3dof motion of a floating breakwater impacted by waves is well verified it also shows that the coarse mesh cannot reproduce the motions of breakwater except for the water elevation fig 7a the medium and dense meshes produced nearly same results hence the dense mesh is believed to be sufficient for the simulation fig 8 depicts the snapshots of water velocity contours at different time instances it is found that some portion of the incident wave energy is dissipated by the breakwater the area of high velocity region decreases after wave impinging breakwater 4 results and discussion in the following sections we investigate the effects of a floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads on a full scale coastal bridge deck under storm conditions by cnoidal waves as a preliminary study only the heave motion of the floating breakwater is considered which corresponds to a common engineering practice mccartney 1985 ning et al 2015 the stiffness and damping of the floating breakwater are ignored in the following sections the computational layout and dimensions of the full scale coastal bridge deck are plotted in fig 9 where the width a h f and height a v f of breakwater are 5 4 m and 1 5 m respectively density of the breakwater is 500 kg m 3 dimensions of the full scale bridge deck are given in fig 9b the submersion depth s of the bridge deck is measured from girder bottom of the bridge to the still water level hence a positive s means that the portion of bridge deck is initially submerged in water the distance between the bridge deck and rear side of the breakwater is s p predicted hydrodynamic loads are normalized using 25 f v f v a h ρ g h 26 f h f h a v ρ g h where a h and a v are used to represent the width and front height of the bridge deck respectively a h 10 67 m and a v 1 77 m in this study in addition a unit span length 1 m of the deck was used to evaluate the efficiency of the floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck r h and r v are defined as 27 r h f h m a x w i t h o u t b r e a k w a t e r f

k w a t e r where f h m a x and f v m a x represent maximum magnitudes of absolute values of the horizontal and vertical loads respectively 4 1 hydrodynamic phenomena in this section the hydrodynamic characteristics of cnodial waves impacting the coastal bridge deck were numerically studied the still water depth h is 4 m input wave height ratio h h is 0 25 submersion depth s is 0 and the spacing distance is s p 1 a h the floating breakwater is 5 4 m wide and 1 5 m high with aspect ratio of 3 6 fig 10 plots the snapshots of the velocity contours of the conidial waves impacting the bridge deck at different times with an installed floating breakwater before the wave crest impacts the bridge deck it first impinges the floating breakwater moving it upwards fig 10a later an overtopping water is observed on top of the breakwater and the overtopping water flows over the breakwater surface due to the weight balance of the overtopping water the floating breakwater starts its downward motion fig 10b and c the downward motion of the breakwater is intensified after the wave crest moves forward fig 10d as seen in fig 10d although the breakwater somewhat reduces the wave height it results in a larger high velocity region between the breakwater and the bridge deck in addition the high velocity region between the breakwater and bridge deck would be partially attributed to is partially attributed to the wave reflection and superimposition and thus a larger wave force can be imposed on the breakwater and the bridge deck similar findings were also reported in xu et al 2018b finally the distorted wave crest impacts the bridge deck and the overtopping water is not observed fig 10e meanwhile the high velocity region is also found underneath of the bridge deck girders and the chambers become partly filled with water fig 10e and f for comparison fig 11 depicts the snapshots of the velocity contours of the conidial wave impacting the bridge deck at different times for the bridge deck without a floating breakwater it is seen that the nearly undistorted wave crest directly impacts the bridge deck fig 11a b c and d apparently without breakwater the impact intensity of the wave is greater and overtopping water is observed fig 11e and f time series of the upward and downward motions of the floating breakwater along with vertical direction are plotted in fig 12 which shows a similar profile to the incident cnodial waves amplitude of the oscillations of the breakwater is about 1 4 m time series of hydrodynamic loads impacted on the bridge deck by cnodial waves are plotted in fig 13 and show that the floating breakwater can substantially reduce the peak values of horizontal by 35 9 and vertical loads by 12 7 it also shows that the quasi static forces on the bridge deck are greatly reduced especially the horizontal load by 36 7 fig 13c the definitions of quasi static forces can be referred to qu et al 2017a the above shows that our numerical wave tank is able to accurately predicting the complex flow phenomena of cnodial waves impacting a bridge deck and that the floating breakwater can substantially reduce the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the bridge deck 4 2 effects of wave height this section examines the effects of wave height on the efficiency of the floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck impacted by cnodial waves five different wave height ratios are selected i e h h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 the still water h is kept as 4 m submersion depth s 0 and spacing distance is s p 1 a h comparisons of velocity contours for the bridge deck with and without breakwater at different time instances are plotted in fig 14 the magnitudes of flow velocity around the bridge deck and breakwater increase with wave height for relatively small wave height installing of the floating breakwater has limited influences on the velocity distribution around the bridge deck but there are some impacts around the breakwater fig 14a and b left side when h h 0 2 overtopping water starts to form with a small water tongue for the bridge deck without the breakwater but the same phenomenon is not observed for the bridge deck with breakwater fig 14c when h h 0 2 significant overtopping water occurs due to an intensified water tongue from the impinging wave fig 14d and e the breakwater can greatly reduce the intensity of the resulting water tongue fig 14d and e left side fig 15 plots variations of maximum horizontal and vertical loads under different wave heights for bridge deck with and without breakwater it shows that the horizontal and vertical loads increase almost linearly with the wave height the breakwater is somewhat able to reduce the horizontal and vertical loads on the bridge deck the efficiency of floating breakwater is higher in reducing the vertical loads of bridge deck compared to the horizontal load fig 15b these findings are also reflected in plot of reducing rate of floating breakwater in hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck fig 16 the reducing rate in horizontal load ranges from 5 8 to 24 3 and the reducing rate in vertical load ranges from 6 4 to 25 1 4 3 effects of submerging depth this section investigates the effects of submerging depth on the performance of the floating breakwater in reducing both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck this is of interest since bridge decks may have different freeboards and the storm surge increases as it approaches the coast five different submerging depths are selected s av 1 2 0 1 2 1 and 3 2 in the computation the still water depth h is kept as 4 m and input wave height h is 1 m the spacing distance is s p 1 a h fig 17 depicts snapshots of velocity contours at different time instances under different submerging depths it is seen that chambers are gradually filled with water as the submerging depth increases meanwhile intensity of wave tongue is enhanced by the submerging depth and the overtopping water gradually becomes stronger after s 1av it is also observed that the presence of the floating breakwater can reduce the intensity of waves impinging the bridge deck as shown by the lower velocity magnitudes observed around the bridge deck although the maximum vertical load increases linearly with the submerging depth the maximum horizontal load reaches its maximum value for s av 1 2 fig 18 results show that the greatest reductions of both horizontal and vertical loads occur for s av 1 2 fig 19 depicts the reduction rates in hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck due to the floating breakwater when the bottom of the bridge deck is elevated above the still water level the reduction rates of both horizontal and vertical loads are the greatest s av 1 2 under different submerging depths the reducing rate in the horizontal load ranges from 5 8 to 71 2 the reducing rate in the vertical load ranges from 4 8 to 52 1 it is also found that large variation exists for r h in contrast to r v it is attributed to the reason that when submerging depth varies the wave ward area changes accordingly in addition solitary wave is to produce a higher velocity distribution in upper water region and lower velocity distribution in lower water region 4 4 effects of water depth to investigate the effects of water depth on the performance of the floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under cnoidal waves five different water depths are selected i e h 3 3 5 4 4 5 and 5 m submerging depth of bridge deck is set as s 0 and the incident wave height h is 1 m the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck is kept as s p 1 a h the floating breakwater can greatly decrease the flow velocity magnitudes when the wave crests impact the bridge deck fig 20 the maximum horizontal load monotonically decreases with water depth for the bridge deck without the floating breakwater fig 21 a when h 4 m the maximum horizontal load can be greatly reduced by breakwater once h 4 m influence of the breakwater on the maximum horizontal load of bridge deck is limited the maximum horizontal load applied to the bridge deck with the breakwater reaches its maximum for h 4 m however the floating breakwater can significantly decrease the maximum vertical load for all water depths fig 21b similar findings can also be drawn from the plot showing the hydrodynamic load reduction rates when the floating breakwater is used fig 22 the reduction rates in the horizontal load range from 3 24 to 75 23 and the reduction rates in the vertical load ranges from 9 14 to 39 64 4 5 effects of spacing distance in the previous sections the spacing distance between the bridge deck and the floating breakwater is kept constant as s p 1 a h the spacing distance can have some influences on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck this section examines the effects of spacing distance s p six different spacing distances are selected i e s p 0 5 a h 1 a h 1 5 a h 2 a h 2 5 a h and 3 a h fig 23 plots velocity contours of wave impinging the bridge deck under different spacing distances there are complex flow fields between the breakwater and the bridge deck when the spacing distance is relatively small in which water can be trapped between them fig 23a as the spacing distance increases the interactions between the bridge deck and the breakwater weaken fig 23b c d and g variations of maximum hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under different spacing distance are plotted in fig 24 spacing distance has some influences on the maximum horizontal load the horizontal load reaches its maximum for s p 1 a h and it decreases with the spacing distance however the spacing distance has very limited impact on the maximum vertical load applied to the bridge deck 4 6 effects of aspect ratio and density of the breakwater five different aspect ratios of l p a h f a v f i e l p 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 are selected to investigate the effects of aspect ratio of the floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck fig 25 depicts the snapshots of water velocity contour at the time instances of the cnoidal waves impinging the bridge deck under different aspect ratios of the breakwater when the aspect ratio is small there are complex flow fields between the breakwater and bridge deck fig 25a and the wave impact forces can be reduced as the aspect ratio increases this reduction gradually weakens both maximum horizontal and vertical loads gradually increase with the aspect ratio in an approximated linear mode fig 26 effects of density of the floating breakwater on hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge deck are investigated by considering five densities i e ρ f b 0 4 ρ 0 45 ρ 0 5 ρ 0 55 ρ and 0 6 ρ ρ f b is the density of the floating breakwater and ρ is the density of water fig 27 plots the snapshots of velocity contours at the time instance of the cnoidal wave impinging the bridge deck under different densities of the floating breakwater it is observed that there are complex flow fields between the floating breakwater and bridge deck when the density of the floating breakwater is small fig 27a and b as the density of the floating breakwater increases interactions between the floating breakwater and bridge deck can be strengthened and overtopping water over the top of the floating breakwater can be observed fig 27c d and e meanwhile hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck can be further reduced fig 28 both maximum horizontal and vertical loads almost linearly decrease with the density of the floating breakwater 5 conclusions this paper numerically investigates the performance of 2d rectangular floating breakwater on reducing the hydrodynamic load applied to the bridge deck under the impact of cnoidal waves the major conclusions drawn from this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the floating breakwater can effectively reduce the magnitudes of both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck 2 the floating breakwater has more contribution in reducing the vertical loads of bridge deck compared to the horizontal load under different wave height ratios the reduction rate in horizontal and vertical loads range from 5 8 to 24 3 and 6 4 25 1 respectively 3 the submersion depth has noticeable impacts on the performances of the floating breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic load applied to the bridge deck the maximum load reductions occur at s av 1 2 for both maximum horizontal and vertical loads under different submersion depths the reductions in horizontal load ranges from 5 8 to 71 2 the reducing rate in vertical load ranges from 4 8 to 52 1 4 the maximum horizontal loads can be greatly reduced by water depth especially when for water depths h 4 m however once h 4 m the influence of the breakwater on the maximum horizontal load on the bridge deck is very limited the maximum horizontal load for the bridge deck with the breakwater occurs at h 4 m the floating breakwater can significantly decrease the maximum vertical load of bridge deck for all water depths 5 the spacing distance also has noticeable impacts on maximum horizontal loads the maximum horizontal load approaches its maximum at s p 1a h however spacing distance has very limited influence on the maximum vertical loads of the bridge deck although maximum horizontal and vertical loads increase gradually with aspect ratio in an approximately linear mode maximum horizontal and vertical loads almost linearly decrease with the density of the floating breakwater overall the installations of floating breakwater can greatly reduce the hydrodynamic load of the coastal bridge deck and protect them from serious damages caused by extreme surge waves it is believed that the findings drawn from this paper can enhance our understanding of the performance of the floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridges under extreme surge waves and should be instructive for the coastal bridge protection however similar to previous researches qu et al 2017a 2018 xu et al 2018a b all of simulation were carried out in simplified situations such as cnoidal waves 2d flows etc in real ocean environment hydrodynamics of cnoidal waves impinging the coastal bridge decks are more complex prominent factors such as bridge configuration in 3d and seabed bathymetry distribution at bridge site have to be considered besides the generation of ocean surface waves and their final impact at the bridge deck is one of the typical multiscale ocean flow phenomena to perform a more realistic modeling suitable multiscale and multiphysics modeling systems are urgently needed tang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 2019b we will keep

hydrodynamic loads of coastal bridge deck can be greatly reduced through the use of floating breakwaters results of this paper can further enhance our understanding on the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under extreme surge waves and should be instructive for future bridge design keywords extreme wave cnoidal wave bridge deck level set submerging depth 1 introduction extreme ocean surface waves generated during hurricanes or tsunamis can be devastating to coastal communities and infrastructures coastal bridges are common in coastal regions and are vulnerable to strong wind generated surges and waves during hurricanes the mean water level gradually increases as hurricanes approach the coast and can approach or even exceed the low chord of the support girders allowing the waves to strike the superstructure chen et al 2009 the forces generated by storm waves can be significant and easily displace the bridge superstructure or remove it from its supporting substructure for instance 44 bridges were substantially damaged during hurricane katrina 2005 in the gulf coast severely impacting the coastal transportation system padgett et al 2008 hurricane ike 2008 also resulted in significant impacts to the transportation systems in the houston galveston region of texas damaging 53 coastal bridges stearns and padgett 2012 during past few decades many efforts have been carried out to study the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under different types of surface waves the earliest attempt was made in the 1960s when el ghamry 1963 and french 1969 adopted solitary wave profile to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a plate under extreme surge waves research in this realm became more active after the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina 2005 extensive experimental works hayatdavoodi et al 2014 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 huang et al 2018 2019a 2019b fang et al 2019 and numerical studies xu and cai 2015 wei and dalrymple 2016 xu et al 2016 2018a cai et al 2017 qu et al 2017a were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of bridges subject to extreme waves effects of prominent factors i e wave height water depth and submergence depth etc on the hydrodynamic load under solitary wave xu et al 2016 wei and dalrymple 2016 hayatdavoodi et al 2017 stokes wave xiao et al 2009 huang and xiao 2009 jin and meng 2011 cnoidal wave seiffert et al 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2017 and tsunami waves qu et al 2019a have been discussed for both rigid and movable bridge decks xu and cai 2015 cai et al 2017 recently huang et al 2018 2019a 2019b investigated the damage mechanisms of bridge decks with box girders under solitary and regular waves qu et al 2019a numerically investigated the hydrodynamic loads of a highway bridge deck under real world tsunami wave profile in a full scale using a newly developed coupled modeling system qu et al 2019b the vulnerability of floating bridges and their dynamics responses under extreme waves had also been systematically investigated in past few years cheng et al 2018 petersen et al 2019 overall these studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the damage mechanisms of bridge decks under extreme surges and waves however there is an increasingly urgent need to propose preventative methods to protect coastal bridges from wave induced damages for instance wei and dalrymple 2016 proposed using side roads to protect coastal bridges from tsunamis xu et al 2016 and qu et al 2017a 2018 investigated effects of installing air vents on the bridge deck for reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to coastal bridges due to relatively low construction costs flexibility and environmental friendliness mccartney 1985 floating breakwaters have been widely used to protect coastal infrastructures from extreme surges and waves by wave attenuation during hurricanes based on the type of mooring floating breakwaters can be classified into two main types i e vertical pile restrained and moored ning et al 2016 when the floating breakwater is restrained by piles it can only heave in the vertical direction moored floating breakwaters can move in six degrees of freedom 6dof in three dimensions 3d and 3dof in 2d under the limitation of the mooring system to make floating breakwater more durable at a low construction cost rectangular cross sections are predominantly used hales 1981 over the past few decades efficiency of box type floating breakwater in wave attenuation and wave energy harvesting have been extensively studied through theoretical analysis drimer et al 1992 zheng et al 2006 experimental works isaacson et al 1998 sannasiraj et al 1998 and numerical simulations diamantoulaki et al 2008 loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 in this paper the vertical pile restrained floating breakwater is proposed to protect the coastal bridge deck from strong ocean surface waves as an environmental friendly wave reduction device vertical pile restrained floating breakwaters can be easily installed and removed before and after a storm avoiding affecting normal navigation requirements and other coastal operations in this paper a high resolution numerical wave tank nwt based on the open source flow solver reef3d bihs 2010 is applied to numerically investigate performance of a floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to a bridge deck under the impacts of cnoidal waves cnoidal wave and solitary wave have been used as the typical wave models to study the complex flow field of extreme wave impinging coastal structures hayatdavoodi et al 2018 2019 and wave breaking processes qu et al 2017b sarfarz and pak 2019 liu et al 2019 ning et al 2019 shao et al 2019 the open source solver reef3d numerically solves the governing equations of the incompressible two phase flow on a staggered mesh and captures the interface between air and water using a high resolution level set method osher and sethian 1988 effects of prominent parameters i e wave height water depth submersion depth spacing distance and aspect ratio of breakwaters on the performance of floating breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to coastal bridge decks are numerically investigated the remainder of the paper is organized as follow section 2 describes the governing equations and corresponding numerical methods model validation results are presented in section 3 hydrodynamic characteristics of bridge deck with floating breakwater under cnoidal waves are discussed in section 4 concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 governing equations and numerical method the three dimensional reynolds averaged naiver stokes rans solver reef3d bihs 2010 has been used to calculate the unsteady incompressible viscous flow with a free surface the governing equations for the mass and momentum conservation are continuity and incompressible rans equations which can be written as 1 u i t 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j v v t u

and the poisson equation is solved using a preconditioned bicgstab solver van der vorst 1992 the turbulence closure is determined using the two equations k ω model proposed by wilcox 1994 to limit the unphysical overproduction of turbulence near the interface between air and water the eddy viscosity limiter proposed by durbin 2009 is applied the open source flow solver reef3d is fully parallelized

3 k s interface between the air and water is resolved using a high resolution level set method the zero level set of a signed distance function ϕ x t is used to represent the interface between the air

if x is in air the transport of the level set function ϕ x t is described by the convection equation as 8 ϕ t u j ϕ x j 0 to avoid the level set function losing its signed distance property on convection and the conservation of mass the reinitialization procedure must be performed peng et al 1999 in the computation convection terms of the governing equations are discretized by applying the 5th conservative finite difference weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme proposed by jiang and shu 1996 an hamiltion jacobi formulation of the weno scheme proposed by jiang and peng 2000 is used to discretize the transport equations of the level set function turbulent kinetic energy and specific turbulent dissipation rate time marching procedures are performed using a total variation diminishing tvd third order runge kutta explicit time scheme shu and osher 1988 for both the momentum and level set equations a first order scheme is utilized for the time advancement of the turbulent kinetic energy and the specific turbulent dissipation and other variables to meet the requirements of numerical stability an adaptive time stepping method is applied and the time step size is automatically adjusted according to courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion uniform cartesian grid is implemented in reef3d with the local directional ghost cell immersed boundary method ibm berthelsen and faltinsen 2008 to represent the complex solid boundaries in our numerical wave tank the whole computational domain consists of relaxing working and numerical beach zones fig 1 the relaxation function proposed by jacobsen et al 2012 is applied to moderate the velocity and the free surface in the relaxation zone according to 9 u r e l a x e d γ x u a n a l y t i c a l 1 γ x u c o m p u t a

wave propagation direction with x s r being the start and x e r the end x coordinate of the relaxing zone in the relaxing zone computational values of the velocity and free surface are increased to the analytical values prescribed by wave theory the wave relaxing zone releases waves into the working zone of the tank the structures to be studied are placed in the working zone of the tank to absorb the waves reflected form the outlet of the computation domain the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are reduced to zero in a smooth manner bihs 2010 a non slip condition is applied at walls which include the channel bottom and deck surfaces a symmetry boundary condition is imposed on the top boundary of the computational domain neumann conditions with zero gradients are used for pressure at inlet outlet and walls in this paper the 2d mode of 6dof computation module of reef3d is applied for brevity the numerical methods regarding 6dof is not expressed here and readers are referred to lu 2017 for more information 3 model calibration 3 1 cnoidal waves impacting bridge deck the nwt used in this study is calibrated based on the experimental results from seiffert et al 2015 studying conidial waves impacting a model of bridge deck seiffert et al 2015 used a simplified bridge deck model at the scale of 1 35 experimental works were carried out in a 9 14 m long 0 1524 m wide and 0 155 m high flume in the computation the entire computational domain is 12 m in length and 0 15 m in height fig 2 still water depth is 0 071 m and ratio of the input wave height h to water depth h is 0 257 the incident wave period is 2 71 s girders of the bridge deck are submerged initially by 0 0142 m in water three wave gages wg1 wg2 and wg3 are placed along the computational domain as shown in fig 2a the geometric dimensions of model bridge deck are also plotted in fig 2b and are comparable to parameters used in other studies focusing on coastal bridge decks hayatdavoodi et al 2014 qu et al 2017a 2019a the span length of the bride deck is 0 1492 m to verify the sufficiency of mesh resolution for simulating conidial waves impacting the bridge deck results were computed on meshes with dx 0 003 0 006 0 012 m representing coarse medium and dense meshes respectively the hydrodynamic loads are calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress on the non slip walls of model bridge deck time series of water elevations recorded at three wave gages are plotted in fig 3 it is seen that the predicted water elevations are in good agreements with measurements it is also observed that wave amplitude can be somewhat reduced after conidial wave impinging coastal bridge deck as shown in fig 3b and c fig 4 shows that the predicted time series of horizontal and vertical components of the hydrodynamic load are in good agreements with experimental data in terms of peak magnitude and temporal evolution it also shows that the medium and dense meshes produce very similar results with respect to water elevation and hydrodynamic loads hence the resolution of the dense mesh is sufficient for the computation fig 5 depicts the snapshots of water velocity contours during the process of conidial waves impinging the bridge deck at different time instances it demonstrates that overtopping water propagates over the top of the deck after the wave crest impinged the bridge model overall the above comparisons indicate that reef3d can accurately capture the flow field and hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under the impact of conidial waves 3 2 regular wave impacting 2d floating breakwater this section investigates the 3dof motions i e surge heave and pitch motion of a 2d floating breakwater without any mooring system under the impact of regular waves predictions are compared to the measurements conducted by ren et al 2015 the computational layout is plotted in fig 6 the breakwater is 0 3 m wide and 0 2 m high although the experimental work is performed in a 3d flume the computational domain can be treated as 2d due to the small gaps between the breakwater and flume sidewalls the breakwater is initially located 7 m downward from the inlet of the domain with its centroid at the still water level the density of the breakwater ρ f b is 500 kg m 3 in the computation the still water depth h is 0 4 m input wave height h is 0 04 m and wave period t is 1 2 s three sets of meshes are used to verify the sufficiency of mesh resolution coarse medium and dense meshes have resolutions of dx 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m respectively fig 7 depicts the time series of water elevation and different types of motion of the breakwater it is seen that the predictions are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data although there are some discrepancies between predictions and measurements especially with respect to the pitch motion those discrepancies may be attributed to damping effects from vortices shedding from walls of the breakwater ren et al 2015 overall the computational capability of reef3d in predicting the 3dof motion of a floating breakwater impacted by waves is well verified it also shows that the coarse mesh cannot reproduce the motions of breakwater except for the water elevation fig 7a the medium and dense meshes produced nearly same results hence the dense mesh is believed to be sufficient for the simulation fig 8 depicts the snapshots of water velocity contours at different time instances it is found that some portion of the incident wave energy is dissipated by the breakwater the area of high velocity region decreases after wave impinging breakwater 4 results and discussion in the following sections we investigate the effects of a floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads on a full scale coastal bridge deck under storm conditions by cnoidal waves as a preliminary study only the heave motion of the floating breakwater is considered which corresponds to a common engineering practice mccartney 1985 ning et al 2015 the stiffness and damping of the floating breakwater are ignored in the following sections the computational layout and dimensions of the full scale coastal bridge deck are plotted in fig 9 where the width a h f and height a v f of breakwater are 5 4 m and 1 5 m respectively density of the breakwater is 500 kg m 3 dimensions of the full scale bridge deck are given in fig 9b the submersion depth s of the bridge deck is measured from girder bottom of the bridge to the still water level hence a positive s means that the portion of bridge deck is initially submerged in water the distance between the bridge deck and rear side of the breakwater is s p predicted hydrodynamic loads are normalized using 25 f v f v a h ρ g h 26 f h f h a v ρ g h where a h and a v are used to represent the width and front height of the bridge deck respectively a h 10 67 m and a v 1 77 m in this study in addition a unit span length 1 m of the deck was used to evaluate the efficiency of the floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck r h and r v are defined as 27 r h f h m a x w i t h o u t b r e a k w a t e r f

k w a t e r where f h m a x and f v m a x represent maximum magnitudes of absolute values of the horizontal and vertical loads respectively 4 1 hydrodynamic phenomena in this section the hydrodynamic characteristics of cnodial waves impacting the coastal bridge deck were numerically studied the still water depth h is 4 m input wave height ratio h h is 0 25 submersion depth s is 0 and the spacing distance is s p 1 a h the floating breakwater is 5 4 m wide and 1 5 m high with aspect ratio of 3 6 fig 10 plots the snapshots of the velocity contours of the conidial waves impacting the bridge deck at different times with an installed floating breakwater before the wave crest impacts the bridge deck it first impinges the floating breakwater moving it upwards fig 10a later an overtopping water is observed on top of the breakwater and the overtopping water flows over the breakwater surface due to the weight balance of the overtopping water the floating breakwater starts its downward motion fig 10b and c the downward motion of the breakwater is intensified after the wave crest moves forward fig 10d as seen in fig 10d although the breakwater somewhat reduces the wave height it results in a larger high velocity region between the breakwater and the bridge deck in addition the high velocity region between the breakwater and bridge deck would be partially attributed to is partially attributed to the wave reflection and superimposition and thus a larger wave force can be imposed on the breakwater and the bridge deck similar findings were also reported in xu et al 2018b finally the distorted wave crest impacts the bridge deck and the overtopping water is not observed fig 10e meanwhile the high velocity region is also found underneath of the bridge deck girders and the chambers become partly filled with water fig 10e and f for comparison fig 11 depicts the snapshots of the velocity contours of the conidial wave impacting the bridge deck at different times for the bridge deck without a floating breakwater it is seen that the nearly undistorted wave crest directly impacts the bridge deck fig 11a b c and d apparently without breakwater the impact intensity of the wave is greater and overtopping water is observed fig 11e and f time series of the upward and downward motions of the floating breakwater along with vertical direction are plotted in fig 12 which shows a similar profile to the incident cnodial waves amplitude of the oscillations of the breakwater is about 1 4 m time series of hydrodynamic loads impacted on the bridge deck by cnodial waves are plotted in fig 13 and show that the floating breakwater can substantially reduce the peak values of horizontal by 35 9 and vertical loads by 12 7 it also shows that the quasi static forces on the bridge deck are greatly reduced especially the horizontal load by 36 7 fig 13c the definitions of quasi static forces can be referred to qu et al 2017a the above shows that our numerical wave tank is able to accurately predicting the complex flow phenomena of cnodial waves impacting a bridge deck and that the floating breakwater can substantially reduce the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the bridge deck 4 2 effects of wave height this section examines the effects of wave height on the efficiency of the floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck impacted by cnodial waves five different wave height ratios are selected i e h h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 the still water h is kept as 4 m submersion depth s 0 and spacing distance is s p 1 a h comparisons of velocity contours for the bridge deck with and without breakwater at different time instances are plotted in fig 14 the magnitudes of flow velocity around the bridge deck and breakwater increase with wave height for relatively small wave height installing of the floating breakwater has limited influences on the velocity distribution around the bridge deck but there are some impacts around the breakwater fig 14a and b left side when h h 0 2 overtopping water starts to form with a small water tongue for the bridge deck without the breakwater but the same phenomenon is not observed for the bridge deck with breakwater fig 14c when h h 0 2 significant overtopping water occurs due to an intensified water tongue from the impinging wave fig 14d and e the breakwater can greatly reduce the intensity of the resulting water tongue fig 14d and e left side fig 15 plots variations of maximum horizontal and vertical loads under different wave heights for bridge deck with and without breakwater it shows that the horizontal and vertical loads increase almost linearly with the wave height the breakwater is somewhat able to reduce the horizontal and vertical loads on the bridge deck the efficiency of floating breakwater is higher in reducing the vertical loads of bridge deck compared to the horizontal load fig 15b these findings are also reflected in plot of reducing rate of floating breakwater in hydrodynamic loads of bridge deck fig 16 the reducing rate in horizontal load ranges from 5 8 to 24 3 and the reducing rate in vertical load ranges from 6 4 to 25 1 4 3 effects of submerging depth this section investigates the effects of submerging depth on the performance of the floating breakwater in reducing both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck this is of interest since bridge decks may have different freeboards and the storm surge increases as it approaches the coast five different submerging depths are selected s av 1 2 0 1 2 1 and 3 2 in the computation the still water depth h is kept as 4 m and input wave height h is 1 m the spacing distance is s p 1 a h fig 17 depicts snapshots of velocity contours at different time instances under different submerging depths it is seen that chambers are gradually filled with water as the submerging depth increases meanwhile intensity of wave tongue is enhanced by the submerging depth and the overtopping water gradually becomes stronger after s 1av it is also observed that the presence of the floating breakwater can reduce the intensity of waves impinging the bridge deck as shown by the lower velocity magnitudes observed around the bridge deck although the maximum vertical load increases linearly with the submerging depth the maximum horizontal load reaches its maximum value for s av 1 2 fig 18 results show that the greatest reductions of both horizontal and vertical loads occur for s av 1 2 fig 19 depicts the reduction rates in hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck due to the floating breakwater when the bottom of the bridge deck is elevated above the still water level the reduction rates of both horizontal and vertical loads are the greatest s av 1 2 under different submerging depths the reducing rate in the horizontal load ranges from 5 8 to 71 2 the reducing rate in the vertical load ranges from 4 8 to 52 1 it is also found that large variation exists for r h in contrast to r v it is attributed to the reason that when submerging depth varies the wave ward area changes accordingly in addition solitary wave is to produce a higher velocity distribution in upper water region and lower velocity distribution in lower water region 4 4 effects of water depth to investigate the effects of water depth on the performance of the floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under cnoidal waves five different water depths are selected i e h 3 3 5 4 4 5 and 5 m submerging depth of bridge deck is set as s 0 and the incident wave height h is 1 m the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck is kept as s p 1 a h the floating breakwater can greatly decrease the flow velocity magnitudes when the wave crests impact the bridge deck fig 20 the maximum horizontal load monotonically decreases with water depth for the bridge deck without the floating breakwater fig 21 a when h 4 m the maximum horizontal load can be greatly reduced by breakwater once h 4 m influence of the breakwater on the maximum horizontal load of bridge deck is limited the maximum horizontal load applied to the bridge deck with the breakwater reaches its maximum for h 4 m however the floating breakwater can significantly decrease the maximum vertical load for all water depths fig 21b similar findings can also be drawn from the plot showing the hydrodynamic load reduction rates when the floating breakwater is used fig 22 the reduction rates in the horizontal load range from 3 24 to 75 23 and the reduction rates in the vertical load ranges from 9 14 to 39 64 4 5 effects of spacing distance in the previous sections the spacing distance between the bridge deck and the floating breakwater is kept constant as s p 1 a h the spacing distance can have some influences on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck this section examines the effects of spacing distance s p six different spacing distances are selected i e s p 0 5 a h 1 a h 1 5 a h 2 a h 2 5 a h and 3 a h fig 23 plots velocity contours of wave impinging the bridge deck under different spacing distances there are complex flow fields between the breakwater and the bridge deck when the spacing distance is relatively small in which water can be trapped between them fig 23a as the spacing distance increases the interactions between the bridge deck and the breakwater weaken fig 23b c d and g variations of maximum hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under different spacing distance are plotted in fig 24 spacing distance has some influences on the maximum horizontal load the horizontal load reaches its maximum for s p 1 a h and it decreases with the spacing distance however the spacing distance has very limited impact on the maximum vertical load applied to the bridge deck 4 6 effects of aspect ratio and density of the breakwater five different aspect ratios of l p a h f a v f i e l p 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 are selected to investigate the effects of aspect ratio of the floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck fig 25 depicts the snapshots of water velocity contour at the time instances of the cnoidal waves impinging the bridge deck under different aspect ratios of the breakwater when the aspect ratio is small there are complex flow fields between the breakwater and bridge deck fig 25a and the wave impact forces can be reduced as the aspect ratio increases this reduction gradually weakens both maximum horizontal and vertical loads gradually increase with the aspect ratio in an approximated linear mode fig 26 effects of density of the floating breakwater on hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge deck are investigated by considering five densities i e ρ f b 0 4 ρ 0 45 ρ 0 5 ρ 0 55 ρ and 0 6 ρ ρ f b is the density of the floating breakwater and ρ is the density of water fig 27 plots the snapshots of velocity contours at the time instance of the cnoidal wave impinging the bridge deck under different densities of the floating breakwater it is observed that there are complex flow fields between the floating breakwater and bridge deck when the density of the floating breakwater is small fig 27a and b as the density of the floating breakwater increases interactions between the floating breakwater and bridge deck can be strengthened and overtopping water over the top of the floating breakwater can be observed fig 27c d and e meanwhile hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck can be further reduced fig 28 both maximum horizontal and vertical loads almost linearly decrease with the density of the floating breakwater 5 conclusions this paper numerically investigates the performance of 2d rectangular floating breakwater on reducing the hydrodynamic load applied to the bridge deck under the impact of cnoidal waves the major conclusions drawn from this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the floating breakwater can effectively reduce the magnitudes of both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck 2 the floating breakwater has more contribution in reducing the vertical loads of bridge deck compared to the horizontal load under different wave height ratios the reduction rate in horizontal and vertical loads range from 5 8 to 24 3 and 6 4 25 1 respectively 3 the submersion depth has noticeable impacts on the performances of the floating breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic load applied to the bridge deck the maximum load reductions occur at s av 1 2 for both maximum horizontal and vertical loads under different submersion depths the reductions in horizontal load ranges from 5 8 to 71 2 the reducing rate in vertical load ranges from 4 8 to 52 1 4 the maximum horizontal loads can be greatly reduced by water depth especially when for water depths h 4 m however once h 4 m the influence of the breakwater on the maximum horizontal load on the bridge deck is very limited the maximum horizontal load for the bridge deck with the breakwater occurs at h 4 m the floating breakwater can significantly decrease the maximum vertical load of bridge deck for all water depths 5 the spacing distance also has noticeable impacts on maximum horizontal loads the maximum horizontal load approaches its maximum at s p 1a h however spacing distance has very limited influence on the maximum vertical loads of the bridge deck although maximum horizontal and vertical loads increase gradually with aspect ratio in an approximately linear mode maximum horizontal and vertical loads almost linearly decrease with the density of the floating breakwater overall the installations of floating breakwater can greatly reduce the hydrodynamic load of the coastal bridge deck and protect them from serious damages caused by extreme surge waves it is believed that the findings drawn from this paper can enhance our understanding of the performance of the floating breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridges under extreme surge waves and should be instructive for the coastal bridge protection however similar to previous researches qu et al 2017a 2018 xu et al 2018a b all of simulation were carried out in simplified situations such as cnoidal waves 2d flows etc in real ocean environment hydrodynamics of cnoidal waves impinging the coastal bridge decks are more complex prominent factors such as bridge configuration in 3d and seabed bathymetry distribution at bridge site have to be considered besides the generation of ocean surface waves and their final impact at the bridge deck is one of the typical multiscale ocean flow phenomena to perform a more realistic modeling suitable multiscale and multiphysics modeling systems are urgently needed tang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 2019b we will keep
