plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms 2 4 adsorption experiments in preliminary experiments the fe3o4 particles synthesized at different ph e g 8 3 10 0 11 0 were examined for the adsorptive removal of arsenate and arsenite from the arsenic contaminated water the adsorption experiments were performed in 1l glass beaker containing 0 5 70 mg l of arsenate or arsenite concentration and 1 g of fe3o4 particles solutions were continuously stirred 250 rpm for 24 h using jar tester the samples were collected in the beginning and end of experiments and analyzed with icp ms to estimate the adsorbed amount arsenate and arsenite onto the fe3o4 particles same adsorption conditions were applied for the particles of different sizes to find out best one for adsorption moreover the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 particles is also assessed at different ph levels 2 10 based on the results of preliminary adsorption experiments supporting information the best particles synthesized at ph 8 3 were further examined and a comprehensive adsorption isotherm and kinetic study is conducted with the experimental conditions described in table 1 0 1n naoh solution is used as an eluent for desorption of arsenate and arsenite the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to explain the adsorption of arsenic species onto the fe3o4 particles the langmuir model is expressed as eq 1 1 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m in eq 1 ce mg l 1 and qe mg g 1 are the arsenic concentration at equilibrium and the amount of adsorbed arsenic on the surface of the fe3o4 respectively qm indicates the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and kl denotes the langmuir constant the freundlich isotherm model is presented by eq 2 shahid et al 2019a 2 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e herein n and kf represent the freundlich constant and freundlich exponent respectively kf shows the adsorption capacity of the fe3o4 toward the arsenic and n is a sign for the degree of the surface heterogeneity and defines the distribution of the adsorbed arsenic on the surface of fe3o4 particles a value of n greater than 1 shows a favorable adsorption of the arsenic onto the fe3o4 particles the greater value of n shows the greater adsorption intensity 2 5 operation of the column and plug flow reactors to meet the large scale commercial application of the synthesized adsorbent material particles were employed in packed bed column and plug flow reactors and the operational performances are examined based on arsenic removal efficiency the particles were packed in column reactors whereas dispersed on the floors of plug flow reactor the column reactors were operated with both upward and downward influent flow mode considering the commercial viability the large size particles 425 600 μm were used in column and plug flow reactors for the treatment of water having 100 1000 μg l 1 initial arsenic concentration the description of columns and plug flow reactor are given in fig 1 and table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized fe3o4 particles the crystalline structure and properties of fe3o4 particles are determined by xrd fig 2 a the diffraction peaks appeared at 2 theta values 30 0 35 5 43 2 53 7 57 0 and 62 6 with miller indices 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively the identified peaks confirmed the cubic spinal structure of crystalline fe3o4 jcpds no 98 015 8741 the xrd spectra did not display any peak associated with impurities that confirms the purity of fe3o4 particles synthesized from the mill scale the xrd spectra is also matched and found in consistence with reported studies shahid and choi 2020 usman et al 2018 xps analysis described the bonding structure of the fe3o4 particles the full scan spectrum of the synthesized particles is presented in fig 2b the full scan spectrum confirmed the photoelectron peaks corresponding to iron and oxygen that belong to the fe3o4 gandon et al 2021 deconvolutions of the o1s peak fig 2c confirmed the typical peaks corresponding to the oxygen atom in the crystal lattice of magnetite fe o 529 7 ev and the oxygen atoms of hydroxyl functionalities o h 531 0 ev from the surface voids these findings appear in fine agreement with earlier studies cîrcu et al 2016 gandon et al 2021 the raman spectra fig 2d of the synthesized particles displayed two strong bands closely at 700 and 510 cm 1 corresponding to the fe3o4 phase as compared with other studies flood garibay and méndez rojas 2021 the ftir spectra of fe3o4 particles is presented in fig 2e the adsorption band at 3196 cm 1 and 1629 cm 1 shows the stretching and symmetric bending mode of vibrations for hydroxyl functionalities respectively a broad adsorption band at 545 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching mode of vibrations for fe o the characteristic vibrations of fe3o4 were appeared in fine agreement with literature shahid and choi 2020 the elemental composition of synthesized particles is also determined by eds analysis fig 2f the fe and o signals confirmed the synthesis of fe3o4 particles shah et al 2022 the zeta potential of fe3o4 particles is determined 8 55 0 5 mv as shown in fig 2g this value is found in consistence with the reported zeta potential of fe3o4 nanoparticles i e 8 7 0 5 mv jadhav and patil 2014 the sem analysis indicated the aggregation of fe3o4 particles at 1 μm scale fig 2h the fe3o4 particles with spherical shape and nanosized structure are confirmed by the tem analysis fig 2i the morphology of fe3o4 particles is found in consistent with reported studies tran et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 3 2 adsorption isotherm based on preliminary experiments and optimum conditions the adsorption isotherms were developed for multiple arsenate and arsenite concentrations the adsorption capacity and the correlation between arsenic species and fe3o4 particles was described based on adsorption isotherm experimental data showed that the arsenic removal capacity of magnetite at the equilibrium rises with increasing the initial arsenate and arsenite concentration mainly the percentage of arsenite and arsenate removal increased rapidly in initial contact phase and later followed steady state before attaining a saturation state the adsorption isotherm data is fitted with linear forms of the freundlich isotherm and langmuir isotherm fig 3 a b and c the data was found quite well fit in langmuir than the freundlich isotherm model this indicates that adsorption of arsenate and arsenite onto the fe3o4 particles is more like a monolayer adsorption phenomena with heterogeneous distribution shahid et al 2020 both arsenate and arsenite solutions indicated adsorptive interactions toward the surface of fe3o4 particles however the higher adsorption is observed in case of arsenate solution table 3 one gram of fe3o4 particles adsorbed 11 3 and 13 9 mg of arsenite and arsenate respectively as estimated by langmuir isotherm model adsorption capacity of fe3o4 particles significantly depends on the initial concentration of arsenate and arsenite the possible adsorption mechanism can be explained considering the ligand exchange mechanism between the ions the hydroxyl ions present onto the surface of fe3o4 particles serve for ligand exchange reaction resulting in the arsenate oxyanion the adsorption capacities of synthesized fe3o4 particles for as iii and as v were found higher than reported particles synthesized using different raw materials and diverse synthesis protocols table 4 it highlights the potential of our particles to be applied in field application 3 3 adsorption kinetics the time dependent adsorption study is conducted for arsenate and arsenite at same initial concentration and absorbent dosages both arsenic species indicated significant adsorption in early stages up to 5 min contact time due to the availability of large number of adsorption sites after 2 h of contact time the removal efficiency was 97 and 100 for as 3 and as 5 ions respectively fig 3d the fast adsorption was observed in the start of experiment and then system reached an equilibrium state this rapid adsorption of arsenic species in early stages is attributed to the outer surface adsorption as maximum number of adsorption localities lies on the outer surface of the fe3o4 arsenic species can certainly access these locations during initial interaction such findings appear in fine agreement with reported studies on adsorptive removal of arsenic species from contaminated water using fe3o4 material phearom et al 2021 shahid et al 2018 3 4 regeneration of adsorbent media reuse of fe3o4 particles needs desorption of arsenate and arsenite from the fe3o4 the adsorption experiments were conducted with initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 for as v as iii and as iii v distinct solutions onto 1 g of fe3o4 at ph 7 later 0 1n naoh solution is used to regenerate the fe3o4 particles which ionizes and replaces the as iii v anion on the surface of fe3o4 particles with oh fig 3e shows the results obtained from the adsorption and desorption of as v as iii v and as iii the adsorption efficiency was over 99 for all the samples whereas the desorption efficiency was appeared 100 98 2 and 90 5 for as v as iii v and as iii respectively an earlier study suggested the capability of mill scale derived fe3o4 for five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles for arsenate ions shahid et al 2019d 4 performances of the column and pfrs considering the commercial application of fe3o4 particles for adsorptive removal of arsenic from water four columns were operated with different influent flow direction empty bed contact time ebct and the initial arsenate concentration other operational parameters such as size and quantity of fe3o4 particles height and width of the columns influent ph and temperature were kept same for all the columns the operational performances of all the columns are assessed based on effluent arsenate concentration and breakthrough point the part of fe3o4 bed in which adsorption occurs is called mass transfer zone mtz as the fe3o4 particles becomes exhausted over the time the mtz shifts ahead through the packed bed when the mtz moves ahead it leaves behind the arsenic saturated portion of adsorption bed consequently the brim of the mass transfer zone approaches the end of the packed bed column and breakthrough arises the graphical illustration for the mtz movement through packed bed column is known as breakthrough curve the height of the mtz hmtz is determined based on eq 3 shahid et al 2019b the adsorption performances of the columns and the breakthrough curves are presented in fig 4 3 h m t z z v e v b v e 0 5 v e v b here z ve and vb denotes packed bed height m treated volume l and breakthrough volume l respectively the column fed with lower arsenic concentration 100 μg l were found effective to adsorb over 98 of influent arsenic concentration during continuous operation for 512 days fig 4a almost same adsorptive performance is indicated by column reactors operated with upward and downward flow directions considering the minimum 10 μg l objective concentration in effluent first breakthrough was witnessed after 62 days of effective operation in columns c3 and c4 fed with 1000 μg l arsenic concentration fig 4b nearly similar operation performance is observed in both mode of operations upward and downward flow direction fig 4c showed the breakthrough curves of columns operated with higher influent arsenic concentration 1000 μg l the breakthrough and exhaust times in columns are corresponded to 0 05 and 0 95 respectively when the packed bed column is fully exhausted no change in influent and effluent arsenic concentration the columns are successfully regenerated with 0 2n naoh solution several successful cycles of adsorption and regeneration are achieved and the results are presented in table 5 the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 is decreased with increasing number of regeneration cycles studies has been confirmed the loss in adsorption capacity of adsorption medias after several cycles of adsorption desorption patel 2020 sharma et al 2022 the operational performances of pfrs are presented in fig 5 the pfr operated with 100 μg l arsenic concentration and 0 5 h ebct is found successful to remove the arsenic concentration for more than 500 days in pfr the contaminated water travels along with surface of fe3o4 particles dispersed on the pfr s floors thus the arsenic species rapidly occupy the adsorption sites at the surface layer of adsorbent making them saturated it gives challenging time to the upcoming arsenic species for interaction within not only the surface layer but also the inner layers of fe3o4 particles therefore the particles were mixed after certain time of operation a significant improvement in adsorption profile is observed after mixing as highlighted in fig 5a the pfrs are also operated in wide range of initial arsenic concentration 100 1000 μg l and higher ebct 0 25 h and the results are presented in fig 5b it is found that within an increase in initial arsenic concentration a significant drop in adsorption capacity is observed thus an earlier breakthrough and exhausted time is noticed 5 arsenic redox transformation mechanisms on fe3o4 particles fig 6 shows the post adsorption characterization of the fe3o4 particles the xrd analysis fig 6a c did not display any major change in the crystalline structure of the fe3o4 particles the electrostatic interaction among the positively charged fe3o4 surfaces and the anionic arsenate species was a foremost reason to adsorb arsenate on the other hand the adsorption mechanism of arsenite was intensely influenced by a surface complexation in addition to the electrostatic interactions these attractions are finely appeared in the xps fig 6d f and ftir pattern of the as loaded fe3o4 particles the raman spectra fig 6m also displayed a shift in adsorption bands a shift in the adsorption bands is attributed to the adsorption of arsenic onto the fe3o4 iconaru et al 2016 the fe3o4 particles were found to have pours structure with sharp border fig 2 however the as loaded fe3o4 particles indicated the smooth and fine borders the tem analysis fig 6k indicated the higher aggregation of particles as compared with as free fe3o4 particles fig 2i other studies also found the similar observation liu et al 2015 wang et al 2011 the eds spectra also identified the arsenic in addition to the iron and oxygen the main constituents of the adsorbent raman spectra of as loaded fe3o4 particles fig 6m showed a slight shift in the principal peak corresponding fe o in o1s region followed by adsorption of arsenic the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 were slightly shifted from 712 cm 1 715 cm 1 and 510 cm 1 to 512 cm 1 moreover a significant change is appeared in the region of 700 800 cm 1 this change highlights the corresponding active signals for the arsenic adsorbed coordination in the 700 800 cm 1 region the altered peaks nearby 700 and 800 cm 1 associate to symmetric and asymmetric mode of vibrations for as oh penke et al 2016 in presence of oxygen the surface complexation led to the redox reactions of as iii and as v on the surface of fe3o4 particles fig 7 both as v reduction and as iii oxidation were found to have association with fe3o4 surface oxidation and the redox reactions of adsorbed as in the presence of oxygen the oxidation was started from as iii to as v and fe3o4 to γ fe2o3 liu et al 2015 in a previous study the presence of both fe ii and oxygen has enriched the oxidation of as iii to as v during the interactions between mineral surfaces and water under neutral ph and oxic conditions ona nguema et al 2010 it is evident that when fe3o4 surface is exposed to oxygen a thin layer of maghemite is formed shahid and choi 2020 during this transformation the oxidation of octahedral center fe ii takes place to form fe iii and subsequently cation voids are formed at the octahedral sites phearom et al 2021 at that moment electroneutrality is balanced by either electron movement from the internal bulk fe3o4 to the oxidized surface or the diffusion of fe ii thus the adsorbed as v might be reduced to as iii through reaction with the migrated electron or fe ii lastly the existence of inner sphere complexes can supplementary assist the electron transfer progression among fe and as via binding ligand 6 conclusion a facile synthesis method is applied to prepare fe3o4 from the mill scale it was found that the final solution ph during the reverse coprecipitation seriously affected as removal efficiency of the fe3o4 particles the particles precipitated at ph 8 3 8 5 indicated higher arsenic removal efficiencies than that of prepared at ph 10 and 11 furthermore the small particles indicated higher adsorption capacities than that of large particles due to the higher surface area well dispersion in aqueous medium and the availability of maximum adsorption sites the trend for arsenic removal efficiency for different size of particles was 45 75 μm 75 425 μm 425 600 μm the maximum adsorption capacity was found 11 26 and 13 875 mg g for as iii and as v respectively it is observed that in presence of oxygen the surface complexation led to the redox reactions of as iii and as v on the surface of fe3o4 particles this study establishes that mill scale derived fe3o4 particles have greater affinity to both arsenate and arsenite from groundwater this is specifically beneficial over conventional methods that required the pre oxidation of arsenite to arsenate the operation of packed bed column and pfrs confirmed the practical ability of the synthesized adsorbent in the field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

and arsenite the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to explain the adsorption of arsenic species onto the fe3o4 particles the langmuir model is expressed as eq 1 1 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m in eq 1 ce mg l 1 and qe mg g 1 are the arsenic concentration at equilibrium and the amount of adsorbed arsenic on the surface of the fe3o4 respectively qm indicates the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and kl denotes the langmuir constant the freundlich isotherm model is presented by eq 2 shahid et al 2019a 2 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e herein n and kf represent the freundlich constant and freundlich exponent respectively kf shows the adsorption capacity of the fe3o4 toward the arsenic and n is a sign for the degree of the surface heterogeneity and defines the distribution of the adsorbed arsenic on the surface of fe3o4 particles a value of n greater than 1 shows a favorable adsorption of the arsenic onto the fe3o4 particles the greater value of n shows the greater adsorption intensity 2 5 operation of the column and plug flow reactors to meet the large scale commercial application of the synthesized adsorbent material particles were employed in packed bed column and plug flow reactors and the operational performances are examined based on arsenic removal efficiency the particles were packed in column reactors whereas dispersed on the floors of plug flow reactor the column reactors were operated with both upward and downward influent flow mode considering the commercial viability the large size particles 425 600 μm were used in column and plug flow reactors for the treatment of water having 100 1000 μg l 1 initial arsenic concentration the description of columns and plug flow reactor are given in fig 1 and table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized fe3o4 particles the crystalline structure and properties of fe3o4 particles are determined by xrd fig 2 a the diffraction peaks appeared at 2 theta values 30 0 35 5 43 2 53 7 57 0 and 62 6 with miller indices 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively the identified peaks confirmed the cubic spinal structure of crystalline fe3o4 jcpds no 98 015 8741 the xrd spectra did not display any peak associated with impurities that confirms the purity of fe3o4 particles synthesized from the mill scale the xrd spectra is also matched and found in consistence with reported studies shahid and choi 2020 usman et al 2018 xps analysis described the bonding structure of the fe3o4 particles the full scan spectrum of the synthesized particles is presented in fig 2b the full scan spectrum confirmed the photoelectron peaks corresponding to iron and oxygen that belong to the fe3o4 gandon et al 2021 deconvolutions of the o1s peak fig 2c confirmed the typical peaks corresponding to the oxygen atom in the crystal lattice of magnetite fe o 529 7 ev and the oxygen atoms of hydroxyl functionalities o h 531 0 ev from the surface voids these findings appear in fine agreement with earlier studies cîrcu et al 2016 gandon et al 2021 the raman spectra fig 2d of the synthesized particles displayed two strong bands closely at 700 and 510 cm 1 corresponding to the fe3o4 phase as compared with other studies flood garibay and méndez rojas 2021 the ftir spectra of fe3o4 particles is presented in fig 2e the adsorption band at 3196 cm 1 and 1629 cm 1 shows the stretching and symmetric bending mode of vibrations for hydroxyl functionalities respectively a broad adsorption band at 545 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching mode of vibrations for fe o the characteristic vibrations of fe3o4 were appeared in fine agreement with literature shahid and choi 2020 the elemental composition of synthesized particles is also determined by eds analysis fig 2f the fe and o signals confirmed the synthesis of fe3o4 particles shah et al 2022 the zeta potential of fe3o4 particles is determined 8 55 0 5 mv as shown in fig 2g this value is found in consistence with the reported zeta potential of fe3o4 nanoparticles i e 8 7 0 5 mv jadhav and patil 2014 the sem analysis indicated the aggregation of fe3o4 particles at 1 μm scale fig 2h the fe3o4 particles with spherical shape and nanosized structure are confirmed by the tem analysis fig 2i the morphology of fe3o4 particles is found in consistent with reported studies tran et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 3 2 adsorption isotherm based on preliminary experiments and optimum conditions the adsorption isotherms were developed for multiple arsenate and arsenite concentrations the adsorption capacity and the correlation between arsenic species and fe3o4 particles was described based on adsorption isotherm experimental data showed that the arsenic removal capacity of magnetite at the equilibrium rises with increasing the initial arsenate and arsenite concentration mainly the percentage of arsenite and arsenate removal increased rapidly in initial contact phase and later followed steady state before attaining a saturation state the adsorption isotherm data is fitted with linear forms of the freundlich isotherm and langmuir isotherm fig 3 a b and c the data was found quite well fit in langmuir than the freundlich isotherm model this indicates that adsorption of arsenate and arsenite onto the fe3o4 particles is more like a monolayer adsorption phenomena with heterogeneous distribution shahid et al 2020 both arsenate and arsenite solutions indicated adsorptive interactions toward the surface of fe3o4 particles however the higher adsorption is observed in case of arsenate solution table 3 one gram of fe3o4 particles adsorbed 11 3 and 13 9 mg of arsenite and arsenate respectively as estimated by langmuir isotherm model adsorption capacity of fe3o4 particles significantly depends on the initial concentration of arsenate and arsenite the possible adsorption mechanism can be explained considering the ligand exchange mechanism between the ions the hydroxyl ions present onto the surface of fe3o4 particles serve for ligand exchange reaction resulting in the arsenate oxyanion the adsorption capacities of synthesized fe3o4 particles for as iii and as v were found higher than reported particles synthesized using different raw materials and diverse synthesis protocols table 4 it highlights the potential of our particles to be applied in field application 3 3 adsorption kinetics the time dependent adsorption study is conducted for arsenate and arsenite at same initial concentration and absorbent dosages both arsenic species indicated significant adsorption in early stages up to 5 min contact time due to the availability of large number of adsorption sites after 2 h of contact time the removal efficiency was 97 and 100 for as 3 and as 5 ions respectively fig 3d the fast adsorption was observed in the start of experiment and then system reached an equilibrium state this rapid adsorption of arsenic species in early stages is attributed to the outer surface adsorption as maximum number of adsorption localities lies on the outer surface of the fe3o4 arsenic species can certainly access these locations during initial interaction such findings appear in fine agreement with reported studies on adsorptive removal of arsenic species from contaminated water using fe3o4 material phearom et al 2021 shahid et al 2018 3 4 regeneration of adsorbent media reuse of fe3o4 particles needs desorption of arsenate and arsenite from the fe3o4 the adsorption experiments were conducted with initial concentration of 500 μg l 1 for as v as iii and as iii v distinct solutions onto 1 g of fe3o4 at ph 7 later 0 1n naoh solution is used to regenerate the fe3o4 particles which ionizes and replaces the as iii v anion on the surface of fe3o4 particles with oh fig 3e shows the results obtained from the adsorption and desorption of as v as iii v and as iii the adsorption efficiency was over 99 for all the samples whereas the desorption efficiency was appeared 100 98 2 and 90 5 for as v as iii v and as iii respectively an earlier study suggested the capability of mill scale derived fe3o4 for five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles for arsenate ions shahid et al 2019d 4 performances of the column and pfrs considering the commercial application of fe3o4 particles for adsorptive removal of arsenic from water four columns were operated with different influent flow direction empty bed contact time ebct and the initial arsenate concentration other operational parameters such as size and quantity of fe3o4 particles height and width of the columns influent ph and temperature were kept same for all the columns the operational performances of all the columns are assessed based on effluent arsenate concentration and breakthrough point the part of fe3o4 bed in which adsorption occurs is called mass transfer zone mtz as the fe3o4 particles becomes exhausted over the time the mtz shifts ahead through the packed bed when the mtz moves ahead it leaves behind the arsenic saturated portion of adsorption bed consequently the brim of the mass transfer zone approaches the end of the packed bed column and breakthrough arises the graphical illustration for the mtz movement through packed bed column is known as breakthrough curve the height of the mtz hmtz is determined based on eq 3 shahid et al 2019b the adsorption performances of the columns and the breakthrough curves are presented in fig 4 3 h m t z z v e v b v e 0 5 v e v b here z ve and vb denotes packed bed height m treated volume l and breakthrough volume l respectively the column fed with lower arsenic concentration 100 μg l were found effective to adsorb over 98 of influent arsenic concentration during continuous operation for 512 days fig 4a almost same adsorptive performance is indicated by column reactors operated with upward and downward flow directions considering the minimum 10 μg l objective concentration in effluent first breakthrough was witnessed after 62 days of effective operation in columns c3 and c4 fed with 1000 μg l arsenic concentration fig 4b nearly similar operation performance is observed in both mode of operations upward and downward flow direction fig 4c showed the breakthrough curves of columns operated with higher influent arsenic concentration 1000 μg l the breakthrough and exhaust times in columns are corresponded to 0 05 and 0 95 respectively when the packed bed column is fully exhausted no change in influent and effluent arsenic concentration the columns are successfully regenerated with 0 2n naoh solution several successful cycles of adsorption and regeneration are achieved and the results are presented in table 5 the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 is decreased with increasing number of regeneration cycles studies has been confirmed the loss in adsorption capacity of adsorption medias after several cycles of adsorption desorption patel 2020 sharma et al 2022 the operational performances of pfrs are presented in fig 5 the pfr operated with 100 μg l arsenic concentration and 0 5 h ebct is found successful to remove the arsenic concentration for more than 500 days in pfr the contaminated water travels along with surface of fe3o4 particles dispersed on the pfr s floors thus the arsenic species rapidly occupy the adsorption sites at the surface layer of adsorbent making them saturated it gives challenging time to the upcoming arsenic species for interaction within not only the surface layer but also the inner layers of fe3o4 particles therefore the particles were mixed after certain time of operation a significant improvement in adsorption profile is observed after mixing as highlighted in fig 5a the pfrs are also operated in wide range of initial arsenic concentration 100 1000 μg l and higher ebct 0 25 h and the results are presented in fig 5b it is found that within an increase in initial arsenic concentration a significant drop in adsorption capacity is observed thus an earlier breakthrough and exhausted time is noticed 5 arsenic redox transformation mechanisms on fe3o4 particles fig 6 shows the post adsorption characterization of the fe3o4 particles the xrd analysis fig 6a c did not display any major change in the crystalline structure of the fe3o4 particles the electrostatic interaction among the positively charged fe3o4 surfaces and the anionic arsenate species was a foremost reason to adsorb arsenate on the other hand the adsorption mechanism of arsenite was intensely influenced by a surface complexation in addition to the electrostatic interactions these attractions are finely appeared in the xps fig 6d f and ftir pattern of the as loaded fe3o4 particles the raman spectra fig 6m also displayed a shift in adsorption bands a shift in the adsorption bands is attributed to the adsorption of arsenic onto the fe3o4 iconaru et al 2016 the fe3o4 particles were found to have pours structure with sharp border fig 2 however the as loaded fe3o4 particles indicated the smooth and fine borders the tem analysis fig 6k indicated the higher aggregation of particles as compared with as free fe3o4 particles fig 2i other studies also found the similar observation liu et al 2015 wang et al 2011 the eds spectra also identified the arsenic in addition to the iron and oxygen the main constituents of the adsorbent raman spectra of as loaded fe3o4 particles fig 6m showed a slight shift in the principal peak corresponding fe o in o1s region followed by adsorption of arsenic the characteristic peaks of fe3o4 were slightly shifted from 712 cm 1 715 cm 1 and 510 cm 1 to 512 cm 1 moreover a significant change is appeared in the region of 700 800 cm 1 this change highlights the corresponding active signals for the arsenic adsorbed coordination in the 700 800 cm 1 region the altered peaks nearby 700 and 800 cm 1 associate to symmetric and asymmetric mode of vibrations for as oh penke et al 2016 in presence of oxygen the surface complexation led to the redox reactions of as iii and as v on the surface of fe3o4 particles fig 7 both as v reduction and as iii oxidation were found to have association with fe3o4 surface oxidation and the redox reactions of adsorbed as in the presence of oxygen the oxidation was started from as iii to as v and fe3o4 to γ fe2o3 liu et al 2015 in a previous study the presence of both fe ii and oxygen has enriched the oxidation of as iii to as v during the interactions between mineral surfaces and water under neutral ph and oxic conditions ona nguema et al 2010 it is evident that when fe3o4 surface is exposed to oxygen a thin layer of maghemite is formed shahid and choi 2020 during this transformation the oxidation of octahedral center fe ii takes place to form fe iii and subsequently cation voids are formed at the octahedral sites phearom et al 2021 at that moment electroneutrality is balanced by either electron movement from the internal bulk fe3o4 to the oxidized surface or the diffusion of fe ii thus the adsorbed as v might be reduced to as iii through reaction with the migrated electron or fe ii lastly the existence of inner sphere complexes can supplementary assist the electron transfer progression among fe and as via binding ligand 6 conclusion a facile synthesis method is applied to prepare fe3o4 from the mill scale it was found that the final solution ph during the reverse coprecipitation seriously affected as removal efficiency of the fe3o4 particles the particles precipitated at ph 8 3 8 5 indicated higher arsenic removal efficiencies than that of prepared at ph 10 and 11 furthermore the small particles indicated higher adsorption capacities than that of large particles due to the higher surface area well dispersion in aqueous medium and the availability of maximum adsorption sites the trend for arsenic removal efficiency for different size of particles was 45 75 μm 75 425 μm 425 600 μm the maximum adsorption capacity was found 11 26 and 13 875 mg g for as iii and as v respectively it is observed that in presence of oxygen the surface complexation led to the redox reactions of as iii and as v on the surface of fe3o4 particles this study establishes that mill scale derived fe3o4 particles have greater affinity to both arsenate and arsenite from groundwater this is specifically beneficial over conventional methods that required the pre oxidation of arsenite to arsenate the operation of packed bed column and pfrs confirmed the practical ability of the synthesized adsorbent in the field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11806,groundwater has become the prime source of drinking and irrigation use in drought prone barind tract bt of bangladesh as the surface water sources are minimal continuous groundwater withdrawals for irrigation drinking domestics industries and other uses deplete groundwater levels gwl so the study aims to compute the quantity of river water extracted for irrigation by double lifting and rubber dam irrigation systems of barind multipurpose development authority bmda in bt area and evaluate their impacts on reducing groundwater exploitation to carry out the study bore log lithology rainfall gwl and water irrigation data have been collected from bmda and field investigation and analyzed the groundwater depletion due to over extraction than the potential recharge lower rainfall than the national average and thick top clay that limits the natural recharge lifted water by the pumps of 11 pontoons placed on the river padma ganges mohanonda and atrai can reduce 7 08 of groundwater extraction for irrigation in the study area groundwater exploitation for puthia upazila can be reduced by 10 11 with conserved water upstream of the rubber dam constructed in the barnai river also a continuous rise in gwl was observed due to storing of river water at a 4 km long section by the rubber dam graphical abstract image 1 keywords river water groundwater pontoon rubber dam barind tract 1 introduction barind tract bt in bangladesh located in its northwest part is the most extensive pleistocene terrace of the country made up of the pleistocene alluvium also known as older alluvium floored by reddish brown sticky pleistocene sediment madhupur clay and covers an area of about 7770 sq km its elevation above sea level varies from a minimum of 14 m to a maximum of 45 m hmeduzzaman et al 2012 bmda 2006 the area is tectonic in the stable shelf region of the bengal basin physiographically this tract covers both the floodplain and the bt which are further divided into three units like recent alluvial fan barind pleistocene and recent floodplain pleistocene barind clay floors the bt areas and younger and older alluvium floors the floodplains the older floodplains are of the rivers mohananda and atrai and the younger floodplain is of the river ganges padma the pleistocene deposits are termed as the older alluvium that forms the terraces iwm 2012 rashid et al 2015 the bt is located between 240 23 to 250 15 north latitude and 880 2 to 880 57 east longitude the bt is divided into three major parts like level barind high barind and north eastern barind bmda 2003 it is bounded by the river atrai karatoya in the east mahananda in the west and ganges padma in the south the area is drought prone and water stressed so the core challenge is to make the water available for irrigation drinking and other uses hossain et al 2019a 2019ba 2019c 2019d hossain et al 2021b the hard red soil typical dry climate with comparatively high temperature and less bt rainfall are very significant compared to the other parts of the country bmda 2020 temperature ranges from 8 c to 44 c ahmeduzzaman et al 2012 the average annual rainfall is 1410 mm which is lower than the national average of 2550 mm jahan et al 2021 and almost 80 of the rainfall occurs from june to october faisal et al 2018 stormwater is the only source of groundwater recharge as the area is flood free iwm 2012 rahman and mahbub 2012 however the stormwater cannot percolate easily due to the top clay layer being more than 14 m thick hossain et al 2019a 2019d and low infiltration capacity 2 3 mm day jahan et al 2010a causing a reduction of the natural recharging of groundwater jahan et al 2015 the elevated bt is one of the driest parts of the country here 77 area is under agricultural practice but only 7 covers surface water bodies which mainly dries up during summer seasons rahman and mahbub 2012 islam 2017 it is said barind is a land where life is written in water bmda 2006 so life was very difficult and the area was underprivileged and underdeveloped water is an essential resource for human beings and other creatures over 97 of accessible freshwater comes from groundwater half of which is for drinking water and approximately half for irrigation water worldwide bari et al 2021 jakeman et al 2016 groundwater has become the essential source to meet water demand for urban industrial and irrigation requirements kafy et al 2021 michael and voss 2009 alam et al 2003 recently groundwater supplies 79 of the water demand for irrigation livestock household and industrial usage bbs 2017 badc started groundwater irrigation in bangladesh by installing and utilizing 102 deep tube wells dtw in 1967 68 and utilizing 998 shallow tube wells stw in 1973 74 to provide irrigation water 37 634 dtws 13 57 532 stws and 1 87 188 low lift pumps llp were utilized in 2018 19 year irrigated area was 5587482 ha which is 65 38 of the total cultivable land of the country and irrigation by groundwater and surface water was 73 09 and 26 91 of the total irrigated area respectively badc 2020 the scenery is different in the bt area because of limited surface water sources irrigation almost depends on groundwater hasan et al 2016 data collected from barind multipurpose development authority bmda which consists of about 100 drill hole logs deep tube wells suggested that the main aquifer in bt areas will appear after drilling 300 m 980 feet the only composite aquifer is present within the depth of 100 m is exploitable which is continuous but consists of composite sand formation in the rainy season the elevation of gwl from msl varies from 20 to 34 m in the dry season the highest value of gwl elevation varies from 15 to 32 m the depth to gwl from the ground surface in the bt area is higher than in the surrounding areas both in dry and wet seasons before initiating the project barind integrated area development project biadp phase i in the bt area of rajshahi naogaon and chapai nawabganj district the irrigated area was 13 of cultivable land and cropping intensity was 117 bmda 2006 which have gone up 93 52 badc 2020 and 230 bmda 2020 respectively through the utilization of 10307 dtws and 88390 stws with other irrigation equipment irrigation by groundwater and surface water was 90 60 and 9 40 of the irrigated area respectively badc 2020 this excessive groundwater withdrawal for irrigation in the area has helped achieve national food security and negatively impacted the environment aggravating groundwater depletion moreover due to the lowering of river water level the yearly average loss of groundwater from barind across the ganges part is 13 56 mm3 and the mohanonda part is 7 94 mm3 respectively iwm 2006 iwm 2012 so excessive extraction of groundwater for irrigation less rainfall poor natural recharge due to thick clay barind clay of pleistocene age drying of water bodies in the dry season and even losses of groundwater from the bt to the river are deteriorating the depleting condition of gwl the decreasing trend of gwl depicts that groundwater resource is under stress and their extraction has become unsustainable in many areas of bt hossain et al 2019b rahman et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 finally lacking of governance issues in the water management sectors is also one of the causes of overusing and depleting gwl islam et al 2020 the alarming situation was considered and to lessen the stress on groundwater suggestions were made emphasizing the development and management of surface water including rainwater harvesting as well as utilization of river water for irritation iwm 2012 iwm 2014 badc 2019 in this perspective it s essential to describe the initiative taken by bmda such as canal and pond re excavation for rainwater harvesting irrigation and using river water from the appropriate perennial source points the present study aims to focus on the impact of the utilization of river water for irrigation at the groundwater dependent water stressed bt area the water conserved in the canal and pond supports supplementary irrigation for a short period of 3 5 months this study will help agricultural officers and respective organizations to understand the importance of groundwater conservation and the effective use of canal and river water for irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies at godagari charghat and puthia upazila under rajshahi district gomostapur upazila under chapai nawabganj district and mohadevpur patnitola and dhamuirhat upazila under naogaon district district and upazila are the second and third lowest tires of the administrative units of bangladesh of bt area respectively located in the northwestern part of bangladesh as shown in fig 1 according to the physiographic map and the agro ecological zoning aez map and the bt area shown in fig 2 a b the study area covers both of the a the bt dissected and undulating b the floodplains it lies in the river ganges padma catchment with a drainage system predominantly of the atrai mahananda purnabhaba rivers and other minor seasonal streams without the padma all others are seasonal and c locations of raingauge and boreholes in bt areas 2 2 data collection and analysis different data like bore log lithology rainfall gwl fluctuation data information about groundwater and surface water irrigation and other necessary information have been collected from the bmda field investigation and other sources 2 2 1 bore log lithology rainfall and groundwater level information lithology data shows that 6 27 44 m top clay layer barind clay of pleistocene age prevails at the top of the aquifer in the entire study area fig 3 put a ceiling on the natural recharging causing depletion of gwl thirteen years of recorded 2007 2019 information of rainfall fig 4 shows that annual rainfall varies from a minimum of 583 mm at dhamuirhat 2012 to a maximum of 2261 mm at charghat 2007 annual average rainfall ranges between 878 19 mm 2013 and 1959 03 mm 2007 and the average of annual average rainfall stands at 1320 69 mm which is much lower than the national average of 2550 mm gradual declination of rainfall is also observed in the annual average rainfall of the study area fig 4 groundwater level hydrograph of 14 years of recorded data as shown in fig 5 reveals that declination of gwl is common all over the study area 2 2 2 information about groundwater irrigation groundwater is the major source of irrigation and dtw and stw are mainly used to extract groundwater for irrigation according to the data collected from bmda and minor irrigation survey report 2018 2019 by badc 2020 the information of irrigation equipment in the study area is as table 1 equ 1 was used to calculate the abstraction of groundwater by dtw or stw 1 q n pc rh peff 3600 35 31 where q total abstraction m3 cum n number of dtw or stw pc pump capacity of dtw or stw cfs rh running hour of the dtw or stw in a year peff pump efficiency the average pump efficiency is recorded to be 60 2 2 3 river water irrigation by double lifting way water is withdrawn from the river and provided to the crop fields by the double lifting way with the help of pontoon pumps buried pipelines and other necessary arrangements also river water conserved by the rubber dam at its upstream is supplied to the crop fields using llp and buried pipe networks the pontoon stations and rubber dam locations are shown in fig 6 the two cases of llp and buried pipe networks were used in this study though most parts of the main rivers like padma atrai and mohanonda in the study area dry up during the dry season but 11 points of those rivers have been identified as perennial surface water sources by a field investigation and water model study by iwm 2006 and 2012 to utilize the water of those sources for irrigation bmda has constructed floating pontoons and on which centrifugal pumps have been placed with rubber made flexible armed hose pipe with the intention that no problem takes place when pontoon moves upwards and downwards with rise and fall of river water during the period of the rainy season and dry season each pontoon has an electric substation with the required capacity built at the river bank close to the pontoon to operate the pumps pumps extract water from the river 1st lift and transmit it to the re excavated canal ponds or irrigation points at distant places through pipelines made of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride upvc or mild steel ms constructed beneath the ground surface electricity driven or solar powered llp are then used to withdraw 2nd lift water from the canal and transmit it through 250 mm diameter buried underground pipelines to the crop field in a controlled way so in this system irrigation water is withdrawn and distributed following the double lifting means standard components of a complete river water irrigation system are shown in fig 7 equ 2 was applied to calculate the abstraction

pontoon pumps in a year peff pump efficiency the average pump efficiency is recorded to be 60 to avoid any damage to surrounding field crops structures or villages rubber bag is made empty by keeping out air or water from it so that the channel river water can move quickly downstream during heavy rain or rainy season a rubber dam was constructed by bmda across the river barnai at jagodishpur under puthia upazila of rajshahi district in 2016 fig 8 the length and height of the rubber dam are 62 m and 4 5 m water can be conserved in the river up to 40 km at upstream of the rubber dam around the year the conserved water of the river is withdrawn for irrigation by 200 numbers of llp of which 30 numbers are of bmda and the rest 170 are operated under private ownership the equ 3 was used to calculate the volume of conserved water by the rubber dam in barnai river 3 v l w d where v volume of water m3 l length of the river that conserves water at the upstream m w average width of the submerged river at upstream m d average depth of water of the river at upstream m 3 results and discussions 3 1 bore log lithology rainfall and groundwater level situation the thick top clay barind clay of pleistocene age ranges from 6 to 27 44 m in the study area the barrier of natural recharge of groundwater causes depletion of gwl rainfall the primary source of natural recharge is decreasing and the annual average rainfall valued 1266 76 mm is much lower than the national average of 2550 mm which aggravates the depleting situation of gwl the declination of gwl is common to the entire study area varying from 2 to 10 m the irrigation of the study area mainly influences the declination of gwl round the year groundwater has been used as the primary source of irrigation due to the less availability of surface water and insufficient rainfall the use of surface water through treatment and excavation of new canals and ponds will ensure sustainable use of groundwater and proper utilization of surface water for irrigation 3 2 volume of groundwater extraction for irrigation annual groundwater withdrawals by dtw and stw have been calculated and shown in table 2 which shows that annual groundwater extraction for irrigation in the study area is 1053 83 mm3 which is higher than the potential recharge of 1042 53 mm3 compute by iwm 2012 this excessive groundwater extraction is the main cause of the depletion of gwl and shows an alarming situation for the area excessive pumping of groundwater for irrigation can lower the gwl and cause wells to no longer be able to reach the pure groundwater as the groundwater table lowers the water must be pumped farther to reach the surface using additional energy using such a well to extract groundwater can be cost prohibitive in extreme cases according to the united states geological survey usgs 70 of the groundwater is pumped for irrigation making the groundwater non renewable and unsustainable 3 3 volume of river water lifted for irrigation there are 84 pumps with a total capacity of 213 cusecs placed on the 11 pontoon to lift water from the river padma ganges mohanonda and atrai for irrigation in the study area table 3 shows that the computed volume of total lifted water is 74 62 mm3 which is about 7 08 of extracted groundwater of the study area so 7 08 of groundwater extraction can be reduced by using river water lifted by 84 numbers of centrifugal pumps and 213 numbers of 1 0 cusec capacity dtws can be replaced using this amount of water for irrigation also 6433 ha of land are irrigated by river water there are still scopes of withdrawing more water from these existing perennial sources of the rivers the volume of river water lifted for irrigation by the double lifting way plays a significant role in accelerating crop production and diversifications followed by a substantial impact on enhancing the quality of life as this method can lift more water than other conventional techniques this technique will significantly help the farmers extend farmland coverage for irrigation reduce the irrigation water cost and ensure water availability construction of more sustainable irrigation channels cross rubber dam quality discharge boxes and sluice gates with a modern drainage system will ensure effective use of the double lifting technique and provide sustainability in surface water uses for irrigation purposes 3 4 augmentation of river water for irrigation by rubber dam and its impact the calculated volume of conserved water in the river barnai upstream of the rubber dam is 12 06 mm3 as shown in table 4 which can reduce the extraction of the same volume of groundwater and irrigates 5500 ha of cropland this conserved water 12 06 mm3 is about 10 11 of extracted groundwater of the puthia upazila under the study area due to conserving water in the river up to 40 km at upstream of the rubber dam groundwater recharging occurs and as a result gwl rises as shown in the hydrograph fig 9 augmentation of river water for irrigation by rubber dam plays a significant role in groundwater recharge which is found from the hydrograph after the construction of the rubber dam in 2016 gwl started rising continuously rubber dams provide water for irrigation and other essential purposes during the dry season in the study area farmers can able to cultivate more farmlands due to the water availability during the dry season with the support of rubber dams more suitable locations need to be identified for rubber dam construction by using modern technologies to ensure the sustainability of irrigation in bt water stress region 4 conclusion rainfall the only source of natural recharge of groundwater at the study area is much lower and over extraction of groundwater 1053 83 mm3 than the potential recharge 1042 53 mm3 causes the continuous declination of gwl and claims for increasing surface water irrigation bmda s implemented double lifting river water irrigation

11806,groundwater has become the prime source of drinking and irrigation use in drought prone barind tract bt of bangladesh as the surface water sources are minimal continuous groundwater withdrawals for irrigation drinking domestics industries and other uses deplete groundwater levels gwl so the study aims to compute the quantity of river water extracted for irrigation by double lifting and rubber dam irrigation systems of barind multipurpose development authority bmda in bt area and evaluate their impacts on reducing groundwater exploitation to carry out the study bore log lithology rainfall gwl and water irrigation data have been collected from bmda and field investigation and analyzed the groundwater depletion due to over extraction than the potential recharge lower rainfall than the national average and thick top clay that limits the natural recharge lifted water by the pumps of 11 pontoons placed on the river padma ganges mohanonda and atrai can reduce 7 08 of groundwater extraction for irrigation in the study area groundwater exploitation for puthia upazila can be reduced by 10 11 with conserved water upstream of the rubber dam constructed in the barnai river also a continuous rise in gwl was observed due to storing of river water at a 4 km long section by the rubber dam graphical abstract image 1 keywords river water groundwater pontoon rubber dam barind tract 1 introduction barind tract bt in bangladesh located in its northwest part is the most extensive pleistocene terrace of the country made up of the pleistocene alluvium also known as older alluvium floored by reddish brown sticky pleistocene sediment madhupur clay and covers an area of about 7770 sq km its elevation above sea level varies from a minimum of 14 m to a maximum of 45 m hmeduzzaman et al 2012 bmda 2006 the area is tectonic in the stable shelf region of the bengal basin physiographically this tract covers both the floodplain and the bt which are further divided into three units like recent alluvial fan barind pleistocene and recent floodplain pleistocene barind clay floors the bt areas and younger and older alluvium floors the floodplains the older floodplains are of the rivers mohananda and atrai and the younger floodplain is of the river ganges padma the pleistocene deposits are termed as the older alluvium that forms the terraces iwm 2012 rashid et al 2015 the bt is located between 240 23 to 250 15 north latitude and 880 2 to 880 57 east longitude the bt is divided into three major parts like level barind high barind and north eastern barind bmda 2003 it is bounded by the river atrai karatoya in the east mahananda in the west and ganges padma in the south the area is drought prone and water stressed so the core challenge is to make the water available for irrigation drinking and other uses hossain et al 2019a 2019ba 2019c 2019d hossain et al 2021b the hard red soil typical dry climate with comparatively high temperature and less bt rainfall are very significant compared to the other parts of the country bmda 2020 temperature ranges from 8 c to 44 c ahmeduzzaman et al 2012 the average annual rainfall is 1410 mm which is lower than the national average of 2550 mm jahan et al 2021 and almost 80 of the rainfall occurs from june to october faisal et al 2018 stormwater is the only source of groundwater recharge as the area is flood free iwm 2012 rahman and mahbub 2012 however the stormwater cannot percolate easily due to the top clay layer being more than 14 m thick hossain et al 2019a 2019d and low infiltration capacity 2 3 mm day jahan et al 2010a causing a reduction of the natural recharging of groundwater jahan et al 2015 the elevated bt is one of the driest parts of the country here 77 area is under agricultural practice but only 7 covers surface water bodies which mainly dries up during summer seasons rahman and mahbub 2012 islam 2017 it is said barind is a land where life is written in water bmda 2006 so life was very difficult and the area was underprivileged and underdeveloped water is an essential resource for human beings and other creatures over 97 of accessible freshwater comes from groundwater half of which is for drinking water and approximately half for irrigation water worldwide bari et al 2021 jakeman et al 2016 groundwater has become the essential source to meet water demand for urban industrial and irrigation requirements kafy et al 2021 michael and voss 2009 alam et al 2003 recently groundwater supplies 79 of the water demand for irrigation livestock household and industrial usage bbs 2017 badc started groundwater irrigation in bangladesh by installing and utilizing 102 deep tube wells dtw in 1967 68 and utilizing 998 shallow tube wells stw in 1973 74 to provide irrigation water 37 634 dtws 13 57 532 stws and 1 87 188 low lift pumps llp were utilized in 2018 19 year irrigated area was 5587482 ha which is 65 38 of the total cultivable land of the country and irrigation by groundwater and surface water was 73 09 and 26 91 of the total irrigated area respectively badc 2020 the scenery is different in the bt area because of limited surface water sources irrigation almost depends on groundwater hasan et al 2016 data collected from barind multipurpose development authority bmda which consists of about 100 drill hole logs deep tube wells suggested that the main aquifer in bt areas will appear after drilling 300 m 980 feet the only composite aquifer is present within the depth of 100 m is exploitable which is continuous but consists of composite sand formation in the rainy season the elevation of gwl from msl varies from 20 to 34 m in the dry season the highest value of gwl elevation varies from 15 to 32 m the depth to gwl from the ground surface in the bt area is higher than in the surrounding areas both in dry and wet seasons before initiating the project barind integrated area development project biadp phase i in the bt area of rajshahi naogaon and chapai nawabganj district the irrigated area was 13 of cultivable land and cropping intensity was 117 bmda 2006 which have gone up 93 52 badc 2020 and 230 bmda 2020 respectively through the utilization of 10307 dtws and 88390 stws with other irrigation equipment irrigation by groundwater and surface water was 90 60 and 9 40 of the irrigated area respectively badc 2020 this excessive groundwater withdrawal for irrigation in the area has helped achieve national food security and negatively impacted the environment aggravating groundwater depletion moreover due to the lowering of river water level the yearly average loss of groundwater from barind across the ganges part is 13 56 mm3 and the mohanonda part is 7 94 mm3 respectively iwm 2006 iwm 2012 so excessive extraction of groundwater for irrigation less rainfall poor natural recharge due to thick clay barind clay of pleistocene age drying of water bodies in the dry season and even losses of groundwater from the bt to the river are deteriorating the depleting condition of gwl the decreasing trend of gwl depicts that groundwater resource is under stress and their extraction has become unsustainable in many areas of bt hossain et al 2019b rahman et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 finally lacking of governance issues in the water management sectors is also one of the causes of overusing and depleting gwl islam et al 2020 the alarming situation was considered and to lessen the stress on groundwater suggestions were made emphasizing the development and management of surface water including rainwater harvesting as well as utilization of river water for irritation iwm 2012 iwm 2014 badc 2019 in this perspective it s essential to describe the initiative taken by bmda such as canal and pond re excavation for rainwater harvesting irrigation and using river water from the appropriate perennial source points the present study aims to focus on the impact of the utilization of river water for irrigation at the groundwater dependent water stressed bt area the water conserved in the canal and pond supports supplementary irrigation for a short period of 3 5 months this study will help agricultural officers and respective organizations to understand the importance of groundwater conservation and the effective use of canal and river water for irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies at godagari charghat and puthia upazila under rajshahi district gomostapur upazila under chapai nawabganj district and mohadevpur patnitola and dhamuirhat upazila under naogaon district district and upazila are the second and third lowest tires of the administrative units of bangladesh of bt area respectively located in the northwestern part of bangladesh as shown in fig 1 according to the physiographic map and the agro ecological zoning aez map and the bt area shown in fig 2 a b the study area covers both of the a the bt dissected and undulating b the floodplains it lies in the river ganges padma catchment with a drainage system predominantly of the atrai mahananda purnabhaba rivers and other minor seasonal streams without the padma all others are seasonal and c locations of raingauge and boreholes in bt areas 2 2 data collection and analysis different data like bore log lithology rainfall gwl fluctuation data information about groundwater and surface water irrigation and other necessary information have been collected from the bmda field investigation and other sources 2 2 1 bore log lithology rainfall and groundwater level information lithology data shows that 6 27 44 m top clay layer barind clay of pleistocene age prevails at the top of the aquifer in the entire study area fig 3 put a ceiling on the natural recharging causing depletion of gwl thirteen years of recorded 2007 2019 information of rainfall fig 4 shows that annual rainfall varies from a minimum of 583 mm at dhamuirhat 2012 to a maximum of 2261 mm at charghat 2007 annual average rainfall ranges between 878 19 mm 2013 and 1959 03 mm 2007 and the average of annual average rainfall stands at 1320 69 mm which is much lower than the national average of 2550 mm gradual declination of rainfall is also observed in the annual average rainfall of the study area fig 4 groundwater level hydrograph of 14 years of recorded data as shown in fig 5 reveals that declination of gwl is common all over the study area 2 2 2 information about groundwater irrigation groundwater is the major source of irrigation and dtw and stw are mainly used to extract groundwater for irrigation according to the data collected from bmda and minor irrigation survey report 2018 2019 by badc 2020 the information of irrigation equipment in the study area is as table 1 equ 1 was used to calculate the abstraction of groundwater by dtw or stw 1 q n pc rh peff 3600 35 31 where q total abstraction m3 cum n number of dtw or stw pc pump capacity of dtw or stw cfs rh running hour of the dtw or stw in a year peff pump efficiency the average pump efficiency is recorded to be 60 2 2 3 river water irrigation by double lifting way water is withdrawn from the river and provided to the crop fields by the double lifting way with the help of pontoon pumps buried pipelines and other necessary arrangements also river water conserved by the rubber dam at its upstream is supplied to the crop fields using llp and buried pipe networks the pontoon stations and rubber dam locations are shown in fig 6 the two cases of llp and buried pipe networks were used in this study though most parts of the main rivers like padma atrai and mohanonda in the study area dry up during the dry season but 11 points of those rivers have been identified as perennial surface water sources by a field investigation and water model study by iwm 2006 and 2012 to utilize the water of those sources for irrigation bmda has constructed floating pontoons and on which centrifugal pumps have been placed with rubber made flexible armed hose pipe with the intention that no problem takes place when pontoon moves upwards and downwards with rise and fall of river water during the period of the rainy season and dry season each pontoon has an electric substation with the required capacity built at the river bank close to the pontoon to operate the pumps pumps extract water from the river 1st lift and transmit it to the re excavated canal ponds or irrigation points at distant places through pipelines made of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride upvc or mild steel ms constructed beneath the ground surface electricity driven or solar powered llp are then used to withdraw 2nd lift water from the canal and transmit it through 250 mm diameter buried underground pipelines to the crop field in a controlled way so in this system irrigation water is withdrawn and distributed following the double lifting means standard components of a complete river water irrigation system are shown in fig 7 equ 2 was applied to calculate the abstraction of river water by pumps installed on the floating pontoons 2 q n pc rh peff 3600 35 31 where q total abstraction m3 cum n number of centrifugal pumps pc pump capacity cfs rh running hour of the pontoon pumps in a year peff pump efficiency the average pump efficiency is recorded to be 60 to avoid any damage to surrounding field crops structures or villages rubber bag is made empty by keeping out air or water from it so that the channel river water can move quickly downstream during heavy rain or rainy season a rubber dam was constructed by bmda across the river barnai at jagodishpur under puthia upazila of rajshahi district in 2016 fig 8 the length and height of the rubber dam are 62 m and 4 5 m water can be conserved in the river up to 40 km at upstream of the rubber dam around the year the conserved water of the river is withdrawn for irrigation by 200 numbers of llp of which 30 numbers are of bmda and the rest 170 are operated under private ownership the equ 3 was used to calculate the volume of conserved water by the rubber dam in barnai river 3 v l w d where v volume of water m3 l length of the river that conserves water at the upstream m w average width of the submerged river at upstream m d average depth of water of the river at upstream m 3 results and discussions 3 1 bore log lithology rainfall and groundwater level situation the thick top clay barind clay of pleistocene age ranges from 6 to 27 44 m in the study area the barrier of natural recharge of groundwater causes depletion of gwl rainfall the primary source of natural recharge is decreasing and the annual average rainfall valued 1266 76 mm is much lower than the national average of 2550 mm which aggravates the depleting situation of gwl the declination of gwl is common to the entire study area varying from 2 to 10 m the irrigation of the study area mainly influences the declination of gwl round the year groundwater has been used as the primary source of irrigation due to the less availability of surface water and insufficient rainfall the use of surface water through treatment and excavation of new canals and ponds will ensure sustainable use of groundwater and proper utilization of surface water for irrigation 3 2 volume of groundwater extraction for irrigation annual groundwater withdrawals by dtw and stw have been calculated and shown in table 2 which shows that annual groundwater extraction for irrigation in the study area is 1053 83 mm3 which is higher than the potential recharge of 1042 53 mm3 compute by iwm 2012 this excessive groundwater extraction is the main cause of the depletion of gwl and shows an alarming situation for the area excessive pumping of groundwater for irrigation can lower the gwl and cause wells to no longer be able to reach the pure groundwater as the groundwater table lowers the water must be pumped farther to reach the surface using additional energy using such a well to extract groundwater can be cost prohibitive in extreme cases according to the united states geological survey usgs 70 of the groundwater is pumped for irrigation making the groundwater non renewable and unsustainable 3 3 volume of river water lifted for irrigation there are 84 pumps with a total capacity of 213 cusecs placed on the 11 pontoon to lift water from the river padma ganges mohanonda and atrai for irrigation in the study area table 3 shows that the computed volume of total lifted water is 74 62 mm3 which is about 7 08 of extracted groundwater of the study area so 7 08 of groundwater extraction can be reduced by using river water lifted by 84 numbers of centrifugal pumps and 213 numbers of 1 0 cusec capacity dtws can be replaced using this amount of water for irrigation also 6433 ha of land are irrigated by river water there are still scopes of withdrawing more water from these existing perennial sources of the rivers the volume of river water lifted for irrigation by the double lifting way plays a significant role in accelerating crop production and diversifications followed by a substantial impact on enhancing the quality of life as this method can lift more water than other conventional techniques this technique will significantly help the farmers extend farmland coverage for irrigation reduce the irrigation water cost and ensure water availability construction of more sustainable irrigation channels cross rubber dam quality discharge boxes and sluice gates with a modern drainage system will ensure effective use of the double lifting technique and provide sustainability in surface water uses for irrigation purposes 3 4 augmentation of river water for irrigation by rubber dam and its impact the calculated volume of conserved water in the river barnai upstream of the rubber dam is 12 06 mm3 as shown in table 4 which can reduce the extraction of the same volume of groundwater and irrigates 5500 ha of cropland this conserved water 12 06 mm3 is about 10 11 of extracted groundwater of the puthia upazila under the study area due to conserving water in the river up to 40 km at upstream of the rubber dam groundwater recharging occurs and as a result gwl rises as shown in the hydrograph fig 9 augmentation of river water for irrigation by rubber dam plays a significant role in groundwater recharge which is found from the hydrograph after the construction of the rubber dam in 2016 gwl started rising continuously rubber dams provide water for irrigation and other essential purposes during the dry season in the study area farmers can able to cultivate more farmlands due to the water availability during the dry season with the support of rubber dams more suitable locations need to be identified for rubber dam construction by using modern technologies to ensure the sustainability of irrigation in bt water stress region 4 conclusion rainfall the only source of natural recharge of groundwater at the study area is much lower and over extraction of groundwater 1053 83 mm3 than the potential recharge 1042 53 mm3 causes the continuous declination of gwl and claims for increasing surface water irrigation bmda s implemented double lifting river water irrigation projects placed at the 11 locations of padma mohananda and atrai rivers lifted 74 62 mm3 water which is 7 08 of extracted groundwater and by which 6433 ha of cropland were irrigated using this amount

at p 0 05 in groundwater the distribution patterns of hms followed the decreasing trends of zn ni mn cu pb co for nails and ni zn mn co cr pb cd for urine the hazard quotient values estimated for hms except zn and pb in groundwater consumed by adults were greater than the permissible limit of 1 0 indicating adverse health effects the cancer risk data for cd and pb were generally higher than the acceptable limit of 1 0 10 4 suggesting the possible development of cancer on exposure to groundwater through ingestion the crs of hms in groundwater samples were 114 76 and 14 times higher than the acceptable limit of 1 0 10 4 for infants children and adults respectively cd 94 was the major contributor to the total cancer burden of hms in the groundwater the hms were observed at higher

area the study location is a border town between lagos and ogun states in the southwestern region of nigeria the states are prominent in terms of population size economic value natural resources and heavy industrial actions lagos has the coordinates of 3 45 3 75 e and 6 35 n 6 58 n while ogun state has the coordinates of 3 36 3 58 e and 6 91 n 7 15 n the kurata dumpsite is located in igberen community surrounded by several settlements in sango otta ogun state fig 1 it is located between latitude 6 40 and 6 44 n and longitude 3 13 and 3 15 e river atunwara flows in the north eastern direction of the sampling site a small river whose course runs southwards of the sampling site where there is indiscriminate disposal of untreated effluents the sample location was chosen because of its importance to both the community and the industrial regions in addition the sampling site was selected to determine the effect of various existing anthropogenic activities on human health the choice of studying the deposition of heavy metals in nails and urine was due to the fact that these scavengers were usually hand picking and sorting their supposed helpful materials from the dumping site without using any personal protective equipment ppe furthermore some of the wastes materials settles on their nails and skin thereby becoming absorbed into their systems through ingestion and dermal contact therefore one of the most convenient and effective ways to study the health risks of the scavengers is collection of nail and urine samples 2 2 water sampling and preservation fifteen

sampling design which ensures the law of statistical regularity was used for the water sample collection in the study location it is usually considered the best technique for selecting a representative sample 2 3 3 urine and nail samples collection and preparation the urine and nail samples of thirty eight 38 volunteers males and females were collected at the selected sampling sites the urine samples were collected into a clean bottle while the nail samples were collected into dispensing envelopes before collecting the nail samples the volunteers were asked to wash their hands with medicated soap and rinse with deionized water this was done to prevent any form of metal contamination ciszewski et al 1997 this was then followed by drying the hands with a clean towel and tissue paper to eliminate external contamination fingernail and toenail samples were cut with a new and sterilized razor blade per an individual the collected biological samples nail and urine were stored in dispensing envelopes and urine bottles respectively the nature of these samples was maintained with the aid of a cooler containing ice packs and thereby transported to the laboratory where they were stored in the refrigerator until chemical analysis was carried out a global positioning system gps device was employed to locate the sampling sites 2 3 4 digestion of nail sample the dried nail samples 1 g were digested with mixture of 10 ml concentrated nitric acid 70 15 8 m and 5 ml perchloric acid 70 11 6 m and kept overnight at room temperature to prevent excessive foaming afterward samples were heated at 160 180 c on a heater in a fume cupboard until the mixture became clear and reduced to 1 ml taiwo and awomeso 2017 each sample solution was then diluted with nitric acid 0 1 m and made to a volume of 50 ml with distilled water 2 3 5 urine sample collection and preparation urine samples were collected in 100 ml polyethylene tubes after which they were wrapped in clean polyethylene bags during the sample collection sessions the samples collected were then acidified with ultrapure concentrated hno3 acid 1 v v and stored at 4 c following the kazi et al 2008 procedure the samples were vigorously shaken for 1 min before sub sampling for analysis to ensure a homogeneous suspension 2 3 6 digestion of urine sample the urine samples were digested by adding 1 ml concentrated hno3 acid 70 15 8 m to the aliquot of urine sample previously kept at 4 c for analysis horng et al 2002 to quickly prepare the urine sample microwave digestion is ideal for the process a 5 0 ml sample and 10 0 ml of a 1 1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric 36 11 65 m and nitric acids 5 0 ml conc hcl 5 0 ml conc hno3 was transferred into a 125 ml pressure resistant bottle for digestion the digestion process was carried out at 300 w for 4 min i e to remove any interfering matrix within the samples until the solution became colorless it was then evaporated to dryness before diluting to 25 0 ml with deionized water 2 3 7 digestion of water samples the water samples were digested for heavy metals analysis using the standard procedure aoac 2000 an approximately 100 ml of the acid fixed water sample was measured into a labeled conical flask containing glass pebbles 10 ml concentrated nitric acid was added and heated in the fume cupboard for 30 min digested samples were filtered into pre washed digestion bottles before transported to university of ibadan central laboratory for metal analysis 2 3 8 determination of heavy metals all digested samples were analyzed for selected heavy metals cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb and zn using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 210 211vgp buck scientific e norwalk ct usa parizanganeh et al 2014 also a standard solution for each element was prepared at the concentration range of 0 10 mg l the summary of physical and chemical analyses is presented in table 1 2 4 ethical consideration the ethical approval to carry out the study on the scavengers biological samples was collected from ogun state ministry of health abeokuta ref hprs 381 314 see the supplementary information it should also be noted that the unevenness in the biological samples of the scavengers collected at the dumpsite was solely based on the responsiveness and availability of volunteers to donate their samples this is usually a general challenge for researchers when carrying out scientific investigations or case studies 2 5 quality control quality assurance the urine specimen collection requires a storage system capable of maintaining the optimal temperature at 20 c and keeping it for stability urine samples that were not analyzed during the period were frozen and kept at 20 c and analyzed within one month of collection following the method reported in the past study vimercati et al 2016 all the glassware used in this study were thoroughly washed and then rinsed with deionized water this was followed by subsequent drying at 35 c cooled and rinsed with acetone c3h6o dong et al 2012 onydinma et al 2021 the aas instrument was calibrated with series of standards prepared in 0 10 mg l concentration variation meters were calibrated each sampling day using their respective standards according to the manufacturer s guidelines all reagents used were of analytical grade sigma aldrich chemie gmbh darmstadt germany blank samples were determined to cancel the background contribution of the extracting chemicals and also to estimate the detection limit of the analytical instruments calculated as three times the standard deviation taiwo et al 2014 2021a 2021b kumar et al 2014 jurowski et al 2018 onydinma et al 2021 2 6 data analysis the obtained data were subjected to descriptive mean and standard deviation and inferential

sampling points 2 and 4 which were highly acidic with ph of 5 5 and 4 7 respectively table s1 the average ph value 6 85 0 82 was measured to be within the who standard range of 6 5 8 5 in drinking water who 2017 the high ph values observed in groundwater samples from sampling points 2 and 4 could be due to the high influx of leachates from the dumpsite the ph results showed that 87 of the analyzed water samples were neutral similar to the findings of nirmala and jagath 2013 the temperature was slightly higher than 29 0 c across all the sampling points having the overall mean value of 29 5 0 16 c table s1 the alkalinity value ranged from 0 30 mg l at the 14th sampling point to 2 20 mg l at the 5th sampling point the result shows the average value of alkalinity to be 1 0 mg l according to sa eed and mahmoud 2014 and onydinma et al 2021 the main species that contributed to water alkalinity are bicarbonates phosphates hydroxides and borates lower alkalinity values have less resistance to ph changes while higher alkalinity values have greater resistance to ph changes onydinma et al 2021 the present study showed high variations in the total hardness th levels of the groundwater samples at the vicinity of the dumpsite the 11th 2nd and 5th sampling points were observed to have high th values of 10 00 12 00 and 19 00 mg l respectively it was observed that 67 of the sampling points showed the th values lower than 4 00 mg l with an overall average value of 4 47 5 12 mg l which was within the who recommended value 500 mg l in drinking water islam et al 2016a 2016b lower th may pose negative effects on human health especially malnourished people s health islam et al 2016a 2016b electrical conductivity ec values varied from 14 00 to 370 00 μs cm at sampling points 2 to 7 with the average value of 254 73 90 85 μs cm table s1 the sampling point with the highest value reflects the point with the highest influx of leachate the result indicated a high ec value 250 μs cm which is the permissible threshold the ec values from 50 of the sampling points showed that the water samples were unsuitable for drinking the inflow of ions anions and dissolved solids from the dumpsite leachate into the water body might explain the high levels of ec in the samples on the other hand the total dissolved solids tds followed the ec pattern because tds is approximately the half of the measured ec the mean value of tds was 149 24 60 12 mg l tds measures the combined dissolved contents of all inorganic and organic substances present in a water sample high tds and ec values table s1 were observed in approximately 87 of the water samples high concentrations of ec and tds could be associated with leachate from the dumpsite taiwo et al 2019 3 2 heavy metal concentrations in the water samples the levels of selected heavy metals in water samples at various sampling sites are presented in table 2 cd and cu were observed at the lowest and highest levels at the 1st and 15th sampling points respectively while fe and zn were measured lowest at the 15th sampling point table s2 shows the analysis of variance anova of heavy metals at p 0 05 the heavy metals showed significant differences across the fifteen sampling points this implies that the observed level of each heavy metal varied significantly across the water samples this therefore denotes that exposure to heavy metals through consumption of water would also vary considerably the average concentration of each heavy metal in water samples are shown in fig 2 table 3 shows the pearson s correlation coefficient data of heavy metals in groundwater a moderate correlation 0 446 p 0 01 was observed between cu and pb while a strong correlation 0 899 p 0 01 occurred between cu and cd this showed that the availability of cu would influence both pb and cd and their respective environmental and human induced effects fe has a negatively moderate correlation 0 555 p 0 01 with pb indicating different emission sources while a moderate association correlation 0 538 p 0 01 with zn indicates a similar emission origin pb has a weak positive relationship 0 318 with cd and a negative weak correlation 0 326 p 0 05 with zn the observed metals from the landfill leachate could have accumulative and detrimental effects on the ecology and food chains leading to carcinogenic effects acute toxicity and genotoxicity in humans ozturk et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2014 this is attributed to the fact that leachate can infiltrate into groundwater degrade water quality and be transported from several distances into water bodies this can thus result in acute toxic and genotoxic hazards that impair aquatic lives maqbool et al 2011 it can also cause significant resources to be spent on both the treatment and control of the contamination veli et al 2008 pollution from dumpsite leachate is a significant environmental and public health hazard because its improper handling has a significant negative influence on groundwater widziewicz et al 2012 besides their presence in the soil can also lead to contamination especially by zn fe pb cu and cd kurniawan et al 2006 lead is a bluish grey metal that is abundantly present in the environment due to various anthropogenic activities the disposal of wastes that contain for instance medical equipment batteries paint and dyes production could influence the deposition of pb in the leachate the health impacts of pb are the same despite the route of exposure astdr and 2010 pb toxicities include inference of vitamin d metabolism rise in blood pressure brain damage a decline in fertility in man through sperm damage impairment of proper infant mental development taiwo et al 2010a and b cadmium is often found in phosphate fertilizers producing industries and others engage in its application it is also obtained proximal to metal mining and refining sites waste incineration and disposal sites cadmium binds to albumin and it is transported to the liver upon absorption into the blood cd induced liver damage increases hepatic enzymes astdr and 2010 renal tubule damage is a hallmark of cd toxicity and it is reflected in increased concentrations of biomarkers such as β2 microglobulin glomerular damage may follow with corresponding increased albumin and transferrin levels bernard 2004 the range value for cu in this study 0 005 0 001 to 0 047 0 001 mg l was lower than the amount 0 03 0 44 mg l reported by nirmala and jagath 2013 the levels of fe 1 430 0 017 to 36 333 0 153 mg l and zn 0 887 0 012 to 8 677 0 108 mg l obtained in this study were higher than the values of 1 20 17 60 mg l fe and 0 11 0 58 mg l zn reported in nirmala and jagath 2013 study which appraised leachate characterization and groundwater pollution at a municipal solid waste landfill in gohagoda sri lanka the presence of fe in water makes it colored and may be unfit for domestic use 4 levels of heavy metals in the volunteers nail samples table 4 presents the levels of metals in nail samples cd was below the detection limit in 24 out of the 38 volunteers for nail samples this implies that 63 of the sampled volunteers were free from possible cd contamination nail samples of the 1st 18th and 20th volunteers revealed cd concentrations of 11 07 0 12 20 02 0 03 and 16 02 0 03 mg kg respectively the average level of cd in the nail samples was determined to be 2 13 4 46 mg kg fig 3 this concentration is likely to pose toxicological threats on the volunteers if ingested without proper handwashing levels of cr were quantified in 7 out of the 38 nail samples to be less than 20 00 mg kg high concentrations 144 03 0 03 123 02 0 03 and 152 02 0 03 mg kg of cr were observed in the 5th 34th and 35th nail volunteer samples respectively the average level of cr in the nail samples was 55 66 35 18 mg kg fig 3 this indicated that none of the 38 volunteers were free from possible toxicological effects of cr the levels of pb were below the detection limit in 28 nail samples 74 while the remaining nail samples indicated concentrations between 37 22 0 03 and 358 00 0 00 mg kg in the 19th and 18th sample respectively with an overall average level of 36 58 89 36 mg kg fig 3 levels of co were also observed below the detection limit in 24 nail samples 63 while the remaining 14 nail samples had the metal level ranging from 0 22 0 02 to 32 02 0 03 mg kg in the 25th and 28th nail samples respectively the average level of co in nail samples was 2 86 6 97 mg kg possible toxicological effects from the traces of co were elicited in 36 14 nail samples of the volunteers the average concentrations of cu mn ni and zn were 95 37 452 39 108 47 167 76 156 04 172 91 and 354 34 333 86 mg kg respectively fig 3 the analysis of variance data presented in table s3 in the supplementary information indicated that there was a significant p 0 05 difference across the assessed heavy metals in the 38 nail samples of the volunteers table 5 presents the pearson s correlation coefficients of metals in nail samples cd and pb and cr and mn were observed to be moderately correlated with values of 0 582 and 0 568 respectively at p 0 01 significant level the moderate correlation between the two sets of metals showed possible similar emission sources however cd and co 0 186 p 0 05 and pb and zn 0 248 p 0 05 exhibited weak anti correlation indicating different emission sources of the two metals also cr and zn and co and mn exhibited weak correlations with coefficients of 0 321 and 0 356 at p 0 01 respectively this indicates that the availability of cr and co would weakly increase zn and mn levels respectively the ranges of nail concentrations of zn cd cu and pb observed in this study were higher than the values of 0 59 0 69 12 21 3 82 5 18 and 130 224 mg kg respectively reported by rashed and hossam 2007 in aswan egypt furthermore the mean values of cd cu pb and zn were comparable to the values observed in previous studies such as mortada et al 2002 and samanta et al 2004 yoo et al 2002 documented the corresponding values for cd 0 08 2 1 mg kg cu 0 82 11 30 mg kg pb bdl 13 30 mg kg and zn 2 7 171 mg kg the occurrence of heavy metals in this study corroborated the studies of nowak and chmielnicka 2000 mortada et al 2002 daniel et al 2004 and rashed and hossam 2007 in which human nails were used as bio indicators for metal cd cu pb zn accumulation the studies recommended the metals as suitable fingerprints for metals pollution identification and chronic exposure study 4 1 levels of heavy metals in the volunteers urine samples cd concentrations in 11 urine samples were below the detection limit table 6 and less than 0 05 mg l in the remaining samples 27 samples while cr levels were less than 0 70 mg l in addition except for the 28th urine sample pb 0 77 mg l all samples tested for pb were observed to be below the detection limit in all the volunteers nail samples precisely 50 of the urine samples have co levels below the detection limit with the highest concentration 1 03 mg l observed in the 33rd sample the average concentrations of ni zn and mn varied from 0 64 mg l in the 38th urine sample to 3 59 mg l in the 31st urine sample 0 09 mg l in the 5th urine sample to 4 82 mg l in the 9th urine sample and 0 04 in the 2nd 4th 5th 6th and 36th urine samples to 9 76 mg l in the 33rd urine sample respectively the levels of the observed heavy metals were generally lower in the urine than in the nail samples the average concentrations of heavy metals in urine samples are presented in fig 4 the distribution pattern followed the decreasing order of ni zn mn co cr pb cd the analysis of variance data established the significance p 0 05 of some heavy metals across the volunteers urine samples table s4 in the supplementary information this indicates that the determined heavy metals varied with possible toxicological health effects across the samples the levels of heavy metals documented in the urine samples from the study area are comparable to the past work of mahugija et al 2018 in school children from selected industrial and non industrial areas of dar es salaam tanzania the presence of heavy metals in urine samples is an attractive matrix that has been widely applied for estimating exposure tsalev and zaprianov 1988 analysis of urine reflects the total body intake of the various heavy metals better than other biological fluids clarkson and magos 2006 table 7 presents the pearson s correlation coefficients of metals observed in the scavengers urine samples cd and pb showed significant weak negative relationship r 0 187 p 0 05 while cd and co indicated moderate 0 428 p 0 05 and 0 01 pb was weakly correlated with co 0 231 p 0 05 and ni 0 205 p 0 05 co was strongly correlated with ni 0 839 p 0 01 indicating a possible emission origin the observed heavy metals in the urine samples of the dumpsite workers could have been from scavengers exposure through inhalation of dust in air or particles generated by burning materials and or ingestion of metal contaminated water and food and dermal contact in nails morais et al 2012 the presence of the selected heavy metals at varying concentrations in water human nails and urine could be attributed to environmental exposure hyoi et al 1986 and golow and kwaansa ansah 1994 revealed that increased heavy metal levels in the environmental samples could be associated with their dispersion in the air and the dumping of unused materials which the water sources and volunteers might have been exposed to similarly mortada et al 2000 2001 2002 showed that the measurement of metals in environmental media could be of considerable use for diagnosing exposure bergoni and borella 1989 cabez 1991 nowak and chmielnicka 2000 have previously buttressed the associations among cd cu pb and zn however the variations in the different sample types water nails and urine might propose their varying concentrations in the environmental media high levels of the detected heavy metals indicated the possibility of acute and chronic occupational exposure gerhardsson et al 2002 the statistical p 0 05 differences observed in the heavy metals across the sampling points and volunteers corroborate the assertion of slotink et al 2005 4 2 principal component analysis of heavy metals in urine and nail samples table 8 shows the varimax principal component analysis pca of water quality parameters the pca indicated three components factors that accounted for 70 of the total variance the first factor which explained 42 of the total variance has high loadings for mn co cr fe and zn suggesting emissions from industries the second factor was significant for cd and pb and explained 18 of the total variance this component is suspected to emanate from the disposal of battery waste as ni cr and zn characterized factor three which explained only 10 of the dataset the probable source for this component is vehicular emissions taiwo et al 2014 4 3 health risk assessment the health risk assessment data for the average daily dose add of heavy metals in groundwater consumed by adults children and infants are presented in table 9 fe and zn were the most dosed heavy metals consumed by adults in groundwater the adult that consumed 2 l would dose 2 11 2 01 mg kg day bodyweight of fe and 0 35 0 26 mg kg day bodyweight of zn a child who drank 1 l of groundwater daily would dose 1 41 1 34 mg kg day fe and 0 24 0 17 mg kg day zn which is about three times higher than that of adults an infant of lower bodyweight that ingested less quantity of water compared to an adult of higher bodyweight would take more of these heavy metals than an adult taiwo and awomeso 2017 the order of the adds of heavy metals in the assessed water samples were fe zn pb cu cd the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi values of heavy metals in groundwater samples are shown in table 10 the hqs of pb cd for children and infants cu fe and zn in groundwater samples were greater than the permissible limit of 1 0 thereby establishing the non carcinogenic adverse health effects obiri et al 2016 cu fe and zn are vital elements necessary for proper body metabolism however at high doses fe can result in haemochromatosis a disease characterized by liver cirrhosis impaired pancreatic function and hepatocellular carcinoma taiwo and awomeso 2017 taiwo et al 2021a 2021b other adverse effects of fe include gastric upset nausea constipation heart disease stomach pain vomiting diarrhea bloody vomit and stool dehydration and lethargy due to damage to internal organs particularly the brain and the liver yu et al 2018 oral intake of extremely high doses of zinc above 300 mg zn day may cause nausea vomiting pain cramps and diarrhea plum et al 2010 high intake of cu can be harmful to children and adults while chronic exposure elicits irritation to the eyes mouth and nose and can cause vomiting dizziness nausea diarrhea headaches stomach cramps liver and kidney damage and even death atsdr 2004 cd and pb are heavy metals with no known physiological benefits to the human body there has been increased interest in pb because of its ability to cause various toxicological effects in kidney liver and blood and initiate cardiovascular damage and cancer in humans naghipour et al 2017 balli and leghouchi 2018 pb toxicity may result in numerous toxic effects including reduced intelligence damage to the kidney neurological disorder and gastrointestinal tract taiwo and awomeso 2017 extensive exposure to cd has been linked with lung renal and prostate cancer bone diseases kidney failure and anemia balli and leghouchi 2018 fig 5 presents the contributions of heavy metals to non carcinogenic adverse effects in groundwater fe indicated the largest portion 99 64 to the total disease burden while other heavy metals contributed less than 0 4 in contrast to the present study the past studies have shown cr as the major contributor to non carcinogenic adverse effects in groundwater from southwestern nigeria ayantobo et al 2014 ayedun et al 2015 taiwo and awomeso 2017 unfortunately the present study has not determined cr in groundwater samples 4 4 the cancer risk of heavy metals in groundwater the cancer risk cr values of pb and cd in drinking water are presented in table 11 higher cr values greater than the acceptable limit of 1 0 10 4 were observed in groundwater for cd and pb children and infants this therefore indicates probable lifetime cancer development the crs of heavy metals exposure by infants children and adults in groundwater were also greater than the permissible limit of 1 0 10 4 the cr data showed that infants were mostly at significant risk followed by the children the cr of metals in groundwater samples were 114 76 and 14 times higher than the acceptable limit for infants children and adults the cr values of cd and pb obtained in this study were lower than those reported by ayedun et al 2015 in groundwater samples from lagos and ogun states in this study cd was the major contributor to the cancer risk constituting up to 94 while pb contributed 6 to the total cancer burden in groundwater fig 6 5 conclusion this study assessed the impacts of open dumpsites on the quality status of groundwater samples and the resultant adverse effects of improper handling of wastes by the scavengers operating at the kurata dumpsite ijoko ogun state the observed heavy metals showed varying significant levels in groundwater human nails and urine samples the patterns of distribution of heavy metals followed fe zn pb cu cd in water samples zn ni mn cu pb co in nail samples and ni zn mn co cr pb cd in urine samples the results of the principal component analysis revealed industrial mn co cr fe and zn battery wastes cd and pb and vehicular emission as ni cr and zn as the probable sources of heavy metals in groundwater samples the hazard quotients of pb cu fe and zn in groundwater consumed by adults children and infants were estimated above the acceptable limit of 1 0 indicating non carcinogenic adverse health effects higher cancer risk values were documented for pb and cd than the permissible limit of 1 0 10 4 in drinking water thereby establishing their possible carcinogenic effects the data obtained in this study showed that the kurata dumpsite could pose major health threats to the neighboring communities and the scavengers consequently urgent actions should be taken by the environmentalists and the policymakers to combat the negative impacts associated with the activities of scavenging around the dumpsite though scavenging activities at dumpsites should be discouraged however for the benefits of those who wish to continue in the business the use of personal protective equipment should be echoed to them furthermore hand dug wells boreholes and other drinking water sources should be situated far from the dumpsite areas environmental stakeholders should introduce occupational health and safety training programmes to help the scavengers understand the health risks associated with solid wastes sorting without an

11807,groundwater contamination by leachate from dumpsites is a major health issue of public concern in developing nations of the world the present study assessed the health risk of the scavengers and residents exposed to different heavy metals hms in drinking water contaminated through leaching from improperly managed dumpsite waste in kurata ijoko sango area of ogun state nigeria the data of groundwater parameters and biological nails and urine samples of scavengers and the residents around the dumpsite were evaluated for descriptive and inferential statistics the hms observed in samples varied significantly p 0 05 across the sampling sites however 74 and 63 of the nail samples had pb and co levels below the detection limit bdl of the analytical instrument respectively the hm

at p 0 05 in groundwater the distribution patterns of hms followed the decreasing trends of zn ni mn cu pb co for nails and ni zn mn co cr pb cd for urine the hazard quotient values estimated for hms except zn and pb in groundwater consumed by adults were greater than the permissible limit of 1 0 indicating adverse health effects the cancer risk data for cd and pb were generally higher than the acceptable limit of 1 0 10 4 suggesting the possible development of cancer on exposure to groundwater through ingestion the crs of hms in groundwater samples were 114 76 and 14 times higher than the acceptable limit of 1 0 10 4 for infants children and adults respectively cd 94 was the major contributor to the total cancer burden of hms in the groundwater the hms were observed at higher concentrations in biological samples than in groundwater this study therefore established the deleterious health effects of the dumpsite on the vicinity groundwater and the scavengers graphical

progressively cropping up in various nigerian cities and towns due to the scavengers actions where gathered the scavenged wastes are sorted bulked together according to kinds and sold to the end users asibor and edjere 2017 according to the world bank assessment around 2 of the world s population survive through scavenging the actions of scavengers save big developing cities such manila philippines jakarta indonesia karachi india and bangkok thailand about 3 million per year aljaradin et al 2015 asibor and edjere 2017 ijioma et al 2021 most scavengers crudely carry out sorting activities without much protective wares and masks apart from sustaining injuries during the sorting activities these scavengers are also exposed to harmful and obnoxious chemicals exhuming from the dumpsite they are further subjected to hazards such as bites from poisonous reptiles and other terrestrial creatures some of the dumpsite wastes are known to contain a significant level of heavy metals guerriero et al 2009 oriyomi et al 2016 osakwe and okolie 2015 primo et al 2008 salami et al 2014 salami and susu 2013 schoeters et al 2006 adedosu et al 2013 furthermore due to the low quality and low hygienic lifestyles by most scavengers some of the waste materials from the dumpsites are deposited on their skins and nails and then absorbed into their body through bloodstream and food ingestion overtime sango otta is regarded as one of the fastest developing areas in ogun state due to heavy industrial activities which has taken a drastic toll on the geological resources in the area ojekunle et al 2020 past studies by samson et al 2012 oyelami et al 2013a b adekitan et al 2016 aboyeji and eigbokhan 2016 aladejana et al 2018 laniyan and adewumi 2019 and ojo et al 2020 had investigated physicochemical and trace metal concentrations in dumpsites across different study locations in the southwestern region of nigeria however the studies on the health risk of the scavengers and the residents around the dumpsite areas are rarely reported considering the enormity and complexity of menace and associated health challenges on the human and ecosystem especially the scavengers in kurata dumpsite thorough investigations become necessary this is expected to assess the health risk of the scavengers and residents exposed to different heavy metals in drinking water that leached through improper management of leachate collection and removal system koerner and eith 2005 the objectives of the present study were to i determine heavy metals in groundwater samples around the dumpsite ii assess heavy metals in the urine and nail samples of the scavengers and selected people around the study area iii evaluate the resultant effect of heavy metals on human health after a long term exposure and iv ascertain the long term effect of consumption of groundwater around the vicinity of the dumpsite using the cancer risk model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study location is a border town between lagos and ogun states in the southwestern region of nigeria the states are prominent in terms of population size economic value natural resources and heavy industrial actions lagos has the coordinates of 3 45 3 75 e and 6 35 n 6 58 n while ogun state has the coordinates of 3 36 3 58 e and 6 91 n 7 15 n the kurata dumpsite is located in igberen community surrounded by several settlements in sango otta ogun state fig 1 it is located between latitude 6 40 and 6 44 n and longitude 3 13 and 3 15 e river atunwara flows in the north eastern direction of the sampling site a small river whose course runs southwards of the sampling site where there is indiscriminate disposal of untreated effluents the sample location was chosen because of its importance to both the community and the industrial regions in addition the sampling site was selected to determine the effect of various existing anthropogenic activities on human health the choice of studying the deposition of heavy metals in nails and urine was due to the fact that these scavengers were usually hand picking and sorting their supposed helpful materials from the dumping site without using any personal protective equipment ppe furthermore some of the wastes materials settles on their nails and skin thereby becoming absorbed into their systems through ingestion and dermal contact therefore one of the most convenient and effective ways to study the health risks of the scavengers is collection of nail and urine samples 2 2 water sampling and preservation fifteen 15 groundwater water samples were collected between may 2017 and january 2018 in triplicate using sterilized 5 l plastic bottles samples were analyzed for physicochemical and microbiological parameters following the procedures adopted by previous studies adamu et al 2015 adeniji et al 2019 madilonga et al 2021 parameters such as ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen were monitored in situ the samples were tagged appropriately and stored at 4 c with ice cubes before being transported to the laboratory for further analysis 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 physicochemical parameters the groundwater temperature ph and ec were determined in situ using extech multimeter ec 400 extech nashua nh usa onydinma et al 2021 the ph value measures the acidity or alkalinity of water kirby cravotta iii 2005 li et al 2020 one of the most critical water quality metrics for predicting salinity and mineralization is ec ahmadianfar et al 2020 it is a measure of the ability of the water to pass an electrical current it is affected by the presence of inorganic dissolved solids like nitrate sulfate and phosphate anions or cations like sodium magnesium and iron ahmadianfar et al 2020 grisso et al 2005 temperature is an important parameter that influences dissolved chemicals and other pollutants including dissolved oxygen in the water harvey et al 2011 sánchez et al 2007 total hardness ca2 and mg2 were determined using the edta complexometric titration method where ebt and patton redder were used as indicators total hardness is defined as the total sum of magnesium and calcium concentration expressed as mg l of caco3 which signifies the mineral content in a water sample that is irreversible by boiling shariati rad and heidari 2020 it is equivalent to the total calcium and magnesium hardness diehl et al 1950 2 3 2 heavy metals analysis heavy metals in samples were determined at the central laboratory university of ibadan oyo state using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 210 211vgp buck scientific e norwalk ct usa calibration standards were prepared from the test metals stock solution 100 mg l random probability sampling design which ensures the law of statistical regularity was used for the water sample collection in the study location it is usually considered the best technique for selecting a representative sample 2 3 3 urine and nail samples collection and preparation the urine and nail samples of thirty eight 38 volunteers males and females were collected at the selected sampling sites the urine samples were collected into a clean bottle while the nail samples were collected into dispensing envelopes before collecting the nail samples the volunteers were asked to wash their hands with medicated soap and rinse with deionized water this was done to prevent any form of metal contamination ciszewski et al 1997 this was then followed by drying the hands with a clean towel and tissue paper to eliminate external contamination fingernail and toenail samples were cut with a new and sterilized razor blade per an individual the collected biological samples nail and urine were stored in dispensing envelopes and urine bottles respectively the nature of these samples was maintained with the aid of a cooler containing ice packs and thereby transported to the laboratory where they were stored in the refrigerator until chemical analysis was carried out a global positioning system gps device was employed to locate the sampling sites 2 3 4 digestion of nail sample the dried nail samples 1 g were digested with mixture of 10 ml concentrated nitric acid 70 15 8 m and 5 ml perchloric acid 70 11 6 m and kept overnight at room temperature to prevent excessive foaming afterward samples were heated at 160 180 c on a heater in a fume cupboard until the mixture became clear and reduced to 1 ml taiwo and awomeso 2017 each sample solution was then diluted with nitric acid 0 1 m and made to a volume of 50 ml with distilled water 2 3 5 urine sample collection and preparation urine samples were collected in 100 ml polyethylene tubes after which they were wrapped in clean polyethylene bags during the sample collection sessions the samples collected were then acidified with ultrapure concentrated hno3 acid 1 v v and stored at 4 c following the kazi et al 2008 procedure the samples were vigorously shaken for 1 min before sub sampling for analysis to ensure a homogeneous suspension 2 3 6 digestion of urine sample the urine samples were digested by adding 1 ml concentrated hno3 acid 70 15 8 m to the aliquot of urine sample previously kept at 4 c for analysis horng et al 2002 to quickly prepare the urine sample microwave digestion is ideal for the process a 5 0 ml sample and 10 0 ml of a 1 1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric 36 11 65 m and nitric acids 5 0 ml conc hcl 5 0 ml conc hno3 was transferred into a 125 ml pressure resistant bottle for digestion the digestion process was carried out at 300 w for 4 min i e to remove any interfering matrix within the samples until the solution became colorless it was then evaporated to dryness before diluting to 25 0 ml with deionized water 2 3 7 digestion of water samples the water samples were digested for heavy metals analysis using the standard procedure aoac 2000 an approximately 100 ml of the acid fixed water sample was measured into a labeled conical flask containing glass pebbles 10 ml concentrated nitric acid was added and heated in the fume cupboard for 30 min digested samples were filtered into pre washed digestion bottles before transported to university of ibadan central laboratory for metal analysis 2 3 8 determination of heavy metals all digested samples were analyzed for selected heavy metals cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb and zn using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 210 211vgp buck scientific e norwalk ct usa parizanganeh et al 2014 also a standard solution for each element was prepared at the concentration range of 0 10 mg l the summary of physical and chemical analyses is presented in table 1 2 4 ethical consideration the ethical approval to carry out the study on the scavengers biological samples was collected from ogun state ministry of health abeokuta ref hprs 381 314 see the supplementary information it should also be noted that the unevenness in the biological samples of the scavengers collected at the dumpsite was solely based on the responsiveness and availability of volunteers to donate their samples this is usually a general challenge for researchers when carrying out scientific investigations or case studies 2 5 quality control quality assurance the urine specimen collection requires a storage system capable of maintaining the optimal temperature at 20 c and keeping it for stability urine samples that were not analyzed during the period were frozen and kept at 20 c and analyzed within one month of collection following the method reported in the past study vimercati et al 2016 all the glassware used in this study were thoroughly washed and then rinsed with deionized water this was followed by subsequent drying at 35 c cooled and rinsed with acetone c3h6o dong et al 2012 onydinma et al 2021 the aas instrument was calibrated with series of standards prepared in 0 10 mg l concentration variation meters were calibrated each sampling day using their respective standards according to the manufacturer s guidelines all reagents used were of analytical grade sigma aldrich chemie gmbh darmstadt germany blank samples were determined to cancel the background contribution of the extracting chemicals and also to estimate the detection limit of the analytical instruments calculated as three times the standard deviation taiwo et al 2014 2021a 2021b kumar et al 2014 jurowski et al 2018 onydinma et al 2021 2 6 data analysis the obtained data were subjected to descriptive mean and standard deviation and inferential

sampling points 2 and 4 which were highly acidic with ph of 5 5 and 4 7 respectively table s1 the average ph value 6 85 0 82 was measured to be within the who standard range of 6 5 8 5 in drinking water who 2017 the high ph values observed in groundwater samples from sampling points 2 and 4 could be due to the high influx of leachates from the dumpsite the ph results showed that 87 of the analyzed water samples were neutral similar to the findings of nirmala and jagath 2013 the temperature was slightly higher than 29 0 c across all the sampling points having the overall mean value of 29 5 0 16 c table s1 the alkalinity value ranged from 0 30 mg l at the 14th sampling point to 2 20 mg l at the 5th sampling point the result shows the average value of alkalinity to be 1 0 mg l according to sa eed and mahmoud 2014 and onydinma et al 2021 the main species that contributed to water alkalinity are bicarbonates phosphates hydroxides and borates lower alkalinity values have less resistance to ph changes while higher alkalinity values have greater resistance to ph changes onydinma et al 2021 the present study showed high variations in the total hardness th levels of the groundwater samples at the vicinity of the dumpsite the 11th 2nd and 5th sampling points were observed to have high th values of 10 00 12 00 and 19 00 mg l respectively it was observed that 67 of the sampling points showed the th values lower than 4 00 mg l with an overall average value of 4 47 5 12 mg l which was within the who recommended value 500 mg l in drinking water islam et al 2016a 2016b lower th may pose negative effects on human health especially malnourished people s health islam et al 2016a 2016b electrical conductivity ec values varied from 14 00 to 370 00 μs cm at sampling points 2 to 7 with the average value of 254 73 90 85 μs cm table s1 the sampling point with the highest value reflects the point with the highest influx of leachate the result indicated a high ec value 250 μs cm which is the permissible threshold the ec values from 50 of the sampling points showed that the water samples were unsuitable for drinking the inflow of ions anions and dissolved solids from the dumpsite leachate into the water body might explain the high levels of ec in the samples on the other hand the total dissolved solids tds followed the ec pattern because tds is approximately the half of the measured ec the mean value of tds was 149 24 60 12 mg l tds measures the combined dissolved contents of all inorganic and organic substances present in a water sample high tds and ec values table s1 were observed in approximately 87 of the water samples high concentrations of ec and tds could be associated with leachate from the dumpsite taiwo et al 2019 3 2 heavy metal concentrations in the water samples the levels of selected heavy metals in water samples at various sampling sites are presented in table 2 cd and cu were observed at the lowest and highest levels at the 1st and 15th sampling points respectively while fe and zn were measured lowest at the 15th sampling point table s2 shows the analysis of variance anova of heavy metals at p 0 05 the heavy metals showed significant differences across the fifteen sampling points this implies that the observed level of each heavy metal varied significantly across the water samples this therefore denotes that exposure to heavy metals through consumption of water would also vary considerably the average concentration of each heavy metal in water samples are shown in fig 2 table 3 shows the pearson s correlation coefficient data of heavy metals in groundwater a moderate correlation 0 446 p 0 01 was observed between cu and pb while a strong correlation 0 899 p 0 01 occurred between cu and cd this showed that the availability of cu would influence both pb and cd and their respective environmental and human induced effects fe has a negatively moderate correlation 0 555 p 0 01 with pb indicating different emission sources while a moderate association correlation 0 538 p 0 01 with zn indicates a similar emission origin pb has a weak positive relationship 0 318 with cd and a negative weak correlation 0 326 p 0 05 with zn the observed metals from the landfill leachate could have accumulative and detrimental effects on the ecology and food chains leading to carcinogenic effects acute toxicity and genotoxicity in humans ozturk et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2014 this is attributed to the fact that leachate can infiltrate into groundwater degrade water quality and be transported from several distances into water bodies this can thus result in acute toxic and genotoxic hazards that impair aquatic lives maqbool et al 2011 it can also cause significant resources to be spent on both the treatment and control of the contamination veli et al 2008 pollution from dumpsite leachate is a significant environmental and public health hazard because its improper handling has a significant negative influence on groundwater widziewicz et al 2012 besides their presence in the soil can also lead to contamination especially by zn fe pb cu and cd kurniawan et al 2006 lead is a bluish grey metal that is abundantly present in the environment due to various anthropogenic activities the disposal of wastes that contain for instance medical equipment batteries paint and dyes production could influence the deposition of pb in the leachate the health impacts of pb are the same despite the route of exposure astdr and 2010 pb toxicities include inference of vitamin d metabolism rise in blood pressure brain damage a decline in fertility in man through sperm damage impairment of proper infant mental development taiwo et al 2010a and b cadmium is often found in phosphate fertilizers producing industries and others engage in its application it is also obtained proximal to metal mining and refining sites waste incineration and disposal sites cadmium binds to albumin and it is transported to the liver upon absorption into the blood cd induced liver damage increases hepatic enzymes astdr and 2010 renal tubule damage is a hallmark of cd toxicity and it is reflected in increased concentrations of biomarkers such as β2 microglobulin glomerular damage may follow with corresponding increased albumin and transferrin levels bernard 2004 the range value for cu in this study 0 005 0 001 to 0 047 0 001 mg l was lower than the amount 0 03 0 44 mg l reported by nirmala and jagath 2013 the levels of fe 1 430 0 017 to 36 333 0 153 mg l and zn 0 887 0 012 to 8 677 0 108 mg l obtained in this study were higher than the values of 1 20 17 60 mg l fe and 0 11 0 58 mg l zn reported in nirmala and jagath 2013 study which appraised leachate characterization and groundwater pollution at a municipal solid waste landfill in gohagoda sri lanka the presence of fe in water makes it colored and may be unfit for domestic use 4 levels of heavy metals in the volunteers nail samples table 4 presents the levels of metals in nail samples cd was below the detection limit in 24 out of the 38 volunteers for nail samples this implies that 63 of the sampled volunteers were free from possible cd contamination nail samples of the 1st 18th and 20th volunteers revealed cd concentrations of 11 07 0 12 20 02 0 03 and 16 02 0 03 mg kg respectively the average level of cd in the nail samples was determined to be 2 13 4 46 mg kg fig 3 this concentration is likely to pose toxicological threats on the volunteers if ingested without proper handwashing levels of cr were quantified in 7 out of the 38 nail samples to be less than 20 00 mg kg high concentrations 144 03 0 03 123 02 0 03 and 152 02 0 03 mg kg of cr were observed in the 5th 34th and 35th nail volunteer samples respectively the average level of cr in the nail samples was 55 66 35 18 mg kg fig 3 this indicated that none of the 38 volunteers were free from possible toxicological effects of cr the levels of pb were below the detection limit in 28 nail samples 74 while the remaining nail samples indicated concentrations between 37 22 0 03 and 358 00 0 00 mg kg in the 19th and 18th sample respectively with an overall average level of 36 58 89 36 mg kg fig 3 levels of co were also observed below the detection limit in 24 nail samples 63 while the remaining 14 nail samples had the metal level ranging from 0 22 0 02 to 32 02 0 03 mg kg in the 25th and 28th nail samples respectively the average level of co in nail samples was 2 86 6 97 mg kg possible toxicological effects from the traces of co were elicited in 36 14 nail samples of the volunteers the average concentrations of cu mn ni and zn were 95 37 452 39 108 47 167 76 156 04 172 91 and 354 34 333 86 mg kg respectively fig 3 the analysis of variance data presented in table s3 in the supplementary information indicated that there was a significant p 0 05 difference across the assessed heavy metals in the 38 nail samples of the volunteers table 5 presents the pearson s correlation coefficients of metals in nail samples cd and pb and cr and mn were observed to be moderately correlated with values of 0 582 and 0 568 respectively at p 0 01 significant level the moderate correlation between the two sets of metals showed possible similar emission sources however cd and co 0 186 p 0 05 and pb and zn 0 248 p 0 05 exhibited weak anti correlation indicating different emission sources of the two metals also cr and zn and co and mn exhibited weak correlations with coefficients of 0 321 and 0 356 at p 0 01 respectively this indicates that the availability of cr and co would weakly increase zn and mn levels respectively the ranges of nail concentrations of zn cd cu and pb observed in this study were higher than the values of 0 59 0 69 12 21 3 82 5 18 and 130 224 mg kg respectively reported by rashed and hossam 2007 in aswan egypt furthermore the mean values of cd cu pb and zn were comparable to the values observed in previous studies such as mortada et al 2002 and samanta et al 2004 yoo et al 2002 documented the corresponding values for cd 0 08 2 1 mg kg cu 0 82 11 30 mg kg pb bdl 13 30 mg kg and zn 2 7 171 mg kg the occurrence of heavy metals in this study corroborated the studies of nowak and chmielnicka 2000 mortada et al 2002 daniel et al 2004 and rashed and hossam 2007 in which human nails were used as bio indicators for metal cd cu pb zn accumulation the studies recommended the metals as suitable fingerprints for metals pollution identification and chronic exposure study 4 1 levels of heavy metals in the volunteers urine samples cd concentrations in 11 urine samples were below the detection limit table 6 and less than 0 05 mg l in the remaining samples 27 samples while cr levels were less than 0 70 mg l in addition except for the 28th urine sample pb 0 77 mg l all samples tested for pb were observed to be below the detection limit in all the volunteers nail samples precisely 50 of the urine samples have co levels below the detection limit with the highest concentration 1 03 mg l observed in the 33rd sample the average concentrations of ni zn and mn varied from 0 64 mg l in the 38th urine sample to 3 59 mg l in the 31st urine sample 0 09 mg l in the 5th urine sample to 4 82 mg l in the 9th urine sample and 0 04 in the 2nd 4th 5th 6th and 36th urine samples to 9 76 mg l in the 33rd urine sample respectively the levels of the observed heavy metals were generally lower in the urine than in the nail samples the average concentrations of heavy metals in urine samples are presented in fig 4 the distribution pattern followed the decreasing order of ni zn mn co cr pb cd the analysis of variance data established the significance p 0 05 of some heavy metals across the volunteers urine samples table s4 in the supplementary information this indicates that the determined heavy metals varied with possible toxicological health effects across the samples the levels of heavy metals documented in the urine samples from the study area are comparable to the past work of mahugija et al 2018 in school children from selected industrial and non industrial areas of dar es salaam tanzania the presence of heavy metals in urine samples is an attractive matrix that has been widely applied for estimating exposure tsalev and zaprianov 1988 analysis of urine reflects the total body intake of the various heavy metals better than other biological fluids clarkson and magos 2006 table 7 presents the pearson s correlation coefficients of metals observed in the scavengers urine samples cd and pb showed significant weak negative relationship r 0 187 p 0 05 while cd and co indicated moderate 0 428 p 0 05 and 0 01 pb was weakly correlated with co 0 231 p 0 05 and ni 0 205 p 0 05 co was strongly correlated with ni 0 839 p 0 01 indicating a possible emission origin the observed heavy metals in the urine samples of the dumpsite workers could have been from scavengers exposure through inhalation of dust in air or particles generated by burning materials and or ingestion of metal contaminated water and food and dermal contact in nails morais et al 2012 the presence of the selected heavy metals at varying concentrations in water human nails and urine could be attributed to environmental exposure hyoi et al 1986 and golow and kwaansa ansah 1994 revealed that increased heavy metal levels in the environmental samples could be associated with their dispersion in the air and the dumping of unused materials which the water sources and volunteers might have been exposed to similarly mortada et al 2000 2001 2002 showed that the measurement of metals in environmental media could be of considerable use for diagnosing exposure bergoni and borella 1989 cabez 1991 nowak and chmielnicka 2000 have previously buttressed the associations among cd cu pb and zn however the variations in the different sample types water nails and urine might propose their varying concentrations in the environmental media high levels of the detected heavy metals indicated the possibility of acute and chronic occupational exposure gerhardsson et al 2002 the statistical p 0 05 differences observed in the heavy metals across the sampling points and volunteers corroborate the assertion of slotink et al 2005 4 2 principal component analysis of heavy metals in urine and nail samples table 8 shows the varimax principal component analysis pca of water quality parameters the pca indicated three components factors that accounted for 70 of the total variance the first factor which explained 42 of the total variance has high loadings for mn co cr fe and zn suggesting emissions from industries the second factor was significant for cd and pb and explained 18 of the total variance this component is suspected to emanate from the disposal of battery waste as ni cr and zn characterized factor three which explained only 10 of the dataset the probable source for this component is vehicular emissions taiwo et al 2014 4 3 health risk assessment the health risk assessment data for the average daily dose add of heavy metals in groundwater consumed by adults children and infants are presented in table 9 fe and zn were the most dosed heavy metals consumed by adults in groundwater the adult that consumed 2 l would dose 2 11 2 01 mg kg day bodyweight of fe and 0 35 0 26 mg kg day bodyweight of zn a child who drank 1 l of groundwater daily would dose 1 41 1 34 mg kg day fe and 0 24 0 17 mg kg day zn which is about three times higher than that of adults an infant of lower bodyweight that ingested less quantity of water compared to an adult of higher bodyweight would take more of these heavy metals than an adult taiwo and awomeso 2017 the order of the adds of heavy metals in the assessed water samples were fe zn pb cu cd the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi values of heavy metals in groundwater samples are shown in table 10 the hqs of pb cd for children and infants cu fe and zn in groundwater samples were greater than the permissible limit of 1 0 thereby establishing the non carcinogenic adverse health effects obiri et al 2016 cu fe and zn are vital elements necessary for proper body metabolism however at high doses fe can result in haemochromatosis a disease characterized by liver cirrhosis impaired pancreatic function and hepatocellular carcinoma taiwo and awomeso 2017 taiwo et al 2021a 2021b other adverse effects of fe include gastric upset nausea constipation heart disease stomach pain vomiting diarrhea bloody vomit and stool dehydration and lethargy due to damage to internal organs particularly the brain and the liver yu et al 2018 oral intake of extremely high doses of zinc above 300 mg zn day may cause nausea vomiting pain cramps and diarrhea plum et al 2010 high intake of cu can be harmful to children and adults while chronic exposure elicits irritation to the eyes mouth and nose and can cause vomiting dizziness nausea diarrhea headaches stomach cramps liver and kidney damage and even death atsdr 2004 cd and pb are heavy metals with no known physiological benefits to the human body there has been increased interest in pb because of its ability to cause various toxicological effects in kidney liver and blood and initiate cardiovascular damage and cancer in humans naghipour et al 2017 balli and leghouchi 2018 pb toxicity may result in numerous toxic effects including reduced intelligence damage to the kidney neurological disorder and gastrointestinal tract taiwo and awomeso 2017 extensive exposure to cd has been linked with lung renal and prostate cancer bone diseases kidney failure and anemia balli and leghouchi 2018 fig 5 presents the contributions of heavy metals to non carcinogenic adverse effects in groundwater fe indicated the largest portion 99 64 to the total disease burden while other heavy metals contributed less than 0 4 in contrast to the present study the past studies have shown cr as the major contributor to non carcinogenic adverse effects in groundwater from southwestern nigeria ayantobo et al 2014 ayedun et al 2015 taiwo and awomeso 2017 unfortunately the present study has not determined cr in groundwater samples 4 4 the cancer risk of heavy metals in groundwater the cancer risk cr values of pb and cd in drinking water are presented in table 11 higher cr values greater than the acceptable limit of 1 0 10 4 were observed in groundwater for cd and pb children and infants this therefore indicates probable lifetime cancer development the crs of heavy metals exposure by infants children and adults in groundwater were also greater than the permissible limit of 1 0 10 4 the cr data showed that infants were mostly at significant risk followed by the children the cr of metals in groundwater samples were 114 76 and 14 times higher than the acceptable limit for infants children and adults the cr values of cd and pb obtained in this study were lower

dumpsite could pose major health threats to the neighboring communities and the scavengers consequently urgent actions should be taken by the environmentalists and the policymakers to combat the negative impacts associated with the activities of scavenging around the dumpsite though scavenging activities at dumpsites should be discouraged however for the benefits of those who wish to continue in the business the use of personal protective equipment should be echoed to them furthermore hand dug wells boreholes and other drinking water sources should be situated far from the dumpsite areas environmental stakeholders should introduce occupational health and safety training programmes to help the scavengers understand the health risks associated with solid wastes sorting without an

11808,this study aims to synthesize activated magnetic biochar using a single step approach and explore solute solvent mechanisms for removing hexavalent chromium cr vi from the aqueous solution agricultural waste rice husk was pre treated in iron chloride and zinc chloride solution and pyrolyzed at 500 c obtained activated magnetic biochar were characterized by sem eds ftir xrd vsm and bet to analyze physicochemical features adsorption experiments indicated that activated magnetic biochar achieved an adsorption capacity of 9 97 mg g with removal efficiency of 99 7 for an initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l at ph 2 and 351 k in aqueous solutions cr vi break down to hcro 4 cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions however at low ph 1 4 hcro 4 ion attributes electrostatic force of attraction which encourages higher adsorption of cr vi ions overall batch experiments demonstrated that initial ph cr vi concentration biochar dose temperature and co existing ions significantly affected the cr vi adsorption using activated magnetic biochar therefore electrostatic interaction and ion exchange dominate cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar at low ph experiments showed heterogeneous non linear monolayer and spontaneous sorption which were validated via temkin isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic for cr vi ions as a result cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar occurred due to chemisorption on heterogeneous non linear monolayers mainly governed by electrostatic attraction and ion exchange mechanisms due to enriched oxygen containing surface groups with activated magnetic biochar in terms of thermodynamics the adsorption process for cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar was endothermic and spontaneous as a positive δs value indicates randomness during cr vi adsorption at the solution solute interface in contrast the negative value of δg 15855 3 kj mol at 351 k shows that adsorption was spontaneous overall the activated magnetic biochar synthesized from rice husk was more efficient than raw biochar in removing cr vi ions from the aqueous solution graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated magnetic biochar adsorbent hexavalent chromium adsorption 1 introduction chromium cr derived from the greek word chroma is the 24st most abundant element occurring naturally in trivalent and hexavalent forms on the earth s crust abdel sabour 2007 lunk 2015 barnhart 1997 cr is most commonly used in mining leather tanning cement dyeing electroplating and corrosive paint industries hlihor et al 2009 coetzee et al 2020 anthropogenic actions and industrialization are the primary reasons behind cr contamination in the environment which can enter the human body mainly through drinking water ertani et al 2017 robertson 1975 or food sykuła zając and pawlak 2012 rowbotham et al 2000 subsequently cr creates adverse effects like ulcers skin dermatitis cancer and even causes death chatterjee et al 2015 due to the high mobility and toxicity of the hexavalent form of chromium cr vi is considered a primary source of concern pagilla and canter 1999 international agency for research on cancer iarc identified cr vi as one of the potent carcinogenic elements iarc 1987 iarc 1980 cr iii vi removal methods from the aqueous or soil environment include filtration coagulation sedimentation electrodialysis photocatalyst ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane filtration adsorption etc golder et al 2007 li et al 2009 babu and gupta 2008 zhang et al 2020a the adsorption method is one of the most promising techniques in recent times because it is cost effective and eco friendly and can efficiently remove cr ions or other organic pollutants and heavy metals from wastewater and contaminated water benjamin et al 1996 roy et al 2018 ghosh et al 2019 several adsorbents have been developed and used for example activated carbon babel and kurniawan 2004 rai et al 2016 fang et al 2007 wanees et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 paper waste sludge nguyen et al 2021 snail shell derived biosorbent vu et al 2019 chitosan zhang et al 2020b schmuhl et al 2001 polymers based composites jia et al 2022 green hull nasseh et al 2017 wheat straw song et al 2016 eucalyptus sawdust zhang et al 2018a carbon nanotubes chen et al 2018 aslam et al 2022 silica shankar et al 2022 gao et al 2022 starch dang et al 2022 resins marcu et al 2021 cotton zhong et al 2022 biochar zhang et al 2020a van et al 2019 liu et al 2020a sinha et al 2022 etc for cr vi removal via adsorption process besides raw adsorbents such as neem leaves babu and gupta 2008 wheat straw eupatorium adenophorium crofton weed song et al 2016 bentonite wanees et al 2013 almond hull nasseh et al 2017 have also been used to remove cr vi from the wastewater however biochar is as considered carbon rich biosorbents which are being produced via pyrolyzing biomass in the temperature range of 300 700 c in the absence of oxygen zhang et al 2020a wani et al 2022 the main factors responsible for the inherent and unique characteristics of biochar are their feedstock types and pyrolysis conditions biochar preparation is cost efficient as several feedstocks are abundant and locally available in most places zhang et al 2019 it possesses inherent properties like high cation exchange capacity specific surface area unique pore structure and rich oxygen containing functional groups zhang et al 2018a modification of biochar by chemical or physical processes dong et al 2017 metal impregnation and magnetization li et al 2020 xin et al 2017 activation braghiroli et al 2018 etc can further increase the functional groups associated with biochar surfaces along with enhancement in their surface area and pore structure volpe et al 2018 sakhiya et al 2020 wani et al 2022 these modifications thus help in the effective removal of contaminants previously biochar was derived from various biomass such as wheat straw ali et al 2020 sugarcane bagasse bai et al 2021 badam shell jia et al 2021 peanut hull han et al 2016 douglas fir herath et al 2021 etc was performed for cr vi adsorption however there is a need to explore efficient and locally available waste biomass that can be potentially used as biochar to remove cr vi ions rice husk is significantly available in bulk as feedstock material for contaminant remediation from the environment synthesizing biochar from rice husk results in a higher o c ratio which represents abundant functional groups onto biochar with negative surface charges so the adsorption capacity for positively charged heavy metals is relatively strong such as cr vi ions from contaminated environments sanka et al 2020 more recently biochar has been modified as activated magnetic biochar in which activation and magnetization are performed simultaneously resulting in a high potential for wastewater treatment yin et al 2018 shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 few studies have reported remediation of heavy metals using activated magnetic biochar yin et al 2018 shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 sharma et al 2022 this type of biochar modification enhances the properties of biochar as compared to the activated or magnetized biochar alone for example activated magnetic biochar has successfully removed 17β estradiol and cu ii from the wastewater activation and magnetization were done in a single step method this helped to improve the specific surface area enhance the pore structure and increase the attached functional groups yin et al 2018 several studies have reported that activation and magnetization of biochar have shown significant adsorption capacities for cr vi ions sun et al 2021 medha et al 2021 guo et al 2021 sinha et al 2022 however to our knowledge no such study has been documented for cr vi removal using single step synthesized activated magnetic biochar in addition to further improve cr vi adsorption performance activated magnetic biochar derived from rice husk which might show the potential for strong adsorption has not been explored and reported yet in this research novel and eco friendly activated magnetic biochar was proposed to synthesize from locally available agricultural waste rice husk to remove cr vi ions from the contaminated water the current study attempts to evaluate the feasibility of cr vi ions adsorption onto cost effective single step synthesized activated magnetic biochar the objectives of this study are a to analyze physical and chemical characteristics of synthesized raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar and b to investigate cr vi removal efficiency under the influence of ph initial concentration biochar dose contact time temperature and co existing anions using batch experiments finally adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic behaviour were also performed for cr vi removal using activated magnetic biochar and the adsorption mechanism for cr vi ions was explored and proposed 2 materials and method this section outlines the chemicals and equipment used for general laboratory operations along with their protocol to determine equilibrium sorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis dealing with the removal of cr vi using rice husk derived raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar 2 1 material and reagents analytical grade chemicals such as ferric chloride loba india zinc chloride merck india potassium

magnetic biochar rice husk biomass was washed 4 5 times with ultrapure deionized water and dried at 80 c for 24 h rice husk was pyrolyzed at 500 c for 2 h to produce the raw biochar the procedure for synthesizing the activated magnetic biochar was followed by yin et al 2018 in brief the fe zn solution was prepared by adding 2 g fecl3 6h2o and 2 g zncl2 in 500 ml ultrapure water and mixed uniformly 10 g washed and dried rice husk biomass was added to the fe zn solution and sonicated for 2 h and then left for 24 h after drying soaked biomass at 80 c in the hot air oven fe zn soaked biomass was pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace icon instrument company india at 500 c for 2 h to produce the activated magnetic biochar subsequently both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar were ball milled for 4 h at 500 rpm using a zirconium ball mill retsch germany to remove excess zn particles activated magnetic biochars were washed with deionized water until the neutral ph 7 0 0 1 achieved and then dried at 80 c in the hot air oven further similar approach was adopted to wash and dry raw biochar after ball milling 2 3 characterization of activated magnetic biochar scanning electron microscopy sem demicro orchid india equipped with electron energy dispersive x ray edx edax inc usa analysis was performed to identify the surface morphology and elemental composition of the raw and activated magnetic biochar similarly the structural and chemical characterization of raw and activated magnetic biochar was carried out using fourier transform infrared ftir spectra agilent technologies usa and x ray diffraction rigaku corporation japan respectively the magnetic potential was determined by vibrating sample magnetometer quantum design versalab usa for the raw and activated magnetic biochar bet surface area for raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar was analyzed by micrometric asap 2020 surface area analyzer on 0 15 g samples out grassed at 250 c for 12 h at 10 3 torr 2 4 analytical method for cr vi stock solution preparation and quantification hexavalent chromium cr vi stock solution was prepared via dissolving potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in ultra pure water i e 100 mg l cr vi stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0 28 g of potassium dichromate in 1 l of deionized water huang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 phosphoric acid and 1 5 diphenyl carbazide indicator were used as per astm d1687 17 using photometric diphenyl carbazide test method to detect cr vi concentration astm 2017 naoh and hcl were used to adjust the ph of the solution 0 025 g l of 1 5 diphenyl carbazide dpc was prepared in acetone and stored in a brown bottle inside the refrigerator at 2 c while not in use phosphoric acid was prepared in 1 1 ratio i e 20 ml of acid was mixed with 20 ml of ultrapure water after that for detection purposes 2 ml dpc and 5 ml phosphoric acid were added to chromium solution and kept for 15 min to develop a reddish purple color then quantified by following the colorimetric method in the presence of dpc using uv vis spectrophotometer cary100 agilent technologies usa at 540 nm wavelength astm 2017 2 5 batch sorption experiments the adsorption process of cr vi

sorption experiments were examined under the influence of contact time ph initial cr vi concentration biochar dosages experimental temperature and co existing ions table 1 for the batch sorption experiment the initial cr vi concentration was kept in the range of 1 10 mg l and the biochar doses in the range of 0 5 2 5 g l at varying ph 2 3 5 7 and 9 for 120 min in an aqueous solution at room temperature 303 k further based on the above parameters the effect of experimental temperatures 303 k 323 k 340 k and 351 k was investigated after optimizing the batch sorption experiments with 10 mg l initial cr vi concentration 1 g l biochar dose and 120 min duration the co existing ion effect was investigated by mixing cr vi with nacl na3po4 na2so4 or no3 salt solutions in 1 1 vol ratio at optimal ph with known quantities of biochar dose and cr vi concentration for 120 min each set of sorption experiments was performed in triplicate and their mean value and standard deviation as error bars were presented in the paper for better precision and accuracy the removal efficiency of cr vi and adsorption capacity q t of biochar were estimated using the following equations 1 removal

mass of biochar 33 8 and 32 67 wt yield of rice husk raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar was achieved after slow pyrolysis sem analysis reveals the shape and surface morphology of the biochar particles fig 1 a and b shows sem images for raw and activated magnetic biochar which indicate that the biochar particles possess flake like morphology and porous structure sem images of activated magnetic biochar also adorn flake like structures and particles agglomerated with fe3o4 nanoparticles dehkhoda et al 2014 kumar et al 2021 as shown structural fusion in fig 1b edx measurements were carried out to investigate the elemental analysis of raw and activated magnetic biochar edx analysis confirmed the presence of high carbon oxygen and silicon in the synthesized raw biochar fig 1c the presence of iron content onto activated magnetic biochar indicated the magnetization of biochar i e agglomerated with fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 1d similar kinds of structural fusion were observed in activated magnetic biochar synthesized from rice and cotton straw shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 xrd analysis for raw biochar showed regular diffraction peaks which indicated that the carbon matrix for raw biochar is amorphous in nature xrd performed on the activated magnetic biochar validated the associated crystalline phase and wide angle spectra patterns fig 2 precise measurement showed that the peaks were centered at 18 11 29 92 35 08 36 92 42 69 53 28 and 62 32 which was confirmed from the xrd pattern of activated magnetic biochar due to crystalline fe species of hematite fe2o3 and magnetite activated magnetic biochar showed clear distinctive peaks after alteration with fe feo and other peaks were related to zno and znfe2o4 this indicates that the fe and zn have been successfully loaded into the biochar during activation and magnetization detailed structural characteristics of activated magnetic biochar are explained in the supplementary information section s1 fig 3 shows the ftir spectra in which characteristic peaks for functional groups such as oh 3440 cm 1 ch 802 and 2942 cm 1 cc 1569 1620 cm 1 and co 1080 cm 1 were commonly observed for both raw and activated magnetic biochar tang et al 2016 the prominent peak at 1585 cm 1 in the raw biochar spectrum corresponding to cc vibration shifted slightly for the activated magnetic biochar about 1618 cm 1 due to iron and zinc modification tang et al 2015 fe o stretch vibration was centered at wavelength of 673 cm 1 showing the successful magnetization of the activated magnetic biochar devi and saroha 2014 magnetization of adsorbents is useful for wastewater treatment because of their ease of recycling and recovery from aqueous solutions santhosh et al 2020 chen et al 2011 reddy and lee 2014 zhang et al 2018b at room temperature magnetic hysteresis was investigated at magnetic fields of 30 000 a m for raw and activated magnetic biochar fig 4 raw biochar has no magnetism whereas activated magnetic biochar has a considerable magnetization value 8 69 emu g because of fe3o4 particles agglomerated with the biochar surface fe3o4 particles adorning the biochar surface are magnetically active which improves the characteristics of magnetic biochar as evident from sem eds analysis a similar range of magnetization was also reported using magnetic biochar for cr vi adsorption santhosh et al 2020 bet surface areas were 96 1 and 134 6 m2 g for rice husk raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar respectively 3 2 influence of contact time on cr vi adsorption adsorption efficiency of cr vi using both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar increase with increasing residence contact time in the aqueous solution influence of contact time on cr vi removal was performed with cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and fixed biochar dose of 0 5 g l using raw and activated magnetic biochar at ph 7 as depicted in fig 5 cr vi adsorption equilibrium was reached in 120 min approximately with removal efficiencies of 13 and 21 for raw and activated magnetic biochar respectively which were calculated using equation 1 at the same time it was estimated that activated magnetic biochar possesses a sorption capacity of 4 39 mg g though the sorption capacity for raw biochar was only 2 7 mg g which was calculated using equation 2 these results conclude that the maximum concentration of cr vi ions was adsorbed onto biochar surfaces within 120 min due to the availability of vacant active sites it has been observed that both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar possess slow adsorption of cr vi ions for ph 7 at 303 k the removal efficiency was observed to increase less with respect to residence time because of electrostatic attraction between cr vi ions and biochar surface in the aqueous solution 3 3 effect of ph the ph of the solution affects the potential charges of active sites present on the adsorbent zhanqi et al 2007 and affects the solubility of metal ion s speciation mohan et al 2015 hence the removal efficiency of cr vi onto raw and activated magnetic biochar was investigated at varying ph in the range 2 9 using equation 1 these results showed high cr vi removal efficiency using both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar obtained at low ph 4 and relatively low cr vi removal efficiency at high ph 5 fig 6 depicts that the maximum removal efficiencies were 46 and 50 for raw and activated magnetic biochar respectively for an initial concentration of 10 mg l biochar dosage of 0 5 g l and ph 2 at room temperature therefore using equation 2 it was estimated that the adsorption capacities were observed 9 2 mg g and 10 0 mg g at ph 2 and biochar dosages of 0 5 g l for raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar respectively activated magnetic biochar has shown maximum zeta potential at ph less than 4 due to which adsorption capacity can reach maximum for cr vi ions yin et al 2018 shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 previously a similar outcome was observed with cr vi ions adsorption on coffee biochar modified with polyphenol formaldehyde and polyphenol acetaldehyde mulani et al 2013 liang et al 2020 additionally li et al 2014 stated that a decrease in ph increases the adsorption efficiency due to improved electrostatic attraction similar results were found in the case of cr vi adsorption using biochar or nanoparticles at lower ph such as magnetic eucalyptus leaf residue biochar sugar beet tailing biochar and mgo modified sugarcane harvest biochar wang et al 2014 yuan et al 2009 dong et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 at lower ph values 3 furthermore in previous research work it has been observed that cr vi can easily be reduced to cr iii this was another potential factor for the maximum chromium removal at ph 2 verma et al 2006 choudhary et al 2017 functionalized biochar i e activated magnetic biochar possesses significant functional groups which encourage optimal adsorption of cr vi ions onto biochar surfaces the surface area of activated magnetic biochar was found higher than raw biochar therefore the surface area also plays a significant role in the removal of cr vi ions from contaminated water in the above ph study activated magnetic biochar shows higher adsorption capacity compared with raw biochar therefore for further experiments only activated magnetic biochar has been considered to perform the influence of activated magnetic biochar dosages initial cr vi concentration temperature and co existing ions adsorption analysis 3 4 effect of biochar dosages and initial cr vi concentration biochar dose is an essential factor for regulating the degree of solute removal from an aqueous medium the concentration gradient of the initial cr vi concentration and mass transfer in the aqueous and solid phases are the driving force for cr vi ions removal using activated magnetic biochar therefore the effect of activated magnetic biochar dosages in the range of 0 5 2 5 g l was tested in this study for the fixed initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l at ph 2 and 303 k temperature as shown in fig 7 a after using equation 1 it was noted that cr vi removal efficiency increases from 50 to 65 at ph 2 with increased biochar dosage from 0 5 g l to 1 g l for activated magnetic biochar due to large available active sites onto biochar surfaces though the removal efficiency became constant for 1 5 g l to 2 5 g l biochar dosages due to a decrease in the mass transfer of cr vi ions at the solid liquid interface i e decrease in the concentration of cr vi ions adsorption per unit of biochar mass at constant cr vi concentration using equation 2 it was estimated that the adsorption capacities decreased from 10 0 mg g to 2 61 mg g with an increase in biochar dosages from 0 5 mg g to 2 5 g l in the aqueous solution hence the increased biochar dosages created the saturation of active sites on the activated magnetic biochar which caused a decrease in the adsorption capacity similar results have been reported with cr vi adsorption on ferric chloride coated mango kernel powder van et al 2019 akram et al 2017 initial cr vi concentration also influenced the cr vi adsorption in an aqueous solution using activated magnetic biochar the initial cr vi concentrations were varied from 1 to 10 mg l at the fixed biochar dosage of 1 g l ph 2 and 303 k temperature fig 7b depicts the influence of varying initial cr vi concentrations on the removal efficiency of cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar the results showed decrease in cr vi ions adsorption with an increase in cr vi concentrations at a fixed biochar dose thus the removal efficiency was reduced from 99 9 to 65 with increased initial concentration from 1 to 10 mg l using equation 1 due to less available active sites onto the biochar surface for adsorption of cr vi ions however with an increase in the initial cr vi concentration of 1 10 mg l it was estimated that the adsorption capacities also increased from 0 1 to 6 5 mg g onto activated magnetic biochar using equation 2 cr vi ions diffusion took longer to reach the activated magnetic biochar surface resulting in an improvement in removal efficiency as the initial cr vi concentration was reduced from 10 to 7 mg l similar results were observed in other studies using different biochar types such as rice husk and tea wastes biochars and modified magnetic biochar prepared from raw corn con for adsorption of cr vi van et al 2019 shakya and agarwal 2019 khalil et al 2020 3 5 influence of temperature on cr vi adsorption the experimental temperature indicates the variation of individual sorption mechanisms and affects the mobility and reactivity of cr vi ions the effect of temperature on cr vi adsorption was performed for the temperature range of 303 351 k at ph 2 1 g l biochar dose and contact time of 120 min using equation 1 it was noted that the removal efficiency increased from 65 07 to 99 78 with an increase in temperature from 323 to 351 k fig 8 at 1 g l of biochar dose and 10 mg l cr vi concentration using equation 2 it was estimated that the adsorption capacity of the activated magnetic biochar increased from 6 5 to 9 9 mg g by increasing the temperature from 303 to 351 k increased cr vi adsorption at high temperatures might be due to the interactions between molecules at a high temperature which ultimately influences the mobility and transfer of the molecules wang et al 2016 3 6 influence of co existing ions the effects of interfering ions such as cl no 3 so 4 2 and po 4 3 were investigated by adding 10 mg l of their respective salts nacl nano3 na2so4 and na3po4 with 10 mg l of initial cr vi concentration at ph 2 and 303 k temperature using an activated magnetic biochar dose of 1 mg l as a result the removal efficiency of cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar was 65 07 at the experimental conditions stated above whereas a minor decrease in cr vi removal efficiency was observed in the presence of anions such as cl 64 3 po 4 3 64 0 so 4 2 63 2 and no 3 62 6 adsorption of cr vi ions had negligible influence due to the co existence of ions in the aqueous solution fig s2 3 7 adsorption isotherms modeling adsorption isotherm describes the diffusion of the adsorbate cr vi ions with the adsorbent activated magnetic biochar langmuir isotherm explains non linear monolayer sorption onto homogenous surfaces without interfering among the adsorbed particles in this model the equilibrium condition explains the correlation between the solute adsorbed onto the adsorbent surfaces and the initial concentration of

interacts with adsorbed molecules temkin isotherm model explains the heat of sorption i e sorbent solute interactions the heat of sorption of solute is decreased linearly with surface coverage where the uniform distribution of binding sites defines the solute sorption besides dubinin radushkevich isotherm explains gaussian energy distribution onto heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces mainly

adsorption capacity obtained using langmuir isotherm model for the activated magnetic biochar assumes that adsorption occurs at homogeneous adsorption sites onto the activated magnetic biochar surface

1 using equation 7 has been shown in table 2 dubinin radushkevich isotherm analysis for cr vi ions showed poor fitting r2 0 27 with activated magnetic biochar as shown in table 2 overall temkin model shows uniform distribution of solute solvent onto binding sites and is considered the best fitting model for cr vi adsorption using activated magnetic biochar 3 8 adsorption kinetics models kinetics models explain the cr vi adsorption mechanism onto activated magnetic biochar the kinetic model named the pseudo first order model recognized as the lagergren model describes the sorption kinetics under the influence of contact time the pseudo second order kinetic explains that the chemical reaction rate directly relates to active sites available on the biochar surface however weber morris intraparticle diffusion kinetic model interprets the internal adsorption on adsorbent in an aqueous solution the equation for the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion

for the pseudo first order the value of k 1 0 034545 qe 3 739383 and r 2 0 9054 were calculated by the analysis of the linear form of pseudo first order kinetic using equation 10 as shown values in table 3 the pseudo second order kinetic is based on the mass transfer dynamics the value of k 2 0 019917 q e 10 34126 and r 2 0 9994 equated with the linear form of pseudo second order kinetic using equation 11 as shown in table 3 intraparticle diffusion kinetic evaluated k ipd c and r 2 values as 0 4252 mg g min1 2 5 92 and 0 84 respectively for cr vi ions adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar using equation 12 among all three kinetic models pseudo second order kinetic r 2 0 9994 was the best fitted for cr vi sorption dynamics onto activated magnetic biochar the calculated q e mg g from pseudo second order kinetic was closer to the experimental q e than pseudo first order kinetic r2 0 9054 the findings of the present study are similar to cr vi adsorption using wastewater sludge zhang et al 2013 according to the pseudo second order model the adsorption is regulated by the amount of cr vi ions at the surface of activated magnetic biochar and the rate limiting step may be a chemical adsorption process 3 9 thermodynamic adsorption analysis thermodynamic adsorption isotherm was performed to determine the adsorption feasibility of cr vi ions onto activated magnetic biochar the thermodynamic constants such as free energy δg standard entropy δs and enthalpy δh determine the adsorption feasibility by using the equilibrium constant and the temperature the equation is given by sun et al 2021 huang et al 2016 13 l o g k e δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r 1 t 14 k c c a e c e 15 δ g δ h t δ s where δs is a standard entropy kj mol k δg denotes free energy kj mol δh is enthalpy kj mol k c is equilibrium constant t is the corresponding temperature k c e and c ae indicate equilibrium concentration of the aqueous solution and adsorbent mg l respectively and r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k the effect of the temperature was examined at different temperatures 303 k 323 k 340 k and 351 k using the above equations 13 15 at ph 2 10 mg l initial cr vi concentration 1 g l biochar dose and 120 min duration the thermodynamic parameters δh δs and δg explain whether cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar is exothermic or endothermic in nature table 4 shows the value of δh δs and δg calculated from linear regression using equation 15 the positive value for δh shows that cr vi removal onto activated magnetic biochar was endothermic adsorption using equation 15 the δs value is also positive indicating an improvement in randomness during cr vi adsorption at the solution solute interface the negative value of δg 15855 3 kj mol at 351 k shows that adsorption was spontaneous similar results were observed in cr vi removal using b cyclodextrin chitosan modified biochars huang et al 2016 sewage sludge and nano zero valent iron magnetic biochar liu et al 2020b fes and chitosan modified soy sauce residue yang et al 2021 tio2 modified rosin biochar yousaf et al 2018 and many other 3 10 proposed mechanism and comparative cr vi removal using activated magnetic biochar with other biochar adsorbents cr vi dissociates into different forms in the aqueous solution like hcro 4 cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions gupta et al 2013 whereas hcro 4 is the predominant form that persists in an aqueous solution at low ph 3 wang et al 2014 ekanayake et al 2022 with a rise in ph values i e from acidic to alkaline medium hcro 4 converts into cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions hence hcro 4 is more strongly adsorbed than cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions yuan et al 2009 biochar possesses various oxygen containing functional groups for example oh cooh cho coc etc which encourages adsorption of cr vi ions in the ph range of 1 4 kahraman and pehlivan 2017 wang et al 2019a dehghani et al 2021 rasaie et al 2021 dehgani et al 2020 at ph 1 4 the active form of cr vi is absorbed on hcro 4 ions and attributed to an electrostatic force of attraction due to the existence of several functional groups such as cooh2 nh4 oh2 etc onto biochar surfaces brito et al 1997 availability of h ions and cr 6 or cr vi ions at neutral ph competes themselves for active sorption sites on the activated magnetic biochar considering presence of oxygen based functional groups optimal cr vi removal was observed at low ph which means electrostatic attraction increases at the acidic condition overall electrostatic interaction and ion exchange are major governing mechanisms for cr vi adsorption onto the biochar materials as depicted in fig 9 babu and gupta 2008 braghiroli et al 2018 bishnoi et al 2004 wu et al 2017 qu et al 2021 hadjmohammadi et al 2011 ekanayake et al 2022 this explains ph dependent behavior of cr vi adsorption by activated magnetic biochar at low ph table 5 shows the comparative removal efficiency of cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar with respect to other biochar based adsorbents it indicates that activation of biochar improves biochar properties and can increase their adsorption potential for example zncl2 activated biochar derived from sea buckthorn stone biomass enhances the surface area and the active sites resulting in removal efficiency of 98 for cr vi ions guo et al 2021 similarly iron and 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane biochar composite derived from rice straw were prepared by medha et al 2021 biochar treated with iron and 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane improved removal capacity by 100 59 mg g the results demonstrated that hydrothermal chemical treatment improved physicochemical properties such as surface area functional group and silica content magnetic biochar made from melia azedarach wood was used in another study to remove cr vi ions pre treating the biomass with fe c resulted in the production of biochar impregnation increased removal capacity to 25 27 mg g 99 8 at ph 3 initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and biochar dose of 5 g l the findings revealed that impregnation aids in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii ions zhang et al 2018b magnetic biochar has been readily and easily separable with higher adsorption capacity and recyclable among different kinds of biochar chen et al 2011 reddy and lee 2014 magnetic biochar synthesis includes several methods such as coordinating biochar with fe2 fe3 ions with thermal treatment loading of iron oxide or magnetization followed by impregnation sun et al 2021 wang et al 2019b qin et al 2020 wen et al 2022 van et al 2019 made magnetic biochar with raw corncob at a 20 w w impregnation ratio the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 25 94 mg g at ph 3 with an initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and a biochar dose of 4 g l the experiment revealed that higher removal occurred in an acidic ph medium the impregnation demonstrated that the biochar attained high magnetization and maintained its magnetic properties at ph 3 yielding a higher removal capacity of 25 94 mg g prepared magnetic biochar by pre treating the biomass with fe2 fe3 ions solution which possesses improved magnetic properties with the removal efficiency of 95 27 for cr vi ions the characteristics of biochar and the efficiency of cr vi removal were also influenced by the peak temperature of pyrolysis and the particle size higher temperatures increased the magnetic properties of biochar and its ability to adsorb cr vi ions however activated magnetic biochar synthesized in this study has shown maximum removal efficiency for low cr vi concentration range 4 conclusions biochar applications in cr vi removal have been considered an efficient and low investment approach in this research work adsorption of cr vi ions has been performed using raw and activated magnetic biochar via batch experiments under the influence of ph initial cr vi concentration biochar doses and temperature the equilibrium sorption for cr vi ions gained an adsorption capacity of 9 97 mg g using activated magnetic biochar at ph 2 for 10 mg l of cr vi concentration and 351 k maximum adsorption using activated magnetic biochar was observed at high temperatures due to molecules interaction at high temperature influences the mobility and transfer of molecules in aqueous solutions besides increased activated magnetic biochar dose also increases cr vi removal because of primarily available active sites interestingly the co existing ions show no interference with cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar temkin isotherm and pseudo second order have been preferred as best fitted isotherm and kinetics for sorption equilibrium analysis cr vi removal efficiency also increased with an increase in temperature i e the negative value of δg which shows that the adsorption of cr vi was endothermic and spontaneous the thermodynamic adsorption analysis showed the positive value of δh 90498 97 kj mol i e endothermic adsorption of cr vi ions onto activated magnetic biochar consequently the positive value of δs 303 0035 kj mol directs that increase in randomness at the solute solution interface during cr vi adsorption was significant the study on cr vi adsorption using activated magnetic biochar was efficient and low cost technique furthermore single step magnetization and activation reduced time and cost investment this investigation summarized comprehensive understanding of different modified biochars synthesized in various steps applied to remove cr vi concentration compared with single step synthesized activated magnetic biochar which even performed for lower concentrations that can play as a guideline for biochar selection to control pollution this study recommends in depth investigation of cr vi contaminated wastewater treatment using activated magnetic biochar at neutral ph introducing activated magnetic biochar may help researchers understand cr vi adsorption process and compare it with different materials overall this study established that activated magnetic biochar can efficiently remove heavy metals from wastewater credit author statement rama sinha investigation sample synthesis execution and writing original

11808,this study aims to synthesize activated magnetic biochar using a single step approach and explore solute solvent mechanisms for removing hexavalent chromium cr vi from the aqueous solution agricultural waste rice husk was pre treated in iron chloride and zinc chloride solution and pyrolyzed at 500 c obtained activated magnetic biochar were characterized by sem eds ftir xrd vsm and bet to analyze physicochemical features adsorption experiments indicated that activated magnetic biochar achieved an adsorption capacity of 9 97 mg g with removal efficiency of 99 7 for an initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l at ph 2 and 351 k in aqueous solutions cr vi break down to hcro 4 cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions however at low ph 1 4 hcro 4 ion attributes electrostatic force of attraction which encourages higher adsorption of cr vi ions overall batch experiments demonstrated that initial ph cr vi concentration biochar dose temperature and co existing ions significantly affected the cr vi adsorption using activated magnetic biochar therefore electrostatic interaction and ion exchange dominate cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar at low ph experiments showed heterogeneous non linear monolayer and spontaneous sorption which were validated via temkin isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic for cr vi ions as a result cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar occurred due to chemisorption on heterogeneous non linear monolayers mainly governed by electrostatic attraction and ion exchange mechanisms due to enriched oxygen containing surface groups with activated magnetic biochar in terms of thermodynamics the adsorption process for cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar was endothermic and spontaneous as a positive δs value indicates randomness during cr vi adsorption at the solution solute interface in contrast the negative value of δg 15855 3 kj mol at 351 k shows that adsorption was spontaneous overall the activated magnetic biochar synthesized from rice husk was more efficient than raw biochar in removing cr vi ions from the aqueous solution graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated magnetic biochar adsorbent hexavalent chromium adsorption 1 introduction chromium cr derived from the greek word chroma is the 24st most abundant element occurring naturally in trivalent and hexavalent forms on the earth s crust abdel

actions and industrialization are the primary reasons behind cr contamination in the environment which can enter the human body mainly through drinking water ertani et al 2017 robertson 1975 or food sykuła zając and pawlak 2012 rowbotham et al 2000 subsequently cr creates adverse effects like ulcers skin dermatitis cancer and even causes death chatterjee et al 2015 due to the high mobility and toxicity of the hexavalent form of chromium cr vi is considered a primary source of concern pagilla and canter 1999 international agency for research on cancer iarc identified cr vi as one of the potent carcinogenic elements iarc 1987 iarc 1980 cr iii vi removal methods from the aqueous or soil environment include filtration coagulation sedimentation electrodialysis photocatalyst ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane filtration adsorption etc golder et al 2007 li et al 2009 babu and gupta 2008 zhang et al 2020a the adsorption method is one of the most promising techniques in recent times because it is cost effective and eco friendly and can efficiently remove cr ions or other organic pollutants and heavy metals from wastewater and contaminated water benjamin et al 1996 roy et al 2018 ghosh et al 2019 several adsorbents have been developed and used for example activated carbon babel and kurniawan 2004 rai et al 2016 fang et al 2007 wanees et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 paper waste

zhong et al 2022 biochar zhang et al 2020a van et al 2019 liu et al 2020a sinha et al 2022 etc for cr vi removal via adsorption process besides raw adsorbents such as neem leaves babu and gupta 2008 wheat straw eupatorium adenophorium crofton weed song et al 2016 bentonite wanees et al 2013 almond hull nasseh et al 2017 have also been used to remove cr vi from the wastewater however biochar is as considered carbon rich biosorbents which are being produced via pyrolyzing biomass in the temperature range of 300 700 c in the absence of oxygen zhang et al 2020a wani et al 2022 the main factors responsible for the inherent and unique characteristics of biochar are their feedstock types and pyrolysis conditions biochar preparation is cost efficient as several feedstocks are abundant and locally available in most places zhang et al 2019 it possesses inherent properties like high cation exchange capacity specific surface area unique pore structure and rich oxygen containing functional groups zhang et al 2018a modification of biochar by chemical or physical processes dong et al 2017 metal impregnation and magnetization li et al 2020 xin et al 2017 activation braghiroli et al 2018 etc can further increase the functional groups associated with biochar surfaces along with enhancement in their surface area and pore structure volpe et al 2018 sakhiya et al 2020 wani et al 2022 these modifications thus help in the effective removal of contaminants previously biochar was derived from various biomass such as wheat straw ali et al 2020 sugarcane bagasse bai et al 2021 badam shell jia et al 2021 peanut hull han et al 2016 douglas fir herath et al 2021 etc was performed for cr vi adsorption however there is a need to explore efficient and locally available waste biomass that can be potentially used as biochar to remove cr vi ions rice husk is significantly available in bulk as feedstock material for contaminant remediation from the environment synthesizing biochar from rice husk results in a higher o c ratio which represents abundant functional groups onto biochar with negative surface charges so the adsorption capacity for positively charged heavy metals is relatively strong such as cr vi ions from contaminated environments sanka et al 2020 more recently biochar has been modified as activated magnetic biochar in which activation and magnetization are performed simultaneously resulting in a high potential for wastewater treatment yin et al 2018 shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 few studies have reported remediation of heavy metals using activated magnetic biochar yin et al 2018 shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 sharma et al 2022 this type of biochar modification enhances the properties of biochar as compared to the activated or magnetized biochar alone for example activated magnetic biochar has successfully removed 17β estradiol and cu ii from the wastewater activation and magnetization were done in a single step method this helped to improve the specific surface area enhance the pore structure and increase the attached functional groups yin et al 2018 several studies have reported that activation and magnetization of biochar have shown significant adsorption capacities for cr vi ions sun et al 2021 medha et al 2021 guo et al 2021 sinha et al 2022 however to our knowledge no such study has been documented for cr vi removal using single step synthesized activated magnetic biochar in addition to further improve cr vi adsorption performance activated magnetic biochar derived from rice husk which might show the potential for strong adsorption has not been explored and reported yet in this research novel and eco friendly activated magnetic biochar was proposed to synthesize from locally available agricultural waste rice husk to remove cr vi ions from the contaminated water the current study attempts to evaluate the feasibility of cr vi ions adsorption onto cost effective single step synthesized activated magnetic biochar the objectives of this study are a to analyze physical and chemical characteristics of synthesized raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar and b to investigate cr vi removal efficiency under the influence of ph initial concentration biochar dose contact time temperature and co existing anions using batch experiments finally adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic behaviour were also performed for cr vi removal using activated magnetic biochar and the adsorption mechanism for cr vi ions was explored and proposed 2 materials and method this section outlines the chemicals and equipment used for general laboratory operations along with their protocol to determine equilibrium sorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis dealing with the removal of cr

10 g washed and dried rice husk biomass was added to the fe zn solution and sonicated for 2 h and then left for 24 h after drying soaked biomass at 80 c in the hot air oven fe zn soaked biomass was pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace icon instrument company india at 500 c for 2 h to produce the activated magnetic biochar subsequently both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar were ball milled for 4 h at 500 rpm using a zirconium ball mill retsch germany to remove excess zn particles activated magnetic biochars were washed with deionized water until the neutral ph 7 0 0 1 achieved and then dried at 80 c in the hot air oven further similar approach was adopted to wash and dry raw biochar after ball milling 2 3 characterization of activated magnetic biochar scanning electron microscopy sem demicro orchid india equipped with electron energy dispersive x ray edx edax inc usa analysis was performed to identify the surface morphology and elemental composition of the raw and activated magnetic biochar similarly the structural and chemical characterization of raw and activated magnetic biochar was carried out using fourier transform infrared ftir spectra agilent technologies usa and x ray diffraction rigaku corporation japan respectively the magnetic potential was determined by vibrating sample magnetometer quantum design versalab usa for the raw and activated magnetic biochar bet surface area for raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar was analyzed by micrometric asap 2020 surface area analyzer on 0 15 g samples out grassed at 250 c for 12 h at 10 3 torr 2 4 analytical method for cr vi stock solution preparation and quantification hexavalent chromium cr vi stock solution was prepared via dissolving potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in ultra pure water i e 100 mg l cr vi stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0 28 g of potassium dichromate in 1 l of deionized water huang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 phosphoric acid and 1 5 diphenyl carbazide indicator were used as per astm d1687 17 using photometric diphenyl carbazide test method to detect cr vi concentration astm 2017 naoh and hcl were used to adjust the ph of the solution 0 025 g l of 1 5 diphenyl carbazide dpc was prepared in acetone and stored in a brown bottle inside the refrigerator at 2 c while not in use phosphoric acid was prepared in 1 1 ratio i e 20 ml of acid was mixed with 20 ml of ultrapure water after that for detection purposes 2 ml dpc and 5 ml phosphoric acid were added to chromium solution and kept for 15 min to develop a reddish purple color then quantified by following the colorimetric method in the presence of dpc using uv vis spectrophotometer cary100 agilent technologies usa at 540 nm wavelength astm 2017 2 5 batch sorption experiments the adsorption process of cr vi

sorption experiments were examined under the influence of contact time ph initial cr vi concentration biochar dosages experimental temperature and co existing ions table 1 for the batch sorption experiment the initial cr vi concentration was kept in the range of 1 10 mg l and the biochar doses in the range of 0 5 2 5 g l at varying ph 2 3 5 7 and 9 for 120 min in an aqueous solution at room temperature 303 k further based on the above parameters the effect of experimental temperatures 303 k 323 k 340 k and 351 k was investigated after optimizing the batch sorption experiments with 10 mg l initial cr vi concentration 1 g l biochar dose and 120 min duration the co existing ion effect was investigated by mixing cr vi with nacl na3po4 na2so4 or no3 salt solutions in 1 1 vol ratio at optimal ph with known quantities of biochar dose and cr vi concentration for 120 min each set of sorption experiments was performed in triplicate and their mean value and standard deviation as error

mass of biochar 33 8 and 32 67 wt yield of rice husk raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar was achieved after slow pyrolysis sem analysis reveals the shape and surface morphology of the biochar particles fig 1 a and b shows sem images for raw and activated magnetic biochar which indicate that the biochar particles possess flake like morphology and porous structure sem images of activated magnetic biochar also adorn flake like structures and particles agglomerated with fe3o4 nanoparticles dehkhoda et al 2014 kumar et al 2021 as shown structural fusion in fig 1b edx measurements were carried out to investigate the elemental analysis of raw and activated magnetic biochar edx analysis confirmed the presence of high carbon oxygen and silicon in the synthesized raw biochar fig 1c the presence of iron content onto activated magnetic biochar indicated the magnetization of biochar i e agglomerated with fe3o4 nanoparticles fig 1d similar kinds of structural fusion were observed in activated magnetic biochar synthesized from rice and cotton straw shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 xrd analysis for raw biochar showed regular diffraction peaks which indicated that the carbon matrix for raw biochar is amorphous in nature xrd performed on the activated magnetic biochar validated the associated crystalline phase and wide angle spectra patterns fig 2 precise measurement showed that the peaks were centered at 18 11 29 92 35 08 36 92 42 69 53 28 and 62 32 which was confirmed from the xrd pattern of activated magnetic biochar due to crystalline fe species of hematite fe2o3 and magnetite activated magnetic biochar showed clear distinctive peaks after alteration with fe feo and other peaks were related to zno and znfe2o4 this indicates that the fe and zn have been successfully loaded into the biochar during activation and magnetization detailed structural characteristics of activated magnetic biochar are explained in the supplementary information section s1 fig 3 shows the ftir spectra in which characteristic peaks for functional groups such as oh 3440 cm 1 ch 802 and 2942 cm 1 cc 1569 1620 cm 1 and co 1080 cm 1 were commonly observed for both raw and activated magnetic biochar tang et al 2016 the prominent peak at 1585 cm 1 in the raw biochar spectrum corresponding to cc vibration shifted slightly for the activated magnetic biochar about 1618 cm 1 due to iron and zinc modification tang et al 2015 fe o stretch vibration was centered at wavelength of 673 cm 1 showing the successful magnetization of the activated magnetic biochar devi and saroha 2014 magnetization of adsorbents is useful for wastewater treatment because of their ease of recycling and recovery from aqueous solutions santhosh et al 2020 chen et al 2011 reddy and lee 2014 zhang et al 2018b at room temperature magnetic hysteresis was investigated at magnetic fields of 30 000 a m for raw and activated magnetic biochar fig 4 raw biochar has no magnetism whereas activated magnetic biochar has a considerable magnetization value 8 69 emu g because of fe3o4 particles agglomerated with the biochar surface fe3o4 particles adorning the biochar surface are magnetically active which improves the characteristics of magnetic biochar as evident from sem eds analysis a similar range of magnetization was also reported using magnetic biochar for cr vi adsorption santhosh et al 2020 bet surface areas were 96 1 and 134 6 m2 g for rice husk raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar respectively 3 2 influence of contact time on cr vi adsorption adsorption efficiency of cr vi using both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar increase with increasing residence contact time in the aqueous solution influence of contact time on cr vi removal was performed with cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and fixed biochar dose of 0 5 g l using raw and activated magnetic biochar at ph 7 as depicted in fig 5 cr vi adsorption equilibrium was reached in 120 min approximately with removal efficiencies of 13 and 21 for raw and activated magnetic biochar respectively which were calculated using equation 1 at the same time it was estimated that activated magnetic biochar possesses a sorption capacity of 4 39 mg g though the sorption capacity for raw biochar was only 2 7 mg g which was calculated using equation 2 these results conclude that the maximum concentration of cr vi ions was adsorbed onto biochar surfaces within 120 min due to the availability of vacant active sites it has been observed that both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar possess slow adsorption of cr vi ions for ph 7 at 303 k the removal efficiency was observed to increase less with respect to residence time because of electrostatic attraction between cr vi ions and biochar surface in the aqueous solution 3 3 effect of ph the ph of the solution affects the potential charges of active sites present on the adsorbent zhanqi et al 2007 and affects the solubility of metal ion s speciation mohan et al 2015 hence the removal efficiency of cr vi onto raw and activated magnetic biochar was investigated at varying ph in the range 2 9 using equation 1 these results showed high cr vi removal efficiency using both raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar obtained at low ph 4 and relatively low cr vi removal efficiency at high ph 5 fig 6 depicts that the maximum removal efficiencies were 46 and 50 for raw and activated magnetic biochar respectively for an initial concentration of 10 mg l biochar dosage of 0 5 g l and ph 2 at room temperature therefore using equation 2 it was estimated that the adsorption capacities were observed 9 2 mg g and 10 0 mg g at ph 2 and biochar dosages of 0 5 g l for raw biochar and activated magnetic biochar respectively activated magnetic biochar has shown maximum zeta potential at ph less than 4 due to which adsorption capacity can reach maximum for cr vi ions yin et al 2018 shan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 previously a similar outcome was observed with cr vi ions adsorption on coffee biochar modified with polyphenol formaldehyde and polyphenol acetaldehyde mulani et al 2013 liang et al 2020 additionally li et al 2014 stated that a decrease in ph increases the adsorption efficiency due to improved electrostatic attraction similar results were found in the case of cr vi adsorption using biochar or nanoparticles at lower ph such as magnetic eucalyptus leaf residue biochar sugar beet tailing biochar and mgo modified sugarcane harvest biochar wang et al 2014 yuan et al 2009 dong et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 at lower ph values 3 furthermore in previous research work it has been observed that cr vi can easily be reduced to cr iii this was another potential factor for the maximum chromium removal at ph 2 verma et al 2006 choudhary et al 2017 functionalized biochar i e activated magnetic biochar possesses significant functional groups which encourage optimal adsorption of cr vi ions onto biochar surfaces the surface area of activated magnetic biochar was found higher than raw biochar therefore the surface area also plays a significant role in the removal of cr vi ions from contaminated water in the above ph study activated magnetic biochar shows higher adsorption capacity compared with raw biochar therefore for further experiments only activated magnetic biochar has been considered to perform the influence of activated magnetic biochar dosages initial cr vi concentration temperature and co existing ions adsorption analysis 3 4 effect of biochar dosages and initial cr vi concentration biochar dose is an essential factor for regulating the degree of solute removal from an aqueous medium the concentration gradient of the initial cr vi concentration and mass transfer in the aqueous and solid phases are the driving force for cr vi ions removal using activated magnetic biochar therefore the effect of activated magnetic biochar dosages in the range of 0 5 2 5 g l was tested in this study for the fixed initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l at ph 2 and 303 k temperature as shown in fig 7 a after using equation 1 it was noted that cr vi removal efficiency increases from 50 to 65 at ph 2 with increased biochar dosage from 0 5 g l to 1 g l for activated magnetic biochar due to large available active sites onto biochar surfaces though the removal efficiency became constant for 1 5 g l to 2 5 g l biochar dosages due to a decrease in the mass transfer of cr vi ions at the solid liquid interface i e decrease in the concentration of cr vi ions adsorption per unit of biochar mass at constant cr vi concentration using equation 2 it was estimated that the adsorption capacities decreased from 10 0 mg g to 2 61 mg g with an increase in biochar dosages from 0 5 mg g to 2 5 g l in the aqueous solution hence the increased biochar dosages created the saturation of active sites on the activated magnetic biochar which caused a decrease in the adsorption capacity similar results have been reported with cr vi adsorption on ferric chloride coated mango kernel powder van et al 2019 akram et al 2017 initial cr vi concentration also influenced the cr vi adsorption in an aqueous solution using activated magnetic biochar the initial cr vi concentrations were varied from 1 to 10 mg l at the fixed biochar dosage of 1 g l ph 2 and 303 k temperature fig 7b depicts the influence of varying initial cr vi concentrations on the removal efficiency of cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar the results showed decrease in cr vi ions adsorption with an increase in cr vi concentrations at a fixed biochar dose thus the removal efficiency was reduced from 99 9 to 65 with increased initial concentration from 1 to 10 mg l using equation 1 due to less available active sites onto the biochar surface for adsorption of cr vi ions however with an increase in the initial cr vi concentration of 1 10 mg l it was estimated that the adsorption capacities also increased from 0 1 to 6 5 mg g onto activated magnetic biochar using equation 2 cr vi ions diffusion took longer to reach the activated magnetic biochar surface resulting in an improvement in removal efficiency as the initial cr vi concentration was reduced from 10 to 7 mg l similar results were observed in other studies using different biochar types such as rice husk and tea wastes biochars and modified magnetic biochar prepared from raw corn con for adsorption of cr vi van et al 2019 shakya and agarwal 2019 khalil et al 2020 3 5 influence of temperature on cr vi adsorption the experimental temperature indicates the variation of individual sorption mechanisms and affects the mobility and reactivity of cr vi ions the effect of temperature on cr vi adsorption was performed for the temperature range of 303 351 k at ph 2 1 g l biochar dose and contact time of 120 min using equation 1 it was noted that the removal efficiency increased from 65 07 to 99 78 with an increase in temperature from 323 to 351 k fig 8 at 1 g l of biochar dose and 10 mg l cr vi concentration using equation 2 it was estimated that the adsorption capacity of the activated magnetic biochar increased from 6 5 to 9 9 mg g by increasing the temperature from 303 to 351 k increased cr vi adsorption at high temperatures might be due to the interactions between molecules at a high temperature which ultimately influences the mobility and transfer of the molecules wang et al 2016 3 6 influence of co existing ions the effects of interfering ions such as cl no 3 so 4 2 and po 4 3 were investigated by adding 10 mg l of their respective salts nacl nano3 na2so4 and na3po4 with 10 mg l of initial cr vi concentration at ph 2 and 303 k temperature using an activated magnetic biochar dose of 1 mg l as a result the removal efficiency of cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar was 65 07 at the experimental conditions stated above whereas a minor decrease in cr vi removal efficiency was observed in the presence of anions such as cl 64 3 po 4 3 64 0 so 4 2 63 2 and no 3 62 6 adsorption of cr vi ions had negligible influence due to the co existence of ions in the aqueous solution fig s2 3 7 adsorption isotherms modeling adsorption isotherm describes the diffusion of the adsorbate cr vi ions with the adsorbent activated magnetic biochar langmuir isotherm explains non linear monolayer sorption onto homogenous surfaces without interfering among the adsorbed particles in this model the equilibrium condition explains the correlation between the solute adsorbed onto the adsorbent surfaces and the initial concentration of hexavalent chromium however freundlich isotherm model explains the heterogeneity of non linear sorption of adsorbents which is valid for non linear monolayer sorption on heterogeneous surfaces which interacts with adsorbed molecules temkin isotherm model explains the heat of sorption i e sorbent solute interactions the heat of sorption of solute is decreased linearly with surface coverage where the uniform distribution of binding sites defines the solute sorption besides dubinin radushkevich isotherm explains gaussian energy distribution onto heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces mainly distinguishing adsorption into physical or chemical sorption of metal ions in an aqueous solution travis and etnier 1981 the equation for langmuir isotherm is as follows freundlich 1909 3 q e q c 0 β

l g and t indicates the absolute temperature k for langmuir isotherm the values of the correlation coefficient r 2 0 184 q o 8 025 and β 207 666 were calculated using equation 4 as given in table 2 adsorption capacity obtained using langmuir isotherm model for the activated magnetic biochar assumes that adsorption occurs at homogeneous adsorption sites onto the activated magnetic biochar surface and also there are no mutual interactions between the adsorbed pollutants molecules labidi et al 2016 in the langmuir isotherm model the experimental value of q o 9 97 is similar to the calculated value of q c o 8 02 for freundlich isotherm the values of correlation coefficient r 2 0 6748 k f 8 1849 and value of n 12 13592 were calculated using equation 6 as given in table 2 in the freundlich model adsorption shows heterogeneous adsorption of cr vi ions onto activated magnetic biochar surface for temkin isotherm the value of the correlation coefficient r 2 0 7156 β 4251 477 and k t 173985 1 using equation 7 has been shown in table 2 dubinin radushkevich isotherm analysis for cr vi ions showed poor fitting r2 0 27 with activated magnetic biochar as shown in table 2 overall temkin model shows uniform distribution of solute solvent onto binding sites and is considered the best fitting model for cr vi adsorption using activated magnetic biochar 3 8 adsorption kinetics models kinetics models explain the cr vi adsorption mechanism onto activated magnetic biochar the kinetic model named the pseudo first order model recognized as the lagergren model describes the sorption kinetics under the influence of contact time the pseudo second order kinetic explains that the chemical reaction rate directly relates to active sites available on the biochar surface however weber morris intraparticle diffusion kinetic model interprets the internal adsorption on adsorbent in an aqueous solution the equation for the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 shang et al 2016 are given as follows 10 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 11 t q t 1 q e 2 k 2 t q e 12 q t k i p d t 1 2 c where q e denotes equilibrium

t is absolute temperature k and k ipd represents intraparticle diffusion constant mg g min1 2 in general adsorption kinetics gives an idea for the adsorption capacity of biochar with respect to time for the pseudo first order the value of k 1 0 034545 qe 3 739383 and r 2 0 9054 were calculated by the analysis of the linear form of pseudo first order kinetic using equation 10 as shown values in table 3 the pseudo second order kinetic is based on the mass transfer dynamics the value of k 2 0 019917 q e 10 34126 and r 2 0 9994 equated with the linear form of pseudo second order kinetic using equation 11 as shown in table 3 intraparticle diffusion kinetic evaluated k ipd c and r 2 values as 0 4252 mg g min1 2 5 92 and 0 84 respectively for cr vi ions adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar using equation 12 among all three kinetic models pseudo second order kinetic r 2 0 9994 was the best fitted for cr vi sorption dynamics onto activated magnetic biochar the calculated q e mg g from pseudo second order kinetic was closer to the experimental q e than pseudo first order kinetic r2 0 9054 the findings of the present study are similar to cr vi adsorption using wastewater sludge zhang et al 2013 according to the pseudo second order model the adsorption is regulated by the amount of cr vi ions at the surface of activated magnetic biochar and the rate limiting step may be a chemical adsorption process 3 9 thermodynamic adsorption analysis thermodynamic adsorption isotherm was performed to determine the adsorption feasibility of cr vi ions onto activated magnetic biochar the thermodynamic constants such as free energy δg standard entropy δs and enthalpy δh determine the adsorption feasibility by using the equilibrium constant and the temperature the equation is given by sun et al 2021 huang et al 2016 13 l o g k e δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r 1 t 14 k c c a e c e 15 δ g δ h t δ s where δs is a standard entropy kj mol k δg denotes free energy kj mol δh is enthalpy kj mol k c is equilibrium constant t is the corresponding temperature k c e and c ae indicate equilibrium concentration of the aqueous solution and adsorbent mg l respectively and r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k the effect of the temperature was examined at different temperatures 303 k 323 k 340 k and 351 k using the above equations 13 15 at ph 2 10 mg l initial cr vi concentration 1 g l biochar dose and 120 min duration the thermodynamic parameters δh δs and δg explain whether cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar is exothermic or endothermic in nature table 4 shows the value of δh δs and δg calculated from linear regression using equation 15 the positive value for δh shows that cr vi removal onto activated magnetic biochar was endothermic adsorption using equation 15 the δs value is also positive indicating an improvement in randomness during cr vi adsorption at the solution solute interface the negative value of δg 15855 3 kj mol at 351 k shows that adsorption was spontaneous similar results were observed in cr vi removal using b cyclodextrin chitosan modified biochars huang et al 2016 sewage sludge and nano zero valent iron magnetic biochar liu et al 2020b fes and chitosan modified soy sauce residue yang et al 2021 tio2 modified rosin biochar yousaf et al 2018 and many other 3 10 proposed mechanism and comparative cr vi removal using activated magnetic biochar with other biochar adsorbents cr vi dissociates into different forms in the aqueous solution like hcro 4 cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions gupta et al 2013 whereas hcro 4 is the predominant form that persists in an aqueous solution at low ph 3 wang et al 2014 ekanayake et al 2022 with a rise in ph values i e from acidic to alkaline medium hcro 4 converts into cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions hence hcro 4 is more strongly adsorbed than cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 ions yuan et al 2009 biochar possesses various oxygen containing functional groups for example oh cooh cho coc etc which encourages adsorption of cr vi ions in the ph range of 1 4 kahraman and pehlivan 2017 wang et al 2019a dehghani et al 2021 rasaie et al 2021 dehgani et al 2020 at ph 1 4 the active form of cr vi is absorbed on hcro 4 ions and attributed to an electrostatic force of attraction due to the existence of several functional groups such as cooh2 nh4 oh2 etc onto biochar surfaces brito et al 1997 availability of h ions and cr 6 or cr vi ions at neutral ph competes themselves for active sorption sites on the activated magnetic biochar considering presence of oxygen based functional groups optimal cr vi removal was observed at low ph which means electrostatic attraction increases at the acidic condition overall electrostatic interaction and ion exchange are major governing mechanisms for cr vi adsorption onto the biochar materials as depicted in fig 9 babu and gupta 2008 braghiroli et al 2018 bishnoi et al 2004 wu et al 2017 qu et al 2021 hadjmohammadi et al 2011 ekanayake et al 2022 this explains ph dependent behavior of cr vi adsorption by activated magnetic biochar at low ph table 5 shows the comparative removal efficiency of cr vi ions using activated magnetic biochar with respect to other biochar based adsorbents it indicates that activation of biochar improves biochar properties and can increase their adsorption potential for example zncl2 activated biochar derived from sea buckthorn stone biomass enhances the surface area and the active sites resulting in removal efficiency of 98 for cr vi ions guo et al 2021 similarly iron and 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane biochar composite derived from rice straw were prepared by medha et al 2021 biochar treated with iron and 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane improved removal capacity by 100 59 mg g the results demonstrated that hydrothermal chemical treatment improved physicochemical properties such as surface area functional group and silica content magnetic biochar made from melia azedarach wood was used in another study to remove cr vi ions pre treating the biomass with fe c resulted in the production of biochar impregnation increased removal capacity to 25 27 mg g 99 8 at ph 3 initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and biochar dose of 5 g l the findings revealed that impregnation aids in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii ions zhang et al 2018b magnetic biochar has been readily and easily separable with higher adsorption capacity and recyclable among different kinds of biochar chen et al 2011 reddy and lee 2014 magnetic biochar synthesis includes several methods such as coordinating biochar with fe2 fe3 ions with thermal treatment loading of iron oxide or magnetization followed by impregnation sun et al 2021 wang et al 2019b qin et al 2020 wen et al 2022 van et al 2019 made magnetic biochar with raw corncob at a 20 w w impregnation ratio the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 25 94 mg g at ph 3 with an initial cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and a biochar dose of 4 g l the experiment revealed that higher removal occurred in an acidic ph medium the impregnation demonstrated that the biochar attained high magnetization and maintained its magnetic properties at ph 3 yielding a higher removal capacity of 25 94 mg g prepared magnetic biochar by pre treating the biomass with fe2 fe3 ions solution which possesses improved magnetic properties with the removal efficiency of 95 27 for cr vi ions the characteristics of biochar and the efficiency of cr vi removal were also influenced by the peak temperature of pyrolysis and the particle size higher temperatures increased the magnetic properties of biochar and its ability to adsorb cr vi ions however activated magnetic biochar synthesized in this study has shown maximum removal efficiency for low cr vi concentration range 4 conclusions biochar applications in cr vi removal have been considered an efficient and low investment approach in this research work adsorption of cr vi ions has been performed using raw and activated magnetic biochar via batch experiments under the influence of ph initial cr vi concentration biochar doses and temperature the equilibrium sorption for cr vi ions gained an adsorption capacity of 9 97 mg g using activated magnetic biochar at ph 2 for 10 mg l of cr vi concentration and 351 k maximum adsorption using activated magnetic biochar was observed at high temperatures due to molecules interaction at high temperature influences the mobility and transfer of molecules in aqueous solutions besides increased activated magnetic biochar dose also increases cr vi removal because of primarily available active sites interestingly the co existing ions show no interference with cr vi adsorption onto activated magnetic biochar temkin isotherm and pseudo second order have been preferred as best fitted isotherm and kinetics for sorption equilibrium analysis cr vi removal efficiency also increased with an increase in temperature i e the negative value of δg which shows that the adsorption of cr vi was endothermic and spontaneous the thermodynamic adsorption analysis showed the positive value of δh 90498 97 kj mol i e endothermic adsorption of cr vi ions onto activated magnetic biochar consequently the positive value of δs 303 0035 kj mol directs that increase in randomness at the solute solution interface during cr vi adsorption was significant the study on cr vi adsorption using activated magnetic biochar was efficient and low cost technique furthermore single step magnetization and activation reduced time and cost investment this investigation summarized comprehensive understanding of different modified biochars synthesized in various steps applied to remove cr vi concentration compared with single step synthesized activated magnetic biochar which even performed for lower concentrations that can play as a guideline for biochar selection to control pollution this study recommends in depth investigation of cr vi contaminated wastewater treatment using activated magnetic biochar at neutral ph introducing activated magnetic biochar may help researchers understand cr vi adsorption process and compare it with different materials overall this study established that activated magnetic biochar can efficiently remove heavy metals from wastewater credit author statement rama sinha investigation sample synthesis execution and writing original

98 to 8 41 with average value 7 69 all samples were within limit of who 6 5 8 5 the highest level of ph was found in sample 28 and lowest was in sample 40 the results of ph showed that groundwater of study area was slightly alkaline in nature electrical conductivity is to quantify the capability of water to flow the electrical current the results of ec were found from 569 to 17790 μs cm with average value of 3998 84 μs cm ec of 35 76 0 samples were above the who limits 1500 μs cm the values of tds were from 364 to 11385 mg l with average value of 2553 71 mg l tds of 35 76 0 samples were beyond who limits 1000 mg l the samples number 24 showed highest level of tds and sample number 34 indicated lowest level of tds it may be due to the geological nature and aquifer status which is varying from area to area the results of total hardness were 120 3400 mg l with average value of 536 04 mg l table 1 the th of 19 41 3 samples were beyond the who limits 500 mg l the chemical oxygen demands cod in grounwater may be due to breakdown of microorganisms and seepages of sewage water and is harmful the concentration of cod varied from below detection limit bdl to 40 mg l higher results of cod may be due to drainage recharge at the study area table 1 the cod of 7 15 2 samples crossed the who standard limits the lanjwani et al 2020a analyzed the groundwater quality of taluka kamber and ec and tds results were varied from 497 to 11 580 μs cm and tds 318 and 7411 mg l which are comparable with present study lanjwani et al 2020b also assessed tha groundwater quality of other 3 subdistricts of kamber shahdakot district and ec and tds results were between ec 373 to 18700 μs cm and 238 to 11 968 mg l and were comparable with present study 3 1 anions results the results of

khan town and a few area of taluka warah and nasirabad were affected by excess amount of lead pb the ni showed lower values and only few samples were affected by higher level of ni lanjwani et al 2022 analyzed the heavy metals of taluka bakrani and results were zn 34 3 488 8 μg l fe 20 3 to 110 5 cu 10 4 to 104 5 co 10 2 to 27 2 mn 9 6 to 34 0 ni 11 0 to 38 2 cr 5 4 to 37 3 cd 0 0 to 5 5 and pb 0 0 19 0 μg l the present study showed higher level of heavy metal as compared to reported value may be due to the higher level of salts present in the aquifer of study area 3 4 fluoride and arsenic the main cause of fluoride f in water is fluoride bearing rocks fluorite fluorspar fluorapatite hydroxylapatite and cryolite the f in small amount effects favourably on the dental system meenakshi et al 2004 the fluoride values were observed from 0 25 to 22 5 mg l high value of fluoride was found in sample 24 22 5 mg l and lowest in sample 22 0 25 mg l the f values of 9 samples were fit for drinking with concentration below 1 5 mg l 10 samples were within maximum permissible limit 3 0 mg l and 25 53 3 locations were above the maximum limit and may be determental for human health table 2 the arsenic values were from bdl to 20 μg l arsenic values of 45 samples were within limits and suitable for drinking one sample only was exceeding the permissible limit low value of arsenic may be due to the geochemical nature of the area 3 5 contour diagram the contour plots of tds and fluoride were drawn by plotting the longitudes and latitudes of the analyzed samples from gps against average concentrations mg l of tds and fluoride by minitab software the contour diagram of tds results indicated highest average concentrations at sample no 24 11385 mg l and lowest at sample 34 364 mg l fig 5 the contour diagram of f results indicated highest average concentration also at sample no 24 22 5 mg l and lowest at sample 22 0 25 mg l fig 6 the contour diagram indicated that level of f increased with concontarion of tds and were directly proportional to each other 3 6 ions balance anion and cation balance is most useful method for examining the major ions reliability for groundwater freshwater or saline water analyses this method shows that the major ions are contained in the total dissolved solids tds boyd et al 2007 the ions balance idea is beneficial for the validity of water analysis ions balance is expressed in meq l the ions balance method is applied for the 7 parameters cations ca2 na mg2 k anions s hco3 and cl fig 7 the pie chart indicated predonancy of cl than others parameters 17 37 meq l and potassium were found in lowest results 0 51 meq l the na 10 91 k 0 51 ca2 11 86 mg2 11 89 cl 17 39 so4 2 10 94 and hco3 6 12 meq l sum of cations 35 17 sum of anions 34 43 meq l and relative error of 2 10 meq l occurred in the ions balance 3 7 human health risk assessment 3 7 1 contamination index cd the groundwater parameters which crossed the allowable limits were calculated separately and then jointed all individual parameters to achieve contaminated index cd the cd is group of all water quality parameters which are considered hazardous for drinking purpose the contaminated index results of parameters varied from negative to 101 table 3 the results indicated that cd of 20 samples were negative and considered good for water quality 4 samples were found in moderated contamination cd 3 and 19 samples were in higher contaminated category cd 3 and 3 samples were found with very high contaminated index 50 backman et al 1998 the cd results showed that 22 47 8 samples were harmful for human health on the basis of contamination index 3 7 2 chronic daily intake cdi indices the cdi level of heavy metals were found for co from 0 to 1 77 with an average value

0 to 4 22 with average value 0 71 pb 0 to 1 22 with average value 0 19 and as 0 to 0 11 with average value 0 03 μg kg day table 4 therefore cdi for groundwater of taluka miro khan warah and nasirabad were obtained in order of fe cr co ni mn cu pb cd as the cdi values of fe and cr were found higher may be due to the mineralization of fe and cr caused from mafic bed and ultramafic rocks comprising deposits of chromite 3 7 3 hazard quotient hq indices the hq indices for intake of drinking groundwater in area was analyzed the average hq index results were calculated for co 1 87e 03 fe 6 50e 03 pb

and were less than 1 the hq indices for all samples did not indicate serious threat to local people when results were compared with us epa standards 3 7 4 water quality index wqi the wqi was used to evaluate the water suitability for drinking the wqi is used to known comprehensive picture of groundwater quality for human consumption wqi indicates combined influence of the various parameters sahu and sikdar 2008 the parameters were used for computing the wqi and weight was given to each water parameter depending on the apparent effect on the human life avvannavar and shrihari 2008 table 6 indicates the given weight and relative weight of individual parameters with standards of who the fourty six samples were applied to examine the quality of the groundwater for human consumption the 16 parameters ph tds cl alkalinity na ca2 k mg2 so4 2 cr ni fe cd pb as and f were used to calculate wqi the wqi is categorized in five groups 50 excellent 50 100 good water 100 200 poor 200 300 very poor 300 unfit for drinking ketata et al 2012 the calculated wqi for drinking ranged from 36 11 to 486 51 table 7 the results showed highest value of wqi in sample no 24 486 51 and lowest in sample no 31 36 11 the results of wqi of groundwater of study area showed 5 10 87 samples were present in excellent category 14 30 43 samples in good 16 34 78 in poor 8 17 39 in very poor and 3 6 52 samples were found in unfit category for drinking purposes fig 8 a the wqi increased in towns as compared to rural areas wqi enhanced in nasirabad warah and miro khan towns may be due to the seepage of sewage to groundwater water quality for irrigation was also calculated to check the fitness of groundwater for cultivation using water quality standards for irrigation the wqi results varied from 19 66 to 225 89 the 26 56 52 samples were found in excellent category 13 28 26 samples were in good 6 13 04 samples were in poor water category only 1 4 72 sample was in very poor and no any sample was found in unfit water category for irrigation category fig 8b the gis maps fig 8a dwqi indicated that 58 69 area was under poor to unfit wqi for drinking and 8b iwqi results revealed that 17 76 groundwater of study area was poor to very poor wqi for irrigation the miro khan town and some area of taluka nasirabad and warah were affected by higher level of wqi 3 8 scatter analysis 3 8 1 weathering process evaporation and ion exchange process fig 9 a scatter plot of so4 2 hco3 against ca2 mg2 showed most of samples were along 1 1 line and indicated that dissolutions of dolomite calcite and gypsum were main sources some points were above the line and indicated reverse ion exchange process and carbonate and sulphate weathering and some points were below the line and indicated forward ion exchange process and silicate weathering lanjwani et al 2021a the fig 9b ca2 versus so4 2 showed majority of samples dots were on both the side of the equiline 1 1 which indicated gypsum and silicate weathering the dots above the equiline indicated mainly gypsum weathering as compared to silicate waethering controlling the geochemistry of major ion in research area egbueri 2019 fig 9c hco3 versus ca indicated that majority of samples were found below the equiline and indicated silicate weathering was main process controlling the geochemistry of the research area and also calcite dissolution but some samples dots were found above the equiline and indicated carbonate weathering and carbonic acid silicate weathering egbueri 2019 fig 9d na versus cl indicated that majority of samples points were found within equiline 1 1 line indicated dissolution of halite and mainly contributed to concentration of na in groundwater and may be suggested due to the halite containing minerals present in study area if the ratio is above than equiline it shows reverse ion exchange and silicate weathering and if ratio is less than equiline it shows forward ion exchange process mgbenu and egbueri 2019 fig 9e ec versus na cl showed that trend line was not linear and it indicated that evaporation can t be chief geochemical process observing the chemistry of groundwater lanjwani et al 2020c if na cl ratio is greater than 1 indicate silicate weathering and cation exchange if ratio is less than 1 shows anthropogenic disturbance the figure showed that na cl ratio of most samples points were less than 1 fig 9f cl versus na cl indicated that most of samples points were within 1 1 equiline some points were above than equiline and indicated reverse ion exchange lanjwani et al 2021a b 3 8 2 gibbs diagram the distribution of cations na ca2 k and anions cl hco versus tds results were applied in the gibbs plot to approximate the dominance of evaporation precipitation and rock gibbs 1970 fig 10 a and b are based on anions versus tds and cation versus tds fig 10a showed 58 70 rock dominance and 41 30 0 indicated evaporation dominance and fig 10b also indicated 67 39 samples rock dominance and 32 61 evaporation dominance however no any sample was found in precipitation dominance source the gibbs diagram showed the dissolution of ions in water were from interaction between groundwater and the rocks 3 8 3 correlation matrix the correlation is applied to examine degree of nearness among dissimilar variables khuhawar et al 2018 the results of correlation matrix were obtained by spss software version 22 by puting average values of 21 parameters of 46 samples table 8 the cl showed strong correlation to tds and total hardness 0 7 and negatively correlated to ph so4 2 was good correlated to cl tds and th but less correlated to alkalinity na was strong correlated to cl tds th and so4 2 but less correlated to alkalinity 0 5 and negatively correlated to ph the dissolution of halite and sodium sulphate salts present in the study area was indicated the ca2 was strong correlated to th tds cl so4 2 and na but less correlated to alkalinity and k and negative correlated to ph fe was negatively correlated to alkalinity and pb was negative correlated to ph cu and ni fluoride was good correlated to tds th na cl ca2 and so4 2 and supported that the concentration of fluoride increased with the increase in the amount of tds mg was moderately correlated to alkalinity k and co 0 5 0 7 but less correlated to mn fe and pb as was less correlated to ph cr fe ni and cu but negative correlated to other parameters the correlation indicated that major water quality parameters were correlated to each other and showed that these water samples were in similar area and origin 3 8 4 piper diagram the piper trilinear plot is applied to know the hydro geochemical nature the diagrams are based on concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 and cl hco3 and so4 2 the chemical information of groundwater samples are presented by the plotting on the piper tri linear graph fig 11 the diagram exposes similarities and variances between groundwater samples piper s 1953 the diagram is useful to understand chemical compositions between water in definite terms the right triangle showed the anions concentration and left showed the cations results the right side triangle showed that most of samples dots gathered at the centre of the triangle which indicated mixed type water but some samples showed rich in cl and indicated chloride type water within 40 90 some samples also showed dominancy of hco3 left triangle for cations also indicated mixed type water and showed no dominancy of any parameter and most of the dots of samples were gathered in the centre of the triangle the mg2 ca2 and so4 2 cl were simultaneously at both sides and raised arrows to upward in diamond shape the most of samples dots gathered in between on the figure and showed mixed ca2 na hco3 type and mixed ca2 mg2 cl type water but some dots gathered to upward cl and ca2 showed that water was slightly ca2 and cl type piper diagram showed some samples are sodium chloride type also 3 8 5 cluster analysis ca the cluster analysis is multivariate methods which chiefly classify variables into cluster with higher similarity and dissimilarity level among the classes the ca was used for combination of 46 different groundwater samples by using ward s method the classification arrangement apply euclidean distance for the similarity analysis together with the help of ward process for linkages ward 1963 the maximum distinct groups where every member in the groups were more equivalent to its related member than other members of the group the cluster analysis was used to know the similarity among sampling sites fig 12 the samples were grouped into three in the dendrogram group a is based on 33 samples with similar chemical properties geochemical quality of study area and similar results of parameters the cluster b is divided in two parts b1 and b2 the cluster b1 contains 11 samples which were similar to each other and cluster b2 contain only one sample number 40 the clusters b1 and b2 are connected by common line and indicate some resemblances among the parameters the cluster c contains only 1 sample 24 it is revealed that group c has higher results than group b and a similarly clusters b1 and b2 have higher results than cluster a 3 8 6 principal component analysis pca pca analysis is applied for the factor extraction and the current study involves a preceding approximation of variation in the each parameter by factors the eigenvalues are quantity of variance clarified by every factor the factor with eigenvalue greater than 1 explained the whole variation in data of individual parameters if factor with eigenvalue value is less than 1 showed less variation than distinct variable lanjwani 2020 lanjwani and channa 2019 hence only those factor with eigenvalue greater than 1 were taken for explanation and were exposed to varimax rotation coefficient correlation 0 75 is considered powerful correlation between 0 50 and 0 75 is known as moderate loading while 0 30 to

category with high ec and high na and cannot be used for irrigation lanjwani et al 2020c the diagram presented that majority of samples were found in doubtful to unsuitable category and these can t be used for irrigation purposes without very high controlled managements 4 2 salinity hazard the salinity hazard of water is categorized into four categories using electrical conductivity results as reported lanjwani et al 2020a low salinity groundwater ec 500 μs cm is used for most cultivation with the possibility that no salinity of soil will be developed the present study did not show any sample in this category the ec 500 1000 μs cm medium salinity can be used if soil is washed with sufficient volume of water the water can be used for crops which grow with sufficient amount of the salt without special actions for regulation of salinity the 6 13 04 samples were present in this category ec 1000 2250 μs cm high salinity can be applied on soils with well ordered drainage superior regulation of the salinity and selection of crops are essential for the soils with proper drainage the 14 30 43 samples were present in this category ec 3000 μs cm very high salinity is not fitting for crops however it can be used in special situations the soil should be permeable drainage must be acceptable water is used in higher quantities for soil leaching to cultivate crops with high salt tolerance 26 56 52 samples were present in this category fig 14 4 2 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar was calculated by comparative level of na with ca2 and mg2 in the water haritash et al 2016 the sar values of study area varied from 0 52 to 9 31 meq l the 93 48 of groundwater samples were fit for crops with sar value below 6 and 6 52 were unfit for the cultivation 4 2 2 residual sodium

processes multivariate analysis water quality 1 introduction the groundwater is a chief source for drinking and plays an essential role in environmental functions in several eco systems an increase in demand and a decrease in the quantity of groundwater are reported from pakistan ullah et al 2009 among the water available on the earth the drinkable water is present 0 62 in groundwater and 0 001 in air in the form of clouds vapour and precipitation 50 of groundwater in urban area in from bore wells hand pumps and springs are used in asia and latin america for drinking and commercial purposes water is a medium in several biochemical reactions hence life cannot survive without water pacyna et al 2009 water is therefore necessary for human life animals and plants usually groundwater is cleaner than surface water sankar and rao 2014 but industrialization and urbanization may affect the quality of groundwater resources in current years pollution of heavy metal in water soil and environment is raised because of industrial and human activities saleh et al 2017 the exposure and release of toxic metals into the environment are concerns to aquatic and human life even at low levels tuzen 2019 according to the who 2 2 million people die due to the diseases caused from contaminated drinking water schulze et al 2012 and there is a need to manage and protect the quality of groundwater sankar and rao 2014 the pakistan contains sufficient water resources but fast growing population deficiency of water management and growth of industries have put a huge burden on water reservoirs arshad et al 2013 a number of research reports have revealed that water effluence have serious difficulties in pakistan ali et al 2011 hashmi et al 2009 the groundwater in many areas of pakistan is polluted by higher level of arsenic and it is serious concern for human health farooq et al 2007 the reports are available on the assessment the quality of groundwater in sindh pakistan

area is low 180 mm mostly in monsoon season july to september lanjwani et al 2020a 2 2 geology the study area is covered by sedimentary soils and rocks and formations are rich in sandy rocks such as limestone claystone and sandstone by mid eocene marine extent caused in the growing of a co3 ledge in kirthar range the well known hamal lake is present in the study area the hard rock aquifers are generally composed of moderately broken sandstone and limestone and belong to the kirthar formations the limestone is a chief formation in the area lanjwani et al 2020a the geology of sindh is comprised of cretaceous and tertiary formations that contains dolomite limestone marly chert interaction and chalky shah 2009 the geology of study area is distributed into 3 regions the kirthar mountain range and pab containing little hills in west and in the north sindh kamber shahdahkot larkana and dadu cover laki range rocks distribution to suleiman range lanjwani et al 2022 in the areas like miro khan nasirabad and warah town drainage may effect the quality of groundwater because of absorption of effluents in soil but in villages groundwater is less effected because of a little volume of effluents of drainage water the main sources of recharge to grwoundwater are rice canal flow from the study areas and water for irrigation uses 2 3 samples collection and preservation the 46 groundwater samples were collected randomly from 3 talukas of district kamber shahdadkot nasirabad warah and miro khan generally used for drinking and irrigation purposes the groundwater samples were collected from study areas for physicochemical analysis and the global positioning system gps readings were noted on the site fig 1 the 13 samples were collected from taluka miro khan 15 from warah

garnierite present in study area lanjwani et al 2021b the concentrations of mn were bdl to 140 μg l and all samples were within who limit 500 μg l the concentrations of cd were found from bdl to 29 4 μg l table 2 the cd concentration of 14 30 4 samples excceded who limit the gis maps fig 4 a pb 4b cr 4c cd and 4d ni indicated that for cd and cr results had higher risk for human health the miro khan town and a few area of taluka warah and nasirabad were affected by excess amount of lead pb the ni showed lower values and only few samples were affected by higher level of ni lanjwani et al 2022 analyzed the heavy metals of taluka bakrani and results were zn 34 3 488 8 μg l fe 20 3 to 110 5 cu 10 4 to 104 5 co 10 2 to 27 2 mn 9 6 to 34 0 ni 11 0 to 38 2 cr 5 4 to 37 3 cd 0 0 to 5 5 and pb 0 0 19 0 μg l the present study showed higher level of heavy metal as compared to reported value may be due to the higher level of salts present in the aquifer of study area 3 4 fluoride and arsenic the main cause of fluoride f in water is fluoride bearing rocks fluorite fluorspar fluorapatite hydroxylapatite and cryolite the f in small amount effects favourably on the dental system meenakshi et al 2004 the fluoride values were observed from 0 25 to 22 5 mg l high value of fluoride was found in sample 24 22 5 mg l and lowest in sample 22 0 25 mg l the f values of 9 samples were fit for drinking with concentration below 1 5 mg l 10 samples were within maximum permissible limit 3 0 mg l and 25 53 3 locations were above the maximum limit and may be determental for human health table 2 the arsenic values were from bdl to 20 μg l arsenic values of 45 samples were within limits and suitable for drinking one sample only was exceeding the permissible limit low value of arsenic may be due to the geochemical nature of the area 3 5 contour diagram the contour plots of tds and fluoride were drawn by plotting the longitudes and latitudes of the analyzed samples from gps against average concentrations mg l of tds and fluoride by minitab software the contour diagram of tds results indicated highest average concentrations at sample no 24 11385 mg l and lowest at sample 34 364 mg l fig 5 the contour diagram of f results indicated highest average concentration also at sample no 24 22 5 mg l and lowest at sample 22 0 25 mg l fig 6 the contour diagram indicated that level of f increased with concontarion of tds and were directly proportional to each other 3 6 ions balance anion and cation balance is most useful method for examining the major ions reliability for groundwater freshwater or saline water analyses this method shows that the major ions are contained in the total dissolved solids tds boyd et al 2007 the ions balance idea is beneficial for the validity of water analysis ions balance is expressed in meq l the ions balance method is applied for the 7 parameters cations ca2 na mg2 k anions s hco3 and cl fig 7 the pie chart indicated predonancy of cl than others parameters 17 37 meq l and potassium were found in lowest results 0 51 meq l the na 10 91 k 0 51 ca2 11 86 mg2 11 89 cl 17 39 so4 2 10 94 and hco3 6 12 meq l sum of cations 35 17 sum of anions 34 43 meq l and relative error of 2 10 meq l occurred in the ions balance 3 7 human health risk assessment 3 7 1 contamination index cd the groundwater parameters which crossed the allowable limits were calculated separately and then jointed all individual parameters to achieve contaminated index cd the cd is group of all water quality parameters which are considered hazardous for drinking purpose the contaminated index results of parameters varied from negative to 101 table 3 the results indicated that cd of 20 samples were negative and considered good for water quality 4 samples were found in moderated contamination cd 3 and 19 samples were in higher contaminated category cd 3 and 3 samples were found with very high contaminated index 50 backman et al 1998 the cd results showed that 22 47 8 samples were harmful for human health on the basis of contamination index 3 7 2 chronic daily intake cdi indices the cdi level of heavy metals were found for co from 0 to 1 77 with an average value 0 56 fe from 0 28 to 9 31 with average value 1 95 cu 0 to 2 01 with average value 0 41 cd 0 to 0 82 with average value 0 16 cr 0 to 3 72 with average value 1 04 mn 0 to 3 8 with average value 0 60 ni 0 to 4 22 with average value 0 71 pb 0 to 1 22 with average value 0 19 and as 0 to 0 11 with average value 0 03 μg kg day table 4 therefore cdi for groundwater of taluka miro khan warah and nasirabad were obtained in order of fe cr co ni mn cu pb cd as the cdi values of fe and cr were found higher may be due to the mineralization of fe and cr caused from mafic bed and ultramafic rocks comprising deposits of chromite 3 7 3 hazard quotient hq indices the hq indices for intake of drinking groundwater in area was analyzed the average hq index results were calculated for co 1 87e 03 fe 6 50e 03 pb

and were less than 1 the hq indices for all samples did not indicate serious threat to local people when results were compared with us epa standards 3 7 4 water quality index wqi the wqi was used to evaluate the water suitability for drinking the wqi is used to known comprehensive picture of groundwater quality for human consumption wqi indicates combined influence of the various parameters sahu and sikdar 2008 the parameters were used for computing the wqi and weight was given to each water parameter depending on the apparent effect on the human life avvannavar and shrihari 2008 table 6 indicates the given weight and relative weight of individual parameters with standards of who the fourty six samples were applied to examine the quality of the groundwater for human consumption the 16 parameters ph tds cl alkalinity na ca2 k mg2 so4 2 cr ni fe cd pb as and f were used to calculate wqi the wqi is categorized in five groups 50 excellent 50 100 good water 100 200 poor 200 300 very poor 300 unfit for drinking ketata et al 2012 the calculated wqi for drinking ranged from 36 11 to 486 51 table 7 the results showed highest value of wqi in sample no 24 486 51 and lowest in sample no 31 36 11 the results of wqi of groundwater of study area showed 5 10 87 samples were present in excellent category 14 30 43 samples in good 16 34 78 in poor 8 17 39 in very poor and 3 6 52 samples were found in unfit category for drinking purposes fig 8 a the wqi increased in towns as compared to rural areas wqi enhanced in nasirabad warah and miro khan towns may be due to the seepage of sewage to groundwater water quality for irrigation was also calculated to check the fitness of groundwater for cultivation using water quality standards for irrigation the wqi results varied from 19 66 to 225 89 the 26 56 52 samples were found in excellent category 13 28 26 samples were in good 6 13 04 samples were in poor water category only 1 4 72 sample was in very poor and no any sample was found in unfit water category for irrigation category fig 8b the gis maps fig 8a dwqi indicated that 58 69 area was under poor to unfit wqi for drinking and 8b iwqi results revealed that 17 76 groundwater of study area was poor to very poor wqi for irrigation the miro khan town and some area of taluka nasirabad and warah were affected by higher level of wqi 3 8 scatter analysis 3 8 1 weathering process evaporation and ion exchange process fig 9 a scatter plot of so4 2 hco3 against ca2 mg2 showed most of samples were along 1 1 line and indicated that dissolutions of dolomite calcite and gypsum were main sources some points were above the line and indicated reverse ion exchange process and carbonate and sulphate weathering and some points were below the line and indicated forward ion exchange process and silicate weathering lanjwani et al 2021a the fig 9b ca2 versus so4 2 showed majority of samples dots were on both the side of the equiline 1 1 which indicated gypsum and silicate weathering the dots above the equiline indicated mainly gypsum weathering as compared to silicate waethering controlling the geochemistry of major ion in research area egbueri 2019 fig 9c hco3 versus ca indicated that majority of samples were found below the equiline and indicated silicate weathering was main process controlling the geochemistry of the research area and also calcite dissolution but some samples dots were found above the equiline and indicated carbonate weathering and carbonic acid silicate weathering egbueri 2019 fig 9d na versus cl indicated that majority of samples points were found within equiline 1 1 line indicated dissolution of halite and mainly contributed to concentration of na in groundwater and may be suggested due to the halite containing minerals present in study area if the ratio is above than equiline it shows reverse ion exchange and silicate weathering and if ratio is less than equiline it shows forward ion exchange process mgbenu and egbueri 2019 fig 9e ec versus na cl showed that trend line was not linear and it indicated that evaporation can t be chief geochemical process observing the chemistry of groundwater lanjwani et al 2020c if na cl ratio is greater than 1 indicate silicate weathering and cation exchange if ratio is less than 1 shows anthropogenic disturbance the figure showed that na cl ratio of most samples points were less than 1 fig 9f cl versus na cl indicated that most of samples points were within 1 1 equiline some points were above than equiline and indicated reverse ion exchange lanjwani et al 2021a b 3 8 2 gibbs diagram the distribution of cations na ca2 k and anions cl hco versus tds results were applied in the gibbs plot to approximate the dominance of evaporation precipitation and rock gibbs 1970 fig 10 a and b are based on anions versus tds and cation versus tds fig 10a showed 58 70 rock dominance and 41 30 0 indicated evaporation dominance and fig 10b also indicated 67 39 samples rock dominance and 32 61 evaporation dominance however no any sample was found in precipitation dominance source the gibbs diagram showed the dissolution of ions in water were from interaction between groundwater and the rocks 3 8 3 correlation matrix the correlation is applied to examine degree of nearness among dissimilar variables khuhawar et al 2018 the results of correlation matrix were obtained by spss software version 22 by puting average values of 21 parameters of 46 samples table 8 the cl showed strong correlation to tds and total hardness 0 7 and negatively correlated to ph so4 2 was good correlated to cl tds and th but less correlated to alkalinity na was strong correlated to cl tds th and so4 2 but less correlated to alkalinity 0 5 and negatively correlated to ph the dissolution of halite and sodium sulphate salts present in the study area was indicated the ca2 was strong correlated to th tds cl so4 2 and na but less correlated to alkalinity and k and negative correlated to ph fe was negatively correlated to alkalinity and pb was negative correlated to ph cu and ni fluoride was good correlated to tds th na cl ca2 and so4 2 and supported that the concentration of fluoride increased with the increase in the amount of tds mg was moderately correlated to alkalinity k and co 0 5 0 7 but less correlated to mn fe and pb as was less correlated to ph cr fe ni and cu but negative correlated to other parameters the correlation indicated that major water quality parameters were correlated to each other and showed that these water samples were in similar area and origin 3 8 4 piper diagram the piper trilinear plot is applied to know the hydro geochemical nature the diagrams are based on concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 and cl hco3 and so4 2 the chemical information of groundwater samples are presented by the plotting on the piper tri linear graph fig 11 the diagram exposes similarities and variances between groundwater samples piper s 1953 the diagram is useful to understand chemical compositions between water in definite terms the right triangle showed the anions concentration and left showed the cations results the right side triangle showed that most of samples dots gathered at the centre of the triangle which indicated mixed type water but some samples showed rich in cl and indicated chloride type water within 40 90 some samples also showed dominancy of hco3 left triangle for cations also indicated mixed type water and showed no dominancy of any parameter and most of the dots of samples were gathered in the centre of the triangle the mg2 ca2 and so4 2 cl were simultaneously at both sides and raised arrows to upward in diamond shape the most of samples dots gathered in between on the figure and showed mixed ca2 na hco3 type and mixed ca2 mg2 cl type water but some dots gathered to upward cl and ca2 showed that water was slightly ca2 and cl type piper diagram showed some samples are sodium chloride type also 3 8 5 cluster analysis ca the cluster analysis is multivariate methods which chiefly classify variables into cluster with higher similarity and dissimilarity level among the classes the ca was used for combination of 46 different groundwater samples by using ward s method the classification arrangement apply euclidean distance for the similarity analysis together with the help of ward process for linkages ward 1963 the maximum distinct groups where every member in the groups were more equivalent to its related member than other members of the group the cluster analysis was used to know the similarity among sampling sites fig 12 the samples were grouped into three in the dendrogram group a is based on 33 samples with similar chemical properties geochemical quality of study area and similar results of parameters the cluster b is divided in two parts b1 and b2 the cluster b1 contains 11 samples which were similar to each other and cluster b2 contain only one sample number 40 the clusters b1 and b2 are connected by common line and indicate some resemblances among the parameters the cluster c contains only 1 sample 24 it is revealed that group c has higher results than group b and a similarly clusters b1 and b2 have higher results than cluster a 3 8 6 principal component analysis pca pca analysis is applied for the factor extraction and the current study involves a preceding approximation of variation in the each parameter by factors the eigenvalues are quantity of variance clarified by every factor the factor with eigenvalue greater than 1 explained the whole variation in data of individual parameters if factor with eigenvalue value is less than 1 showed less variation than distinct variable lanjwani 2020 lanjwani and channa 2019 hence only those factor with eigenvalue greater than 1 were taken for explanation and were exposed to varimax rotation coefficient correlation 0 75 is considered powerful correlation between 0 50 and 0 75 is known as moderate loading while 0 30 to 0 50 is weak loading it comprises loading components for rotated matrix eigenvalues cumulative and variance for every component it indicates five principal components with cumulative account composed for 81 447 of the whole variance of dataset first component cumulative is 47 309 second 57 380 and third 66 246 fourth 74 990 fifth 81 447 of total variance table 9 the component 1 is with eigenvalues

cobalt indicated medium loading 0 610 0 689 and f cu cr and o po4 3 were with less positive loading 0 5 component 2 indicated eigenvalues 2 216 and variance 10 071 and showed high loading for mn and cr 0 7 and low positive and negative loading for all other parameters the component 3 eigenvalues 1 951 and variance loading 8 866 had positive loading for as and cu 0 7 the component 4 which had eigenvalues 1 924 and variance 8 744 and indicated good positive loading for no3 0 7 and moderate positive loading for pb the component 5 which had eigenvalues 1 421 and variance loading 6 457 showed positive loading for alkalinity and nickel 0 7 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo value for samples adequacy was calculated 0 797 spss 22 and showed acceptable samples adequacy kaiser 1974 pca reflects arrangement of components within water bodies of the area and results indicated that component 1 showed a number of parameters strongly correlated to each other and supported a similar geological origin 4 irrigation water quality for the growth of plant type quality of soil and suitability of water are vital constituent the poor quality of water used for irrigation purposes may disturb the crop production the agriculture applies chemical fertilizers insecticides and pesticides and have major concern on groundwater salinity hazards sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na permeability index pi residual sodium carbonate kelly s index ki and chloro alkaline indices cai were used to explain the suitability of groundwater for agriculture 4 1 richards and wilcox diagrams ec versus sar and ec vs na the richards and wilcox diagrams were applied to assess the groundwater quality for irrigation uses the diagram ec versus sar where the s represents sar and c represents the salinity values in terms of ec the results presented that no any sample was found in low sar and low salinity and category c1 s1 the 3 6 52 samples were found in medium salinity low sar c2 s1 and these may be used for irrigation fig 13 a the 13 28 26 samples were found in high salinity and low sar category c3 s1 which requires drainage control 6 15 22 samples were found in very high salinity and low sar category c4 s1 which is unsuitable for irrigation under the ordinary condition 18 39 13 samples were in very high salinity and medium sar c4 s2 which required very special managements before uses and 6 15 22 samples were found in very high salinity and high sar c4 s3 fig 13 which is unsuitable for irrigation qishlaqi et al 2017 the diagram presented that majority of samples were found in high salinity and medium sar category wilcox diagram ec versus sodium percentage na fig 10b results showed that 3 6 52 samples were found in excellent to good category and can be used for irrigation purposes 16 34 78 samples were in good to permissible these may be used for agriculture 12 26 08 samples were found in doubtful to unsuitable and 15 32 61 samples were present in unsuitable category with high ec and high na and cannot be used for irrigation lanjwani et al 2020c the diagram presented that majority of samples were found in doubtful to unsuitable category and these can t be used for irrigation purposes without very high controlled managements 4 2 salinity hazard the salinity hazard of water is categorized into four categories using electrical conductivity results as reported lanjwani et al 2020a low salinity groundwater ec 500 μs cm is used for most cultivation with the possibility that no salinity of soil will be developed the present study did not show any sample in this category the ec 500 1000 μs cm medium salinity can be used if soil is washed with sufficient volume of water the water can be used for crops which grow with sufficient amount of the salt without special actions for regulation of salinity the 6 13 04 samples were present in this category ec 1000 2250 μs cm high salinity can be applied on soils with well ordered drainage superior regulation of the salinity and selection of crops are essential for the soils with proper drainage the 14 30 43 samples were present in this category ec 3000 μs cm very high salinity is not fitting for crops however it can be used in special situations the soil should be permeable drainage must be acceptable water is used in higher quantities for soil leaching to cultivate crops with high salt tolerance 26 56 52 samples were present in this category fig 14 4 2 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar was calculated by comparative level of na with ca2 and mg2 in the water haritash et al 2016 the sar values of study area varied from 0 52 to 9 31 meq l the 93 48 of groundwater samples were fit for crops with sar value below 6 and 6 52 were unfit for the cultivation 4 2 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc the higher concentrations of bicarbonates and carbonates over ca2 and mg2 affect the fitness of water das and nag 2015 the rsc value of all groundwater samples were found in safe category 1 25 meq l the rsc values were varied from negative to 0 45 meq l 4 2 3 soluble sodium percentage na the excess concentration of sodium decreases the soil permeability destroys structure of soil tak et al 2012 the na values ranged from 14 0 to 50 70 the 80 43 of samples were good for irrigation 20 40 na and 19 57 samples were permissible for agriculture purposes 40 60 na 4 2 4 permeability index pi the influence of long term agriculture does leads to decrease in the soil permeability in the area the ions na mg2 hco3 and ca2 in the water effect permeability of soil gopinath et al 2015 doneen 1962 categorized the pi for the irrigation the permeability index results were between 20 1 and 105 according to this study the 32 61 samples had high pi 75 class i and were good for crops and 41 30 samples pi 50 75 class ii were fit for crops and 26 08 samples were 50 class iii and were unfit for crops 4 2 5 kelley s index ki kelly s index is applied to known the fitness of water for crops the na is examined against mg2 and ca2 and is applied to calculate kelly s index for crop the kelly s ratio of 97 83 samples were suitable for irrigation ki 1 and 2 17 samples ki values were higher than 1 and were unsuitable for irrigation ki values were found from 0 14 to 1 02 meq l 4 2 6 chloro alkaline indices cai the cai is an essential to classify the variations in chemical process of groundwater lanjwani et al 2020a which designate ion exchange among the water and its host atmosphere the cai 1 is used to evaluate the base exchange the cai 1 values of current study were found from 0 03 to 0 75 the cai 1 showed that 45 65 of the samples were with negative ve ratio and 54 34 samples were positive ve ratio 4 2 7 chloride sulphate ratio chloride sulphate ratio is applied to calculate water suitability for crops uses if cl sulphate so4 2 ratio is higher than one water sample is saline and unfit for crops al harbi et al 2009 the chloride sulphate results were found from 0 21 to 4 51 the 35 76 08 samples chloride sulphate ratio was higher than one and 11 23 91 samples were less than one 4 2 8 chloride bicarbonate ratio chloride bicarbonate ratio is applied to calculate water suitability for crops uses if cl hco3 ratio is higher than one water sample is not fit irrigation uses lanjwani et al 2020a the chloride bicarbonate of area were found from 0 12 to 18 82 the 26 56 52 samples cl hco3 were higher than one and 20 43 47 samples were below than one 5 conclusion the aim of current study was to examine the groundwater quality of talukas of district kamber shahdadkot this was first effort to analyzed the quality of groundwater on scientific basis using gis wqi and contamination index in addition of geospatial tools gis maps were applied to recognise the spatial distribution of groundwater for drinking as well as irrigation indices and hydrochemical modelling the analyzed samples were compared with who standard for drinking water the values of electrical conductivity and tds of 76 10 were higher than who limits fluoride results of 80 44 samples crossed the allowable limits 1 5 mg l but 58 69 samples indicated hazardous fluoride above 3 mg l
