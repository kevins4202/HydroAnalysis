3085,linked hydro agronomic modeling systems are often used to evaluate the impact of climate change or management strategies on both groundwater and crop yield however these modeling studies have been performed without a detailed assessment of the factors that jointly control groundwater storage and crop yield the objective of this paper is to present results from a study that applied sensitivity analysis to the linked dssat modflow modeling system to determine the governing environmental and management factors that control groundwater storage and crop yield in an intensively irrigated groundwater region basin methods are applied to finney county in southwest kansas usa sensitivity analysis was accomplished using the morris screening method followed by the sobol variance based method using random sampling a combination of soil hydrologic plant cultivar and climate parameters are included in the analysis a combination of python scripts and simlab pre and post processing routines were used to generate values of parameters update model files for dssat and modflow run the model simulations and calculate sensitivity indices results indicate that climatic parameters account for 44 29 40 and 36 variation in maize soybean winter wheat and sorghum yields hydrogeologic parameters i e hydraulic conductivity specific yield and riverbed conductance have relatively low influence on crop yield water table elevation recharge and irrigation pumping are considerably sensitive to soil and climate related parameters while evapotranspiration river leakage and groundwater discharge are highly influenced by hydrogeological parameters these results can be used to explore effects of management strategies on groundwater and agricultural sustainability in similar regions in the face of a changing climate keywords irrigation groundwater climate dssat modflow sensitivity analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction

in the western united states aliyari et al 2021 and the linked dssat modflow system xiang et al 2020 which links irrigation demand and groundwater pumping on an annual basis although these studies have provided important management information none have performed a systematic analysis of the domain factors that control they key system responses groundwater storage and crop yield such an understanding can provide valuable insights into 1 causes for groundwater depletion 2 sustainable management strategies and 3 possible future trends of groundwater depletion and crop yield in such

mccallum et al 2010 and assess contributions of genetic parameters makowski et al 2006 no study has used sa to identify system parameters that control groundwater storage and crop yield in a coupled groundwater agronomic system using the coupled system is important as one response can control the other e g cultivation practices can dictate the amount of pumping required which affects groundwater storage or the availability of groundwater can determine the amount of cultivation and associated irrigation that the system can undergo applying sa to this system can provide insights into the system that could not be achieved by assessing either system independently the objective of this paper is to determine the governing environmental and management factors that control groundwater storage and crop yield in an intensively cultivated and irrigated groundwater region with an approach of quantitative measures of governing systematic factors the is accomplished by applying global sa morris method for screening parameters and sobol method for quantifying parameter influence to a linked groundwater agronomic modeling system of a region of the high plains aquifer hpa usa that has experienced severe groundwater depletion in recent years and decades specifically the newly published linked dssat modflow model xiang et al 2020 is applied to the land surface subsurface system of southwest kansas for the sa approach 61 parameters 4 climate 10 soil 3 hydrogeologic 44 cultivars genetic are investigated for influence on crop yield and groundwater storage through time the use of a linked model which allows for groundwater storage and cultivation practices to influence each other on an annual time scale allows through the sa approach the quantification of the influence of each models parameters on the other model s system response e g how cultivate genetic parameters influence groundwater storage and water table or how aquifer hydraulic conductivity affects crop growth and crop yield this is a novel approach that can yield valuable insights that are not possible when using these models separately results from this study can have important implications for overall water management in these irrigated regions for the hpa and other aquifers experiencing overdraft due to cultivation 2 materials and methods this section provides details about the dssat modflow modeling system its application to the study region in southwest kansas and the implementation of sa to identify the system parameters that govern groundwater storage and crop yield the study region will be presented first to provide context for the subsequent description of methods the overall description of dssat modflow theory and linkage and its initial application and testing to the study region was detailed in xiang et al 2020 2 1 study region finney county kansas the high plains aquifer hpa also referred to as the ogallala aquifer is one of the largest fresh groundwater sources in the world with a total area of 450 000 km2 174 000 mi2 partially covering eight central states including south dakota wyoming nebraska colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas fig 1 a the agricultural area of the aquifer region provides 30 of total crop and animal production for the u s a guru and horne 2001 rosenberg et al 1999 accounting for 41 i e 20 irrigated cropland in the u s a of total land area with an annual production of over 35 billion basso et al 2013 of crops produced in the hpa 86 is for row crops and small grains and 14 is for pasture alfalfa and fallow lands usgs high plains aquifer wlms physical cultural setting n d approximately 90 of water pumped from the hpa is used for agricultural irrigation compared with 42 of groundwater withdrawn for cropland in other regions of the u s a gollehon and winston 2013 scanlon et al 2012 the composition of aquifer material in the hpa consists of poorly sorted clay silt sand and gravel and the composition of bedrock unit is siltstone shale loosely to moderately cemented clay and silt chalk limestone dolomite conglomerate claystone gypsum anhydrite and bedded salt the range of the elevation of aquifer bedrock is from 366 m 1200ft to 1829 m 6000ft gutentag et al 1984 due to excessive pumping for agricultural irrigation the hpa has experienced severe depletion in the past few decades between 1960 and 2008 groundwater storage has decreased by 360 km3 accounting for 36 of total groundwater depletion in u s a while the change in water table elevation varies from a decline of 78 m 256 ft to a rise of 26 m 85 ft with an average of 5 m 16ft in decline accounting for 9 of the area weighted average saturated thickness mcguire 2014 declines have taken place mainly in eastern colorado southwest kansas the panhandle of oklahoma and northwest texas increases have occurred in central nebraska due to higher precipitation rates composition of soil layer e g the sandy soils that allow more infiltration and percolation and the presence of streams for surface water irrigation finney county fig 1 105 218 ha 260 000 ac located in southwestern kansas was chosen as the study region for this research due to a strong dependence on groundwater pumping 1 629 wells for irrigation resulting in water table elevation declines up to 15 m since 1950 main crop types cultivated in this region are corn maize winter wheat soybeans sorghum and triticale fig 1 shows the location of finney county within southwest kansas and the broader high plains aquifer 1a the groundwater table depth in 1960 1b the crop type in 2006 and the location of

linked model the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 is a computer program that can used on over 40 crops to simulate growth development and yield on the basis of the dynamics among the soil plant atmosphere system the dssat cropping modeling system model requires input information e g weather soil crop management cultivar genetic coefficient data etc to perform agronomic simulations the model is designed for single field applications modflow harbaugh 2005 is a 3d groundwater flow model widely used to simulate groundwater head groundwater storage and groundwater flow rates in both confined and unconfined aquifers the aquifer domain is discretized into grid cells horizontally and vertically with each cell representing a volume of aquifer and provided values of hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage in addition to a suite of groundwater sources and sinks e g recharge pumping groundwater discharge to streams stream seepage to groundwater groundwater et the finite difference method is used to solve for groundwater head for each grid cell for each time step of a specified simulation period the span of the simulation period is first divided into stress periods i e a simulation time that groundwater stresses stay constant and then into time steps the linked dssat modflow modeling system shown in fig 2 was developed xiang et al 2020 to exchange information between the groundwater system i e water table elevation saturated thickness and well capacity and the agronomic system i e irrigation depth and volume of drained water from the soil profile that recharges the aquifer on an annual basis so that each system can be impacted by the other as the simulation of each model depends on output from the other model we consider this to be a loosely coupled system due to the deep groundwater levels and therefore no interaction between the water table and the soil profile we consider this to be acceptable for the study region the data flow within the linked dssat modflow system is shown in fig 2 the simulation of the whole linked hydro agronomic system contains four steps step 1 is an ensemble of dssat simulations with a single dssat simulation for each cultivated field in the study region with a spatial module mode through a batch file input information includes soil type weather data and cultivar genetic information in input files sol wth cul respectively to trigger agronomic simulations through spatial input files of gsx for each crop type step 2 is the conversion of dssat outputs to inputs for modflow python programming language is used as the linkage script python phase 1 to convert daily field based irrigation depth and recharge depth simulated by dssat to daily grid cell based pumping rates and recharge rates for modflow simulations xiang et al 2020 python phase 1 is also used for preparing modflow input files step 3 is the modflow simulation modflow simulates groundwater hydraulic head i e water table elevation for unconfined aquifers for each gird cell with daily stress periods to be consistent with daily outputs by dssat for daily pumping and recharge rates the hydraulic head in the last day of year is saved as initial head for the subsequent year step 4 is to i calculate well capacity for each irrigation well in terms of saturated thickness i e water table elevation bedrock elevation ii update irrigation frequency i e irrigation parameter for dssat simulation based on well capacity in i and iii create input files for dssat simulations of the following year i e cul eco and gsx all detailed information about modflow dssat and the linkage procedure is demonstrated in xiang et al 2020 2 3 dssat modflow application to finney county kansas for finney county dssat was previously calibrated for corn wheat sorghum and soybean araya et al 2017 for application with the dssat modflow framework each of the 1 332 cultivated fields are included 564 484 28 206 and 50 fields for corn winter wheat soybean sorghum and triticale respectively fig 1c with a single dssat simulation for each field the modflow model for groundwater management district no 3 gmd3 see gray shaded area fig 1a developed by the kansas geological survey kgs liu et al 2011 was used to link with dssat the modflow model includes a steady state simulation and transient simulation in the period of 1944 1946 and 1947 2007 respectively the domain area of kgs model is 161 km by 241 km 100 miles by 150 miles shown in grey area in fig 1a and each grid cell is 1 61 km by 1 61 km 1 mile by 1 mile to be consistent with daily irrigation and recharge depths from dssat for daily pumping and recharge rates the modflow model was converted to daily stress periods requiring files to be updated e g discretization file dis recharge package file rch and time variant specified head package file chd and stream package file str as described in xiang et al 2020 the dssat modflow model was run for the 2000 2007 time period and tested against measured groundwater levels and county wide crop yield 2 4 framework for sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa was applied to the dssat modflow model provided in xiang et al 2020 to qualitatively morris screening method and quantitatively sobol method evaluate the factors governing groundwater storage and crop yield in finney county kansas in so doing we attempt to provide general insights and conclusions for groundwater irrigated regions that are experiencing groundwater overdraft in total 61 parameters were included in the sa based on saltelli et al 2004 sa explores how variation in model input factors influence uncertainty related to the model outputs sensitivity analysis is generally classified into two groups 1 local sensitivity analysis lsa and 2 global sensitivity analysis gsa lsa assesses the local impact of the variation in inputs on model response through evaluating the gradient or partial derivative of model outputs in vicinity of nominal values of the input factors while gsa apportions the uncertainty of model outputs to the variation of each input parameter in their entire range of interest lsa is implemented by altering one value of an input with other values of input factors remaining constant whereas in gsa all input factors are changed simultaneously over the entire range of each input factor zhou and lin 2017 the limitations of lsa are 1 not applicable for nonlinear models frey and patil 2002 and 2 interactions between parameters are not considered saltelli et al 2008 therefore gsa was applied in this study to quantitatively evaluate factors governing the hydro agronomic system 2 4 1 morris screening method the morris sa is a gsa method developed by morris 1991 to reduce the model complexity through identifying the non influential input factors using one at a time oat design with several incremental ratios called elementary effects ee the distribution of ee that is related to each input parameter is acquired by randomly sampling the space of model input parameters two sensitivity measurements obtained by the morris screening method are µ measuring the primary effect of an input factor on model response and σ describing interaction effects of a parameter with other parameters with nonlinear effects the potential results that can be determined by the morris method are negligible linear nonlinear or involved in interactions with other parameters in terms of µ and σ to estimate two measurements morris 1991 suggested that the number of executions is determined by the following relationship eq 1 1 n r k 1 where n is the number of executable model runs r is the number of trajectories usually 4 to 10 and k is the number of input factors of a model 2 4 2 sobol variance based method the sobol variance based sa offers quantitative measurements e g first order second order total order sensitivity indices etc to obtain the percentage of each input parameters contribution to the distribution of uncertainty of model responses compared with the first order index the total order index is a more relatively reliable measurement of the effect of an input factor on model output due to the consideration of interactions of a parameter with other parameters to implement sobol sensitivity analysis for obtaining first order and total order indices the number of simulation runs needed is determined by 2 n n 2 k 2 where n is the sample size for estimation of one individual effect and k is the number of input parameters 2 4 3 quantitative measures of governing systematic factors input factors are classified into 7 groups maize genetic parameters sorghum genetic parameters winter wheat genetic parameters soybean genetic parameters hydrogeologic parameters soil related parameters and climate related parameters the equation is created below to quantitatively determine governing systematic factors relying on groups for different systematic responses i e agronomic and hydrological responses 3 mgsf i 1 n i i i t where mgsf stands for measures of governing systematic factors i is the ith input factor in the group n is the number of input factors in that group i i is the sobol total order index for ith parameter and i t indicates the summation of total order indices for all parameters in the system for different systematic responses the groups of input factors maintain the similar configuration however changing values of mgsf indicate varying groups governing model performance responses 2 4 4 overall sensitivity analysis framework since dssat integrates genotype environmental experimental data and management data it is considerably driven by cultivar genetic climate related and soil related parameters jones et al 2015 li et al 2018 mourice et al 2014 rezzoug et al 2008 in addition movement of groundwater in confined and unconfined aquifers exceptionally depends on property of geologic formations of soil sand and rock with relation to hydrogeologic parameters of specific yield xiao et al 2021 and hydraulic conductivity gómez hernández and gorelick 1989 furthermore to quantify interactions between groundwater and surface water riverbed conductance wei and bailey 2019 is also another significant factor for the hydro agronomic system therefore 57 parameters see table s1 in supplementary information including 44 cultivar parameters dssat model 10 soil parameters dssat model e g evaporation limit drainage rate runoff curve number saturated water limit and 3 hydrogeologic parameters modflow model hydraulic conductivity specific yield riverbed hydraulic conductance are selected for the morris screening method based on equ 1 580 model simulations were run for the morris method calculations the sobol method was then applied only to the most influential parameters as identified by the morris screening method in addition to four climate related parameters i e maximum temperature minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation the climate parameters were not screened by the morris method due to their importance in the hydro agronomic system jones et al 2003 kour et al 2016 as described in section 3 24 parameters of the 57 initial parameters were identified in the morris screening method as being influential with the additional four climate parameters and according to equ 2 the number of dssat modflow model simulations run in the sobol method was 14 848 model results were processed using simlab simlab version 2 2 simulation environment for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 2004 the framework for implementing sa with the dssat modflow linked system is described in fig 3 the major task of prior processing is to create sample files for the morris screening and sobol sensitivity analysis respectively based on identified parameters with prior distribution and range of parameters using the random sampling method python phase 1 see fig 3 is used to update input files i e cul eco sol and wth for dssat and kst dat sys dat and str for modflow for the hydro agronomic modeling system in terms of values of parameters in the dssat experiments in the sample file to reduce computation cost parallel simulations through batch files are introduced for all model runs on computing servers the post processing procedure has two main tasks 1 organize outputs of model responses fitting them to the format of input files for simlab to obtain qualitative and quantitative measurements and 2 visualize the evaluations of sa fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening parameters using morris method the results of qualitative measurements using the morris screening sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 4 a b c d and e for maize yield soybean yield wheat yield sorghum yield and water table elevation respectively as shown in fig 4a most parameters are located within µ σ plane below the 1 1 diagonal line showing the parameters primarily influence on maize yield with little interactions with other parameters the larger the value of µ the more the effect a parameter has on maize yield therefore rue g3 p5 p1 slpf and g2 encompassed within a purple rectangle in fig 4a with large µ indicates maize yield is relatively more sensitive to these parameters i e those parameters considerably affect uncertainty of maize yield the parameters are further analyzed quantitatively using the sobol variance based method sdul i e drained upper limit is also greatly influential to maize yield even not included for the quantitative analysis using the sobol method which is consistent with a research result by he et al 2016 soil water content is a major limiting factor to restrict plant growth which is mainly controlled by sdul and other soil related parameters for soybean yield shown in fig 4b there are more interactions among soybean related genetic and soil related parameters and the parameters with high µ and σ are selected for later quantitative analysis contained in the purple rectangle in fig 4b in addition since the entire hydro agronomic system is focused on a system instead of a single hydrological agronomic system or one crop type parameters from the other system or crop model routines affect other model responses phint is one of the maize related genetic parameters but it increases the uncertainty of wheat yield fig 4c in general interactions with other parameters are important in understanding the factors that govern the entire system results for sorghum yield are shown in fig 4d indicating that the genetic parameters mainly influence the uncertainty in simulated sorghum yield with strong interaction with other parameters water table elevation fig 4e is significantly driven by soil related parameters especially sdul and slll with relation to soil water capacity soil specific yield and overall drainage of soil water to the underlying aquifer due to their influence on recharge to the water table overall soil parameters have a strong influence on both crop yield and groundwater levels the most influential twenty eight twenty four identified from the morris method four climate parameters parameters see table 1 were selected for inclusion in the sobol method 3 2 quantitative ranking of parameters using sobol method results of the sobol method are shown in figs 5 and 6 and first and total order indices of 28 parameters for both agronomic and hydrological responses are shown in tables s2 and s3 in supplemental information fig 5 summarizes the sensitivity indices for crop yield and fig 6 summarizes indices for hydrologic system responses water table elevation groundwater et recharge irrigation pumping river leakage groundwater discharge based on results shown in fig 5 the most influential system factors in controlling crop yield are climate factors cultivar genetic factors and soil factors with aquifer properties showing negligible effect climate parameters contribute strongly to crop yield and they also highly interact with other parameters in terms of the difference of first and total order indices for maize fig 5a wheat fig 5c and sorghum fig 5d tmax has the greatest control on crop yield followed by generally rainfall rain solar radiation srad and soil drainage properties slll sdul soybean fig 5b has similar parameter effects but also a strong influence by genetics e g csdld critical short day length for reproductive progress temperatures affect stages of crop growth and rain amount dictates the amount of irrigation i e groundwater pumping that is required for maintaining crop yield and temperature affects stages of crop growth of course cultivar parameters dictate growth stages during the growing season from a systems point of view for those four major crop types crop yields are not controlled by their own cultivar genetic parameters alone but also by other cultivar genetic parameters for example besides maize genetic parameters several winter wheat and soybean cultivar genetic parameters are interactively sensitive to maize yield similarly this situation occurs in other crop types therefore to have accurate simulations of crop yields the different cultivar genetic parameters for the crops within the simulated system should be included in calibration the absence of impact by aquifer properties on crop yield indicates that although groundwater depletion occurs in this region aquifer properties do not impact the ability of the system to supply irrigation water to cultivated fields likely aquifer properties will have an impact only when declining groundwater levels approach the aquifer bedrock interface and local hydraulic conductivity can affect the amount of groundwater that can reach pumping wells during the growing season therefore from the standpoint of sa in the linked system likely the inclusion of the modflow model in the modeling system is not necessary to determine the factors that govern crop yield this is an important result as it provides insights into when the inclusion of physically based groundwater models are necessary to include in agronomic modeling and sa first if groundwater levels are in close proximity to the soil profile in which soil profile hydrology and plant growth routines are affected by the presence of groundwater and second if groundwater levels are in close proximity to the aquifer bedrock interface which groundwater storage many not satisfy irrigation demand for crop growth the current conditions of the study region are in an in between phase where groundwater storage is adequate to satisfy ongoing irrigation however we would expect that as irrigation continues and groundwater levels continue to decline the influence of aquifer properties k sy cond will play a larger role in governing crop yield fig 6 shows quantitative results of parameters for hydrologic responses i e water table elevation et recharge irrigation pumping river leakage and aquifer seepage of parameters simulated by the sobol approach parameters of soil properties i e sldr slll and sdul and climate conditions i e rain tmax tmin and srad primarily drive the process of recharge shown in fig 6c with similar outcomes conducted by mccallum et al 2010 and crosbie et al 2013 for climate conditions and by wang et al 2015 for soil properties climate and soil drainage parameters have the strong influence on water table elevation due to their influence on recharge which controls groundwater levels this relationship between recharge and water table elevation is seen through the similar parameter sensitivity magnitudes for both shown in fig 6a and fig 6c respectively the minor difference of sensitivities between recharge and water table elevation occurred in parameters related to cultivar genetic since crop growth needs to take up water pumped from groundwater sources aquifer specific yield sy has a small control on water table elevation due to sy being a representation of available pore space and hence governing the vertical rise and fall of groundwater levels given incoming recharge for groundwater et fig 6b many parameters contribute to its simulation with very low first order indices and high total order indices indicating strong interaction among parameters causing the high degree of uncertainty of et however as will be discussed in section 3 4 the overall volume of groundwater et is very small compared to other groundwater sources and sinks and hence the high parameter sensitivity shown in fig 6d does not have much bearing on overall system performance pumping fig 6d is controlled primarily by climate parameters and soil drainage parameters climate rainfall temperature determines the need for irrigation water i e groundwater pumping and soil properties can change water content in soil layer which triggers irrigation events in the dssat modeling system river water seepage to the aquifer fig 6e is controlled primarily by riverbed conductance whereas groundwater discharge to the river fig 6f is controlled by a combination of riverbed conductance soil drainage properties and temperature due to the influence of recharge and pumping on groundwater levels and gradients which control the rate of groundwater flows to the river system in general these results indicate a complex system of interacting environmental factors of note is that except for groundwater surface water interactions fig 6e 6f climate variables and soil properties have a much stronger influence on hydrologic fluxes recharge et pumping than hydrogeologic factors k hydraulic conductivity sy specific yield climate impacts crop germination growth and irrigation needs and therefore controls the overall response of crop yield and pumping in the region therefore in contrast to the results for crop yield fig 5 which exhibited no influence of groundwater parameters on crop yield these results suggest that land surface and crop growth parameters have moderate to strong influences on groundwater storage and related groundwater sources and sinks therefore whereas in this region the controls on crop yield could be determined from stand along agronomic models controls on groundwater storage and fluxes requires the linkage with the agronomic model 3 3 parameters quantitively contributing to uncertainty of model responses the contribution of each model parameter to model outputs crop yields hydrologic fluxes is quantified further using frequency distribution plots and pie charts information of quantitative measures of governing systematic factors is summarized in table 2 shown in fig 7 crop yields and fig 8 hydrologic fluxes the left side of each subplot in fig 7 and fig 8 shows the distribution of uncertainty of model responses compared with uncertainties of hydrological responses fig 8 uncertainties of agronomic response fig 7 generally have wider dispersions for maize yield fig 7a over 55 of the uncertainty is due to climate related 44 2 and soil related 13 5 parameters climate and soil parameters account for 34 73 and 50 of yield uncertainty for soybeans fig 7b wheat fig 7c and sorghum fig 7d hydrological responses have less uncertainty in terms of shape and range of distributions with narrow and peaked distributions results are summarized in fig 8 note that the scales of hydrologic fluxes on the axis of each chart in fig 8 vary in magnitude to provide more accurate visualization recharge fig 8c and pumping fig 8d have much larger magnitudes than et fig 8b stream seepage fig 8e and groundwater discharge fig 8f soil related parameters considerably affect water table elevation 44 of uncertainty and recharge 53 of uncertainty with relation to interaction between soil properties and the amount of water that passes from the soil profile to the water table fig 8a c as shown in fig 8b uncertainty of et is caused by all parameters with almost even uncertainty in input factors to et over 80 of uncertainty in irrigation pumping can be attributed to soil related climate related and hydrogeological parameters fig 8d mainly due to the control of these parameters on rainfall and crop growth which triggers irrigation events and associated pumping stream seepage to the aquifer fig 8e and groundwater discharge to streams fig 8f are controlled by riverbed conductance climate parameters and to a lesser degree crop genetic parameters 3 4 comparison of model responses under extreme conditions although model results can exhibit high sensitivity to model parameters the values of parameters may not have a strong influence on the overall movement of water within the linked groundwater agronomic system to demonstrate this and to quantify the influence of parameters on model responses we ran additional dssat modflow model simulations using 1 the minimum values and 2 the maximum values of the parameters with the highest sensitivity index for example as recharge is governed by sdul drained upper limit we selected the minimum and maximum value of sdul and ran two simulations to determine the resulting difference in recharge volumes with comparison to original volumes of the baseline simulation i e 16 313 840 m3 for et 159 131 449 m3 for groundwater discharge 72 440 221 m3 for river leakage 877 641 153 m3 for recharge and 2 651 042 093 m3 for groundwater pumping the relative percentage change in hydrologic fluxes are 4 to 7 8 to 20 60 to 120 31 to 111 and 13 to 15 for et groundwater discharge river leakage recharge and groundwater pumping respectively results for groundwater fluxes fig 9 a show that recharge rch is drastically changed approximately by 3 times when this parameter ranges from the minimum value to the maximum value whereas the other groundwater fluxes change only minimally therefore for parameters that have a high sensitivity index for a given system response three conditions can result 1 average flux volumes are low and changes in parameter values result in minimal flux volume change this is the case for groundwater et compare the sensitivity indices in fig 6b to the volumes in fig 9a 2 average flux volumes are high but changes in parameter values result in minimal flux volume change this is the case for groundwater discharge spg river seepage lkg and groundwater pumping wel 3 average flux volumes are high and changes in parameter values result in large flux volume change this is the case for recharge rch recharge amount is controlled strongly by climate and soil drainage properties which can have a large influence on groundwater levels and groundwater storage groundwater pumping wel on the other hand continues to occur based on irrigation demand due to availability of groundwater therefore for managing the system and forecasting future groundwater levels and groundwater storage climate and soil properties must be known with certainty the change in groundwater pumping volume is demonstrated by the change in water table elevation shown in fig 9c for each modflow grid cell in the finney county area some locations have a difference of up to 14 m which is severe compared to observed decadal changes in the region the largest changes in water table elevation occur in areas of maize compared with crop type distribution in fig 1c similarly fig 9b shows the change in crop yield when the values of the respective influential parameters are implemented in the simulations maximum temperature is the most sensitive parameter for maize sorghum and wheat yield but higher maximum temperature for maize and wheat has negatively impact on crop yields indicating maximum temperature should be in a reasonable range kassie et al 2016 the soybean yield is mostly driven by a cultivar genetic parameter of csdl and the difference between the two scenarios is 2670 kg ha for each crop the yield values shown in fig 9b represent a change of 29 2 567 13 and 20 respectively for maize soybean sorghum and wheat compared to crop yields of the baseline simulation i e 12 356 kg ha for maize 2 436 kg ha for soybean 11 244 kg ha for sorghum and 10 561 kg ha for wheat the relative percentage change in crop yields is 71 to 62 96 to 10 79 to 76 and 32 to 18 for maize soybean sorghum and wheat respectively under scenarios with minimum and maximum values of the corresponding most sensitive parameters 4 summary and conclusions two sensitivity analyses i e morris screening method and sobol variance based method were applied to a groundwater irrigated hydro agronomic system to assess the governing system factors on crop yield and groundwater storage the dssat modflow linked modeling system was used as the simulator a combination of python scripts and simlab pre and post processing were used to generate parameter values update model files for dssat and modflow run the model simulations and calculate sensitivity indices for both the morris method and the sobol method fifty seven parameters were reduced to 24 parameters after the morris screening method and the sensitivity of 28 parameters including 4 climate related parameters were analyzed on 10 model responses i e maize yield soybean yield winter wheat yield sorghum yield water table elevation et recharge irrigation pumping river leakage and aquifer seepage using sobol variance based sensitivity analysis from the results we conclude that climate related parameters significantly affect crop yields especially for maize and sorghum and soybean and winter wheat yields are sensitive to a combination of cultivar genetic parameters soil related parameters and climate related parameters climatic parameters account for 44 29 40 and 36 variation in yield of maize soybean winter wheat and sorghum hydrogeologic parameters i e aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer specific yield and riverbed conductance have a relatively low influence on crop yields hydrological responses show variations in influential parameters water table elevation recharge and irrigation pumping are considerably sensitive to soil and climate related parameters while et river leakage and aquifer seepage are highly influenced by hydrogeological parameter e g riverbed conductance and specific yield shown in fig 6 soil parameters account for 44 20 50 and 34 variation in water table elevation et recharge and irrigation pumping although parameters may have a high sensitivity index in controlling hydrologic fluxes the overall change in flux volumes is not large enough to warrant special attention to these parameters in management schemes for example many cultivars soil climate and hydrogeologic parameters have a high sensitivity index for groundwater et and groundwater surface water interactions however when assessing the groundwater budget for the entire study region the overall flux volumes and the change in volumes due to parameter changes are minimal compared to groundwater recharge and pumping in general we emphasize that for this region where groundwater levels are deep but not near the aquifer bedrock interface results for crop yield could be obtained by stand alone dssat models but accurate results for groundwater storage and groundwater fluxes could be obtained only through linking modflow with the dssat agronomic system and the inclusion of climate soil and cultivar genetic parameters in the sa routines these results point to the general importance of soil water management and climatic patterns in groundwater irrigated regions they can be helpful from the perspective of understanding what might increase crop yield and conserve groundwater and also what parameters should receive more attention in field sampling and monitoring although the study area is in a region with sparse rainfall and hence the need for ongoing pumping climate plays an important role in crop yield principally through maximum daily temperature and solar radiation therefore future climate change will have an ever increasing impact on crop production and associated groundwater conservation even without accounting for future changing rainfall patterns climate cannot be controlled by local water managers and growers however they should be made aware of the implications of increasing temperatures on crop yields and hydrologic fluxes in these systems for hydrologic fluxes climate and soil parameters have approximately the same influence pointing to the need for advanced irrigation systems that increase irrigation efficiency and the awareness and quantification of soil drainage properties also since the influence of maximum temperature on crop growth is exacerbated by water deficits hatfield and prueger 2015 a minimum level of soil water content should be maintained throughout the growing season these general results are applicable to other regions within the high plains aquifer and similar groundwater irrigated systems and the methods presented herein can serve as a guide for identifying controlling factors in other hydro agronomic systems credit authorship

3085,linked hydro agronomic modeling systems are often used to evaluate the impact of climate change or management strategies on both groundwater and crop yield however these modeling studies have been performed without a detailed assessment of the factors that jointly control groundwater storage and crop yield the objective of this paper is to present results from a study that applied sensitivity analysis to the linked dssat modflow modeling system to determine the governing environmental and management factors that control groundwater storage and crop yield in an intensively irrigated groundwater region basin methods are applied to finney county in southwest kansas usa sensitivity analysis was accomplished using the morris screening method followed by the sobol variance based method using random sampling a combination of soil hydrologic plant cultivar and climate parameters are included in the analysis a combination of python scripts and simlab pre and post processing routines were used to generate values of parameters update model files for dssat and modflow run the model simulations and calculate sensitivity indices results indicate that climatic parameters account for 44 29 40 and 36 variation in maize soybean winter wheat and sorghum yields hydrogeologic parameters i e hydraulic conductivity specific yield and riverbed conductance have relatively low influence on crop yield water table elevation recharge and irrigation pumping are considerably sensitive to soil and climate related parameters while evapotranspiration river leakage and groundwater discharge are highly influenced by hydrogeological parameters these results can be used to explore effects of management strategies on groundwater and agricultural sustainability in

mccallum et al 2010 and assess contributions of genetic parameters makowski et al 2006 no study has used sa to identify system parameters that control groundwater storage and crop yield in a coupled groundwater agronomic system using the coupled system is important as one response can control the other e g cultivation practices can dictate the amount of pumping required which affects groundwater storage or the availability of groundwater can determine the amount of cultivation and associated irrigation that the system can undergo applying sa to this system can provide insights into the system that could not be achieved by assessing either system independently the objective of this paper is to determine the governing environmental and management factors that control groundwater storage and crop yield in an intensively cultivated and irrigated groundwater region with an approach of quantitative measures of governing systematic factors the is accomplished by applying global sa morris method for screening parameters and sobol method for quantifying parameter influence to a linked groundwater agronomic modeling system of a region of the high plains aquifer hpa usa that has experienced severe groundwater depletion in recent years and decades specifically the newly published linked dssat modflow model xiang et al 2020 is applied to the land surface subsurface system of southwest kansas for the sa approach 61 parameters 4 climate 10 soil 3 hydrogeologic 44 cultivars genetic are investigated for influence on crop yield and groundwater storage through time the use of a

models parameters on the other model s system response e g how cultivate genetic parameters influence groundwater storage and water table or how aquifer hydraulic conductivity affects crop growth and crop yield this is a novel approach that can yield valuable insights that are not possible when using these models separately results from this study can have important implications for overall water management in these irrigated regions for the hpa and other aquifers experiencing overdraft due to cultivation 2 materials and methods this section provides details about the dssat modflow modeling system its application to the study region in southwest kansas and the implementation of sa to identify the system parameters that govern groundwater storage and crop yield the study region will be presented first to provide context for the subsequent description of methods the overall description of dssat modflow theory and linkage and its initial application and testing to the study region was detailed in xiang et al 2020 2 1 study region finney county kansas the high plains aquifer hpa also referred to as the ogallala aquifer is one of the largest fresh groundwater sources in the world with a total area of 450 000 km2 174 000 mi2 partially covering eight central states including south dakota wyoming nebraska colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas fig 1 a the agricultural area of the aquifer region provides 30 of total crop and animal production for the u s a guru and horne 2001 rosenberg et al 1999 accounting for 41 i e 20 irrigated cropland in the u s a of total land area with an annual production of over 35 billion basso et al 2013 of crops produced in the hpa 86 is for row crops and small grains and 14 is for pasture alfalfa and fallow lands usgs high plains aquifer wlms physical cultural setting n d approximately 90 of water pumped from the hpa is used for agricultural irrigation compared with 42 of groundwater withdrawn for cropland in other regions of the u s a gollehon and winston 2013 scanlon et al 2012 the composition of aquifer material in the hpa consists of poorly sorted clay silt sand and gravel and the composition of bedrock unit is siltstone shale loosely to moderately cemented clay and silt chalk limestone dolomite conglomerate claystone gypsum anhydrite and bedded salt the range of the elevation of aquifer bedrock is from 366 m 1200ft to 1829 m 6000ft gutentag et al 1984 due to excessive pumping for agricultural irrigation the hpa has experienced severe depletion in the past few decades between 1960 and 2008 groundwater storage has decreased by 360 km3 accounting for 36 of total groundwater depletion in u s a while the change in water table elevation varies from a decline of 78 m 256 ft to a rise of 26 m 85 ft with an average of 5 m 16ft in decline accounting for 9 of the area weighted average saturated thickness mcguire 2014 declines have taken place mainly in eastern colorado southwest kansas the panhandle of oklahoma and northwest texas increases have occurred in central nebraska due to higher precipitation rates composition of soil layer e g the sandy soils that allow more infiltration and percolation and the presence of streams for surface water irrigation finney county fig 1 105 218 ha 260 000 ac located in southwestern kansas was chosen as the study region for this research due to a strong dependence on groundwater pumping 1 629 wells for irrigation resulting in water table elevation declines up to 15 m since 1950 main crop types cultivated in this region are corn maize winter wheat soybeans sorghum and triticale fig 1 shows the location of finney county within southwest kansas and the broader high plains aquifer 1a the groundwater table depth in 1960 1b the crop type in 2006 and the location of

linked model the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 is a computer program that can used on over 40 crops to simulate growth development and yield on the basis of the dynamics among the soil plant atmosphere system the dssat cropping modeling system model requires input information e g weather soil crop management cultivar genetic coefficient data etc to perform agronomic simulations the model is designed for single field applications modflow harbaugh 2005 is a 3d groundwater flow model widely used to simulate groundwater head groundwater storage and groundwater flow rates in both confined and unconfined aquifers the aquifer domain is discretized into grid cells horizontally and vertically with each cell representing a volume of aquifer and provided values of hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage in addition to a suite of groundwater sources and sinks e g recharge pumping groundwater discharge to streams stream seepage to groundwater groundwater et the finite difference method is used to solve for groundwater head for each grid cell for each time step of a specified simulation period the span of the simulation period is first divided into stress periods i e a simulation time that groundwater stresses stay constant and then into time steps the linked dssat modflow modeling system shown in fig 2 was developed xiang et al 2020 to exchange information between the groundwater system i e water table elevation saturated thickness and well capacity and the agronomic system i e irrigation depth and volume of drained water from the soil profile that recharges the aquifer on an annual basis so that each system can be impacted by the other as the simulation of each model depends on output from the other model we consider this to be a loosely coupled system due to the deep groundwater levels and therefore no interaction between the water table and the soil profile we consider this to be acceptable for the study region the data flow within the linked dssat modflow system is shown in fig 2 the simulation of the whole linked hydro agronomic system contains four steps step 1 is an ensemble of dssat simulations with a single dssat simulation for each cultivated field in the study region with a spatial module mode through a batch file input information includes soil type weather data and cultivar genetic information in input files sol wth cul respectively to trigger agronomic simulations through spatial input files of gsx for each crop type step 2 is the conversion of dssat outputs to inputs for modflow python programming language is used as the linkage script python phase 1 to convert daily field based irrigation depth and recharge depth simulated by dssat to daily grid cell based pumping rates and recharge rates for modflow simulations xiang et al 2020 python phase 1 is also used for preparing modflow input files step 3 is the modflow simulation modflow simulates groundwater hydraulic head i e water table elevation for unconfined aquifers for each gird cell with daily stress periods to be consistent with daily outputs by dssat for daily pumping and recharge rates the hydraulic head in the last day of year is saved as initial head for the subsequent year step 4 is to i calculate well capacity for each irrigation well in terms of saturated thickness i e water table elevation bedrock elevation ii update irrigation frequency i e irrigation parameter for dssat simulation based on well capacity in i and iii create input files for dssat simulations of the following year i e cul eco and gsx all detailed information about modflow dssat and the linkage procedure is demonstrated in xiang et al 2020 2 3 dssat modflow application to finney county kansas for finney county dssat was previously calibrated for corn wheat sorghum and soybean araya et al 2017 for application with the dssat modflow framework each of the 1 332 cultivated fields are included 564 484 28 206 and 50 fields for corn winter wheat soybean sorghum and triticale respectively fig 1c with a single dssat simulation for each field the modflow model for groundwater management district no 3 gmd3 see gray shaded area fig 1a developed by the kansas geological survey kgs liu et al 2011 was used to link with dssat the modflow model includes a steady state simulation and transient simulation in the period of 1944 1946 and 1947 2007 respectively the domain area of kgs model is 161 km by 241 km 100 miles by 150 miles shown in grey area in fig 1a and each grid cell is 1 61 km by 1 61 km 1 mile by 1 mile to be consistent with daily irrigation and recharge depths from dssat for daily pumping and recharge rates the modflow model was converted to daily stress periods requiring files to be updated e g discretization file dis recharge package file rch and time variant specified head package file chd and stream package file str as described in xiang et al 2020 the dssat modflow model was run for the 2000 2007 time period and tested against measured groundwater levels and county wide crop yield 2 4 framework for sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa was applied to the dssat modflow model provided in xiang et al 2020 to qualitatively morris screening method and quantitatively sobol method evaluate the factors governing groundwater storage and crop yield in finney county kansas in so doing we attempt to provide general insights and conclusions for groundwater irrigated regions that are experiencing groundwater overdraft in total 61 parameters were included in the sa based on saltelli et al 2004 sa explores how variation in model input factors influence uncertainty related to the model outputs sensitivity analysis is generally classified into two groups 1 local sensitivity analysis lsa and 2 global sensitivity analysis gsa lsa assesses the local impact of the variation in inputs on model response through evaluating the gradient or partial derivative of model outputs in vicinity of nominal values of the input factors while gsa apportions the uncertainty of model outputs to the variation of each input parameter in their entire range of interest lsa is implemented by altering one value of an input with other values of input factors remaining constant whereas in gsa all input factors are changed simultaneously over the entire range of each input factor zhou and lin 2017 the limitations of lsa are 1 not applicable for nonlinear models frey and patil 2002 and 2 interactions between parameters are not considered saltelli et al 2008 therefore gsa was applied in this study to quantitatively evaluate factors governing the hydro agronomic system 2 4 1 morris screening method the morris sa is a gsa method developed by morris 1991 to reduce the model complexity through identifying the non influential input factors using one at a time oat design with several incremental ratios called elementary effects ee the distribution of ee that is related to each input parameter is acquired by randomly sampling the space of model input parameters two sensitivity measurements obtained by the morris screening method are µ measuring the primary effect of an input factor on model response and σ describing interaction effects of a parameter with other parameters with nonlinear effects the potential results that can be determined by the morris method are negligible linear nonlinear or involved in interactions with other parameters in terms of µ and σ to estimate two measurements morris 1991 suggested that the number of executions is determined by the following relationship eq 1 1 n r k 1 where n is the number of executable model runs r is the number of trajectories usually 4 to 10 and k is the number of input factors of a model 2 4 2 sobol variance based method the sobol variance based sa offers quantitative measurements e g first order second order total order sensitivity indices etc to obtain the percentage of each input parameters contribution to the distribution of uncertainty of model responses compared with the first order index the total order index is a more relatively reliable measurement of the effect of an input factor on model output due to the consideration of interactions of a parameter with other parameters to implement sobol sensitivity analysis for obtaining first order and total order indices the number of simulation runs needed is determined by 2 n n 2 k 2 where n is the sample size for estimation of one individual effect and k is the number of input parameters 2 4 3 quantitative measures of governing systematic factors input factors are classified into 7 groups maize genetic parameters sorghum genetic parameters winter wheat genetic parameters soybean genetic parameters hydrogeologic parameters soil related parameters and climate related parameters the equation is created below to quantitatively determine governing systematic factors relying on groups for different systematic responses i e agronomic and hydrological responses 3 mgsf i 1 n i i i t where mgsf stands for measures of governing systematic factors i is the ith input factor in the group n is the number of input factors in that group i i is the sobol total order index for ith parameter and i t indicates the summation of total order indices for all parameters in the system for different systematic responses the groups of input factors maintain the similar configuration however changing values of mgsf indicate varying groups governing model performance responses 2 4 4 overall sensitivity analysis framework since dssat integrates genotype environmental experimental data and management data it is considerably driven by cultivar genetic climate related and soil related parameters jones et al 2015 li et al 2018 mourice et al 2014 rezzoug et al 2008 in addition movement of groundwater in confined and unconfined aquifers exceptionally depends on property of geologic formations of soil sand and rock with relation to hydrogeologic parameters of specific yield xiao et al 2021 and hydraulic conductivity gómez hernández and gorelick 1989 furthermore to quantify interactions between groundwater and surface water riverbed conductance wei and bailey 2019 is also another significant factor for the hydro agronomic system therefore 57 parameters see table s1 in supplementary information including 44 cultivar parameters dssat model 10 soil parameters dssat model e g evaporation limit drainage rate runoff curve number saturated water limit and 3 hydrogeologic parameters modflow model hydraulic conductivity specific yield riverbed hydraulic conductance are selected for the morris screening method based on equ 1 580 model simulations were run for the morris method calculations the sobol method was then applied only to the most influential parameters as identified by the morris screening method in addition to four climate related parameters i e maximum temperature minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation the climate parameters were not screened by the morris method due to their importance in the hydro agronomic system jones et al 2003 kour et al 2016 as described in section 3 24 parameters of the 57 initial parameters were identified in the morris screening method as being influential with the additional four climate parameters and according to equ 2 the number of dssat modflow model simulations run in the sobol method was 14 848 model results were processed using simlab simlab version 2 2 simulation environment for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 2004 the framework for implementing sa with the dssat modflow linked system is described in fig 3 the major task of prior processing is to create sample files for the morris screening and sobol sensitivity analysis respectively based on identified parameters with prior distribution and range of parameters using the random sampling method python phase 1 see fig 3 is used to update input files i e cul eco sol and wth for dssat and kst dat sys dat and str for modflow for the hydro agronomic modeling system in terms of values of parameters in the dssat experiments in the sample file to reduce computation cost parallel simulations through batch files are introduced for all model runs on computing servers the post processing procedure has two main tasks 1 organize outputs of model responses fitting them to the format of input files for simlab to obtain qualitative and quantitative measurements and 2 visualize the evaluations of sa fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening parameters using morris method the results of qualitative measurements using the morris screening sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 4 a b c d and e for maize yield soybean yield wheat yield sorghum yield and water table elevation respectively as shown in fig 4a most parameters are located within µ σ plane below the 1 1 diagonal line showing the parameters primarily influence on maize yield with little interactions with other parameters the larger the value of µ the more the effect a parameter has on maize yield therefore rue g3 p5 p1 slpf and g2 encompassed within a purple rectangle in fig 4a with large µ indicates maize yield is relatively more sensitive to these parameters i e those parameters considerably affect uncertainty of maize yield the parameters are further analyzed quantitatively using the sobol variance based method sdul i e drained upper limit is also greatly influential to maize yield even not included for the quantitative analysis using the sobol method which is consistent with a research result by he et al 2016 soil water content is a major limiting factor to restrict plant growth which is mainly controlled by sdul and other soil related parameters for soybean yield shown in fig 4b there are more interactions among soybean related genetic and soil related parameters and the parameters with high µ and σ are selected for later quantitative analysis contained in the purple rectangle in fig 4b in addition since the entire hydro agronomic system is focused on a system instead of a single hydrological agronomic system or one crop type parameters from the other system or crop model routines affect other model responses phint is one of the maize related genetic parameters but it increases the uncertainty of wheat yield fig 4c in general interactions with other parameters are important in understanding the factors that govern the entire system results for sorghum yield are shown in fig 4d indicating that the genetic parameters mainly influence the uncertainty in simulated sorghum yield with strong interaction with other parameters water table elevation fig 4e is significantly driven by soil related parameters especially sdul and slll with relation to soil water capacity soil specific yield and overall drainage of soil water to the underlying aquifer due to their influence on recharge to the water table overall soil parameters have a strong influence on both crop yield and groundwater levels the most influential twenty eight twenty four identified from the morris method four climate parameters parameters see table 1 were selected for inclusion in the sobol method 3 2 quantitative ranking of parameters using sobol method results of the sobol method are shown in figs 5 and 6 and first and total order indices of 28 parameters for both agronomic and hydrological responses are shown in tables s2 and s3 in supplemental information fig 5 summarizes the sensitivity indices for crop yield and fig 6 summarizes indices for hydrologic system responses water table elevation groundwater et recharge irrigation pumping river leakage groundwater discharge based on results shown in fig 5 the most influential system factors in controlling crop yield are climate factors cultivar genetic factors and soil factors with aquifer properties showing negligible effect climate parameters contribute strongly to crop yield and they also highly interact with other parameters in terms of the difference of first and total order indices for maize fig 5a wheat fig 5c and sorghum fig 5d tmax has the greatest control on crop yield followed by generally rainfall rain solar radiation srad and soil drainage properties slll sdul soybean fig 5b has similar parameter effects but also a strong influence by genetics e g csdld critical short day length for reproductive progress temperatures affect stages of crop growth and rain amount dictates the amount of irrigation i e groundwater pumping that is required for maintaining crop yield and temperature affects stages of crop growth of course cultivar parameters dictate growth stages during the growing season from a systems point of view for those four major crop types crop yields are not controlled by their own cultivar genetic parameters alone but also by other cultivar genetic parameters for example besides maize genetic parameters several winter wheat and soybean cultivar genetic parameters are interactively sensitive to maize yield similarly this situation occurs in other crop types therefore to have accurate simulations of crop yields the different cultivar genetic parameters for the crops within the simulated system should be included in calibration the absence of impact by aquifer properties on crop yield indicates that although groundwater depletion occurs in this region aquifer properties do not impact the ability of the system to supply irrigation water to cultivated fields likely aquifer properties will have an impact only when declining groundwater levels approach the aquifer bedrock interface and local hydraulic conductivity can affect the amount of groundwater that can reach pumping wells during the growing season therefore from the standpoint of sa in the linked system likely the inclusion of the modflow model in the modeling system is not necessary to determine the factors that govern crop yield this is an important result as it provides insights into when the inclusion of physically based groundwater models are necessary to include in agronomic modeling and sa first if groundwater levels are in close proximity to the soil profile in which soil profile hydrology and plant growth routines are affected by the presence of groundwater and second if groundwater levels are in close proximity to the aquifer bedrock interface which groundwater storage many not satisfy irrigation demand for crop growth the current conditions of the study region are in an in between phase where groundwater storage is adequate to satisfy ongoing irrigation however we would expect that as irrigation continues and groundwater levels continue to decline the influence of aquifer properties k sy cond will play a larger role in governing crop yield fig 6 shows quantitative results of parameters for hydrologic responses i e water table elevation et recharge irrigation pumping river leakage and aquifer seepage of parameters simulated by the sobol approach parameters of soil properties i e sldr slll and sdul and climate conditions i e rain tmax tmin and srad primarily drive the process of recharge shown in fig 6c with similar outcomes conducted by mccallum et al 2010 and crosbie et al 2013 for climate conditions and by wang et al 2015 for soil properties climate and soil drainage parameters have the strong influence on water table elevation due to their influence on recharge which controls groundwater levels this relationship between recharge and water table elevation is seen through the similar parameter sensitivity magnitudes for both shown in fig 6a and fig 6c respectively the minor difference of sensitivities between recharge and water table elevation occurred in parameters related to cultivar genetic since crop growth needs to take up water pumped from groundwater sources aquifer specific yield sy has a small control on water table elevation due to sy being a representation of available pore space and hence governing the vertical rise and fall of groundwater levels given incoming recharge for groundwater et fig 6b many parameters contribute to its simulation with very low first order indices and high total order indices indicating strong interaction among parameters causing the high degree of uncertainty of et however as will be discussed in section 3 4 the overall volume of groundwater et is very small compared to other groundwater sources and sinks and hence the high parameter sensitivity shown in fig 6d does not have much bearing on overall system performance pumping fig 6d is controlled primarily by climate parameters and soil drainage parameters climate rainfall temperature determines the need for irrigation water i e groundwater pumping and soil properties can change water content in soil layer which triggers irrigation events in the dssat modeling system river water seepage to the aquifer fig 6e is controlled primarily by riverbed conductance whereas groundwater discharge to the river fig 6f is controlled by a combination of riverbed conductance soil drainage properties and temperature due to the influence of recharge and pumping on groundwater levels and gradients which control the rate of groundwater flows to the river system in general these results indicate a complex system of interacting environmental factors of note is that except for groundwater surface water interactions fig 6e 6f climate variables and soil properties have a much stronger influence on hydrologic fluxes recharge et pumping than hydrogeologic factors k hydraulic conductivity sy specific yield climate impacts crop germination growth and irrigation needs and therefore controls the overall response of crop yield and pumping in the region therefore in contrast to the results for crop yield fig 5 which exhibited no influence of groundwater parameters on crop yield these results suggest that land surface and crop growth parameters have moderate to strong influences on groundwater storage and related groundwater sources and sinks therefore whereas in this region the controls on crop yield could be determined from stand along agronomic models controls on groundwater storage and fluxes requires the linkage with the agronomic model 3 3 parameters quantitively contributing to uncertainty of model responses the contribution of each model parameter to model outputs crop yields hydrologic fluxes is quantified further using frequency distribution plots and pie charts information of quantitative measures of governing systematic factors is summarized in table 2 shown in fig 7 crop yields and fig 8 hydrologic fluxes the left side of each subplot in fig 7 and fig 8 shows the distribution of uncertainty of model responses compared with uncertainties of hydrological responses fig 8 uncertainties of agronomic response fig 7 generally have wider dispersions for maize yield fig 7a over 55 of the uncertainty is due to climate related 44 2 and soil related 13 5 parameters climate and soil parameters account for 34 73 and 50 of yield uncertainty for soybeans fig 7b wheat fig 7c and sorghum fig 7d hydrological responses have less uncertainty in terms of shape and range of distributions with narrow and peaked distributions results are summarized in fig 8 note that the scales of hydrologic fluxes on the axis of each chart in fig 8 vary in magnitude to provide more accurate visualization recharge fig 8c and pumping fig 8d have much larger magnitudes than et fig 8b stream seepage fig 8e and groundwater discharge fig 8f soil related parameters considerably affect water table elevation 44 of uncertainty and recharge 53 of uncertainty with relation to interaction between soil properties and the amount of water that passes from the soil profile to the water table fig 8a c as shown in fig 8b uncertainty of et is caused by all parameters with almost even uncertainty in input factors to et over 80 of uncertainty in irrigation pumping can be attributed to soil related climate related and hydrogeological parameters fig 8d mainly due to the control of these parameters on rainfall and crop growth which triggers irrigation events and associated pumping stream seepage to the aquifer fig 8e and groundwater discharge to streams fig 8f are controlled by riverbed conductance climate parameters and to a lesser degree crop genetic parameters 3 4 comparison of model responses under extreme conditions although model results can exhibit high sensitivity to model parameters the values of parameters may not have a strong influence on the overall movement of water within the linked groundwater agronomic system to demonstrate this and to quantify the influence of parameters on model responses we ran additional dssat modflow model simulations using 1 the minimum values and 2 the maximum values of the parameters with the highest sensitivity index for example as recharge is governed by sdul drained upper limit we selected the minimum and maximum value of sdul and ran two simulations to determine the resulting difference in recharge volumes with comparison to original volumes of the baseline simulation i e 16 313 840 m3 for et 159 131 449 m3 for groundwater discharge 72 440 221 m3 for river leakage 877 641 153 m3 for recharge and 2 651 042 093 m3 for groundwater pumping the relative percentage change in hydrologic fluxes are 4 to 7 8 to 20 60 to 120 31 to 111 and 13 to 15 for et groundwater discharge river leakage recharge and groundwater pumping respectively results for groundwater fluxes fig 9 a show that recharge rch is drastically changed approximately by 3 times when this parameter ranges from the minimum value to the maximum value whereas the other groundwater fluxes change only minimally therefore for parameters that have a high sensitivity index for a given system response three conditions can result 1 average flux volumes are low and changes in parameter values result in minimal flux volume change this is the case for groundwater et compare the sensitivity indices in fig 6b to the volumes in fig 9a 2 average flux volumes are high but changes in parameter values result in minimal flux volume change this is the case for groundwater discharge spg river seepage lkg and groundwater pumping wel 3 average flux volumes are high and changes in parameter values result in large flux volume change this is the case for recharge rch recharge amount is controlled strongly by climate and soil drainage properties which can have a large influence on groundwater levels and groundwater storage groundwater pumping wel on the other hand continues to occur based on irrigation demand due to availability of groundwater therefore for managing the system and forecasting future groundwater levels and groundwater storage climate and soil properties must be known with certainty the change in groundwater pumping volume is demonstrated by the change in water table elevation shown in fig 9c for each modflow grid cell in the finney county area some locations have a difference of up to 14 m which is severe compared to observed decadal changes in the region the largest changes in water table elevation occur in areas of maize compared with crop type distribution in fig 1c similarly fig 9b shows the change in crop yield when the values of the respective influential parameters are implemented in the simulations maximum temperature is the most sensitive parameter for maize sorghum and wheat yield but higher maximum temperature for maize and wheat has negatively impact on crop yields indicating maximum temperature should be in a reasonable range kassie et al 2016 the soybean yield is mostly driven by a cultivar genetic parameter of csdl and the difference between the two scenarios is 2670 kg ha for each crop the yield values shown in fig 9b represent a change of 29 2 567 13 and 20 respectively for maize soybean sorghum and wheat compared to crop yields of the baseline simulation i e 12 356 kg ha for maize 2 436 kg ha for soybean 11 244 kg ha for sorghum and 10 561 kg ha for wheat the relative percentage change in crop yields is 71 to 62 96 to 10 79 to 76 and 32 to 18 for maize soybean sorghum and wheat respectively under scenarios with minimum and maximum values of the corresponding most sensitive parameters 4 summary and conclusions two sensitivity analyses i e morris screening method and sobol variance based method were applied to a groundwater irrigated hydro agronomic system to assess the governing system factors on crop yield and groundwater storage the dssat modflow linked modeling system was used as the simulator a combination of python scripts and simlab pre and post processing were used to generate parameter values update model files for dssat and modflow run the model simulations and calculate sensitivity indices for both the morris method and the sobol method fifty seven parameters were reduced to 24 parameters after the morris screening method and the sensitivity of 28 parameters including 4 climate related parameters were analyzed on 10 model responses i e maize yield soybean yield winter wheat yield sorghum yield water table elevation et recharge irrigation pumping river leakage and aquifer seepage using sobol variance based sensitivity analysis from the results we conclude that climate related parameters significantly affect crop yields especially for maize and sorghum and soybean and winter wheat yields are sensitive to a combination of cultivar genetic parameters soil related parameters and climate related parameters climatic parameters account for 44 29 40 and 36 variation in yield of maize soybean winter wheat and sorghum hydrogeologic parameters i e aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer specific yield and riverbed conductance have a relatively low influence on crop yields hydrological responses show variations in influential parameters water table elevation recharge and irrigation pumping are considerably sensitive to soil and climate related parameters while et river leakage and aquifer seepage are highly influenced by hydrogeological parameter e g riverbed conductance and specific yield shown in fig 6 soil parameters account for 44 20 50 and 34 variation in water table elevation et recharge and irrigation pumping although parameters may have a high sensitivity index in controlling hydrologic fluxes the overall change in flux volumes is not large enough to warrant special attention to these parameters in management schemes for example many cultivars soil climate and hydrogeologic parameters have a high sensitivity index for groundwater et and groundwater surface water interactions however when assessing the groundwater budget for the entire study region the overall flux volumes and the change in volumes due to parameter changes are minimal compared to groundwater recharge and pumping in general we emphasize that for this region where groundwater levels are deep but not near the aquifer bedrock interface results for crop yield could be obtained by stand alone dssat models but accurate results for groundwater storage and groundwater fluxes could be obtained only through linking modflow with the dssat agronomic system and the inclusion of climate soil and cultivar genetic parameters in the sa routines these results point to the general importance of soil water management and climatic patterns in groundwater irrigated regions they can be helpful from the perspective of understanding what might increase crop yield and conserve groundwater and also what parameters should receive more attention in field sampling and monitoring although the study area is in a region with sparse rainfall and hence the need for ongoing pumping climate plays an important role in crop yield principally through maximum daily temperature and solar radiation therefore future climate change will have an ever increasing impact on crop production and associated groundwater conservation even without accounting for future changing rainfall patterns climate cannot be controlled by local water managers and growers however they should be made aware of the implications of increasing temperatures on crop yields and hydrologic fluxes in these systems for hydrologic fluxes climate and soil parameters have approximately the same influence pointing to the need for advanced irrigation systems that increase irrigation efficiency and the awareness and quantification of soil drainage properties also since the influence of maximum temperature on crop growth is exacerbated by water deficits hatfield and prueger 2015 a minimum level of soil water content should be maintained throughout the growing season these general results are applicable to other regions within the high plains aquifer and similar groundwater irrigated systems and the methods presented herein can serve as a guide for identifying controlling factors in other hydro agronomic systems credit authorship

3086,the present paper formulates a generalized model for non equilibrium suspended sediment transport through an open channel turbulent flow that contains all the existing models in literature as special cases the two dimensional 2d unsteady model for suspended concentration distribution contains the effect of hindered settling and the bottom boundary condition considers deposition velocity together with equilibrium bottom concentration openfoam an open source finite volume fv method based framework has been used for the numerical approximation of the model the proposed model addresses the non linearity in the governing equation as well as the non linearity in boundary conditions picard iteration approach has been utilized to ensure the convergence of the numerical solution with different physical parameters and conditions concentration profiles of suspended sediment particles have been analysed theoretically and graphically it greatly extends the domain of the numerical

over an erodible bed in a turbulent flow an improved understanding of advection diffusion process is required voluminous research have been carried out since long but the irregular behaviour of turbulence never allowed to have a complete knowledge about the matter and the research on the same will ever be continued an advection diffusion approach is widely used to predict the suspended concentration distribution along vertical as well as horizontal directions in a wide channel with uniform flow the governing equation for sediment transport which is the advection diffusion equation has been solved by numerical analytical or empirical approaches initiation was done by rouse 1937 in 1937 who analytically solved simple diffusion equation for steady uniform one dimensional 1d transport of sediment later in 1954 hunt 1954 considered continuity equation of sediment and water separately and coupled them through settling velocity of sediment to make a single equation and solved analytically following rouse 1937 and hunt 1954 a large number of models rijn 1984 umeyama 1992 cellino and graf 1999 chiu et al 2000 graf and cellino 2002 ghoshal and kundu 2013 kumbhakar et al 2018 can be found in literature that considered different turbulent features to make the models more logical and realistic the number of research in this area is so large that it is almost impossible to mention even a tiny part of it and the cited works are just a few in comparison to these 1d steady transport models 1d unsteady or 2d steady models are quite less in number as these models are based on partial differential equations which is not as simple as to deal with ordinary differential equations for this reason the existing models in these cases do not contain turbulent features also hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 solved the 2d steady transport problem by the classical method of separating variables and considered very simple boundary conditions prior to this mei 1969 solved the same governing equation by laplace transformation taking zero flux condition at the free surface and constant bottom concentration apart from these works several works can be found in literature galappatti and vreugdenhil 1985 wang and ribberink 1986 wang 1992 bolla pittaluga and seminara 2003 who solved steady 2d problem considering fixed bottom boundary condition cheng 1984 was the first to develop a generalized bottom boundary condition considering the deposition velocity and the equilibrium bottom concentration he solved 1d unsteady transport equation with this generalized bottom boundary condition later liu and nayamatullah 2014 and liu 2016 considered this condition in their 1d unsteady and 2d steady problems respectively all these models discussed here are linear pdes and do not contain any turbulent phenomenon that can make the governing equations non linear settling velocity is an important phenomenon in the transport of suspended sediment which usually is taken as constant in the advection diffusion models however richardson and zaki 1954 showed that the presence of adjacent particles changes the settling velocity of a particle causing it to settle slower and this should be incorporated when dealing with high concentrated flows several diffusive models pal and ghoshal 2014 2017 kumbhakar et al 2018 mohan et al 2019 jain and ghoshal 2021 jain et al 2021 on one dimensional steady transport can be found in literature that took into account this effect apart from these 1d transport studies very few other studies considered this effect as inclusion of this effect makes the pde non linear which is difficult to handle both numerically and semi analytically jing et al 2018 considered hindered settling effect in their steady 2d transport model and solved numerically mohan et al 2020 considered this effect in the 1d unsteady transport problem and obtained a semi analytical solution using homotopy analysis method recently kumbhakar et al 2022 used the same method to solve the 2d steady transport formulation incorporating hindered settling effect as already mentioned that in comparison to 1d steady transport model 1d unsteady and 2d steady transport models are quite less moreover researchers considered 2d steady and 1d unsteady transport models separately because under constant advection assumption these two are mathematically equivalent i e the horizontal coordinate can be treated as time liu and nayamatullah 2014 mathematically both of these problems are 2d in nature literature lack in a transport model which is unsteady as well as 2d the possible reason might be that in this case the problem becomes mathematically three dimensional which is obviously more difficult to tackle moreover inclusion of hindered settling effect makes the three dimensional model non linear thus the main objective of the present work is to construct and solve a generalized advection diffusion model where concentration is a function of time as well as two space coordinates together with the hindered settling effect and the most generalized bottom boundary condition as a result all the previously existing models will be special cases of this generalized model and all the results obtained from different models can be obtained from a single model due to high non linearity involved with the present model the analytical solution is not possible except for very special cases the focus thus should be given to finding its numerical solution openfoam jasak 1996 provides a framework for solving differential equations based on finite volume fv approximations however non linearity handling capability is not present as a standard module thus a non linear solution framework has been implemented within openfoam coding additionally the open source nature of openfoam increases both the accessibility and the reviewability of the present study 2 model formulation 2 1 mathematical equations for non equilibrium sediment transport see fig 1 the governing equation is the advection diffusion equation which describes the suspended load transport of sediment in a turbulent open channel flow considering a wide channel with uniform flow the governing equation of the concentration of suspended sediment is given by 1 c t u c x z w s c z ϵ s c z where t represents time c denotes the sediment concentration x and z are the longitudinal stream wise and vertical directions respectively u is the mean velocity component in stream wise direction ϵ s is the sediment diffusion coefficient w s is the settling velocity of the sediment particles which is directed vertically downward as the flow is assumed to be uniform along the stream wise direction and independent of time u varies only in the vertical direction to derive concentration distributions from eq 1 we need to know the expressions for w s ϵ s and u several studies have been made to derive an expression for settling velocity it has been demonstrated that sediment particles settle more slowly in sediment water mixed flow than in clear water flow a phenomenon known as hindered settling according to richardson and zaki 1954 the settling velocity of sediment particles and the concentration in a sediment laden flow are related mathematically as 2 w s w 0 1 c n h where w 0 is the settling velocity of sediment particles in clear water and which can be determined by the well known expression of cheng 1997 given as 3 ω 0 ν d 25 1 2 d 2 5 1 5 where d d s 1 g ν 2 1 3 is the non dimensional diameter of sediment particle in which d is the diameter of that sediment particle ν is the kinematic viscosity of water g is the acceleration due to gravity s is the relative density of sediment particles and n h is the reduction exponent of settling velocity depending on the particle reynolds number r e p n h decreases from 4 9 to 2 3 as r e p increases from 0 1 to 10 3 to simplify the mathematics however an average value of n h 4 may be considered ali and dey 2016 mohan et al 2019 2020 ghoshal et al 2022 besides w s ϵ s is another parameter in eq 1 which also contributes in determining the distribution profile of sediment concentration sediment diffusivity ϵ s is likely to be analogous with turbulent eddy viscosity ϵ f many researchers majumdar and carstens 1967 jobson and sayre 1970 have found that ϵ s ϵ f and the inequality is expressed as follows 4 β ϵ s ϵ f where β is the ratio of sediment diffusivity ϵ s to turbulent eddy viscosity ϵ f which is known as the inverse of turbulent schimdt number with settling velocity w s and sediment diffusivity ϵ s substituted from eqs 2 and 4 respectively eq 1 converts to 5 c t u c x z w 0 1 c n h c z β ϵ f c z where w 0 is given by eq 3 the term w 0 1 c n h in the left hand side of eq 5 arises due to the hindered settling effect eq 5 is a 2d initial boundary value problem ibvp with any ibvp the specification of appropriate boundary conditions bcs for the dependent variable represents a crucial component of the respective mathematical formulation vertically sediment particles are suspended from a particular reference level z a a is the reference level to the top surface z h h is the flow depth at z h there is no mass transfer and hence the most often used bc thereat is the zero flux bc the zero sediment flux bc at the free surface can be expressed as cheng 1984 liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu 2016 6 β ϵ f c z w s c 0 at z h a variety of bottom bcs are available in the literature at the reference level z a hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 apmann and rumer 1970 lee et al 1981 cheng 1984 with the flux being equal to the rate at which sediment is placed in suspension cheng 1984 formulated a generalized bottom bc which is as follows 7 β ϵ f c z w s c λ c c at z a where c denotes the equilibrium concentration at z a and λ is a depth independent parameter depending on the concentration at the bottom surface λ changes physically λ mentioned in eq 7 is interpreted as the reflectively coefficient of the bottom boundary surface when λ 0 the bottom surface behaves like a perfectly reflective surface while λ corresponds to a perfectly absorbing surface cheng 1984 an ideal situation would be somewhere between these two values at the inlet x 0 an arbitrary concentration profile can be prescribed with the following form liu 2016 8 c x 0 z c x 0 z initially the water column has either a uniform concentration profile or sediment free liu and nayamatullah 2014 mohan et al 2020 ghoshal et al 2022 following liu and nayamatullah 2014 the arbitrary initial condition ic is as follows 9 c t 0 x z c t 0 x z eqs 5 9 can be made non dimensional by using the following dimensionless quantities x ˆ x h z ˆ z h t ˆ t u h a ˆ a h u ˆ u u w ˆ 0 w 0 u c ˆ c c a λ ˆ λ u c ˆ c c a c ˆ x 0 c x 0 c a c ˆ t 0 c t 0 c a ϵ ˆ f ϵ s β u h where u is the shear velocity and c a denotes the reference concentration at reference level z a using the above dimensionless variables eqs 5 9 can be rewritten respectively in non dimensional form as follows transport equation for suspended sediment concentration 10 c ˆ t ˆ u ˆ c ˆ x ˆ z ˆ w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ n h c ˆ z ˆ β ϵ ˆ f c ˆ z ˆ boundary and

0 x ˆ z ˆ eqs 10 14 are the non dimensional form of the dimensional eqs 5 9 respectively it is to be noted that the top and bottom bcs given in eqs 11 and 12 respectively are of robin type whereas the inlet bc defined in eq 13 is of dirichlet type 2 2 velocity distribution and eddy viscosity closure the stream wise advection velocity u can be taken as a constant value hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 jing et al 2018 however it is reasonable to consider the more realistic log law as suggested by liu 2016 which reads as 15 u z u κ ln z z 0 where z 0 is the start elevation of the log law formula and κ is the von karman constant the value of κ is taken as 0 41 throughout the study eq 15 can be further rewritten into the following non dimensional form liu 2016 16 u ˆ z ˆ 1 z ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 ln z ˆ 0 1 ln z ˆ z ˆ 0 for z ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 where z ˆ 0 z 0 h the value of z ˆ 0 is usually small and it is considered as 0 001 in liu s spirit liu 2016 reynolds shear stress in open channel flows generally varies linearly with flow depth yang et al 2004 first discovered that shear stress in clear water flows deviates from its linear profile in the outer region and he accordingly suggested a modification yang 2007 later analysed the effect of sediment concentration on turbulent characteristics finding that the measured reynolds stress in sediment laden flows was systematically higher than that in flows with clear water in fig 2 experimental measurements of reynolds shear stress for sediment laden flows are plotted based on the data from muste and patel 1997 cellino and graf 1999 graf and cellino 2002 and muste et al 2005 as can be seen from fig 2 other than a slight scattering these profiles generally maintain a linear trend additionally the linear profile of reynolds stress distribution does not significantly change with the presence of sediment particles in the inner region z h 0 2 the profile falls to zero rather quickly deviating from the linear trend it is likely that this deviation is caused by the high concentration in this area graf and cellino 2002 this type of linear distribution of reynolds shear stress in suspension flows was also reported by best et al 1997 righetti and romano 2004 and lyn 1988 the linear relationship of the reynolds shear stress τ with the vertical depth z of the channel can be written as muste and patel 1997 17 τ τ b 1 z h where τ b ρ u 2 in which ρ is the fluid density is the bed shear stress according to the boussinesq hypothesis the reynolds shear stress τ in turbulent flows can also be expressed as 18 τ ρ ϵ f d u d z considering that the logarithmic velocity profile is preserved throughout the flow depth the velocity gradient d u d z can be expressed as 19 d u d z u κ z combining the linear variation of reynolds shear stress with the logarithmic velocity law i e by using eqs 18 and 19 in eq 17 the following expression for eddy viscosity can be derived rijn 1987 20 ϵ f κ u z 1 z h eq 20 accounts for the parabolic distribution of eddy viscosity and is widely used for eddy viscosity calculation in sediment laden open channel flows in addition to this parabolic distribution linear and constant distributions of eddy viscosity can also be found in the literature rijn 1987 below are the mathematical expressions for the eddy viscosities considered in this study rijn 1987 constant type 21 ϵ f z κ α 1 u h dimensional form or 22 ϵ ˆ

ˆ 1 z ˆ non dimensional form the model parameters α 1 and α 2 have been suggested by rijn 1987 as 6 and 3 respectively fig 3 shows all the three eddy viscosity distributions along with experimental data of coleman 1970 ueda et al 1977 nezu 1985 and muste et al 2005 the suggested values of α 1 and α 2 by van rijn result in comparable eddy viscosities for all three distributions several studies have used all of these three parabolic linear and constant in sediment laden open channel flows including liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu 2016 mohan et al 2020 and kundu 2022 physically the parabolic distribution is most satisfactory as it is based on a linear distribution of the shear stress and a logarithmic velocity profile rijn 1987 these three different types of sediment diffusivity models are taken into account in the present model to ensure the broad applicability of this study 2 3 different sub cases in the present study eqs 10 14 are used to predict the transient suspended concentration distribution in a wide open channel by including the hindered settling mechanism as a point to note in eq 10 the velocity distribution u ˆ z ˆ and the turbulent eddy viscosity ϵ ˆ f z ˆ can be arbitrary profiles of z ˆ however we limit our work to the forms taken in section 2 2 the following are some sub cases of the proposed model eqs 10 14 sub case i by assuming constant advection velocity and parabolic type eddy viscosity along with no time variation and no hindered settling the present model eqs 10 14 reduces to the model of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 which is as follows

eq 29 sub case ii by using constant eddy viscosity to evaluate ϵ ˆ f along with zero x gradient and no hindered settling the present model eqs 10 14 corresponds to cheng s model cheng 1984 in the

obtain the suspended concentration model of liu and nayamatullah 2014 from the present model eqs 10 14 as follows transport equation for suspended sediment concentration 35 c ˆ t ˆ w ˆ 0 c ˆ z ˆ z ˆ β

that can easily be checked by interested readers the models presented in sub case ii iii and v are unsteady 1d whereas the models in sub case i iv and vi are steady and 2d in the present study the model eqs 10 14 considered is unsteady 2d and is a generalization of all the aforementioned models mentioned in sub cases i vi the proposed model eqs 10 14 is highly non linear with non homogeneous robin bcs and cannot be solved analytically in general except in few simplified cases where certain restrictions must be applied as an alternative to analytic solutions for the particular cases numerical solutions for more general cases are attempted by using finite volume technique 3 numerical methodology this study uses openfoam an open source finite volume fv method based computational fluid dynamics cfd framework to get the numerical solution of the proposed model described in eqs 10 14 openfoam contains the necessary infrastructure needed to discretize the governing equations both spatially and temporally and to solve the system of linear algebraic equations generated from the discretization process 3 1 handling non linearity in governing equation in addition to applying the standard fv method to the spatial domain of eq 10 the euler time marching scheme is incorporated into the temporal domain as a result a system of non linear algebraic equations is generated which must be linearized or iterated to solve at a discrete level newton s method and picard iteration methods are more commonly used iteration procedures invoking a backward euler method fully implicit the semi discretized form of eq 10 takes the following form 51 c ˆ i 1 c ˆ i δ t ˆ u ˆ z ˆ c ˆ x ˆ i 1 z ˆ w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ i 1 n h c ˆ i 1 z ˆ β ϵ ˆ f z ˆ c ˆ z ˆ i 1 the superscripts i and i 1 refer the previous and current time levels t ˆ t ˆ i and t ˆ t ˆ i 1 respectively c ˆ i 1 is the value of c ˆ at current time level i 1 and is supposed to be unknown whereas c ˆ i is the old time level value of c ˆ at time level i which is known δ t ˆ t ˆ i 1 t ˆ i is the time step the settling velocity w ˆ s w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ n h is evaluated using c ˆ i 1 due to the non linear dependence of w ˆ s on the sediment concentration c ˆ some iterative linearization procedure must be introduced into eq 51 to get the numerical solution in our study we have adopted picard iteration method for linearizing the suspended concentration eq 51 a sequential estimation of the unknown c ˆ i 1 using the latest estimates of w ˆ s i 1 is invoked in the picard iteration method with the superscripts i and j denoting the time level and picard iteration level respectively the linearized form of the eq 51 can be written respectively as 52 c ˆ i 1 j 1 c ˆ i δ t ˆ u ˆ z ˆ c ˆ x ˆ i 1 j 1 z ˆ w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ i 1 j n h c ˆ i 1 j 1 z ˆ β ϵ ˆ f z ˆ c ˆ z ˆ i 1 j 1 the description of different numerical schemes for different derivative terms present in eq 52 is given in table 1 to solve the discrete linear algebraic equations obtained from eq 52 the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver with a diagonal incomplete cholesky dic preconditioner was adopted compared to other iterative matrix solvers the above one is computationally inexpensive and has better convergence rates 3 2 treatment of various bcs dirichlet and neumann bcs are pre defined in openfoam and are called fixedvalue and fixedgradient type bcs respectively there is a boundary condition known as mixed that can be used to switch between fixed value and fixed gradient situations on a particular boundary but cannot be applied directly to implement robin bc the dirichlet bcs are specified as fixedvalue type bc from openfoam library observing closely the robin bcs in eqs 11 and 12 one can find that those equations are non linear in c ˆ since each bc consists of the non linear hindered settling velocity term w ˆ s in openfoam the execution of this type of non linear robin bc is not straightforward in this study nonlinearrobinbc type bc has been developed in openfoam framework for specifying zero sediment and dynamic sediment flux on the top and bottom boundaries the respective non linearity in the bcs is resolved using newton raphson method considering n h 0 in eqs 11 and 12 the top and bottom bcs respectively become linear functions of c ˆ and these bcs are implemented in openfoam as linearrobinbc type 3 3 convergence criterion besides accuracy the desired computational effort is another aspect of iterative methods for solving non linear equations with a careful choice of a convergence criterion computational expenses can be minimized by reducing the number of iterations needed for the solver s convergence the residual is one of the most important metrics of iterative solver convergence because it directly quantifies error a root mean square rms residual criterion is used here as the convergence criterion on the picard iteration scheme described in eq 52 the considered root mean square residuals are defined by the following 53 1 n c ˆ i 1 j 1 c ˆ i 1 j 2 δ c ˆ t o l where n is the total number of finite volume cells and the summation is taken over the total number of cells and δ c ˆ t o l is the tolerance level which is considered as 10 6 in this work 4 results and discussion in this section the numerical technique adopted in this work is first validated by comparing the obtained numerical results with various analytical and semi analytical solutions then several significant results related to physical phenomena such as hindered settling and overshooting of bottom boundary concentrations are presented theoretically and graphically at the end the proposed model is validated with existing models under steady state and far field conditions 4 1 numerical tests to demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical technique adopted in this work the present model was converted into several existing suspension concentration models the numerical solution was compared to analytical and semi analytical solutions of those existing models validation with analytical solution of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 a simplified suspended sediment transport model based on constant advection velocity and parabolic eddy viscosity was proposed by hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 one can easily convert the present model to hjelmfelt and lenau s hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 model which is shown in sub case i in section 2 3 in the model of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 the physical problem is as follows a sediment free flow of water enters a natural channel and picks up sediments from the bottom until far downstream equilibrium is attained the open channel here is wide and rectangular the analytical solution is obtained at the central region of the channel through its cross sectional area as the effect of side wall is negligible here in fig 4 the vertical concentration profiles at different downstream locations x ˆ 0 1 0 5 1 1 5 2 have been depicted the required parameters are in the figure s caption values of the parameters are chosen from hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 as x ˆ increases the vertical concentration profile becomes more uniform as shown in fig 4 the solution tends to the rouse equation when x ˆ fig 4 shows the pattern of concentration profiles on a sediment bed along the horizontal direction when the inlet sediment concentration is zero the non uniform transport of suspended sediment of uniform size in an open channel is considered here initially sediment free water enters the channel scouring the sediment bed and picking up the sediment in the suspension region during the process of scouring and picking up sediment the concentration profiles in the horizontal direction change by increasing x ˆ more sediment particles will be suspended in the suspension region increasing the magnitude of the concentration profile it continues to increase the concentration profile up until a certain downstream location upon reaching equilibrium at a far downstream location the concentration profile will not change at equilibrium state the net upward sediment transport caused by diffusion becomes equal to the net downward sediment flux caused by settling consequently the concentration profile becomes the rouse profile at a far downstream when equilibrium is reached it is evident from fig 4 that the obtained numerical results are in close agreement with the analytical solution of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 validation with analytical solution of cheng 1984 a simplification of the present model to cheng s model cheng 1984 is given in sub case ii in section 2 3 based upon generalized bottom boundary condition and constant eddy viscosity model cheng 1984 has analytically solved a one dimensional non equilibrium unsteady sediment transport equation using the numerical method of the present study cheng s cheng 1984 test cases were solved and the numerical solution was compared with the analytical solution figs 5 a 5 c illustrate the time variation of the vertical distribution of suspended sediment with different values of c ˆ the time variation of bottom concentration is shown in fig 5 d all the necessary parameters are given within the figures values of the parameters are taken from cheng 1984 as shown in fig 5 d the concentration distribution at first exceeds its equilibrium value and then gradually diminishes to the equilibrium bottom concentration value c ˆ this can be explained as follows initially sediment particles are uniformly distributed throughout the entire flow depth once the flow begins particles start mixing with a constant rate of diffusivity over the water column in this case value of λ ˆ is 2 indicating that the bottom surface is neither fully reflecting nor absorbing but a combination of both as a result when particles hit the bottom surface they remain on the bottom surface resulting in an initial increase in bottom concentration and overshooting with time the bottom concentration stabilizes due to the mixing process overshoot increases as c ˆ becomes smaller with increasing c ˆ the time taken for bottom concentration to attain the equilibrium state decreases cheng 1984 as seen in the figures the numerical solution agrees well with cheng s analytical solution cheng 1984 validation with semi analytical solution of liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu and nayamatullah 2014 presented a semi analytical solution to 1d unsteady non equilibrium suspended sediment transport problem with arbitrary turbulent eddy viscosity and generalized bottom boundary conditions in sub case iii of section 2 3 there is a description of the conversion process from the present model to that of liu and nayamatullah 2014 the vertical variation of suspended sediment concentration at a particular time t ˆ for different turbulent eddy viscosity is plotted in fig 6 a list of the required parameters appears inside the figure values of the parameters are chosen from liu and nayamatullah 2014 according to fig 6 the profiles are almost identical except for the free surface portion at the top of the channel where the parabolic eddy viscosity profile shows zero sediment concentration from fig 6 one can follow that liu and nayamatullah s analytical solution liu and nayamatullah 2014 and the numerical solution are in good agreement validation with analytical solution of liu 2016 using arbitrary eddy viscosity and advection velocity distributions liu 2016 presented an analytical solution to steady 2d suspended sediment transport model with the generalized bottom bc cheng 1984 the conversion of the present model to liu s model liu 2016 is described in sub case iv in section 2 3 the comparison between the numerical solution and the analytical solution is depicted in fig 7 fig 7 a represents vertical sediment concentration profile corresponding to an inlet with clear water while fig 7 b represents concentration profile with an inlet with uniform sediment concentration at a particular downstream location x ˆ 2 the model parameters are provided within the figures values of the parameters are selected from liu 2016 fig 7 reveals that the numerical results are in close agreement with the analytical solution of liu 2016 in addition the two other sub cases sub case v and vi mentioned in section 2 3 can also be verified with the present numerical method and left for interested readers 4 2 impact of hindered settling mechanism on vertical concentration distributions fig 8 illustrates the concentration profile affected by hindered settling on the bottom and top surfaces at steady state and far field conditions the required parameters are listed in the figure s caption as shown in fig 8 incorporating hindered settling effect in the main transport equation and the bottom and top bcs does not result in any significant difference compared to the case when imposing hindered settling effect only in the main transport equation in fact the same was done by mohan et al 2020 and recently by kumbhakar et al 2022 mentioning that the hindered effect is not considered in the top bc as particles are not present there and is not considered in the bottom bc as particles are not in suspension recently ghoshal et al 2022 studied 1d unsteady transport from mixing length point of view since this study is from completely different aspect and cannot be obtained from the generalized model of the present study it has not been mentioned in literature survey there also they did not take this effect in the bcs mentioning that inclusion of that effect in bcs will make the model complicated which may not bring any new result and left it for interested readers to test if any changes occur really unlike the numerical method used in that work the present method can easily solve the model with complicated bcs by the numerical method adopted here and confirms that the hindered settling effect comes in the main suspension region only therefore the discussion will move forward by considering the hindered settling effect only in the main transport equation and not in the bottom and top bcs fig 9 shows the z direction concentration distributions of sediment in suspension affected by the hindered settling mechanism with the exponent n h at different times t ˆ 1 2 5 and 15 at a particular downstream location x ˆ 2 a value of n h 0 corresponds to the case with no consideration for hindered settling while a value of n h 4 corresponds to the case with consideration for hindered settling for all cases the ic is c ˆ 0 t ˆ 0 and the inlet is clear water with no sediment c ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 two different values of c a 0 07 figs 9 a 9 c 9 e and 9 g and 0 02 figs 9 b 9 d 9 f and 9 h have been considered parabolic distribution for ϵ ˆ f has been used for all the cases the other relevant parameters are listed inside the figures the figures demonstrate that hindered settling only affects the concentration in the main suspension region and does not affect the concentration near the bed or water surface this can be explained as follows since momentum transporting eddies are small in the bottom surface the density difference over eddy length scale is negligible whereas at the surface sediment concentration is much lower than in the main area as a result the concentration profile shows no significant difference near the free surface and near the bottom region due to hindered settling in addition figs 9 b 9 d 9 f and 9 h show that the effect of hindered settling is less evident when a less value of reference concentration c a 0 02 is used whereas in figs 9 a 9 c 9 e and 9 g the effect is clearly visible where a value of c a 0 07 was considered thus one can conclude that the higher the reference concentration the greater is the impact of hindered settling on concentration distribution the settling rate of a particle along a downward vertical direction is hindered by other suspended particles in the flow region due to the hindrance of the settling mechanism the higher the reference concentration the more particles will be in suspension due to the presence of more particles in the suspension the obstruction for a single particle caused by the other particles will be greater which results in an increased concentration profile consequently the more are the sediments at the reference concentration the more are these distributed throughout the region in figs 9 a to 9 h it is shown that as time passes the difference between concentrations increases and after a while there is no change 4 3 time variation of vertical concentration profiles with different eddy viscosity in fig 10 time evolution of suspended sediment concentration profile with different turbulent eddy viscosity are shown for times t ˆ 1 2 5 and 15 at x ˆ 2 to this end two cases have been considered i initially there is no sediment in the water column i e c ˆ 0 t ˆ 0 and the inlet has no sediment c ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 figs 10 a 10 c 10 e and 10 g and ii water column has uniform sediment concentration initially i e c ˆ 0 t ˆ 1 and inlet has uniform sediment concentration c ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 figs 10 b 10 d 10 f and 10 h inside the figures the necessary parameters are listed the figures show the solutions for three different eddy viscosity distributions constant linear and parabolic in figs 10 a 10 c 10 e and 10 g sediment entrainment rate is higher for constant eddy viscosity and less for linear viscosity whereas for parabolic eddy viscosity entrainment rate is in the middle the reason for this is due to turbulence diffusivity at the bottom causing entrainment on close observation of fig 3 one can observe that the magnitude of the constant eddy viscosity near the bottom is greater than the linear one whereas the parabolic distribution lies in the middle as turbulence diffusivity at the bottom increases the entrainment rate will increase as can be seen from fig 10 the magnitude of the bottom diffusivity for each distribution is reflected in the order of the observed entrainment rate similar result has been found in liu s work liu 2016 it can be seen in figs 10 b 10 d 10 f and 10 h that at the beginning of time all profiles are nearly the same except at the top portion of the channel where the parabolic profile tends to zero at the surface and as time goes on the linear profile deviates more from the others a similar outcome was achieved in liu and nayamatullah 2014 and mohan et al s 2020 studies moreover one can follow from fig 8 that the magnitude of concentration values is larger for c ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 and c ˆ 0 t ˆ 1 as compared to c ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 and c ˆ 0 t ˆ 0 for all three eddy viscosity distributions in the case of sediment free inlet and sediment free ic the downstream concentration profile develops more slowly in contrast the downstream profile deviates from the uniformity in the case of uniform initial concentration and uniform concentration in the inlet 4 4 concentration contours and average concentration fig 11 a depicts the concentration contour lines the advancement of depth averaged concentration c ˆ a v g along x ˆ is shown in fig 11 b both the figures are plotted at large time the required parameters are w ˆ 0 0 2 λ ˆ 0 2 a ˆ 0 05 and n h 0 both the profiles in figs 11 a and 11 b follow the same pattern as those of mei 1969 hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 liu 2016 and kumbhakar et al 2022 according to fig 11 b the asymptotic value of c ˆ a v g is almost identical to liu s 2016 and kumbhakar et al s 2022 results 4 5 bottom concentration profiles in experiments carried out by jobson and sayre 1970 and in a numerical solution by celik and rodi 1988 the bottom concentration overshoots the equilibrium value in certain inlet conditions among analytical and semi analytical solution approaches overshooting behaviour has been described by cheng 1984 liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu 2016 mohan et al 2020 and kumbhakar et al 2022 the bottom concentration c ˆ x ˆ z ˆ a ˆ is plotted against the horizontal distance x ˆ in fig 12 at steady state condition the parameters required for computation are defined inside the figures according to the figures considering c ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 and c ˆ 0 t ˆ 1 the overshooting occurs irrespective of turbulent eddy viscosity profiles for a sediment free inlet bc and sediment free ic however it does not occur the overshoot is due to the ic and the inlet bc being incompatible with the rest of the bcs and governing equation in overshooting the linear profile responds more than the other two a similar overshooting trend in bottom concentration can be seen in liu 2016 and kumbhakar et al s 2022 model 4 6 experimental validation at steady state and far field conditions to the best of the authors knowledge no experimental data can be found in literature on unsteady suspended sediment transport in 2d the accuracy of the present model cannot therefore be verified directly however many experimental data concerning the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration are available at large time and far from the downstream the 2d unsteady model behaves like a 1d steady model i e the solution of the present model approaches the far field solution as t ˆ and x ˆ thus the solution of the present model is validated with the relevant experiment data at a large value of t ˆ and far from downstream for this purpose two types of data have been considered einstein and chien 1955 data for non dilute flow and coleman 1981 data for dilute flow einstein and chien 1955 conducted 16 different experiments titled run s 1 to s 16 with particles of diameters of 0 274 0 940 and 1 3 mm very close to the channel bed while coleman 1981 performed 40 different tests with three different sand particles of diameter 0 105 0 21 and 0 42 mm by using a 15 m long and 356 mm wide smooth flume for validation six data sets were selected randomly namely run s 10 s 12 and s 13 from einstein and chien 1955 and 2 13 and 24 from coleman 1981 in figs 13 and 14 the proposed model is compared to the experimental results of einstein and chien 1955 and coleman 1981 respectively at large time and far from downstream in both the cases the parabolic profile of turbulent eddy viscosity is selected and all other required parameters are listed in table 2 the effect of hindered settling is also illustrated in the figures for both experimental data in einstein and chien 1955 data the hindered settling effect clearly appears whereas in coleman data coleman 1981 it does not seem to be as apparent this is because einstein and chien 1955 data are for high concentrated flows while coleman 1981 data are for low concentrated flows in the case of high concentrated flows the significant change in the concentration distribution with and without hindered settling mechanism illustrates the importance of incorporating this factor into the mathematical model it can be observed from figs 13 and 14 that the proposed model matches the experimental data well and is therefore considered physically realistic for predicting suspended sediment concentration distribution in wide open channels a similar validation of model with experimental data can be found in mohan et al 2020 and kumbhakar et al 2022 5 conclusions a generalized model for transportation of sediment in a turbulent flow through a wide open channel is presented here the governing equation which is the advection diffusion equation represents unsteady 2d transport of sediments and the bottom boundary condition is a generalized one that takes into account the deposition of velocity of sediment together with equilibrium bottom concentration the main transport equation considers an important phenomenon which is hindered settling i e the changed settling velocity of a particle in presence of other particles in suspension most of the existing models of non equilibrium transport are special cases of the present model and this single model is capable to address all the results obtained by different existing models for the first time non linearity through hindered settling term is considered in the main transport equation as well as in boundary conditions and it is confirmed that the hindered settling mechanism affects only the concentration in the main suspension region and not the concentration near the bottom or top surface which was speculated by previous researchers for the numerical solution of the model openfoam a powerful open source fv method based cfd framework has been used which can easily address all non linearity present in the model the model considers simple log law as velocity distribution and three types of eddy viscosity viz constant linear and parabolic the model shows six existing models as special cases and is validated by comparing with some of those models under specified conditions apart from those six existing models several other existing models also can be obtained from the present model by imposing certain conditions the numerical approach is very general assures convergence and can be a beneficial addition to the sediment transport research source code availability a sample of the source code is available at the following link

3086,the present paper formulates a generalized model for non equilibrium suspended sediment transport through an open channel turbulent flow that contains all the existing models in literature as special cases the two dimensional 2d unsteady model for suspended concentration distribution contains the effect of hindered settling and the bottom boundary condition considers deposition velocity together with equilibrium bottom concentration openfoam an open source finite volume fv method based framework has been used for the numerical approximation of the model the proposed model addresses the non linearity in the governing equation as well as the non linearity in boundary conditions picard iteration approach has been utilized to ensure the convergence of the numerical solution with

over an erodible bed in a turbulent flow an improved understanding of advection diffusion process is required voluminous research have been carried out since long but the irregular behaviour of turbulence never allowed to have a complete knowledge about the matter and the research on the same will ever be continued an advection diffusion approach is widely used to predict the suspended concentration distribution along vertical as well as horizontal directions in a wide channel with uniform flow the governing equation for sediment transport which is the advection diffusion equation has been solved by numerical analytical or empirical approaches initiation was done by rouse 1937 in 1937 who analytically solved simple diffusion equation for steady uniform one dimensional 1d transport of sediment later in 1954 hunt 1954 considered continuity equation of sediment and water separately and coupled them through settling velocity of sediment to make a single equation and solved analytically following rouse 1937 and hunt 1954 a large number of models rijn 1984 umeyama 1992 cellino and graf 1999 chiu et al 2000 graf and cellino 2002 ghoshal and kundu 2013 kumbhakar et al 2018 can be found in literature that considered different turbulent features to make the models more logical and realistic the number of research in this area is so large that it is almost impossible to mention even a tiny part of it and the cited works are just a few in comparison to these 1d steady transport models 1d unsteady or 2d steady models are quite less in number as these models are based on partial differential equations which is not as simple as to deal with ordinary differential equations for this reason the existing models in these cases do not contain turbulent features also hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 solved the 2d steady transport problem by the classical method of separating variables and considered very simple boundary conditions prior to this mei 1969 solved the same governing equation by laplace transformation taking zero flux condition at the free surface and constant bottom concentration apart from these works several works can be found in literature galappatti and vreugdenhil 1985 wang and ribberink 1986 wang 1992 bolla pittaluga and seminara 2003 who solved steady 2d problem considering fixed bottom boundary condition cheng 1984 was the first to develop a generalized bottom boundary condition considering the deposition velocity and the equilibrium bottom concentration he solved 1d unsteady transport equation with this generalized bottom boundary condition later liu and nayamatullah 2014 and liu 2016 considered this condition in their 1d unsteady and 2d steady problems respectively all these models discussed here are linear pdes and do not contain any turbulent phenomenon that can make the governing equations non linear settling velocity is an important phenomenon in the transport of suspended sediment which usually is taken as constant in the advection diffusion models however richardson and zaki 1954 showed that the presence of adjacent particles changes the settling velocity of a particle causing it to settle slower and this should be incorporated when dealing with high concentrated flows several diffusive models pal and ghoshal 2014 2017 kumbhakar et al 2018 mohan et al 2019 jain and ghoshal 2021 jain et al 2021 on one dimensional steady transport can be found in literature that took into account this effect apart from these 1d transport studies very few other studies considered this effect as inclusion of this effect makes the pde non linear which is difficult to handle both numerically and semi analytically jing et al 2018 considered hindered settling effect in their steady 2d transport model and solved numerically mohan et al 2020 considered this effect in the 1d unsteady transport problem and obtained a semi analytical solution using homotopy analysis method recently kumbhakar et al 2022 used the same method to solve the 2d steady transport formulation incorporating hindered settling effect as already mentioned that in comparison to 1d steady transport model 1d unsteady and 2d steady transport models are quite less moreover researchers considered 2d steady and 1d unsteady transport models separately because under constant advection assumption these two are mathematically equivalent i e the horizontal coordinate can be treated as time liu and nayamatullah 2014 mathematically both of these problems are 2d in nature literature lack in a transport model which is unsteady as well as 2d the possible reason might be that in this case the problem becomes mathematically three dimensional which is obviously more difficult to tackle moreover inclusion of hindered settling effect makes the three dimensional model non linear thus the main objective of the present work is to construct and solve a generalized advection diffusion model where concentration is a function of time as well as two space coordinates together with the hindered settling effect and the most generalized bottom boundary condition as a result all the previously existing models will be special cases of this generalized model and all the results obtained from different models can be obtained from a single model due to high non linearity involved with the present model the analytical solution is not possible except for very special cases the focus thus should be given to finding its numerical solution openfoam jasak 1996 provides a framework for solving differential equations based on finite volume fv approximations however non linearity handling capability is not present as a standard module thus a non linear solution framework has been implemented within openfoam coding additionally the open source nature of openfoam increases both the accessibility and the reviewability of the present study 2 model formulation 2 1 mathematical equations for non equilibrium sediment transport see fig 1 the governing equation is the advection diffusion equation which describes the suspended load transport of sediment in a turbulent open channel flow considering a wide channel with uniform flow the governing equation of the concentration of suspended sediment is given by 1 c t u c x z w s c z ϵ s c z where t represents time c denotes the sediment concentration x and z are the longitudinal stream wise and vertical directions respectively u is the mean velocity component in stream wise direction ϵ s is the sediment diffusion coefficient w s is the settling velocity of the sediment particles which is directed vertically downward as the flow is assumed to be uniform along the stream wise direction and independent of time u varies only in the vertical direction to derive concentration distributions from eq 1 we need to know the expressions for w s ϵ s and u several studies have been made to derive an expression for settling velocity it has been demonstrated that sediment particles settle more slowly in sediment water mixed flow than in clear water flow a phenomenon known as hindered settling according to richardson and zaki 1954 the settling velocity of sediment particles and the concentration in a sediment laden flow are related mathematically as 2 w s w 0 1 c n h where w 0 is the settling velocity of sediment particles in clear water and which can be determined by the well known expression of cheng 1997 given as 3 ω 0 ν d 25 1 2 d 2 5 1 5 where d d s 1 g ν 2 1 3 is the non dimensional diameter of sediment particle in which d is the diameter of that sediment particle ν is the kinematic viscosity of water g is the acceleration due to gravity s is the relative density of sediment particles and n h is the reduction exponent of settling velocity depending on the particle reynolds number r e p n h decreases from 4 9 to 2 3 as r e p increases from 0 1 to 10 3 to simplify the mathematics however an average value of n h 4 may be considered ali and dey 2016 mohan et al 2019 2020 ghoshal et al 2022 besides w s ϵ s is another parameter in eq 1 which also contributes in determining the distribution profile of sediment concentration sediment diffusivity ϵ s is likely to be analogous with turbulent eddy viscosity ϵ f many researchers majumdar and carstens 1967 jobson and sayre 1970 have found that ϵ s ϵ f and the inequality is expressed as follows 4 β ϵ s ϵ f where β is the ratio of sediment diffusivity ϵ s to turbulent eddy viscosity ϵ f which is known as the inverse of turbulent schimdt number with settling velocity w s and sediment diffusivity ϵ s substituted from eqs 2 and 4 respectively eq 1 converts to 5 c t u c x z w 0 1 c n h c z β ϵ f c z where w 0 is given by eq 3 the term w 0 1 c n h in the left hand side of eq 5 arises due to the hindered settling effect eq 5 is a 2d initial boundary value problem ibvp with any ibvp the specification of appropriate boundary conditions bcs for the dependent variable represents a crucial component of the respective mathematical formulation vertically sediment particles are suspended from a particular reference level z a a is the reference level to the top surface z h h is the flow depth at z h there is no mass transfer and hence the most often used bc thereat is the zero flux bc the zero sediment flux bc at the free surface can be expressed as cheng 1984 liu and nayamatullah

with the flux being equal to the rate at which sediment is placed in suspension cheng 1984 formulated a generalized bottom bc which is as follows 7 β ϵ f c z w s c λ c c at z a where c denotes the equilibrium concentration at z a and λ is a depth independent parameter depending on the concentration at the bottom surface λ changes physically λ mentioned in eq 7 is interpreted as the reflectively coefficient of the bottom boundary surface when λ 0 the bottom surface behaves like a perfectly reflective surface while λ corresponds to a perfectly absorbing surface cheng 1984 an ideal situation

inlet bc defined in eq 13 is of dirichlet type 2 2 velocity distribution and eddy viscosity closure the stream wise advection velocity u can be taken as a constant value hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 jing et al 2018 however it is reasonable to consider the more realistic log law as suggested by liu 2016 which reads as 15 u z u κ ln z z 0 where z 0 is the start elevation of the log law formula and κ is the von karman constant the value of κ is taken as 0 41 throughout the study eq 15 can be further rewritten into the following non dimensional form liu 2016 16 u ˆ z ˆ 1 z ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 ln z ˆ 0 1 ln z ˆ

with flow depth yang et al 2004 first discovered that shear stress in clear water flows deviates from its linear profile in the outer region and he accordingly suggested a modification yang 2007 later analysed the effect of sediment concentration on turbulent characteristics finding that the measured reynolds stress in sediment laden flows was systematically higher than that in flows with clear water in fig 2 experimental measurements of reynolds shear stress for sediment laden flows are plotted based on the data from muste and patel 1997 cellino and graf 1999 graf and cellino 2002 and muste et al 2005 as can be seen from fig 2 other than a slight scattering these profiles generally maintain a linear trend additionally the linear profile of reynolds stress distribution does not significantly change with the presence of sediment particles in the inner region z h 0 2 the profile falls to zero rather quickly deviating from the linear trend it is likely that this deviation is caused by the high concentration in this area graf and cellino 2002 this type of linear distribution of reynolds shear stress in suspension flows was also reported by best et al 1997 righetti and romano 2004 and lyn 1988 the linear relationship of the reynolds shear stress τ with the vertical depth z of the channel can be written as muste and patel 1997 17 τ τ b 1 z h where τ b ρ u 2 in which ρ is the fluid density is the bed shear stress according to the boussinesq hypothesis the reynolds shear stress τ in turbulent flows can also be expressed as 18 τ ρ ϵ f d u d z considering that the logarithmic velocity profile is preserved throughout the flow depth the velocity gradient d u d z can be expressed as 19 d u d z u κ z combining the linear variation of reynolds shear stress with the logarithmic velocity law i e by using eqs 18 and 19 in eq 17 the following expression for eddy viscosity can be derived rijn 1987 20 ϵ f κ u z 1 z h eq 20 accounts for the parabolic distribution of eddy viscosity and is widely used for eddy viscosity calculation in sediment laden open channel flows in addition to this parabolic distribution linear and constant distributions of eddy viscosity can also be found in the literature rijn 1987 below are the mathematical expressions for the eddy viscosities considered in this study rijn 1987 constant type 21 ϵ f z κ α 1 u h dimensional form or 22 ϵ ˆ

ˆ 1 z ˆ non dimensional form the model parameters α 1 and α 2 have been suggested by rijn 1987 as 6 and 3 respectively fig 3 shows all the three eddy viscosity distributions along with experimental data of coleman 1970 ueda et al 1977 nezu 1985 and muste et al 2005 the suggested values of α 1 and α 2 by van rijn result in comparable eddy viscosities for all three distributions several studies have used all of these three parabolic linear and constant in sediment laden open channel flows including liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu 2016 mohan et al 2020 and kundu 2022 physically the parabolic distribution is most satisfactory as it is based on a linear distribution of the shear stress and a logarithmic velocity profile rijn 1987 these three different types of sediment diffusivity models are taken into account in the present model to ensure the broad applicability of this study 2 3 different sub cases in the present study eqs 10 14 are used to predict the transient suspended concentration distribution in a wide open channel by including the hindered settling mechanism as a point to note in eq 10 the velocity distribution u ˆ z ˆ and the turbulent eddy viscosity ϵ ˆ f z ˆ can be arbitrary profiles of z ˆ however we limit our work to the forms taken in section 2 2 the following are some sub cases of the proposed model eqs 10 14 sub case i by assuming constant advection velocity and parabolic type eddy viscosity along with no time variation and no hindered settling the present model eqs 10 14 reduces to the model of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 which is as follows

1944 mei 1969 galappatti and vreugdenhil 1985 wang and ribberink 1986 mendoza 1991 wang 1992 and bolla pittaluga and seminara 2003 can also be obtained from the present model under specific conditions that can easily be checked by interested readers the models presented in sub case ii iii and v are unsteady 1d whereas the models in sub case i iv and vi are steady and 2d in the present study the model eqs 10 14 considered is unsteady 2d and is a generalization of all the aforementioned models mentioned in sub cases i vi the proposed model eqs 10 14 is highly non linear with non homogeneous robin bcs and cannot be solved analytically in general except in few simplified cases where certain restrictions must be applied as an alternative to analytic solutions for the particular cases numerical solutions for more general cases are attempted by using finite volume technique 3 numerical methodology this study uses openfoam an open source finite volume fv method based computational fluid dynamics cfd framework to get the numerical solution of the proposed model described in eqs 10 14 openfoam contains the necessary infrastructure needed to discretize the governing equations both spatially and temporally and to solve the system of linear algebraic equations generated from the discretization process 3 1 handling non linearity in governing equation in addition to applying the standard fv method to the spatial domain of eq 10 the euler time marching scheme is incorporated into the temporal domain as a result a system of non linear algebraic equations is generated which must be linearized or iterated to solve at a discrete level newton s method and picard iteration methods are more commonly used iteration procedures invoking a backward euler method fully implicit the semi discretized form of eq 10 takes the following form 51 c ˆ i 1 c ˆ i δ t ˆ u ˆ z ˆ c ˆ x ˆ i 1 z ˆ w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ i 1 n h c ˆ i 1 z ˆ β ϵ ˆ f z ˆ c ˆ z ˆ i 1 the superscripts i and i 1 refer the previous and current time levels t ˆ t ˆ i and t ˆ t ˆ i 1 respectively c ˆ i 1 is the value of c ˆ at current time level i 1 and is supposed to be unknown whereas c ˆ i is the old time level value of c ˆ at time level i which is known δ t ˆ t ˆ i 1 t ˆ i is the time step the settling velocity w ˆ s w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ n h is evaluated using c ˆ i 1 due to the non linear dependence of w ˆ s on the sediment concentration c ˆ some iterative linearization procedure must be introduced into eq 51 to get the numerical solution in our study we have adopted picard iteration method for linearizing the suspended concentration eq 51 a sequential estimation of the unknown c ˆ i 1 using the latest estimates of w ˆ s i 1 is invoked in the picard iteration method with the superscripts i and j denoting the time level and picard iteration level respectively the linearized form of the eq 51 can be written respectively as 52 c ˆ i 1 j 1 c ˆ i δ t ˆ u ˆ z ˆ c ˆ x ˆ i 1 j 1 z ˆ w ˆ 0 1 c a c ˆ i 1 j n h c ˆ i 1 j 1 z ˆ β ϵ ˆ f z ˆ c ˆ z ˆ i 1 j 1 the description of different numerical schemes for different derivative terms present in eq 52 is given in table 1 to solve the discrete linear algebraic equations obtained from eq 52 the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver with a diagonal incomplete cholesky dic preconditioner was adopted compared to other iterative matrix solvers the above one is computationally inexpensive and has better convergence rates 3 2 treatment of various bcs dirichlet and neumann bcs are pre defined in openfoam and are called fixedvalue and fixedgradient type bcs respectively there is a boundary condition known as mixed that can be used to switch between fixed value and fixed gradient situations on a particular boundary but cannot be applied directly to implement robin bc the dirichlet bcs are specified as fixedvalue type bc from openfoam library observing closely the robin bcs in eqs 11 and 12 one can find that those equations are non linear in c ˆ since each bc consists of the non linear hindered settling velocity term w ˆ s in openfoam the execution of this type of non linear robin bc is not straightforward in this study nonlinearrobinbc type bc has been developed in openfoam framework for specifying zero sediment and dynamic sediment flux on the top and bottom boundaries the respective non linearity in the bcs is resolved using newton raphson method considering n h 0 in eqs 11 and 12 the top and bottom bcs respectively become linear functions of c ˆ and these bcs are implemented in openfoam as linearrobinbc type 3 3 convergence criterion besides accuracy the desired computational effort is another aspect of iterative methods for solving non linear equations with a careful choice of a convergence criterion computational expenses can be minimized by reducing the number of iterations needed for the solver s convergence the residual is one of the most important metrics of iterative solver convergence because it directly quantifies error a root mean square rms residual criterion is used here as the convergence criterion on the picard iteration scheme described in eq 52 the considered root mean square residuals are defined by the following 53 1 n c ˆ i 1 j 1 c ˆ i 1 j 2 δ c ˆ t o l where n is the total number of finite volume cells and the summation is taken over the total number of cells and δ c ˆ t o l is the tolerance level which is considered as 10 6 in this work 4 results and discussion in this section the numerical technique adopted in this work is first validated by comparing the obtained numerical results with various analytical and semi analytical solutions then several significant results related to physical phenomena such as hindered settling and overshooting of bottom boundary concentrations are presented theoretically and graphically at the end the proposed model is validated with existing models under steady state and far field conditions 4 1 numerical tests to demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical technique adopted in this work the present model was converted into several existing suspension concentration models the numerical solution was compared to analytical and semi analytical solutions of those existing models validation with analytical solution of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 a simplified suspended sediment transport model based on constant advection velocity and parabolic eddy viscosity was proposed by hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 one can easily convert the present model to hjelmfelt and lenau s hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 model which is shown in sub case i in section 2 3 in the model of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 the physical problem is as follows a sediment free flow of water enters a natural channel and picks up sediments from the bottom until far downstream equilibrium is attained the open channel here is wide and rectangular the analytical solution is obtained at the central region of the channel through its cross sectional area as the effect of side wall is negligible here in fig 4 the vertical concentration profiles at different downstream locations x ˆ 0 1 0 5 1 1 5 2 have been depicted the required parameters are in the figure s caption values of the parameters are chosen from hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 as x ˆ increases the vertical concentration profile becomes more uniform as shown in fig 4 the solution tends to the rouse equation when x ˆ fig 4 shows the pattern of concentration profiles on a sediment bed along the horizontal direction when the inlet sediment concentration is zero the non uniform transport of suspended sediment of uniform size in an open channel is considered here initially sediment free water enters the channel scouring the sediment bed and picking up the sediment in the suspension region during the process of scouring and picking up sediment the concentration profiles in the horizontal direction change by increasing x ˆ more sediment particles will be suspended in the suspension region increasing the magnitude of the concentration profile it continues to increase the concentration profile up until a certain downstream location upon reaching equilibrium at a far downstream location the concentration profile will not change at equilibrium state the net upward sediment transport caused by diffusion becomes equal to the net downward sediment flux caused by settling consequently the concentration profile becomes the rouse profile at a far downstream when equilibrium is reached it is evident from fig 4 that the obtained numerical results are in close agreement with the analytical solution of hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 validation with analytical solution of cheng 1984 a simplification of the present model to cheng s model cheng 1984 is given in sub case ii in section 2 3 based upon generalized bottom boundary condition and constant eddy viscosity model cheng 1984 has analytically solved a one dimensional non equilibrium unsteady sediment transport equation using the numerical method of the present study cheng s cheng 1984 test cases were solved and the numerical solution was compared with the analytical solution figs 5 a 5 c illustrate the time variation of the vertical distribution of suspended sediment with different values of c ˆ the time variation of bottom concentration is shown in fig 5 d all the necessary parameters are given within the figures values of the parameters are taken from cheng 1984 as shown in fig 5 d the concentration distribution at first exceeds its equilibrium value and then gradually diminishes to the equilibrium bottom concentration value c ˆ this can be explained as follows initially sediment particles are uniformly distributed throughout the entire flow depth once the flow begins particles start mixing with a constant rate of diffusivity over the water column in this case value of λ ˆ is 2 indicating that the bottom surface is neither fully reflecting nor absorbing but a combination of both as a result when particles hit the bottom surface they remain on the bottom surface resulting in an initial increase in bottom concentration and overshooting with time the bottom concentration stabilizes due to the mixing process overshoot increases as c ˆ becomes smaller with increasing c ˆ the time taken for bottom concentration to attain the equilibrium state decreases cheng 1984 as seen in the figures the numerical solution agrees well with cheng s analytical solution cheng 1984 validation with semi analytical solution of liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu and nayamatullah 2014 presented a semi analytical solution to 1d unsteady non equilibrium suspended sediment transport problem with arbitrary turbulent eddy viscosity and generalized bottom boundary conditions in sub case iii of section 2 3 there is a description of the conversion process from the present model to that of liu and nayamatullah 2014 the vertical variation of suspended sediment concentration at a particular time t ˆ for different turbulent eddy viscosity is plotted in fig 6 a list of the required parameters appears inside the figure values of the parameters are chosen from liu and nayamatullah 2014 according to fig 6 the profiles are almost identical except for the free surface portion at the top of the channel where the parabolic eddy viscosity profile shows zero sediment concentration from fig 6 one can follow that liu and nayamatullah s analytical solution liu and nayamatullah 2014 and the numerical solution are in good agreement validation with analytical solution of liu 2016 using arbitrary eddy viscosity and advection velocity distributions liu 2016 presented an analytical solution to steady 2d suspended sediment transport model with the generalized bottom bc cheng 1984 the conversion of the present model to liu s model liu 2016 is described in sub case iv in section 2 3 the comparison between the numerical solution and the analytical solution is depicted in fig 7 fig 7 a represents vertical sediment concentration profile corresponding to an inlet with clear water while fig 7 b represents concentration profile with an inlet with uniform sediment concentration at a particular downstream location x ˆ 2 the model parameters are provided within the figures values of the parameters are selected from liu 2016 fig 7 reveals that the numerical results are in close agreement with the analytical solution of liu 2016 in addition the two other sub cases sub case v and vi mentioned in section 2 3 can also be verified with the present numerical method and left for interested readers 4 2 impact of hindered settling mechanism on vertical concentration distributions fig 8 illustrates the concentration profile affected by hindered settling on the bottom and top surfaces at steady state and far field conditions the required parameters are listed in the figure s caption as shown in fig 8 incorporating hindered settling effect in the main transport equation and the bottom and top bcs does not result in any significant difference compared to the case when imposing hindered settling effect only in the main transport equation in fact the same was done by mohan et al 2020 and recently by kumbhakar et al 2022 mentioning that the hindered effect is not considered in the top bc as particles are not present there and is not considered in the bottom bc as particles are not in suspension recently ghoshal et al 2022 studied 1d unsteady transport from mixing length point of view since this study is from completely different aspect and cannot be obtained from the generalized model of the present study it has not been mentioned in literature survey there also they did not take this effect in the bcs mentioning that inclusion of that effect in bcs will make the model complicated which may not bring any new result and left it for interested readers to test if any changes occur really unlike the numerical method used in that work the present method can easily solve the model with complicated bcs by the numerical method adopted here and confirms that the hindered settling effect comes in the main suspension region only therefore the discussion will move forward by considering the hindered settling effect only in the main transport equation and not in the bottom and top bcs fig 9 shows the z direction concentration distributions of sediment in suspension affected by the hindered settling mechanism with the exponent n h at different times t ˆ 1 2 5 and 15 at a particular downstream location x ˆ 2 a value of n h 0 corresponds to the case with no consideration for hindered settling while a value of n h 4 corresponds to the case with consideration for hindered settling for all cases the ic is c ˆ 0 t ˆ 0 and the inlet is clear water with no sediment c ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 two different values of c a 0 07 figs 9 a 9 c 9 e and 9 g and 0 02 figs 9 b 9 d 9 f and 9 h have been considered parabolic distribution for ϵ ˆ f has been used for all the cases the other relevant parameters are listed inside the figures the figures demonstrate that hindered settling only affects the concentration in the main suspension region and does not affect the concentration near the bed or water surface this can be explained as follows since momentum transporting eddies are small in the bottom surface the density difference over eddy length scale is negligible whereas at the surface sediment concentration is much lower than in the main area as a result the concentration profile shows no significant difference near the free surface and near the bottom region due to hindered settling in addition figs 9 b 9 d 9 f and 9 h show that the effect of hindered settling is less evident when a less value of reference concentration c a 0 02 is used whereas in figs 9 a 9 c 9 e and 9 g the effect is clearly visible where a value of c a 0 07 was considered thus one can conclude that the higher the reference concentration the greater is the impact of hindered settling on concentration distribution the settling rate of a particle along a downward vertical direction is hindered by other suspended particles in the flow region due to the hindrance of the settling mechanism the higher the reference concentration the more particles will be in suspension due to the presence of more particles in the suspension the obstruction for a single particle caused by the other particles will be greater which results in an increased concentration profile consequently the more are the sediments at the reference concentration the more are these distributed throughout the region in figs 9 a to 9 h it is shown that as time passes the difference between concentrations increases and after a while there is no change 4 3 time variation of vertical concentration profiles with different eddy viscosity in fig 10 time evolution of suspended sediment concentration profile with different turbulent eddy viscosity are shown for times t ˆ 1 2 5 and 15 at x ˆ 2 to this end two cases have been considered i initially there is no sediment in the water column i e c ˆ 0 t ˆ 0 and the inlet has no sediment c ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 figs 10 a 10 c 10 e and 10 g and ii water column has uniform sediment concentration initially i e c ˆ 0 t ˆ 1 and inlet has uniform sediment concentration c ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 figs 10 b 10 d 10 f and 10 h inside the figures the necessary parameters are listed the figures show the solutions for three different eddy viscosity distributions constant linear and parabolic in figs 10 a 10 c 10 e and 10 g sediment entrainment rate is higher for constant eddy viscosity and less for linear viscosity whereas for parabolic eddy viscosity entrainment rate is in the middle the reason for this is due to turbulence diffusivity at the bottom causing entrainment on close observation of fig 3 one can observe that the magnitude of the constant eddy viscosity near the bottom is greater than the linear one whereas the parabolic distribution lies in the middle as turbulence diffusivity at the bottom increases the entrainment rate will increase as can be seen from fig 10 the magnitude of the bottom diffusivity for each distribution is reflected in the order of the observed entrainment rate similar result has been found in liu s work liu 2016 it can be seen in figs 10 b 10 d 10 f and 10 h that at the beginning of time all profiles are nearly the same except at the top portion of the channel where the parabolic profile tends to zero at the surface and as time goes on the linear profile deviates more from the others a similar outcome was achieved in liu and nayamatullah 2014 and mohan et al s 2020 studies moreover one can follow from fig 8 that the magnitude of concentration values is larger for c ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 and c ˆ 0 t ˆ 1 as compared to c ˆ 0 z ˆ 0 and c ˆ 0 t ˆ 0 for all three eddy viscosity distributions in the case of sediment free inlet and sediment free ic the downstream concentration profile develops more slowly in contrast the downstream profile deviates from the uniformity in the case of uniform initial concentration and uniform concentration in the inlet 4 4 concentration contours and average concentration fig 11 a depicts the concentration contour lines the advancement of depth averaged concentration c ˆ a v g along x ˆ is shown in fig 11 b both the figures are plotted at large time the required parameters are w ˆ 0 0 2 λ ˆ 0 2 a ˆ 0 05 and n h 0 both the profiles in figs 11 a and 11 b follow the same pattern as those of mei 1969 hjelmfelt and lenau 1970 liu 2016 and kumbhakar et al 2022 according to fig 11 b the asymptotic value of c ˆ a v g is almost identical to liu s 2016 and kumbhakar et al s 2022 results 4 5 bottom concentration profiles in experiments carried out by jobson and sayre 1970 and in a numerical solution by celik and rodi 1988 the bottom concentration overshoots the equilibrium value in certain inlet conditions among analytical and semi analytical solution approaches overshooting behaviour has been described by cheng 1984 liu and nayamatullah 2014 liu 2016 mohan et al 2020 and kumbhakar et al 2022 the bottom concentration c ˆ x ˆ z ˆ a ˆ is plotted against the horizontal distance x ˆ in fig 12 at steady state condition the parameters required for computation are defined inside the figures according to the figures considering c ˆ 0 z ˆ 1 and c ˆ 0 t ˆ 1 the overshooting occurs irrespective of turbulent eddy viscosity profiles for a sediment free inlet bc and sediment free ic however it does not occur the overshoot is due to the ic and the inlet bc being incompatible with the rest of the bcs and governing equation in overshooting the linear profile responds more than the other two a similar overshooting trend in bottom concentration can be seen in liu 2016 and kumbhakar et al s 2022 model 4 6 experimental validation at steady state and far field conditions to the best of the authors knowledge no experimental data can be found in literature on unsteady suspended sediment transport in 2d the accuracy of the present model cannot therefore be verified directly however many experimental data concerning the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration are available at large time and far from the downstream the 2d unsteady model behaves like a 1d steady model i e the solution of the present model approaches the far field solution as t ˆ and x ˆ thus the solution of the present model is validated with the relevant experiment data at a large value of t ˆ and far from downstream for this purpose two types of data have been considered einstein and chien 1955 data for non dilute flow and coleman 1981 data for dilute flow einstein and chien 1955 conducted 16 different experiments titled run s 1 to s 16 with particles of diameters of 0 274 0 940 and 1 3 mm very close to the channel bed while coleman 1981 performed 40 different tests with three different sand particles of diameter 0 105 0 21 and 0 42 mm by using a 15 m long and 356 mm wide smooth flume for validation six data sets were selected randomly namely run s 10 s 12 and s 13 from einstein and chien 1955 and 2 13 and 24 from coleman 1981 in figs 13 and 14 the proposed model is compared to the experimental results of einstein and chien 1955 and coleman 1981 respectively at large time and far from downstream in both the cases the parabolic profile of turbulent eddy viscosity is selected and all other required parameters are listed in table 2 the effect of hindered settling is also illustrated in the figures for both experimental data in einstein and chien 1955 data the hindered settling effect clearly appears whereas in coleman data coleman 1981 it does not seem to be as apparent this is because einstein and chien 1955 data are for high concentrated flows while coleman 1981 data are for low concentrated flows in the case of high concentrated flows the significant change in the concentration distribution with and without hindered settling mechanism illustrates the importance of incorporating this factor into the mathematical model it can be observed from figs 13 and 14 that the proposed model matches the experimental data well and is therefore considered physically realistic for predicting suspended sediment concentration distribution in wide open channels a similar validation of model with experimental data can be found in mohan et al 2020 and kumbhakar et al 2022 5 conclusions a generalized model for transportation of sediment in a turbulent flow through a wide open channel is presented here the governing equation which is the advection diffusion equation represents unsteady 2d transport of sediments and the bottom boundary condition is a generalized one that takes into account the deposition of velocity of sediment together with equilibrium bottom concentration the main transport equation considers an important phenomenon which is hindered settling i e the changed settling velocity of a particle in presence of other particles in suspension most of the existing models of non equilibrium transport are special cases of the present model and this single model is capable to address all the results obtained by different existing models for the first time non linearity through hindered settling term is considered in the main transport equation as well as in boundary conditions and it is confirmed that the hindered settling mechanism affects only the concentration in the main suspension region and not the concentration near the bottom or top surface which was speculated by previous researchers for the numerical solution of the model openfoam a powerful open source fv method based cfd framework has been used which can easily address all non linearity present in the model the model considers simple log law as velocity distribution and three types of eddy viscosity viz constant linear and parabolic the model shows six existing models as special cases and is validated by comparing with some of those models under specified conditions apart from those six existing models several other existing models also can be obtained from the present model by imposing certain conditions the numerical

archaean dharwar bastar and singhbhum cratonic blocks is an important precambrian geological entity of peninsular india known as a blueprint for models of reconstruction of columbia rodinia and gondwana dasgupta et al 2013 valdiya 2016 fig 1 a egmb is considered to be a collage of several juxtaposed terrains separated by major shear zones and is characterized by stretching lineation and internal homogeneity in terms of litho package and tectonic history chetty 2001 valdiya 2016 an ultra high temperature metamorphism at mid to lower crustal depths has been reported by many researchers and the thermal models of the present day egmb crust estimated a moho temperature of 550 c dasgupta 1993 bhowmik et al 1995 the concentrations of radioactive elements and the heat production are reported to be highest amongst the granulite belts of india kumar et al 2007 and therefore egmb is classified under zone ii based on the heat flow values fig 1b several surface manifestations mainly low to medium enthalpy thermal waters with temperatures ranging from 42 to 59 c feature in egmb gsi 1987 gsi 1991 thussu 2002 considering the heat flow values many researchers have suggested for exploration of thermal waters for electricity production using binary cycle power plants or through enhanced geothermal systems chandrasekharam and chandrasekhar 2010 studies were conducted on the

to gain better insights into genesis mixing processes geochemical evolution and residence time distribution of thermal fluids sammel and craig 1981 navada and rao 1991 chatterjee et al 2016 2017 keesari et al 2019 as per the current database the thermal waters age ranges from 40 years in himalayan province to 18 6 ka in godavari valley chatterjee et al 2018 chatterjee et al 2019 and the estimated temperature ranges from 50 c himachal region nw himalaya to 250 c puga valley ladakh craig et al 2013 tiwari et al 2016 thermal waters of egmb did not attract much attention from researchers and authorities due to their low enthalpy and uncertainty over their sustainability studies on these thermal waters were mainly focused on the water quality and hydrochemical aspects thussu 2002 zimik et al 2017 and references therein but a few studies were also conducted to understand the source and recharge of the thermal waters using isotope techniques navada et al 1995 the chemical geothermometry estimated a wide range of reservoir temperatures from 92 to 277 c navada et al 1995 mahala 2019 while radiocarbon ages were found to vary from 5 18 ka keesari et al 2019 a few studies attempted isotope characterization of the non thermal waters in this region farooq 2018 but a detailed geochemical analysis of the thermal groundwaters and their intermixing with the non thermal waters is still missing poor understanding of the origin and subsurface temperature of thermal water its recharge history and sustainability act as major impediment to the development of strategies for economic exploitation of these thermal waters we constrained the resident time and temperature of the thermal waters age and heat content of subsurface thermal reservoirs there by trying to understand the upwelling of the juvenile geothermal waters that is a novel observation in cratonic crystalline aquifer with non specific magmatic sources the use of radioisotopes chemical geothermometers mixing models and integrated multi component geothermometry provided unconventional tools to understand the hydro geo dynamic processes of thermal waters that can help to establish the future enhanced geothermal systems egs of this region by using a combination of stable and radioisotope tracers hydrochemistry geochemical modeling and geothermometry we developed a conceptual model

understand the hydrochemical evolution of thermal and non thermal waters and their interactions iii estimate mean transit times of thermal water as well as trace the flow paths and iv develop a model for the thermal and non thermal water circulations in egmb indian shield 2 regional and structural components the egmb falls in a tectonically stable non orogenic field of indian shield this was formed along the eastern coast of peninsular india due to neoproterozoic collisions between the indian cratons and east antarctica dasgupta et al 2013 valdiya 2016 these collisional events and the subsequent successive deformations created a number of faults and shear zones paving way for complex groundwater circulation patterns and geothermal activity ramakrishnan 1987 valdiya 2016 the mahanadi and godavari rift systems divide the egmb into three segments viz northern central and southern fig 1d the egb is broadly divided into the three groups viz khondalite group charnockite group

generated by combusting baco3 precipitate in an elemental analyser ea coupled with the mass spectrometer irms isoprime 100 the results are reported in δ notation and expressed in units of parts per thousand denoted as the δ values are calculated using the eq 2 coplen 1996 2 δ r x r s 1 1000 where r denotes the ratio of heavy to light isotope e g 2h 1h or 18o 16o or 13c 12c and rx and rs are the

precision of measurement is 0 30 2σ laboratory caco3 salt calibrated against the vpdb standard was used for daily calibration the measurement precision is estimated by repeated analysis of laboratory standards while the accuracy is estimated from the deviation of isotopic ratio of standard from the assigned value 3 4 radioisotope measurements for tritium 3h measurement 250 ml of water sample was distilled and electrolyzed in a cool bath 1 4 c for tritium enrichment the enriched sample was mixed with scintillator mixture 8 12 ml and counted for beta activity using an ultra low background

study and the data is given in table s5 for quality assurance spiked samples and distilled water samples are added in each batch of samples so that consistency of measurements is monitored the measurements are periodically crosschecked through iaea inter comparison exercise for radiocarbon 14c measurement the dic was precipitated from 60 l of water and the procedure for baco3 precipitation is same as given for 13c isotope in the laboratory phosphoric acid was added to the baco3 precipitate to evolve co2 in a vacuum line which was then passed through the cold trap mixture of acetone and liquid nitrogen of temperature 70 c to remove the water moisture from the gas the cylinders filled with co2 gas were stored for 15 30 days to allow radon decay finally the co2 was absorbed in the

4990c oxalic acid and the 14c data is reported as pmc percent modern carbon nine samples were collected for radiocarbon measurements table 1 3 5 estimation of reservoir temperature since 1960s chemical geothermometers have been widely used worldwide to predict the subsurface temperature of the geothermal reservoir commonly employed chemical geothermometers also known as classical geothermometers include silica fournier 1977 na k fournier 1979 arnorsson 1983 giggenbach et al 1988 na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 and k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 the implicit assumption in applying chemical geothermometer is that there exists a chemical equilibrium between the interacting thermal water and aquifer mineral for example if the quartz geothermometer is used to estimate the reservoir temperature it is assumed that thermal water has attained equilibrium with quartz mineral present in the host rock similarly na k geothermometer fournier 1979 arnorsson 1983 is based on the equilibrium between albite and k feldspar minerals the equations used for estimating reservoir temperature using chemical geothermometric methods are provided in table s6 in silica enthalpy mixing model enthalpy derived from steam tables is used as an axis rather than temperature this is because the combined heat content enthalpy of the two waters is conserved on mixing whereas the combined temperature is not fournier and truesdell 1970 in this mixing model the silica concentrations of the examined samples were plotted against their corresponding onsite enthalpies the enthalpy values were determined using the steam tables of keenan et al 1969 for the application of this model two end member fluids were considered viz thermal highest temperature water and non thermal nearby cold water the subsurface enthalpy of the geothermal reservoir can be estimated by extrapolating a line joining the data points of local groundwater with that of hot springs which intersects the quartz solubility curve the intersection point represents the silica content of the parent geothermal water before mixing next a vertical line is drawn from the intersection point of the quartz solubility curve to the enthalpy axis and the intersection point in the enthalpy axis denotes the enthalpy of the parent geothermal water before mixing in integrated multicomponent solute geothermometry img method the representative reservoir temperature is estimated based on the saturation state analysis of suitable mineral assemblages spycher et al 2014 the saturation indices si of potential reservoir minerals over a range of temperatures are calculated and plotted as a function of temperature reservoir temperature is estimated from the clustering of log q k curves near to the zero a stand alone computer program geot is used to solve the mass balance mass action equations using newton raphson iterative method refer spycher et al 2014 for details the thermodynamic database soltherm h06 is used to compute the ion activity product q the thermodynamic equilibrium constant k and si values geot also computes different statistical parameters i e median rmed standard deviation sdev mean mean and root mean square error rmse of si values as well as the temperatures at which these statistical parameters attain minimum value trmed tmean tsdev and trmse for a perfectly clustered system trmed tmean tsdev and trmse should be identical and this temperature reflects the computed reservoir temperature the main limitations of this approach are need for exhaustive mineralogical data dependency on steam loss and non thermal mixing and sensitivity towards the choice of the thermodynamic database pang and reed 1998 4 results the thermal discharge is highest at atri site 233 lpm followed by taptapani 82 lpm and athmalik sites 36 lpm the thermal manifestations at tarabalo site are at multiple points and are under marshy condition hence the discharge could not be quantified accurately the previous reports estimated thermal discharges in the range of 33 420 lpm and found overall discharge rates constant throughout the year thussu 2002 mahala 2019 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the temperature of the thermal water ranges from 38 8 to 58 4 c in pre monsoon and 35 8 to 58 9 c in post monsoon seasons the non thermal waters show temperature variations from 29 0 to 34 2 c in pre monsoon and 26 6 to 38 5 c in post monsoon fig s1 irrespective of location the thermal waters are colorless and have gas bubbling with sulfur odor while the non thermal waters are colorless and odorless navada et al 1995 reported similar thermal water temperatures during 1995 suggesting that the temperature of thermal water did not change for the past 25 years during pre monsoon the non thermal waters show a wider variation in electrical conductivity 198 1592 µs cm than thermal waters 788 1312 µs cm a similar trend is observed in the case of post monsoon samples the summary of the hydrochemical data is provided in table 2 and 3 dominance of ions in thermal waters during post monsoon period is in the order of na 150 220 mg l ca2 4 18 mg l mg2 0 5 11 mg l anions follow the order cl 140 245 mg l hco3 54 99 mg l so4 2 36 101 mg l only thermal water at taptapani site show a conspicuous reduction in cl 10 mg l and so4 2 5 mg l concentrations compared to other thermal waters the non thermal waters show the cation order similar to thermal waters na 18 180 mg l ca2 6 70 mg l mg2 1 35 mg l but the anions show a different order compared to the thermal waters hco3 102 446 mg l cl 8 138 mg l so4 2 0 24 mg l the major ion trends in thermal and non thermal waters are shown in schoeller diagrams fig s2a and b no significant difference in the major ion concentration ranges is observed among non thermal waters of different sites the piper s classification shows that the thermal and non thermal waters have different facies suggesting different sources or processes governing geochemistry fig 3 a the hydrochemical facies of the samples indicate that thermal waters barring taptapani site show dominance of na and cl ions cluster i in both seasons however four clusters are observed for non thermal waters cluster ii dominated by ca2 and hco3 indicates recharging nature of water while cluster iii dominated by na and hco3 indicates influence of water rock interaction mainly silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions as discussed in section 5 2 a few non thermal samples also fall in cluster i indicating the possibility of mixing with thermal sources which is supported by warmer temperatures in those samples 34 9 38 5 c samples falling in cluster iv with relatively higher ec values 750 µs cm suggest dissolution of salts from the formation the enrichment of cl average 169 mg l and na average 170 mg l in thermal waters over non thermal waters average cl 29 26 mg l average na 65 6 mg l may be attributed to greater leaching of minerals present in rocks due to elevated temperatures tables s3 and s4 the common sources for na and cl could be minerals like biotite hornblende and feldspar present in the study area mahala 2019 maitra et al 2020 among trace elements fluoride 2 25 13 2 mg l concentration is found to be higher while boron 53 2 128 µg l lithium 40 3 232 µg l and rubidium 41 3434 µg l are lower in concentrations like major ions the trace elements concentrations are also higher in thermal waters compared to non thermal waters table s4 which underlines the influence of greater water rock reactions favoured by high temperature 4 2 stable isotopes 2h 18o and 13c the δ18o and δ2h values of the thermal waters vary from 6 30 to 2 80 and 36 8 to 14 02 respectively during post monsoon and 4 42 to 2 96 and 26 05 to 15 34 respectively during pre monsoon table s5 the thermal water from taptapani site shows most depleted isotopic signature δ18o 6 3 as compared to other sites table s5 like thermal water the non thermal waters also show relatively depleted isotope values at taptapani site average δ18o and δ2h 6 4 and 40 9 in general a wide scatter in isotope data is observed in non thermal waters δ18o 5 28 to 0 98 δ2h 31 94 to 3 58 in pre monsoon and δ18o 6 82 to 0 87 δ2h 45 4 to 0 97 during post monsoon season the isotope plots of the thermal and non thermal waters are shown in fig 4 a b the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 and local meteoric water line lmwl of the study area δ2h 7 92 δ18o 5 74 after kumar et al 2010 are also shown in the plots the possibility of presence of any magmatic component is ruled out considering the wide contrast between the thermal water isotope values and magmatic sources isotope signatures which are enriched in δ18o 6 to 9 and depleted in δ2h 40 to 80 giggenbach 1992 low ec 369 1130 µs cm low cl contents 10 245 mg l and absence of enriched stable isotope δ18o δ2h values preclude the possibility of marine contribution to the studied thermal waters the geothermal waters fall along the gmwl and lmwl clearly demonstrating their meteoric origin fig 4a and the slope close to 8 indicates the recharge without significant evaporation clark and fritz 1997 kumar et al 2010 no δ18o shift in the δ2h vs δ18o plot is observed in thermal waters fig 4a which further indicates that the reservoir temperature is not sufficient enough i e 150 c to shift δ18o value through extensive water rock interaction in geothermal systems with high water to rock ratio the fresh rock surface available for isotopic exchange would be very small resulting low to negligible 18o shift nicholson 1993 there are multiple sources for dic in subsurface waters like atmospheric co2 oxidation of dissolved organic matter carbonate or silicate mineral weathering which can be identified through examining the δ13c dic clark and fritz 1997 das et al 2005 the average δ13c of the atmospheric co2 is 8 1 cerling et al 1991 c3 vegetation is characterized by more depleted δ13c composition 25 than for c4 plants 13 the magmatic co2 shows δ13c values from 7 5 to 5 5 vpdb exley et al 1986 the marine carbonates have enriched δ13c values 0 while the organic sources are characterized by depleted δ13c values 30 evans et al 2008 geogenic co2 present in deeply circulating geothermal systems typically has high pco2 and moderately enriched δ13c value 6 marty and jambon 1987 in the present study the δ13c values range from 21 to 16 2 for thermal waters and 20 to 14 7 for non thermal waters table 1 these ranges overlap with the δ13c dic derived from silicate weathering reactions das et al 2005 the contributions from marine carbonate mantle degassing and organic matter oxidation seems to be negligible or absent these aspects are further discussed in section 5 4 4 3 radioisotopes 3h and 14c tritium content in thermal waters provides estimation of residence time and shallow groundwater mixing proportions sammel and craig 1981 chatterjee et al 2018 samples with tritium 1 0 tu indicate recent recharge or mixing with modern water whereas low tritium 1 0 tu indicates recharge prior to 1951 clark and fritz 1997 tritium data of thermal waters during both seasons pre monsoon 0 4 0 9 tu and post monsoon 0 4 1 5 tu is typically 1 5 tu or less table s5 this suggests that modern recharge to thermal waters is negligible and the residence time of thermal water could be 50 years low tritium 1 tu thermal waters with high temperatures up to 97 c are also observed in other geothermal fields of india sarolkar 1996 chatterjee et al 2016 2017 the thermal water at taptapani site has relatively higher tritium 1 5 tu suggesting modern recharge 50 years or mixing with modern waters during ascent thermal waters with modern tritium are also reported from other geothermal systems in india navada et al 1995 chatterjee et al 2018 in the present study the tritium content of non thermal waters from all sites ranges from 0 9 to 3 4 tu indicating modern recharge table s5 the 14c values range from 10 to 56 pmc while non thermal waters show values from 50 to 99 pmc table 1 a close examination of the data suggests that 14c values of the thermal waters with highest temperature are 20 pmc or lower similar low 14c values have been reported from godavari valley geothermal systems chatterjee et al 2019 the radiocarbon dating of thermal waters is further discussed in section 5 4 5 discussion 5 1 subsurface temperature estimation 5 1 1 chemical geothermometry a wide scatter is observed in the estimated reservoir temperatures at different sites of the study area table 4 quartz geothermometer no steam loss estimated subsurface temperatures from 112 to 136 c and a similar range of temperatures 111 132 c is observed from adiabatic quartz geothermometer maximum steam loss indicating no appreciable steam separation from the thermal water system chalcedony geothermometer estimated temperatures 83 109 c lower than quartz geothermometer values the na k mg ternary diagram aids in inferring whether thermal water is immature or in partial equilibrium or attained full equilibrium with the rocks at a given temperature giggenbach 1988 the sample data falls near mg corner in the immature waters region suggesting that the estimates from na k geothermometers may be erroneous fig 5 a this is further witnessed in the wide range of subsurface temperatures 54 192 c estimated from the na k geothermometers the na k ca and magnesium corrected na k ca geothermometers estimate reservoir temperatures from 118 159 c and 101 109 c respectively table 4 the plot of 10 k 10 k na vs 10 mg 10 mg ca is presented in fig 5b the sample data falls above the line inferring that thermal waters are not completely equilibrated with alkali feldspars the subsurface temperature estimated from k mg geothermometer ranges from 65 to 92 c and is lower than the quartz geothermometer estimates this lowering of the estimated temperatures suggests contribution of near surface rock water interaction or non thermal water mixing from the above discussion temperature estimates of quartz geothermometry are found to be reliable and representative the average reservoir temperatures for atri tarabalo athmalik and taptapani sites are found to be 134 3 c 117 1 c 131 3 c and 112 1 c respectively table 4 5 1 2 mixing model positive correlations between the conservative elements and presence of environmental tritium in thermal water confirm the mixing between thermal and non thermal waters table s5 the non thermal mixing fraction to thermal water is estimated to be 0 12 to 0 63 table s5 the end member pairs for atri tarabalo and athmalik and taptapani sites are id 1 3 id 11 13 id 19 31 and id 40 42 respectively the average silica values pre and post monsoon data are used in the plot points a b c and d represent the enthalpy and the silica content of the parent geothermal water before mixing for taptapani tarabalo atri and athmalik sites respectively fig 6 the subsurface temperatures computed using this method 119 to 163 c are found to be slightly higher than the estimates obtained from chemical geothermometers table 4 5 1 3 integrated multicomponent solute geothermometry both the classical geothermometry and silica enthalpy mixing models though provided a similar range of reservoir temperatures the estimates for individual reservoirs are not consistent this is a common issue for the low to medium enthalpy geothermal systems owing to non attainment or partial attainment of equilibria this limitation is addressed by applying img method in this study quartz magnesite albit lo enstatite hercynite grossular sanidine pyrite osumilite are taken as ten main clustering minerals based on the geological information of the study area dasgupta 1993 mahala 2019 maitra et al 2020 geot is applied over the four thermal water samples samples id 1 11 19 and 40 and deep fluid temperature is computed from the ten best clustering minerals for id 1 atri thermal water the chemical composition of water suggests equilibrium with minerals such as quartz calcite magnesite grossular hercynite sanidine osumilite etc fig 7 a and estimated equilibrium temperature trmed is found to be 118 c fig 7b in case of id 11 tarabalo thermal water the clustering is observed with minerals such as quartz albit lo calcite magnesite dolo dis osumilite sanidine enstatite etc fig 7c and the estimated equilibrium temperature is trmed 112 c fig 7d in athmalik area id 19 quartz albit lo magnesite grossular osumilite sanidine etc are found to be the main clustering minerals fig 7e and the estimated reservoir temperature trmed turns out to be 124 c fig 7f in taptapani site id 40 quartz magnesite osumilite sanidine calcite dolomite etc are found to be the main clustering minerals fig 7g and the estimated reservoir temperature trmed is found to be 92 c fig 7h it is observed that the estimates of reservoirs temperature range from 92 to 124 c and fall on the lower side of the values obtained from silica enthalpy mixing model and chemical geothermometry table 4 but the spread in the estimates is much smaller than the previously reported values 92 to 277 c navada et al 1995 these estimates indicate a lower enthalpy thermal system in mahanadi graben compared to sonata mobile systems conforming to the heat flow values of indian shield kumar et al 2007 roy and mareschal 2011 5 2 geochemical processes along the flow groundwater accumulates salts leading to higher ec therefore the geochemical reactions are examined in tandem with ec values in piper s trilinear plot fig 3b and c in the case of thermal waters a clear distinction is noticed in the chemical facies athmalik thermal water shows na cl so4 facies while atri and tarabalo sites show na cl hco3 facies similar nature of subsurface geology at these sites could be the reason for the observed similarity in water facies thermal waters represented by na cl type with high salinity 5000 µs cm are common in the west coast geothermal systems in india due to mixing with marine waters chandrasekhar et al 2018 however in this study though the hydrochemical facies is na cl type the salinity range is lower ec 1000 µs cm in thermal waters a similar pattern of low ec and na cl facies of thermal waters is observed in the hazaribagh and dumka jharkhand and bakreswar and tantloi west bengal geothermal regions singh et al 2020 the second dominant anion after cl in the thermal waters of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites is hco3 and so4 2 respectively the hco3 concentration of thermal waters is similar in these three sites 54 99 mg l however the so4 2 concentration is lower 40 mg l in atri tarabalo sites but relatively higher 80 100 mg l in athmalik site tables s3 and s4 this clearly suggests that the thermal waters are circulating through different rock types in these sites at athmalik site the thermal waters issue along the northern fringe while at atri and tarabalo sites the thermal waters issue along the southern fringe of the mahanadi graben fig 2a northern part of the egmb is dominated by iron ore supergroup consisting of pyritic minerals mahala 2019 oxidation of pyrite releases high so4 2 and h which reduces the ph of the water high so4 2 concentration and reduced alkaline nature of thermal water at athmalik site ph 8 0 0 3 compared to other sites ph 8 7 0 2 further substantiate this observation in contrast thermal water at taptapani site is na ca hco3 type water similar type of thermal water was reported in taptapani and salbardi areas of sonata belt and rajapur area of west coast geothermal systems minissale et al 2000 relatively higher concentration of ca2 and hco3 in taptapani site can be attributed to weathering of mixed plagioclase minerals lower temperature 42 7 c lower ec 369 µs cm and neutral ph 7 38 compared to rest of the thermal waters as well as its location away from the mahanadi graben as shown in fig 1c d and 2a indicate that the geothermal reservoir is different for this site this observation is further supported by its distinct isotopic as well as geothermometry values discussed in subsequent sections thermal waters do not show any temporal variations in chemical composition whereas non thermal waters do fig 3a c the source rocks contributing to the dissolved species in thermal waters are evaluated by ionic ratios low hco3 sio2 ratio 5 and intermediate na k cl na k ca2 cl ratio 0 2 to 0 8 shown in table s7 infer silicate weathering hounslow 1995 the plots of na normalized molar ratios mg2 na vs ca2 na and hco3 na vs ca2 na also suggest the contribution of evaporite and silicate minerals towards dissolved ions in thermal waters fig 8 a and b none of the samples fall in the carbonate mineral zone indicating less no influence of carbonate minerals on the hydrochemistry of thermal and non thermal waters presence of high sio2 and high f further supports the contribution of minerals from granitic and hornblende gneissic rocks these observations conform to the nature of rocks present in egmb mahala 2019 maitra et al 2020 the sample data fall in the chloride region of the cl so4 hco3 ternary diagram in the case of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites indicating that the thermal waters are not steam heated local groundwater and are mature in nature fig 8c thermal water from the taptapani region falls in the bicarbonate region representing mixed water or immature waters the non thermal waters show low ec and the hydrochemical facies are either ca mg hco3 type cluster i or na hco3 type cluster iii evolving to na ca hco3 or ca na hco3 type cluster ii as shown fig 3c these facies variations agree with the increasing ec values from 200 to 650 µs cm some samples with higher ec 750 µs cm are characterised by na cl hco3 type similar to that of diluted thermal water suggesting mixing between thermal and non thermal waters it is observed that the less percent of ca2 the thermal water contains the higher temperature it has fig 3d the facies variations can result from various geochemical reactions such as weathering of minerals ion exchange or evaporite dissolution from fig 9 a and b it can be concluded that the silicate weathering exerts a major control on the chemistry of non thermal waters which is supported by presence of moderately high silica concentration 37 132 mg l the ion plot of na cl vs mg2 ca2 so4 2 hco3 evaluates the ion exchange process occurring in thermal and non thermal waters fig 8d the non thermal waters fall along the line with slope 1 indicating na in water is being replaced by ca2 from clay but thermal water data fall as a cluster in the plot indicating less significance of ion exchange process in order to estimate the extent of water mineral equilibrium saturation indices si were estimated using the formula eq 3 3 si log iap k sp where iap ion activity product ksp solubility product the si 0 0 and 0 indicates saturation supersaturation and unsaturation respectively wateq4f program was used to compute si of common minerals the ranges of saturation indices of thermal and non thermal waters with respect to common minerals are represented in table s8 saturated to supersaturated condition is exhibited for silicate minerals while carbonate minerals demonstrate unsaturated to saturated condition sulphate and fluoride minerals demonstrate unsaturation in both thermal and non thermal waters the degree of saturation seems to be higher for thermal waters than non thermal waters which agrees with the enrichment of major ions as well as trace elements however the si variations are similar for both thermal and non thermal waters which can be attributed to their interaction with common rock types this could also imply that the thermal water circulations are not deep enough to encounter different kind of rock types in egmb the characteristic ionic ratios of thermal waters are used to infer the nature of reservoir and the associated flow paths the na ca2 ratio wt ratio 1 0 40 is different for different thermal waters indicating different reservoirs or different flow paths wright et al 1991 while the near uniform ratios observed in the case of sio2 cl wt ratio 0 4 0 6 and na k cl f wt ratio 0 72 1 1 reflect significant interaction with country rocks table s7 these observations agree with the inferences obtained from si variations table s8 the ionic ratios are quite different in the case of taptapani thermal water suggesting completely a different source reservoir and or flow path for thermal water presence of high b and cl concentrations in thermal waters suggests deep circulation paths and extended interaction with the rocks arnorsson 2000 the cl b ratio is used to trace the groundwater flow paths and assess the mixing proportions of different water masses in geothermal systems aggarwal et al 2000 atri tarabalo and athmalik sites exhibit different cl b ratios 4750 2237 and 1810 respectively but the thermal waters located at a particular site showed similar cl b ratios table s7 these non uniform cl b ratios at different sites demonstrate that these conservative constituents are originated from different reservoirs fournier and truesdell 1970 the interrelationships among li rb and cs also help in evaluating the secondary processes due to the large differences in the respective concentrations of these elements a scaling factor is applied to spread the data evenly in the li rb cs ternary diagram it is observed that the thermal water data of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites fall away from the crustal rock s composition indicating the presence of different secondary processes fig 9a thermal waters in athmalik site show lowest li cs ratio wt ratio 9 7 15 4 whereas tarabalo thermal water shows highest li cs ratio wt ratio 30 indicating incorporation of cs in clay minerals at tarabalo site table s7 in the cl b li ternary diagram the sample data falls near the chloride corner which suggests that these thermal waters are part of a very old hydrothermal system fig 9b the relatively low b content in the thermal springs 0 13 mg l reflects the high degree of maturity in the geothermal system table s4 during the early heating up stages volatile components such as b are likely to be expelled from the system thus fluids from the older hydrothermal systems normally show lower b concentration 5 3 isotope systematics the stable isotopic composition of the thermal waters indicates different clusters as shown by shaded regions in fig 4a the isotope data of these thermal waters measured during 1995 by navada et al 1995 also fall in the respective groups indicating that the reservoir isotope characteristics have not changed during the last 25 years the seasonal variation in isotope data is very small indicating less influence of current hydrological cycle on the reservoir source the isotopic values of thermal waters are similar for atri and tarabalo sites with mean δ2h and δ18o values 24 01 2 2 and 4 1 0 3 respectively at athmalik site the mean values of δ2h and δ18o are 17 1 1 05 and 3 2 0 17 respectively isotope data of thermal waters from atri and tarabalo sites fall in a single cluster indicating possibility of a common reservoir however thermal waters of athmalik and taptapani have different and distinct stable isotopic signatures inferring the possibility of different source reservoirs fig 4a considering the similarity in basement rocks of egmb the discrepancy among the temperature values ionic ratios and isotopic compositions rules out the possibility of a common reservoir feeding these thermal waters in other words this confirms the presence of different reservoirs or and flow paths for thermal sprouts at these sites in order to verify if the means of the isotope data of these groups viz atri tarabalo n1 12 and athmalik n2 10 are statistically significant anova single factor test was conducted it is found that the fstat 60 6 fcritical 4 35 p 0 001 indicating the means belong to different population α 0 05 i e the thermal waters are fed by different reservoirs presence of multiple subsurface thermal reservoirs are reported by chatterjee et al 2017 in peninsular india viz the manuguru geothermal area telangana compared with the local rainwater δ2h 32 and δ18o 5 5 keesari et al 2016 the isotope values are enriched for athmalik tarabalo and atri thermal waters possibly indicating the recharge during arid climate discussed in section 5 4 depleted stable isotope values δ2h 36 8 0 8 and δ18o 6 3 0 2 and moderate temperature of the thermal water at taptapani site indicate a greater mixing of thermal water with non thermal water which can also be substantiated geochemically the chemical facies of the taptapani thermal water is found to be na ca hco3 type whereas the other thermal waters are na cl type the preponderance of bicarbonate type of thermal water in taptapani area indicates a greater extent of mixing with non thermal waters which is also corroborated from high tritium value of the taptapani thermal water 1 5 tu compared to other thermal waters 1 tu the approximate degree of mixing is estimated from tritium concentrations assuming the deep seated thermal water has zero tritium content sammel and craig 1981 the percentage of non thermal water contribution was found to be highest for taptapani site 63 followed by atri tarabalo 20 and athmalik site 10 these estimated mixing proportions justify the lower temperature and depleted isotopic composition of the thermal water at taptapani site and higher temperature and enriched isotopic composition of the thermal waters in other sites the ec correlations with δ2h and δ18o also indicate different groups for thermal waters collected from different sites fig s3 which rules out the possibility of a common reservoir as the source for the thermal waters in all the four studied sites this inference further strengthens the observations obtained from the hydrochemical classification fig 3a and b and isotope trends fig 4a the deuterium excess dx δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o provides a reliable measure of the physical conditions surface temperature humidity of the source region responsible for vapor transport to the site of precipitation dansgaard 1964 the dx of oceanic origin is normally 10 in temperate climate clark and fritz 1997 the mean dx values of thermal water during pre and post monsoon periods are found to be similar in this case i e 8 6 1 3 and 9 0 2 3 respectively while thermal water at taptapani site has slightly higher dx value 13 6 the dx values of the thermal waters suggest their oceanic origin with some modifications during the infiltration the modifications include contribution of recirculated moisture evaporative enrichment or mixing with different moisture sources the non thermal waters also fall along the gmwl and lwml indicating precipitation recharge to shallow aquifer system fig 4b a few samples mainly from tarabalo site fall below lmwl on a line with slope 3 49 indicating evaporation effect higher evaporation is observed in samples during pre monsoon compared to post monsoon fig 4b which could be due to evaporative enrichment this seasonal variation in isotope data of non thermal waters suggests contribution of local precipitation to the shallow aquifer system unlike thermal waters there is no site wise clustering in non thermal waters excepting for taptapani site fig 4b this observation suggests that the thermal and non thermal water circulations in egmb follow different flow paths furthermore the non thermal waters show a wider scatter in the ec correlations with δ2h and δ18o fig s3 and do not show a particular grouping like in the case of thermal waters this clearly suggests the influence of soil water interaction in the top weathered formation and contribution of precipitation to non thermal waters depleted isotope composition of non thermal waters of taptapani site mean δ18o 6 4 suggests their origin from rainfall occurring at higher elevation the dem of this area indicates that the altitude of taptapani site is 450 m amsl above mean sea level while other three sites have altitude in the range of 50 75 m amsl fig 2b therefore it can be concluded that shallow aquifer system of taptapani site is recharged by precipitation occurring at higher elevations 5 4 age dating of thermal waters very low environmental tritium content observed in thermal waters of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites clearly suggests that ages are very old 50 years while at taptapani the thermal water is modern water most of the non thermal waters have tritium content 1 5 tu indicating modern recharge a few non thermal waters show low tritium 1 tu which can be attributed to thermal water mixing radiocarbon dating was carried out to estimate the age of thermal waters the major challenge in estimating accurate radiocarbon age of waters is assigning the initial radiocarbon value for dic several models are in use which can account for the different isotope and geochemical processes modifying the initial signatures of 14c of dic clark and fritz 1997 blaser et al 2010 and references therein the source of co2 is important in geothermal waters since different processes provide different initial radiocarbon values for the dic the thermo metamorphic decarbonation of carbonates and upper mantle degassing contribute to co2 which has a 14c value of 0 pmc evans et al 2008 both these sources contribute to radiocarbon dilution and overestimation of thermal water ages however the large difference between the δ13c dic values of the studied thermal waters 20 to 16 vpdb and the expected values of decarbonation and degassing processes 2 to 2 and 8 to 3 respectively indicate that radiocarbon dilution is not significant this is further supported by presence of low co2 concentration 0 2 in gas emissions from these sites mahala 2019 the oxidation of organic material in the presence of dissolved sulphate within the aquifer also complicates 14c dating due to addition of 14c free carbonate to the dic reservoir aravena et al 1995 there is no data available on the h2s concentration of these thermal waters however dic derived in the sulphate reduction process normally has δ13c in the range of 5 to 10 hoefs 1997 which again different from the range of δ13c dic values observed in this case therefore the influence of sulphate reduction on the dating of thermal waters can be ignored the silicate mineral weathering reactions supply dic to waters through dissolution of soil and atmospheric co2 recharging waters dissolve root zone co2 to form carbonic acid log pco2 2 6 facilitating silicate mineral weathering in the case of closed condition the consumed co2 is not replenished by the soil gas and that results in lowering of log pco2 values as observed in this case 2 3 to 3 9 table s8 the log pco2 also plays a crucial role in controlling the saturation state of carbonate minerals charlet et al 1990 and indicate the microbial oxidation of organic matter benedetti et al 1996 the open closed condition of thermal water with respect to co2 is further examined from δ13c dic vs hco3 plot fig 10 a atmospheric co2 has a typical δ13c value 8 cerling et al 1991 therefore the corresponding δ13c dic would be 1 6 shown by line 1 in fig 10a the closed system dissolution of carbonate rocks without any fractionation is shown by line 2 δ13c 0 the non equilibrium dissolution of carbonates 1 1 mixture of soil co2 with δ13c 25 and carbonates with δ13c 0 is shown by line 3 the equilibration of dic with soil co2 δ13c 25 yields 17 5 value as shown by line 4 from the graph it can be observed that the sample data fall along the line 4 indicating equilibrium of dic with soil co2 both thermal and non thermal waters show a similar source of dic the radiocarbon content of the dic also modifies similar to δ13c dic under open system condition the dic exchanges continuously with the 14c active soil gas therefore the initial activity of dic 14cdic remains at 100 pmc but under closed equilibrium condition the 14c dic decays with time without being replenished an increasing trend in log pco2 is noticed in thermal waters from 3 9 to 2 3 which reaches to the value similar to non thermal water fig 1b indicating that the dic is derived dominantly from soil co2 and the decrease in log pco2 clearly suggests a closed co2 condition correlation between δ13c and 14c is found to be positive implying the contribution of carbon sources with dead radiocarbon and depleted δ13c fig 10c the dissolution of carbonates with time mineralized organic matter is further ascertained by the negative relationship between 14c and ph fig 10d radiocarbon correction using pearson model was not applied in this study as the model demands recharge conditions of the aquifer to obtain accurate ages fontes and garnier s f g model though does not require input parameters and removes the recharge conditions uncertainty it is applicable to only carbonate systems and therefore was not considered in closed system like that typically exhibited by deep groundwater the iaea model is apt clark and fritz 1997 as it takes in to account the temperature dependent isotope fractionation among carbonate species co2 hco3 co3 2 which is highly effective for thermal waters the relatively high ph mean 8 3 and lower log pco2 2 6 observed in thermal waters would not support an open co2 evolutionary pathway since the continuous supply of co2 would render acidic ph the general formula for corrected 14c groundwater age is given as equation 4 4 age 8267 ln a 14 c measured q a 14 c initial the correction factor q is calculated using the following equation 5 5 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carb δ 13 c soil ε gb δ 13 c carb where ε gb 9483 t 23 89 which considers isotope exchange among carbon species co2 gas hco3 aq co3 2 solid where δ13cdic measured 13c in groundwater δ13csoil δ13c of the soil co2 δ13ccarb δ13c of the calcite ɛgb additive fractionation factor between co2 gas and hco3 and t is the temperature in kelvin in order to account for the contribution of deep inorganic carbon sources and subsequent radiocarbon dilution we have used the equation 6 proposed by wang et al 2019 6 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c deadcarb δ 13 c rech δ 13 c deadcarb δ13crech represents the recharge area δ13cdead carb represents the deep source inorganic co2 the δ13c value of deep source inorganic co2 of gas reservoirs and geothermal water is usually around 1 5 wang et al 2019 which is selected as the value of δ13cdead carb to correct the 14c age of deep source dead carbon the apparent ages were also provided for comparison which is estimated by considering 98 6 pmc highest 14c measured in the study area as initial 14c value the corrected ages of thermal waters are shown in table 1 the results obtained from the 14c correction models slightly differ from the apparent age estimates uncorrected indicating the impact of temperature dependent fractionation on 14c value and impact of mixing with deep inorganic carbon source table 1 the conformity between the corrected and uncorrected radiocarbon age dating is largely due to the absence of dissolution of the dead carbon from the aquifer matrix which is exemplified from the δ13c dic 18 75 to 21 values of the thermal water the δ13c values of dic clearly reflect the silicate weathering with soil co2 derived from c3 type of plants that has an average value of about 19 1 das et al 2005 the phenomenon of silicate weathering is also substantiated from the subsurface geological formation of the study area however the three modeled age estimates are found to have similar range the agreement among different modelled values provided confidence to the reliability of the ages determined the residence time of thermal waters at atri t1 14 0 14 9 ka and tarabalo t1 13 3 14 2 ka is found to be similar while thermal waters at athmalik are relatively older t1 18 8 20 7 ka thermal and non thermal mixed sources show ages in the range of 2 8 7 6 ka non thermal water is shown by negative radiocarbon age indicating modern recharge the estimated ages of the thermal waters suggest that these waters are recharged during last glacial maximum lgm a relatively arid climatic regime this interpretation is supported by the enriched δ18o values of the thermal waters δ18o 3 2 and 4 1 for athmalik and atri tarabalo respectively compared to the present day meteoric waters average rainwater δ18o 5 5 keesari et al 2016 we interpret the enriched δ18o value of thermal waters to represent recharge during the decreased summer monsoon rainfall which is characterized by enriched mean annual δ18o of the rainfall high evaporative flux reflects a significant reduction in the soil moisture which facilitates greater fractionation and leads enriched δ18o composition in recharging waters as was observed in this case the inter tropical aridity in egmb delang puri sector odisha during 12 17 ka has been reported by kulkarni et al 1998 wherein the authors also noted that the isotopic composition of groundwater is enriched compared to modern precipitation hinting at the possible recharge during arid climate the global sea level data indicate that the sea level during the period 20 ka was 130 m below the current level lambeck et al 2014 this could have displaced the shoreline to further east from the current location a similar phenomenon was reported in bengal basin bangladesh where the shoreline during the lgm 20 ka was displaced 100 150 km to the south ravenscroft et al 2018 considering the age of the thermal waters and the sea level during that time the sea water component as the source of thermal water can be squarely ruled out the monsoonal circulation was greatly reduced during lgm and the resultant precipitation was also isotopically enriched δ18o 3 5 which matches well with the isotopic composition of thermal waters the deep groundwater from chittagong coastal aquifer bangladesh showed a radiocarbon age of 17 ka age and an enriched stable isotope composition ravenscroft et al 2018 the paleo recharge history of thermal waters is clearly displayed in the positive correlations among temperature δ18o and water age fig 11 the trends observed in this figure clearly suggest that the observed enrichment in thermal waters is due to their recharge during arid climate the deep groundwaters from middle ganga plains are found to be 3 5 to 4 7 ka old while in deltaic plains the typical ages range from 1 to 10 ka lapworth et al 2018 and 3 9 ka hoque and burgess 2012 a comparison of the deep groundwater ages from ganga basin with the thermal waters of egmb suggests longer circulation path of the thermal waters compared to the deep non thermal groundwater systems however the thermal waters from the adjacent godavari river basin show a similar age between 9 and 18 6 ka chatterjee et al 2019 which essentially infers that the evolution history of both the geothermal systems is same 5 5 thermal water genesis circulations and reservoir depth there are many speculations on the source of heat in shear zones of egmb since very little data is available field studies supplemented by satellite data also indicate that the thermal springs lie along lineaments fig 1c 2b which infer close relationship between tectonics and thermal activity there is no evidence of any recent magmatic activity around these thermal springs and hence the likely source of heat is the rocks of egmb the radioactive elements concentrations and the heat production 71 3 142 8 mw m2 in the egmb is reported to be highest amongst the granulite belts of india kumar et al 2007 very high levels of radioactive elements u 600 mg kg th 1500 mg kg and k 5 are reported in metamorphic rocks baranwal et al 2006 another study conducted on gas emissions of these thermal springs indicated a considerable amount of helium gas 0 27 to 1 7 by volume and the n2 ar he ternary diagram suggested a long residence time of the gas phase in the crust affected by u and th decay mahala 2019 from the correlations among the temperature and water age it is observed that temperature of thermal waters increases with residence time of water from this observation and tectonic and thermal information provided above it can be concluded that the thermal waters in egmb are produced due to the long contact and deep circulation of the rainwater inside the precambrian metamorphites high heat producing comprising elevated levels of radioactive elements the water flows in geothermal systems are complex due to the occurrence of complex subsurface stratigraphy and heterogeneity in geology temperature gradients and fractures or other conduits in the permeable zones the e w trending graben bounding faults provide permeable pathways for a thermal water circulation system along the northern sector of egmb based on the hydrochemical isotopic and residence time values as well as variation of temperatures in thermal waters two modes of thermal flow paths can be suggested in egmb the first mode is n s flow system that originates from iron ore super group iosg plateau and proceed to graben floor through fractures and fissures to ultimately issue on the surface along the contact zones of iosg plateau and northern edge of mahanadi graben the second mode is s n directional flow system that originates from eastern ghats super group egsg plateau and reach graben floor which subsequently appear as thermal sprouts along the contact zones of iosg plateau and southern edge of mahanadi graben the rainwater which upon penetrating downwards along the faults and fractures is heated by geothermal gradient and then rises to the surface through the permeable zones the non thermal water also circulates in the same way but do not flow through the permeable fault zones and hence restricted to shallow depths the circulation depth of thermal waters is estimated using the equation 7 7 z tz t o g z o where z is the circulation depth m to is the local annual average temperature 26 6 c from https en climate data org g is thermal gradient of the region 0 04 0 01 c m after padhi and pitale 1995 and zo is the thickness of the constant temperature zone taken as 0 m tz is the temperature c of the geothermal reservoir calculated by a reasonable geothermometer img in this case table 4 the estimated circulation depths for atri tarabalo athmalik and taptapani sites are 2 3 0 6 km 2 1 0 5 km 2 4 0 6 km and 1 6 0 4 km respectively table 4 reservoir depths of similar order 1 3 km have been reported in several geothermal systems of india chatterjee et al 2016 2017 singh et al 2020 a conceptual hydrogeological hydrochemical isotope model for thermal water genesis and circulations in mahandi graben egmb is presented in fig 12 from the above calculations it can be inferred that the geothermal reservoir in egmb lies in the depth range of 2 1 0 35 km 5 6 future scope limberger et al 2018 reported that the geothermal electrical production is mostly confined to the areas containing high geothermal gradients and sufficient reservoirs which are very limited hence development of technology focusing exploitation of low enthalpy geothermal systems would pave way for reduction in fossil burning and leading to cleaner environment till now about 4000 thermal springs have been identified in indian subcontinent and except few high temperature thermal springs i e puga and chumathang in indus valley ladakh panamik in nubra valley ladakh parbati and beas valley in himachal pradesh tapoban and badrinath in uttarakhand all other thermal springs fall in the medium to low enthalpy category singh et al 2016 indian shield has an estimated potential of 10 000 mw www indiaenergyportal org the majority of which are low to moderate enthalpy systems extensive investigations have been carried out with regard to geological geochemical and geophysical aspects of geothermal systems but the drilling investigations have been very limited though it was realized a long time ago that india has good potential to harness geothermal energy krishnaswamy and ravishanker 1982 the development of the geothermal resources has not progressed mainly due to inadequate understanding of the deeper thermal regime leading to uncertainty over the proposed reservoir models as well as the sustainability of heat source there are only a couple of geothermal energy based power plants constructed planned at a few places such as a 25 mw geothermal power project in the west coast hot spring belt sharma and trikha 2013 a 35 mwe geothermal power plant in gujarat chandrasekharam and chandrasekhar 2015 singh et al 2016 a 5 kw pilot power plant at manikaran razdan et al 2008 an approved 25 mwe geothermal power project in andhra pradesh chandrasekharam and chandrasekhar 2015 but with regard to power production the geothermal resources are entirely undeveloped in the country at present reservoir temperature its depth and volume are the primary factors considered while planning geothermal energy exploitation india fares well with regard to the information on the geothermal reservoir temperature and its depth but the information on genesis recharge history and movement of thermal fluids is very limited there are reports on the reduction of thermal water discharges and drying up of reservoirs after the commencement of thermal water exploitation chandrajith et al 2013 pingheng et al 2017 which clearly demonstrate the importance of understanding the genesis and estimating the flow patterns of the thermal fluids in any geothermal system therefore in order to expand the footprint of geothermal energy use in india it is very important to determine the genesis recharge history and thermal water circulations of geothermal systems in this regard isotope techniques are very valuable tools that can address uncertainty over the sustainability of geothermal reservoirs as demonstrated in this study 6 conclusions the genesis and circulation of thermal and non thermal waters in shear zones of mahanadi graben of eastern ghats mobile belt region are investigated using multi tracers including chemical and isotope tracers the thermal waters issue along the faults of mahanadi graben and are classified as low to medium enthalpy systems 55 59 c thermal waters close to graben are alkaline ph 8 75 9 13 less saline ec 1500 µs cm and na cl type while away from the graben thermal water has low temperature 42 c neutral ph and is na ca hco3 type the characteristic ionic ratios and major ion trends indicate that bulk of the chemical ions is derived from the silicate weathering in both the thermal and non thermal waters isotope characteristics of the thermal waters indicate meteoric source and presence of three different thermal reservoirs stable isotope and environmental tritium data indicate that the non thermal waters are recharged by modern precipitation influence of evaporative enrichment in non thermal waters is observed during pre monsoon period the thermal circulations seem to originate from northern side of the graben in the case of athmalik site and southern side in the case of atri tarabalo sites the estimated reservoir temperatures range between 92 and 124 c and the circulation depths are found to be 1 6 2 4 km the radiocarbon age of 13 3 to 20 7 ka for thermal waters suggests dominant recharge during lgm which is characterized by arid climate and low rainfall the stable isotope and hydrochemical inferences clearly establish the improbability of marine sources while the age and temperature correlations indicate thermal gradient as the source of heat the emergence of thermal waters is controlled through fracture systems and the hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions reflect minimum mixing with non thermal waters during their rise to surface however thermal water located away from graben indicates significant mixing with non thermal water and hence lower outlet temperature and depleted isotopic content credit authorship

3087,the development of the geothermal resources in india has not progressed mainly due to inadequate understanding of the deeper thermal regime and uncertainty over the sustainability of heat source in this study isotopes hydrochemical techniques and integrated geothermometric models have been applied to a low medium enthalpy geothermal system belonging to shear zones of mahanadi graben eastern ghats mobile belt eastern india to gain better insights isotope results indicate that thermal waters are meteoric in nature and absence of δ18o shift suggests that the subsurface temperatures are below 200 c distinct isotopic and hydrochemical signatures of thermal waters clearly suggest their origin from different geothermal reservoirs thermal waters at atri tarabalo sites are derived from the southern part of the graben while at athmalik from northern part away from graben in southern direction taptapani site the thermal waters are derived from rain occurring at elevated regions seasonal variations in chemical and isotope data are minimum in thermal waters the estimated reservoir temperatures range between 92 and 124 c with reservoir depths 1 6 2 4 km tritium data suggests that thermal waters are old and have 12 63 mixing with non thermal water the modelled radiocarbon age of thermal waters 13 3 20 7 ka suggests paleo recharge of the reservoirs during last glacial maximum lgm characterized by arid climate and low rainfall a conceptual isotope model illustrating the genesis and circulation patterns of thermal and non thermal waters is presented the study highlights the potential of isotope based studies in expanding the geothermal energy utilization in india keywords thermal waters mahanadi graben eastern ghats mobile belt geothermal energy environmental isotopes radiocarbon dating data availability the data is provided in the supplimenatary file available online 1 introduction the proterozoic eastern ghats mobile belt egmb bordering the archaean dharwar bastar and singhbhum cratonic blocks is an important precambrian geological entity of peninsular india known as a blueprint for models of reconstruction of columbia rodinia and gondwana dasgupta et al 2013 valdiya 2016 fig 1 a egmb is considered to be a collage of several juxtaposed terrains separated by major shear zones and is characterized by stretching lineation and internal homogeneity in terms of litho package and tectonic history chetty 2001 valdiya 2016 an ultra high temperature metamorphism at mid to lower crustal depths has been reported by many researchers and the thermal models of the present day egmb crust estimated a moho temperature of 550 c dasgupta 1993 bhowmik et al 1995 the concentrations of radioactive elements and the heat production are reported to be highest amongst the granulite belts of india kumar et al 2007 and therefore egmb is classified under zone ii based on the heat flow values fig 1b several surface manifestations mainly low to medium enthalpy thermal waters with temperatures ranging from 42 to 59 c feature in egmb gsi 1987 gsi 1991 thussu 2002 considering the heat flow values many researchers have suggested for exploration of thermal waters for electricity production using binary cycle power plants or through enhanced geothermal systems chandrasekharam and chandrasekhar 2010 studies were conducted on the thermal waters of india covering all the ten geothermal provinces which mainly reported the thermo tectonic aspects quality of thermal water reservoir temperatures and geochemical processes gsi 1987 gsi 1991 minissale et al 2000 thussu 2002 craig et al 2013 zimik et al 2017 environmental isotopes of water 2h 18o 3h and its dissolved species 13c 14c 15n and 34s etc were also applied in some cases to gain better insights into genesis mixing processes geochemical evolution and residence time distribution of thermal fluids sammel and craig 1981 navada and rao 1991 chatterjee et al 2016 2017 keesari et al 2019 as per the current database the thermal waters age ranges from 40 years in himalayan province to 18 6 ka in godavari valley chatterjee et al 2018 chatterjee et al 2019 and the estimated temperature ranges from 50 c himachal region nw himalaya to 250 c puga valley ladakh craig et al 2013 tiwari et al 2016 thermal waters of egmb did not attract much attention from researchers and authorities due to their low enthalpy and uncertainty over their sustainability studies on these thermal waters were mainly focused on the water quality and hydrochemical aspects thussu 2002 zimik et al 2017 and references therein but a few studies were also conducted to understand the source and recharge of the thermal waters using isotope techniques navada et al 1995 the chemical geothermometry estimated a wide range of reservoir temperatures from 92 to 277 c navada et al 1995 mahala 2019 while radiocarbon ages were found to vary from 5 18 ka keesari et al 2019 a few studies attempted isotope characterization of the non thermal waters in this region farooq 2018 but a detailed geochemical analysis of the thermal groundwaters and their intermixing with the non thermal waters is still missing poor understanding of the origin and subsurface temperature of thermal water its recharge history and sustainability act as major impediment to the development of strategies for economic exploitation of these thermal waters we constrained the resident time and temperature of the thermal waters age and heat content of subsurface thermal reservoirs there by trying to understand the upwelling of the juvenile geothermal waters that is a novel observation in cratonic crystalline aquifer with non specific magmatic sources the use of radioisotopes chemical geothermometers mixing models and integrated multi component geothermometry provided unconventional tools to understand the hydro geo dynamic processes of thermal waters that can help to establish the future enhanced geothermal systems egs of this region by using a combination of stable and radioisotope tracers hydrochemistry geochemical modeling and geothermometry we developed a conceptual model for the geothermal reservoir and the associated fluid circulations and pathways in the mahanadi graben egmb the objectives of this study are to i estimate the subsurface reservoir temperature ii understand the hydrochemical evolution of thermal and non thermal waters and their interactions iii estimate mean transit times of thermal water as well as trace the flow paths and iv develop a model for the thermal and non thermal water circulations in egmb indian shield 2 regional and structural components the egmb falls in a tectonically stable non orogenic field of indian shield this was formed along the eastern coast of peninsular india due to neoproterozoic collisions between the indian cratons and east antarctica dasgupta et al 2013 valdiya 2016 these collisional events and the subsequent successive deformations created a number of faults and shear zones paving way for complex groundwater circulation patterns and geothermal activity ramakrishnan 1987 valdiya 2016 the mahanadi and godavari rift systems divide the egmb into three segments viz northern central and southern fig 1d the egb is broadly divided into the three groups viz khondalite group charnockite group and migmatite group moving from east to west the sequence of these groups is eastern khondalites central migmatites western khondalites charnockites and westernmost transition zone ramakrishnan 1987 the geological succession of the study area is shown in table s1 petrological studies infer that the egb group of rocks comprises garnet sillomanite schist and gneisses khondalite rocks hypersthene bearing granulite and gneisses charnockite rocks biotite bearing granite gneisses pink granites and porphyritic granite the egb group of rocks is directly overlain by the rocks of the gondwana supergroup which in turn are overlain by alluvium the khondalite rocks display well developed foliation trending nw se to nnw sse and dipping at high angles 45 75 towards ne and north respectively many faults and joints exist in khondalite and granitic group of rocks among which the lineaments trending ne sw i e taptapani to tarabalo and nw se i e athmalik to atri play a critical role in thermal water circulation in egmb fig 1c the generalized litho units and digital elevation model of the study area are shown in fig 2 a and b the atri site falls in a lateritic terrain within the egb group of rocks and has charnockite and granite rock exposures in the northwestern and khondalite and charnockite in the southern southeastern and southwestern parts gondwana supergroup rocks are exposed in the northeastern part in general the foliation shows moderately higher dips i e 50 70 towards north four sets of joints are observed trending n s e w nw se and ne sw and the thermal sprout is present at the intersection of ne sw and nw se trending joints fig 2c tarabalo site is located within alluvium of the granitic terrain surrounded by isolated hill masses of charnockite and khondalite in the northeastern and southeastern parts respectively while the exposures of charnockite and granite are present in the southern western and northwestern parts respectively the foliation within the granite and charnockite trends e w dipping 40 60 towards north while the foliation in the khondalite trends nw se to ene wsw dipping 50 65 towards ne to nw the foliations within the granite are not prominent suggesting latter emplacement the joints are found to be e w and n s trending in the southern and wnw ese and ne sw trending in the western and northwestern parts respectively the multiple thermal sprouts are found at the intersection of nw se and ne sw lineaments fig 2d the athmalik site is located on nne ssw trending fracture and is very close to the intersection of ne sw and nw se trending major fracture fig 2e two sets of foliations are observed dipping nw and ne with high dip the thermal sprout at taptapani site fall in the contact zone of khondalite and charnockite rocks fig 2f two sets of deep to shallow vertical fractures trending ne sw and nw se are noticed massive grey granite and micaceous rock exposures with foliation having 57 dip towards se direction are also observed in this site the study area has tropical climate characterized by high temperature high humidity and medium to high rainfall the annual rainfall varies from 1008 to 1988 mm with an average of 1481 mm the water levels range from 2 to 10 m below ground level during pre monsoon april 2016 and 2 to 5 m during post monsoon november 2016 the depths of the sampled wells range from 80

ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime 100 located at bhabha atomic research centre mumbai india was used for isotope 2h and 18o measurements one milli liter of water sample was equilibrated with h2 and co2 gases respectively for δ2h and δ18o measurements the operating conditions like temperature catalyst and equilibrium time for δ2h and δ18o analysis are adopted from keesari et al 2016 after equilibration the gas was introduced into the mass analyser for isotope ratio measurements for δ13c measurement dissolved inorganic carbon dic was precipitated in the form of baco3 in one liter bottle by adding naoh to increase the ph above 10 and carbonate free saturated bacl2 solution this precipitate was dried and transferred into a vial on site δ13c analysis was performed on the co2 gas generated by combusting baco3 precipitate in an elemental analyser ea coupled with the mass spectrometer irms isoprime 100 the results are reported in δ notation and expressed in units of parts per thousand denoted as the δ values are calculated using the eq 2 coplen 1996 2 δ r x r s 1 1000 where r denotes the ratio of heavy to light isotope e g 2h 1h or 18o 16o or 13c 12c and rx and rs are the

precision of measurement is 0 30 2σ laboratory caco3 salt calibrated against the vpdb standard was used for daily calibration the measurement precision is estimated by repeated analysis of laboratory standards while the accuracy is estimated from the deviation of isotopic ratio of standard from the assigned value 3 4 radioisotope measurements for tritium 3h measurement 250 ml of water sample was distilled and electrolyzed in a cool bath 1 4 c for tritium enrichment the enriched sample was mixed with scintillator mixture 8 12 ml and counted for beta activity using an ultra low background

study and the data is given in table s5 for quality assurance spiked samples and distilled water samples are added in each batch of samples so that consistency of measurements is monitored the measurements are periodically crosschecked through iaea inter comparison exercise for radiocarbon 14c measurement the dic was precipitated from 60 l of water and the procedure for baco3 precipitation is same as given for 13c isotope in the laboratory phosphoric acid was added to the baco3 precipitate to evolve co2 in a vacuum line which was then passed through the cold trap mixture of acetone and liquid nitrogen of temperature 70 c to remove the water moisture from the gas the cylinders filled with co2 gas were stored for 15 30 days to allow radon decay finally the co2 was absorbed in the

4990c oxalic acid and the 14c data is reported as pmc percent modern carbon nine samples were collected for radiocarbon measurements table 1 3 5 estimation of reservoir temperature since 1960s chemical geothermometers have been widely used worldwide to predict the subsurface temperature of the geothermal reservoir commonly employed chemical geothermometers also known as classical geothermometers include silica fournier 1977 na k fournier 1979 arnorsson 1983 giggenbach et al 1988 na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 and k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 the implicit assumption in applying chemical geothermometer is that there exists a chemical equilibrium between the interacting thermal water and aquifer mineral for example if the quartz geothermometer is used to estimate the reservoir temperature it is assumed that thermal water has attained equilibrium with quartz mineral present in the host rock similarly na k geothermometer fournier 1979 arnorsson 1983 is based on the equilibrium between albite and k feldspar minerals the equations used for estimating reservoir temperature using chemical geothermometric methods are provided in table s6 in silica enthalpy mixing model enthalpy derived from steam tables is used as an axis rather than temperature this is because the combined heat content enthalpy of the two waters is conserved on mixing whereas the combined temperature is not fournier and truesdell 1970 in this mixing model the silica concentrations of the examined samples were plotted against their corresponding onsite enthalpies the enthalpy values were determined using the steam tables of keenan et al 1969 for the application of this model two end member fluids were considered viz thermal highest temperature water and non thermal nearby cold water the subsurface enthalpy of the geothermal reservoir can be estimated by extrapolating a line joining the data points of local groundwater with that of hot springs which intersects the quartz solubility curve the intersection point represents the silica content of the parent geothermal water before mixing next a vertical line is drawn from the intersection point of the quartz solubility curve to the enthalpy axis and the intersection point in the enthalpy axis denotes the enthalpy of the parent geothermal water before mixing in integrated multicomponent solute geothermometry img method the representative reservoir temperature is estimated based on the saturation state analysis of suitable mineral assemblages spycher et al 2014 the saturation indices si of potential reservoir minerals over a range of temperatures are calculated and plotted as a function of temperature reservoir temperature is estimated from the clustering of log q k curves near to the zero a stand alone computer program geot is used to solve the mass balance mass action equations using newton raphson iterative method refer spycher et al 2014 for details the thermodynamic database soltherm h06 is used to compute the ion activity product q the thermodynamic equilibrium constant k and si values geot also computes different statistical parameters i e median rmed standard deviation sdev mean mean and root mean square error rmse of si values as well as the temperatures at which these statistical parameters attain minimum value trmed tmean tsdev and trmse for a perfectly clustered system trmed tmean tsdev and trmse should be identical and this temperature reflects the computed reservoir temperature the main limitations of this approach are need for exhaustive mineralogical data dependency on steam loss and non thermal mixing and sensitivity towards the choice of the thermodynamic database pang and reed 1998 4 results the thermal discharge is highest at atri site 233 lpm followed by taptapani 82 lpm and athmalik sites 36 lpm the thermal manifestations at tarabalo site are at multiple points and are under marshy condition hence the discharge could not be quantified accurately the previous reports estimated thermal discharges in the range of 33 420 lpm and found overall discharge rates constant throughout the year thussu 2002 mahala 2019 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the temperature of the thermal water ranges from 38 8 to 58 4 c in pre monsoon and 35 8 to 58 9 c in post monsoon seasons the non thermal waters show temperature variations from 29 0 to 34 2 c in pre monsoon and 26 6 to 38 5 c in post monsoon fig s1 irrespective of location the thermal waters are colorless and have gas bubbling with sulfur odor while the non thermal waters are colorless and odorless navada et al 1995 reported similar thermal water temperatures during 1995 suggesting that the temperature of thermal water did not change for the past 25 years during pre monsoon the non thermal waters show a wider variation in electrical conductivity 198 1592 µs cm than thermal waters 788 1312 µs cm a similar trend is observed in the case of post monsoon samples the summary of the hydrochemical data is provided in table 2 and 3 dominance of ions in thermal waters during post monsoon period is in the order of na 150 220 mg l ca2 4 18 mg l mg2 0 5 11 mg l anions follow the order cl 140 245 mg l hco3 54 99 mg l so4 2 36 101 mg l only thermal water at taptapani site show a conspicuous reduction in cl 10 mg l and so4 2 5 mg l concentrations compared to other thermal waters the non thermal waters show the cation order similar to thermal waters na 18 180 mg l ca2 6 70 mg l mg2 1 35 mg l but the anions show a different order compared to the thermal waters hco3 102 446 mg l cl 8 138 mg l so4 2 0 24 mg l the major ion trends in thermal and non thermal waters are shown in schoeller diagrams fig s2a and b no significant difference in the major ion concentration ranges is observed among non thermal waters of different sites the piper s classification shows that the thermal and non thermal waters have different facies suggesting different sources or processes governing geochemistry fig 3 a the hydrochemical facies of the samples indicate that thermal waters barring taptapani site show dominance of na and cl ions cluster i in both seasons however four clusters are observed for non thermal waters cluster ii dominated by ca2 and hco3 indicates recharging nature of water while cluster iii dominated by na and hco3 indicates influence of water rock interaction mainly silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions as discussed in section 5 2 a few non thermal samples also fall in cluster i indicating the possibility of mixing with thermal sources which is supported by warmer temperatures in those samples 34 9 38 5 c samples falling in cluster iv with relatively higher ec values 750 µs cm suggest dissolution of salts from the formation the enrichment of cl average 169 mg l and na average 170 mg l in thermal waters over non thermal waters average cl 29 26 mg l average na 65 6 mg l may be attributed to greater leaching of minerals present in rocks due to elevated temperatures tables s3 and s4 the common sources for na and cl could be minerals like biotite hornblende and feldspar present in the study area mahala 2019 maitra et al 2020 among trace elements fluoride 2 25 13 2 mg l concentration is found to be higher while boron 53 2 128 µg l lithium 40 3 232 µg l and rubidium 41 3434 µg l are lower in concentrations like major ions the trace elements concentrations are also higher in thermal waters compared to non thermal waters table s4 which underlines the influence of greater water rock reactions favoured by high temperature 4 2 stable isotopes 2h 18o and 13c the δ18o and δ2h values of the thermal waters vary from 6 30 to 2 80 and 36 8 to 14 02 respectively during post monsoon and 4 42 to 2 96 and 26 05 to 15 34 respectively during pre monsoon table s5 the thermal water from taptapani site shows most depleted isotopic signature δ18o 6 3 as compared to other sites table s5 like thermal water the non thermal waters also show relatively depleted isotope values at taptapani site average δ18o and δ2h 6 4 and 40 9 in general a wide scatter in isotope data is observed in non thermal waters δ18o 5 28 to 0 98 δ2h 31 94 to 3 58 in pre monsoon and δ18o 6 82 to 0 87 δ2h 45 4 to 0 97 during post monsoon season the isotope plots of the thermal and non thermal waters are shown in fig 4 a b the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 and local meteoric water line lmwl of the study area δ2h 7 92 δ18o 5 74 after kumar et al 2010 are also shown in the plots the possibility of presence of any magmatic component is ruled out considering the wide contrast between the thermal water isotope values and magmatic sources isotope signatures which are enriched in δ18o 6 to 9 and depleted in δ2h 40 to 80 giggenbach 1992 low ec 369 1130 µs cm low cl contents 10 245 mg l and absence of enriched stable isotope δ18o δ2h values preclude the possibility of marine contribution to the studied thermal waters the geothermal waters fall along the gmwl and lmwl clearly demonstrating their meteoric origin fig 4a and the slope close to 8 indicates the recharge without significant evaporation clark and fritz 1997 kumar et al 2010 no δ18o shift in the δ2h vs δ18o plot is observed in thermal waters fig 4a which further indicates that the reservoir temperature is not sufficient enough i e 150 c to shift δ18o value through extensive water rock interaction in geothermal systems with high water to rock ratio the fresh rock surface available for isotopic exchange would be very small resulting low to negligible 18o shift nicholson 1993 there are multiple sources for dic in subsurface waters like atmospheric co2 oxidation of dissolved organic matter carbonate or silicate mineral weathering which can be identified through examining the δ13c dic clark and fritz 1997 das et al 2005 the average δ13c of the atmospheric co2 is 8 1 cerling et al 1991 c3 vegetation is characterized by more depleted δ13c composition 25 than for c4 plants 13 the magmatic co2 shows δ13c values from 7 5 to 5 5 vpdb exley et al 1986 the marine carbonates have enriched δ13c values 0 while the organic sources are characterized by depleted δ13c values 30 evans et al 2008 geogenic co2 present in deeply circulating geothermal systems typically has high pco2 and moderately enriched δ13c value 6 marty and jambon 1987 in the present study the δ13c values range from 21 to 16 2 for thermal waters and 20 to 14 7 for non thermal waters table 1 these ranges overlap with the δ13c dic derived from silicate weathering reactions das et al 2005 the contributions from marine carbonate mantle degassing and organic matter oxidation seems to be negligible or absent these aspects are further discussed in section 5 4 4 3 radioisotopes 3h and 14c tritium content in thermal waters provides estimation of residence time and shallow groundwater mixing proportions sammel and craig 1981 chatterjee et al 2018 samples with tritium 1 0 tu indicate recent recharge or mixing with modern water whereas low tritium 1 0 tu indicates recharge prior to 1951 clark and fritz 1997 tritium data of thermal waters during both seasons pre monsoon 0 4 0 9 tu and post monsoon 0 4 1 5 tu is typically 1 5 tu or less table s5 this suggests that modern recharge to thermal waters is negligible and the residence time of thermal water could be 50 years low tritium 1 tu thermal waters with high temperatures up to 97 c are also observed in other geothermal fields of india sarolkar 1996 chatterjee et al 2016 2017 the thermal water at taptapani site has relatively higher tritium 1 5 tu suggesting modern recharge 50 years or mixing with modern waters during ascent thermal waters with modern tritium are also reported from other geothermal systems in india navada et al 1995 chatterjee et al 2018 in the present study the tritium content of non thermal waters from all sites ranges from 0 9 to 3 4 tu indicating modern recharge table s5 the 14c values range from 10 to 56 pmc while non thermal waters show values from 50 to 99 pmc table 1 a close examination of the data suggests that 14c values of the thermal waters with highest temperature are 20 pmc or lower similar low 14c values have been reported from godavari valley geothermal systems chatterjee et al 2019 the radiocarbon dating of thermal waters is further discussed in section 5 4 5 discussion 5 1 subsurface temperature estimation 5 1 1 chemical geothermometry a wide scatter is observed in the estimated reservoir temperatures at different sites of the study area table 4 quartz geothermometer no steam loss estimated subsurface temperatures from 112 to 136 c and a similar range of temperatures 111 132 c is observed from adiabatic quartz geothermometer maximum steam loss indicating no appreciable steam separation from the thermal water system chalcedony geothermometer estimated temperatures 83 109 c lower than quartz geothermometer values the na k mg ternary diagram aids in inferring whether thermal water is immature or in partial equilibrium or attained full equilibrium with the rocks at a given temperature giggenbach 1988 the sample data falls near mg corner in the immature waters region suggesting that the estimates from na k geothermometers may be erroneous fig 5 a this is further witnessed in the wide range of subsurface temperatures 54 192 c estimated from the na k geothermometers the na k ca and magnesium corrected na k ca geothermometers estimate reservoir temperatures from 118 159 c and 101 109 c respectively table 4 the plot of 10 k 10 k na vs 10 mg 10 mg ca is presented in fig 5b the sample data falls above the line inferring that thermal waters are not completely equilibrated with alkali feldspars the subsurface temperature estimated from k mg geothermometer ranges from 65 to 92 c and is lower than the quartz geothermometer estimates this lowering of the estimated temperatures suggests contribution of near surface rock water interaction or non thermal water mixing from the above discussion temperature estimates of quartz geothermometry are found to be reliable and representative the average reservoir temperatures for atri tarabalo athmalik and taptapani sites are found to be 134 3 c 117 1 c 131 3 c and 112 1 c respectively table 4 5 1 2 mixing model positive correlations between the conservative elements and presence of environmental tritium in thermal water confirm the mixing between thermal and non thermal waters table s5 the non thermal mixing fraction to thermal water is estimated to be 0 12 to 0 63 table s5 the end member pairs for atri tarabalo and athmalik and taptapani sites are id 1 3 id 11 13 id 19 31 and id 40 42 respectively the average silica values pre and post monsoon data are used in the plot points a b c and d represent the enthalpy and the silica content of the parent geothermal water before mixing for taptapani tarabalo atri and athmalik sites respectively fig 6 the subsurface temperatures computed using this method 119 to 163 c are found to be slightly higher than the estimates obtained from chemical geothermometers table 4 5 1 3 integrated multicomponent solute geothermometry both the classical geothermometry and silica enthalpy mixing models though provided a similar range of reservoir temperatures the estimates for individual reservoirs are not consistent this is a common issue for the low to medium enthalpy geothermal systems owing to non attainment or partial attainment of equilibria this limitation is addressed by applying img method in this study quartz magnesite albit lo enstatite hercynite grossular sanidine pyrite osumilite are taken as ten main clustering minerals based on the geological information of the study area dasgupta 1993 mahala 2019 maitra et al 2020 geot is applied over the four thermal water samples samples id 1 11 19 and 40 and deep fluid temperature is computed from the ten best clustering minerals for id 1 atri thermal water the chemical composition of water suggests equilibrium with minerals such as quartz calcite magnesite grossular hercynite sanidine osumilite etc fig 7 a and estimated equilibrium temperature trmed is found to be 118 c fig 7b in case of id 11 tarabalo thermal water the clustering is observed with minerals such as quartz albit lo calcite magnesite dolo dis osumilite sanidine enstatite etc fig 7c and the estimated equilibrium temperature is trmed 112 c fig 7d in athmalik area id 19 quartz albit lo magnesite grossular osumilite sanidine etc are found to be the main clustering minerals fig 7e and the estimated reservoir temperature trmed turns out to be 124 c fig 7f in taptapani site id 40 quartz magnesite osumilite sanidine calcite dolomite etc are found to be the main clustering minerals fig 7g and the estimated reservoir temperature trmed is found to be 92 c fig 7h it is observed that the estimates of reservoirs temperature range from 92 to 124 c and fall on the lower side of the values obtained from silica enthalpy mixing model and chemical geothermometry table 4 but the spread in the estimates is much smaller than the previously reported values 92 to 277 c navada et al 1995 these estimates indicate a lower enthalpy thermal system in mahanadi graben compared to sonata mobile systems conforming to the heat flow values of indian shield kumar et al 2007 roy and mareschal 2011 5 2 geochemical processes along the flow groundwater accumulates salts leading to higher ec therefore the geochemical reactions are examined in tandem with ec values in piper s trilinear plot fig 3b and c in the case of thermal waters a clear distinction is noticed in the chemical facies athmalik thermal water shows na cl so4 facies while atri and tarabalo sites show na cl hco3 facies similar nature of subsurface geology at these sites could be the reason for the observed similarity in water facies thermal waters represented by na cl type with high salinity 5000 µs cm are common in the west coast geothermal systems in india due to mixing with marine waters chandrasekhar et al 2018 however in this study though the hydrochemical facies is na cl type the salinity range is lower ec 1000 µs cm in thermal waters a similar pattern of low ec and na cl facies of thermal waters is observed in the hazaribagh and dumka jharkhand and bakreswar and tantloi west bengal geothermal regions singh et al 2020 the second dominant anion after cl in the thermal waters of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites is hco3 and so4 2 respectively the hco3 concentration of thermal waters is similar in these three sites 54 99 mg l however the so4 2 concentration is lower 40 mg l in atri tarabalo sites but relatively higher 80 100 mg l in athmalik site tables s3 and s4 this clearly suggests that the thermal waters are circulating through different rock types in these sites at athmalik site the thermal waters issue along the northern fringe while at atri and tarabalo sites the thermal waters issue along the southern fringe of the mahanadi graben fig 2a northern part of the egmb is dominated by iron ore supergroup consisting of pyritic minerals mahala 2019 oxidation of pyrite releases high so4 2 and h which reduces the ph of the water high so4 2 concentration and reduced alkaline nature of thermal water at athmalik site ph 8 0 0 3 compared to other sites ph 8 7 0 2 further substantiate this observation in contrast thermal water at taptapani site is na ca hco3 type water similar type of thermal water was reported in taptapani and salbardi areas of sonata belt and rajapur area of west coast geothermal systems minissale et al 2000 relatively higher concentration of ca2 and hco3 in taptapani site can be attributed to weathering of mixed plagioclase minerals lower temperature 42 7 c lower ec 369 µs cm and neutral ph 7 38 compared to rest of the thermal waters as well as its location away from the mahanadi graben as shown in fig 1c d and 2a indicate that the geothermal reservoir is different for this site this observation is further supported by its distinct isotopic as well as geothermometry values discussed in subsequent sections thermal waters do not show any temporal variations in chemical composition whereas non thermal waters do fig 3a c the source rocks contributing to the dissolved species in thermal waters are evaluated by ionic ratios low hco3 sio2 ratio 5 and intermediate na k cl na k ca2 cl ratio 0 2 to 0 8 shown in table s7 infer silicate weathering hounslow 1995 the plots of na normalized molar ratios mg2 na vs ca2 na and hco3 na vs ca2 na also suggest the contribution of evaporite and silicate minerals towards dissolved ions in thermal waters fig 8 a and b none of the samples fall in the carbonate mineral zone indicating less no influence of carbonate minerals on the hydrochemistry of thermal and non thermal waters presence of high sio2 and high f further supports the contribution of minerals from granitic and hornblende gneissic rocks these observations conform to the nature of rocks present in egmb mahala 2019 maitra et al 2020 the sample data fall in the chloride region of the cl so4 hco3 ternary diagram in the case of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites indicating that the thermal waters are not steam heated local groundwater and are mature in nature fig 8c thermal water from the taptapani region falls in the bicarbonate region representing mixed water or immature waters the non thermal waters show low ec and the hydrochemical facies are either ca mg hco3 type cluster i or na hco3 type cluster iii evolving to na ca hco3 or ca na hco3 type cluster ii as shown fig 3c these facies variations agree with the increasing ec values from 200 to 650 µs cm some samples with higher ec 750 µs cm are characterised by na cl hco3 type similar to that of diluted thermal water suggesting mixing between thermal and non thermal waters it is observed that the less percent of ca2 the thermal water contains the higher temperature it has fig 3d the facies variations can result from various geochemical reactions such as weathering of minerals ion exchange or evaporite dissolution from fig 9 a and b it can be concluded that the silicate weathering exerts a major control on the chemistry of non thermal waters which is supported by presence of moderately high silica concentration 37 132 mg l the ion plot of na cl vs mg2 ca2 so4 2 hco3 evaluates the ion exchange process occurring in thermal and non thermal waters fig 8d the non thermal waters fall along the line with slope 1 indicating na in water is being replaced by ca2 from clay but thermal water data fall as a cluster in the plot indicating less significance of ion exchange process in order to estimate the extent of water mineral equilibrium saturation indices si were estimated using the formula eq 3 3 si log iap k sp where iap ion activity product ksp solubility product the si 0 0 and 0 indicates saturation supersaturation and unsaturation respectively wateq4f program was used to compute si of common minerals the ranges of saturation indices of thermal and non thermal waters with respect to common minerals are represented in table s8 saturated to supersaturated condition is exhibited for silicate minerals while carbonate minerals demonstrate unsaturated to saturated condition sulphate and fluoride minerals demonstrate unsaturation in both thermal and non thermal waters the degree of saturation seems to be higher for thermal waters than non thermal waters which agrees with the enrichment of major ions as well as trace elements however the si variations are similar for both thermal and non thermal waters which can be attributed to their interaction with common rock types this could also imply that the thermal water circulations are not deep enough to encounter different kind of rock types in egmb the characteristic ionic ratios of thermal waters are used to infer the nature of reservoir and the associated flow paths the na ca2 ratio wt ratio 1 0 40 is different for different thermal waters indicating different reservoirs or different flow paths wright et al 1991 while the near uniform ratios observed in the case of sio2 cl wt ratio 0 4 0 6 and na k cl f wt ratio 0 72 1 1 reflect significant interaction with country rocks table s7 these observations agree with the inferences obtained from si variations table s8 the ionic ratios are quite different in the case of taptapani thermal water suggesting completely a different source reservoir and or flow path for thermal water presence of high b and cl concentrations in thermal waters suggests deep circulation paths and extended interaction with the rocks arnorsson 2000 the cl b ratio is used to trace the groundwater flow paths and assess the mixing proportions of different water masses in geothermal systems aggarwal et al 2000 atri tarabalo and athmalik sites exhibit different cl b ratios 4750 2237 and 1810 respectively but the thermal waters located at a particular site showed similar cl b ratios table s7 these non uniform cl b ratios at different sites demonstrate that these conservative constituents are originated from different reservoirs fournier and truesdell 1970 the interrelationships among li rb and cs also help in evaluating the secondary processes due to the large differences in the respective concentrations of these elements a scaling factor is applied to spread the data evenly in the li rb cs ternary diagram it is observed that the thermal water data of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites fall away from the crustal rock s composition indicating the presence of different secondary processes fig 9a thermal waters in athmalik site show lowest li cs ratio wt ratio 9 7 15 4 whereas tarabalo thermal water shows highest li cs ratio wt ratio 30 indicating incorporation of cs in clay minerals at tarabalo site table s7 in the cl b li ternary diagram the sample data falls near the chloride corner which suggests that these thermal waters are part of a very old hydrothermal system fig 9b the relatively low b content in the thermal springs 0 13 mg l reflects the high degree of maturity in the geothermal system table s4 during the early heating up stages volatile components such as b are likely to be expelled from the system thus fluids from the older hydrothermal systems normally show lower b concentration 5 3 isotope systematics the stable isotopic composition of the thermal waters indicates different clusters as shown by shaded regions in fig 4a the isotope data of these thermal waters measured during 1995 by navada et al 1995 also fall in the respective groups indicating that the reservoir isotope characteristics have not changed during the last 25 years the seasonal variation in isotope data is very small indicating less influence of current hydrological cycle on the reservoir source the isotopic values of thermal waters are similar for atri and tarabalo sites with mean δ2h and δ18o values 24 01 2 2 and 4 1 0 3 respectively at athmalik site the mean values of δ2h and δ18o are 17 1 1 05 and 3 2 0 17 respectively isotope data of thermal waters from atri and tarabalo sites fall in a single cluster indicating possibility of a common reservoir however thermal waters of athmalik and taptapani have different and distinct stable isotopic signatures inferring the possibility of different source reservoirs fig 4a considering the similarity in basement rocks of egmb the discrepancy among the temperature values ionic ratios and isotopic compositions rules out the possibility of a common reservoir feeding these thermal waters in other words this confirms the presence of different reservoirs or and flow paths for thermal sprouts at these sites in order to verify if the means of the isotope data of these groups viz atri tarabalo n1 12 and athmalik n2 10 are statistically significant anova single factor test was conducted it is found that the fstat 60 6 fcritical 4 35 p 0 001 indicating the means belong to different population α 0 05 i e the thermal waters are fed by different reservoirs presence of multiple subsurface thermal reservoirs are reported by chatterjee et al 2017 in peninsular india viz the manuguru geothermal area telangana compared with the local rainwater δ2h 32 and δ18o 5 5 keesari et al 2016 the isotope values are enriched for athmalik tarabalo and atri thermal waters possibly indicating the recharge during arid climate discussed in section 5 4 depleted stable isotope values δ2h 36 8 0 8 and δ18o 6 3 0 2 and moderate temperature of the thermal water at taptapani site indicate a greater mixing of thermal water with non thermal water which can also be substantiated geochemically the chemical facies of the taptapani thermal water is found to be na ca hco3 type whereas the other thermal waters are na cl type the preponderance of bicarbonate type of thermal water in taptapani area indicates a greater extent of mixing with non thermal waters which is also corroborated from high tritium value of the taptapani thermal water 1 5 tu compared to other thermal waters 1 tu the approximate degree of mixing is estimated from tritium concentrations assuming the deep seated thermal water has zero tritium content sammel and craig 1981 the percentage of non thermal water contribution was found to be highest for taptapani site 63 followed by atri tarabalo 20 and athmalik site 10 these estimated mixing proportions justify the lower temperature and depleted isotopic composition of the thermal water at taptapani site and higher temperature and enriched isotopic composition of the thermal waters in other sites the ec correlations with δ2h and δ18o also indicate different groups for thermal waters collected from different sites fig s3 which rules out the possibility of a common reservoir as the source for the thermal waters in all the four studied sites this inference further strengthens the observations obtained from the hydrochemical classification fig 3a and b and isotope trends fig 4a the deuterium excess dx δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o provides a reliable measure of the physical conditions surface temperature humidity of the source region responsible for vapor transport to the site of precipitation dansgaard 1964 the dx of oceanic origin is normally 10 in temperate climate clark and fritz 1997 the mean dx values of thermal water during pre and post monsoon periods are found to be similar in this case i e 8 6 1 3 and 9 0 2 3 respectively while thermal water at taptapani site has slightly higher dx value 13 6 the dx values of the thermal waters suggest their oceanic origin with some modifications during the infiltration the modifications include contribution of recirculated moisture evaporative enrichment or mixing with different moisture sources the non thermal waters also fall along the gmwl and lwml indicating precipitation recharge to shallow aquifer system fig 4b a few samples mainly from tarabalo site fall below lmwl on a line with slope 3 49 indicating evaporation effect higher evaporation is observed in samples during pre monsoon compared to post monsoon fig 4b which could be due to evaporative enrichment this seasonal variation in isotope data of non thermal waters suggests contribution of local precipitation to the shallow aquifer system unlike thermal waters there is no site wise clustering in non thermal waters excepting for taptapani site fig 4b this observation suggests that the thermal and non thermal water circulations in egmb follow different flow paths furthermore the non thermal waters show a wider scatter in the ec correlations with δ2h and δ18o fig s3 and do not show a particular grouping like in the case of thermal waters this clearly suggests the influence of soil water interaction in the top weathered formation and contribution of precipitation to non thermal waters depleted isotope composition of non thermal waters of taptapani site mean δ18o 6 4 suggests their origin from rainfall occurring at higher elevation the dem of this area indicates that the altitude of taptapani site is 450 m amsl above mean sea level while other three sites have altitude in the range of 50 75 m amsl fig 2b therefore it can be concluded that shallow aquifer system of taptapani site is recharged by precipitation occurring at higher elevations 5 4 age dating of thermal waters very low environmental tritium content observed in thermal waters of atri tarabalo and athmalik sites clearly suggests that ages are very old 50 years while at taptapani the thermal water is modern water most of the non thermal waters have tritium content 1 5 tu indicating modern recharge a few non thermal waters show low tritium 1 tu which can be attributed to thermal water mixing radiocarbon dating was carried out to estimate the age of thermal waters the major challenge in estimating accurate radiocarbon age of waters is assigning the initial radiocarbon value for dic several models are in use which can account for the different isotope and geochemical processes modifying the initial signatures of 14c of dic clark and fritz 1997 blaser et al 2010 and references therein the source of co2 is important in geothermal waters since different processes provide different initial radiocarbon values for the dic the thermo metamorphic decarbonation of carbonates and upper mantle degassing contribute to co2 which has a 14c value of 0 pmc evans et al 2008 both these sources contribute to radiocarbon dilution and overestimation of thermal water ages however the large difference between the δ13c dic values of the studied thermal waters 20 to 16 vpdb and the expected values of decarbonation and degassing processes 2 to 2 and 8 to 3 respectively indicate that radiocarbon dilution is not significant this is further supported by presence of low co2 concentration 0 2 in gas emissions from these sites mahala 2019 the oxidation of organic material in the presence of dissolved sulphate within the aquifer also complicates 14c dating due to addition of 14c free carbonate to the dic reservoir aravena et al 1995 there is no data available on the h2s concentration of these thermal waters however dic derived in the sulphate reduction process normally has δ13c in the range of 5 to 10 hoefs 1997 which again different from the range of δ13c dic values observed in this case therefore the influence of sulphate reduction on the dating of thermal waters can be ignored the silicate mineral weathering reactions supply dic to waters through dissolution of soil and atmospheric co2 recharging waters dissolve root zone co2 to form carbonic acid log pco2 2 6 facilitating silicate mineral weathering in the case of closed condition the consumed co2 is not replenished by the soil gas and that results in lowering of log pco2 values as observed in this case 2 3 to 3 9 table s8 the log pco2 also plays a crucial role in controlling the saturation state of carbonate minerals charlet et al 1990 and indicate the microbial oxidation of organic matter benedetti et al 1996 the open closed condition of thermal water with respect to co2 is further examined from δ13c dic vs hco3 plot fig 10 a atmospheric co2 has a typical δ13c value 8 cerling et al 1991 therefore the corresponding δ13c dic would be 1 6 shown by line 1 in fig 10a the closed system dissolution of carbonate rocks without any fractionation is shown by line 2 δ13c 0 the non equilibrium dissolution of carbonates 1 1 mixture of soil co2 with δ13c 25 and carbonates with δ13c 0 is shown by line 3 the equilibration of dic with soil co2 δ13c 25 yields 17 5 value as shown by line 4 from the graph it can be observed that the sample data fall along the line 4 indicating equilibrium of dic with soil co2 both thermal and non thermal waters show a similar source of dic the radiocarbon content of the dic also modifies similar to δ13c dic under open system condition the dic exchanges continuously with the 14c active soil gas therefore the initial activity of dic 14cdic remains at 100 pmc but under closed equilibrium condition the 14c dic decays with time without being replenished an increasing trend in log pco2 is noticed in thermal waters from 3 9 to 2 3 which reaches to the value similar to non thermal water fig 1b indicating that the dic is derived dominantly from soil co2 and the decrease in log pco2 clearly suggests a closed co2 condition correlation between δ13c and 14c is found to be positive implying the contribution of carbon sources with dead radiocarbon and depleted δ13c fig 10c the dissolution of carbonates with time mineralized organic matter is further ascertained by the negative relationship between 14c and ph fig 10d radiocarbon correction using pearson model was not applied in this study as the model demands recharge conditions of the aquifer to obtain accurate ages fontes and garnier s f g model though does not require input parameters and removes the recharge conditions uncertainty it is applicable to only carbonate systems and therefore was not considered in closed system like that typically exhibited by deep groundwater the iaea model is apt clark and fritz 1997 as it takes in to account the temperature dependent isotope fractionation among carbonate species co2 hco3 co3 2 which is highly effective for thermal waters the relatively high ph mean 8 3 and lower log pco2 2 6 observed in thermal waters would not support an open co2 evolutionary pathway since the continuous supply of co2 would render acidic ph the general formula for corrected 14c groundwater age is given as equation 4 4 age 8267 ln a 14 c measured q a 14 c initial the correction factor q is calculated using the following equation 5 5 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carb δ 13 c soil ε gb δ 13 c carb where ε gb 9483 t 23 89 which considers isotope exchange among carbon species co2 gas hco3 aq co3 2 solid where δ13cdic measured 13c in groundwater δ13csoil δ13c of the soil co2 δ13ccarb δ13c of the calcite ɛgb additive fractionation factor between co2 gas and hco3 and t is the temperature in kelvin in order to account for the contribution of deep inorganic carbon sources and subsequent radiocarbon dilution we have used the equation 6 proposed by wang et al 2019 6 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c deadcarb δ 13 c rech δ 13 c deadcarb δ13crech represents the recharge area δ13cdead carb represents the deep source inorganic co2 the δ13c value of deep source inorganic co2 of gas reservoirs and geothermal water is usually around 1 5 wang et al 2019 which is selected as the value of δ13cdead carb to correct the 14c age of deep source dead carbon the apparent ages were also provided for comparison which is estimated by considering 98 6 pmc highest 14c measured in the study area as initial 14c value the corrected ages of thermal waters are shown in table 1 the results obtained from the 14c correction models slightly differ from the apparent age estimates uncorrected indicating the impact of temperature dependent fractionation on 14c value and impact of mixing with deep inorganic carbon source table 1 the conformity between the corrected and uncorrected radiocarbon age dating is largely due to the absence of dissolution of the dead carbon from the aquifer matrix which is exemplified from the δ13c dic 18 75 to 21 values of the thermal water the δ13c values of dic clearly reflect the silicate weathering with soil co2 derived from c3 type of plants that has an average value of about 19 1 das et al 2005 the phenomenon of silicate weathering is also substantiated from the subsurface geological formation of the study area however the three modeled age estimates are found to have similar range the agreement among different modelled values provided confidence to the reliability of the ages determined the residence time of thermal waters at atri t1 14 0 14 9 ka and tarabalo t1 13 3 14 2 ka is found to be similar while thermal waters at athmalik are relatively older t1 18 8 20 7 ka thermal and non thermal mixed sources show ages in the range of 2 8 7 6 ka non thermal water is shown by negative radiocarbon age indicating modern recharge the estimated ages of the thermal waters suggest that these waters are recharged during last glacial maximum lgm a relatively arid climatic regime this interpretation is supported by the enriched δ18o values of the thermal waters δ18o 3 2 and 4 1 for athmalik and atri tarabalo respectively compared to the present day meteoric waters average rainwater δ18o 5 5 keesari et al 2016 we interpret the enriched δ18o value of thermal waters to represent recharge during the decreased summer monsoon rainfall which is characterized by enriched mean annual δ18o of the rainfall high evaporative flux reflects a significant reduction in the soil moisture which facilitates greater fractionation and leads enriched δ18o composition in recharging waters as was observed in this case the inter tropical aridity in egmb delang puri sector odisha during 12 17 ka has been reported by kulkarni et al 1998 wherein the authors also noted that the isotopic composition of groundwater is enriched compared to modern precipitation hinting at the possible recharge during arid climate the global sea level data indicate that the sea level during the period 20 ka was 130 m below the current level lambeck et al 2014 this could have displaced the shoreline to further east from the current location a similar phenomenon was reported in bengal basin bangladesh where the shoreline during the lgm 20 ka was displaced 100 150 km to the south ravenscroft et al 2018 considering the age of the thermal waters and the sea level during that time the sea water component as the source of thermal water can be squarely ruled out the monsoonal circulation was greatly reduced during lgm and the resultant precipitation was also isotopically enriched δ18o 3 5 which matches well with the isotopic composition of thermal waters the deep groundwater from chittagong coastal aquifer bangladesh showed a radiocarbon age of 17 ka age and an enriched stable isotope composition ravenscroft et al 2018 the paleo recharge history of thermal waters is clearly displayed in the positive correlations among temperature δ18o and water age fig 11 the trends observed in this figure clearly suggest that the observed enrichment in thermal waters is due to their recharge during arid climate the deep groundwaters from middle ganga plains are found to be 3 5 to 4 7 ka old while in deltaic plains the typical ages range from 1 to 10 ka lapworth et al 2018 and 3 9 ka hoque and burgess 2012 a comparison of the deep groundwater ages from ganga basin with the thermal waters of egmb suggests longer circulation path of the thermal waters compared to the deep non thermal groundwater systems however the thermal waters from the adjacent godavari river basin show a similar age between 9 and 18 6 ka chatterjee et al 2019 which essentially infers that the evolution history of both the geothermal systems is same 5 5 thermal water genesis circulations and reservoir depth there are many speculations on the source of heat in shear zones of egmb since very little data is available field studies supplemented by satellite data also indicate that the thermal springs lie along lineaments fig 1c 2b which infer close relationship between tectonics and thermal activity there is no evidence of any recent magmatic activity around these thermal springs and hence the likely source of heat is the rocks of egmb the radioactive elements concentrations and the heat production 71 3 142 8 mw m2 in the egmb is reported to be highest amongst the granulite belts of india kumar et al 2007 very high levels of radioactive elements u 600 mg kg th 1500 mg kg and k 5 are reported in metamorphic rocks baranwal et al 2006 another study conducted on gas emissions of these thermal springs indicated a considerable amount of helium gas 0 27 to 1 7 by volume and the n2 ar he ternary diagram suggested a long residence time of the gas phase in the crust affected by u and th decay mahala 2019 from the correlations among the temperature and water age it is observed that temperature of thermal waters increases with residence time of water from this observation and tectonic and thermal information provided above it can be concluded that the thermal waters in egmb are produced due to the long contact and deep circulation of the rainwater inside the precambrian metamorphites high heat producing comprising elevated levels of radioactive elements the water flows in geothermal systems are complex due to the occurrence of complex subsurface stratigraphy and heterogeneity in geology temperature gradients and fractures or other conduits in the permeable zones the e w trending graben bounding faults provide permeable pathways for a thermal water circulation system along the northern sector of egmb based on the hydrochemical isotopic and residence time values as well as variation of temperatures in thermal waters two modes of thermal flow paths can be suggested in egmb the first mode is n s flow system that originates from iron ore super group iosg plateau and proceed to graben floor through fractures and fissures to ultimately issue on the surface along the contact zones of iosg plateau and northern edge of mahanadi graben the second mode is s n directional flow system that originates from eastern ghats super group egsg plateau and reach graben floor which subsequently appear as thermal sprouts along the contact zones of iosg plateau and southern edge of mahanadi graben the rainwater which upon penetrating downwards along the faults and fractures is heated by geothermal gradient and then rises to the surface through the permeable zones the non thermal water also circulates in the same way but do not flow through the permeable fault zones and hence restricted to shallow depths the circulation depth of thermal waters is estimated using the equation 7 7 z tz t o g z o where z is the circulation depth m to is the local annual average temperature 26 6 c from https en climate data org g is thermal gradient of the region 0 04 0 01 c m after padhi and pitale 1995 and zo is the thickness of the constant temperature zone taken as 0 m tz is the temperature c of the geothermal reservoir calculated by a reasonable geothermometer img in this case table 4 the estimated circulation depths for atri tarabalo athmalik and taptapani sites are 2 3 0 6 km 2 1 0 5 km 2 4 0 6 km and 1 6 0 4 km respectively table 4 reservoir depths of similar order 1 3 km have been reported in several geothermal systems of india chatterjee et al 2016 2017 singh et al 2020 a conceptual hydrogeological hydrochemical isotope model for thermal water genesis and circulations in mahandi graben egmb is presented in fig 12 from the above calculations it can be inferred that the geothermal reservoir in egmb lies in the depth range of 2 1 0 35 km 5 6 future scope limberger et al 2018 reported that the geothermal electrical production is mostly confined to the areas containing high geothermal gradients and sufficient reservoirs which are very limited hence development of technology focusing exploitation of low enthalpy geothermal systems would pave way for reduction in fossil burning and leading to cleaner environment till now about 4000 thermal springs have been identified in indian subcontinent and except few high temperature thermal springs i e puga and chumathang in indus valley ladakh panamik in nubra valley ladakh parbati and beas valley in himachal pradesh tapoban and badrinath in uttarakhand all other thermal springs fall in the medium to low enthalpy category singh et al 2016 indian shield has an estimated potential of 10 000 mw www indiaenergyportal org the majority of which are low to moderate enthalpy systems extensive investigations have been carried out with regard to geological geochemical and geophysical aspects of geothermal systems but the drilling investigations have been very limited though it was realized a long time ago that india has good potential to harness geothermal energy krishnaswamy and ravishanker 1982 the development of the geothermal resources has not progressed mainly due to inadequate understanding of the deeper thermal regime leading to uncertainty over the proposed reservoir models as well as the sustainability of heat source there are only a couple of geothermal energy based power plants constructed planned at a few places such as a 25 mw geothermal power project in the west coast hot spring belt sharma and trikha 2013 a 35 mwe geothermal power plant in gujarat chandrasekharam and chandrasekhar 2015 singh et al 2016 a 5 kw pilot power plant at manikaran razdan et al 2008 an approved 25 mwe geothermal power project in andhra pradesh chandrasekharam and chandrasekhar 2015 but with regard to power production the geothermal resources are entirely undeveloped in the country at present reservoir temperature its depth and volume are the primary factors considered while planning geothermal energy exploitation india fares well with regard to the information on the geothermal reservoir temperature and its depth but the information on genesis recharge history and movement of thermal fluids is very limited there are reports on the reduction of thermal water discharges and drying up of reservoirs after the commencement of thermal water exploitation chandrajith et al 2013 pingheng et al 2017 which clearly demonstrate the importance of understanding the genesis and estimating the flow patterns of the thermal fluids in any geothermal system therefore in order to expand the footprint of geothermal energy use in india it is very important to determine the genesis recharge history and thermal water circulations of geothermal systems in this regard isotope techniques are very valuable tools that can address uncertainty over the sustainability of geothermal reservoirs as demonstrated in this study 6 conclusions the genesis and circulation of thermal and non thermal waters in shear zones of mahanadi graben of eastern ghats mobile belt region are investigated using multi tracers including chemical and isotope tracers the thermal waters issue along the faults of mahanadi graben and are classified as low to medium enthalpy systems 55 59 c thermal waters close to graben are alkaline ph 8 75 9 13 less saline ec 1500 µs cm and na cl type while away from the graben thermal water has low temperature 42 c neutral ph and is na ca hco3 type the characteristic ionic ratios and major ion trends indicate that bulk of the chemical ions is derived from the silicate weathering in both the thermal and non thermal waters isotope characteristics of the thermal waters indicate meteoric source and presence of three different thermal reservoirs stable isotope and environmental tritium data indicate that the non thermal waters are recharged by modern precipitation influence of evaporative enrichment in non thermal waters is observed during pre monsoon period the thermal circulations seem to originate from northern side of the graben in the case of athmalik site and southern side in the case of atri tarabalo sites the estimated reservoir temperatures range between 92 and 124 c and the circulation depths are found to be 1 6 2 4 km the radiocarbon age of 13 3 to 20 7 ka for thermal waters suggests dominant recharge during lgm which is characterized by arid climate and low rainfall the stable isotope and hydrochemical inferences clearly establish the improbability of marine sources while the age and temperature correlations indicate thermal gradient as the source of heat the emergence of thermal waters is controlled through fracture systems and the hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions reflect minimum mixing with non thermal waters during their rise to surface however thermal water located away from graben indicates significant mixing with non thermal water and hence lower outlet temperature and depleted isotopic content credit authorship

3088,this study presents a scaling analysis of extremes in hourly precipitation with coincident temperature in 14 urban locations across india for monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons and examines the probabilistic association through bivariate copula using gridded hourly rainfall and dew point temperature dpt datasets from era5 reanalysis and daily maximum temperature from the india meteorology department imd it examines how far the scaling relationships of sub daily precipitation extremes with temperature deviate from the clausius clapeyron cc scaling across different climatic regimes in india pre and post 1975 analyses were conducted to evaluate if the scaling relationships have altered in line with the global climate shift of the 1970s findings from the study indicate that during the monsoon the scaling relationship was negative in all the cities except pune pnq during the post 1975 period in fact in most of the locations e g bhopal bho jaipur jai and mumbai bom the scaling coefficient for monsoon rainfall extremes decreased after the 1975 global climate shift during the non monsoon season the scaling coefficient was slightly positive almost everywhere and approximately equal to the cc scaling rate both pre and post 1975 the only exception being in pnq where a negative scaling was observed the joint probabilistic distributions for bom showed that the non exceedance probability of extreme rainfall was higher when conditioned on higher temperatures in the monsoon season however the opposite was observed in the non monsoon season pre 1975 a similar distinct seasonal feature was noticed in a few other locations including new delhi del using dpt as the scaling variable chennai maa guwahati gau and tiruchirappalli trz showed positive scaling in both pre and post 1975 in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons unlike with maximum air temperature super cc scaling was observed with dpt in the monsoon season for trz pre and post 1975 and for maa and gau pre 1975 and also in the non monsoon season for maa pre and post 1975 and for gau and bom post 1975 this analysis is expected to provide useful insights into the regional and seasonal distribution of hydrological extremes for a subsequent assessment of their impacts on the design of urban infrastructure keywords clausius clapeyron cc relationship hourly precipitation extremes temperature conditional dependence monsoon 1 introduction scientific literature suggests the likelihood of greater intensity of extreme hydrologic events due to global warming and climate change alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the increasing magnitude and frequency of extreme events due to climate change accentuates the risk of more floods and droughts underlining the need to take these into account while developing infrastructure in the future guerreiro et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 according to the clausius clapeyron cc scaling as temperature increases the water holding capacity of the atmosphere also increases at an approximate rate of 6 8 c hardwick jones et al 2010 prein et al 2017 blenkinsop et al 2017 wang et al 2021 thus extreme rainfall on a daily scale is considered to exhibit a similar scaling relationship with temperature prein et al 2017 however latitudinal characteristics temperature effects duration of rainfall events and dynamic responses to climate change are known to impact regional temperature precipitation scaling relationships beyond the expected thermodynamic response rate lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 hardwick jones et al 2010 shaw et al 2011 utsumi et al 2011 mishra et al 2012 panthou et al 2014 vittal et al 2016 ali and mishra 2017 for instance sub daily rainfall extremes in australia were found to exhibit both positive and negative scaling with temperature depending on the station s location and the duration of rainfall events herath and sarukkalige 2018 most precipitation temperature scaling studies have used maximum air temperature as the scaling variable ali and mishra 2017 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 gao et al 2020 however some studies suggest that surface air temperature alone is not a good predictor of rainfall extremes and prefer dpt as a scaling variable as it can exclude the effects of the humidity limitations panthou et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 in india the scaling relationship between precipitation extremes and dpt provides more robust results for the sensitivity of rainfall extremes under a warming climate compared to surface air temperature since convection largely contributes to precipitation lenderink et al 2011 ali mishra 2017 compared to daily rainfall extremes the scaling of sub daily rainfall extremes is even more difficult to assess due to the shortage of and inconsistency in observation records available at such finer temporal scale westra et al 2014 barbero et al 2017 lewis et al 2019 studies suggest that hourly or multi hourly rainfall variation with coincident temperature can exhibit a super cc relationship at higher and intermediate temperature ranges lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 lenderink et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 for instance lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 observed that at temperatures exceeding 12 c hourly precipitation extremes increased at a rate close to 14 c in large parts of europe hourly scaling rates were also found to be higher and twice the cc scaling rate in hong kong and the netherlands lenderink et al 2011 and varying between cc rate and super cc rate in austria schroeer kirchengast 2018 south korea park and min 2017 the usa mishra et al 2012 prein et al 2017 ali et al 2021a australia europe japan india and malaysia ali et al 2021a in china the scaling rate was found to be close to the cc rate at lower temperatures but was super cc rate at higher temperatures wang et al 2018 even triple the cc rates were observed for hourly precipitation events in australia guerreiro et al 2018 on the other hand some studies noted negative scaling relationships between precipitation extremes and surface air temperature which were attributed to local cooling or in storm effects which reduce the scaling rate ali and mishra 2017 bao et al 2017 in order to assess the risks related to urban floods or floods in steeper catchments with lower infiltration the relationship of sub daily precipitation extremes with temperature needs to be explored moreover it has been established that there was a shift in global climate around the 1970s gupta and chavan 2021 you and ting 2021 this has been observed in india in the form of a consistent rise in mean surface air temperature after 1975 kulkarni 2012 sahana et al 2015 observed a significant delay in the onset of summer monsoon in india due to changes in large scale circulation related to the regime shift during pre and post 1976 77 the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr was found to have decreased post 1976 which is attributed to a deficit in rainfall over the core monsoon zone in fact deficit in the monsoon rainfall became more frequent and excess in monsoon rainfall became less frequent during the post 1976 period kulkarni 2012 the frequency of short break spells and moderate active spells in the indian summer monsoon have increased over central india after 1977 singh 2013 dash and maity 2019 evaluated the spatio temporal trends of 11 precipitation based climate indices over india using daily precipitation data all the indices were found to show an increasing trend during post 1975 compared to pre 1975 the study showed an increase in short duration precipitation events rx1day over a larger area compared to long duration precipitation events rx5day further vittal et al 2016 noted an increase in the frequency of lower percentile precipitation post 1975 thus it is hypothesized that the scaling relationship of precipitation extremes with coincident temperature may have altered around the 1970s serving as the basis for this study previous evidence suggests that the rainfall temperature scaling relationship may have varied seasonally as observed in australia wasko and sharma 2014 and europe berg et al 2009 shaw et al 2011 and mishra et al 2012 since most regions in india receive about 70 80 of the annual rainfall during the monsoon kumar et al 2010 deshpande et al 2012 naidu et al 2017 the causal factors and behaviour of extreme rainfall events in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons differ this calls for a separate analysis of the temperature precipitation scaling for monsoon and non monsoon periods this study aims to address the following research questions i how far does the scaling relationship of sub daily precipitation extremes with temperature deviate from cc scaling across different climatic regimes in india ii were these scaling relationships altered in accordance with the global climate shift of the 1970s iii are the scaling relationships of monsoon rainfall extremes distinct from those of non monsoon extremes to answer these questions we conducted a pre and post climate shift analysis of hourly rainfall extremes with coincident temperature in 14 urban locations across india for monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons this paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents the study area and data used section 3 presents the detailed methodology section 4 enumerates the results and discussions and section 5 furnishes the summary and conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area a total of 14 locations across india were considered in this study their selection was done to provide a proper representation of different climatic regions across india the details of these locations are presented in fig 1 and summarised in table 1 the international airlines and airports iata acronyms are used to denote the names of the cities as per imd india has four climatological seasons winter january to february summer or pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to september and post monsoon october to december dash and maity 2019 the precipitation pattern in the country is strongly periodic and the monsoon season receives approximately 75 of the annual rainfall kumar et al 2010 deshpande et al 2012 naidu et al 2017 hence the study analyses the monsoon june july august and september hereafter jjas and non monsoon seasons all months other than jjas separately further since precipitation patterns experienced some changes post 1975 kulkarni 2012 singh 2013 vittal et al 2016 a separate analysis was conducted for monsoon and non monsoon seasons for the pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods 2 2 data gridded rainfall data with high temporal resolution hourly and spatial resolution 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude was used from era5 climate data store for the period 1951 2016 era5 is a fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis of global climate and weather dataset produced by copernicus climate change service c3s the data assimilation system used to produce era5 is ifs cycle 41r2 4d var hersbach et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 era5 reanalysis is a successor of era interim reanalysis and was initially available from 1979 to date the hourly preliminary back extension 1950 1978 was recently made available for public use it is well known that sub daily precipitation extremes in reanalysis data have limitations however alternative datasets like global summary of the day gsod climate prediction center morphing method cmorph and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm have greater limitations in terms of continuity and are mostly available at a daily scale rather than hourly scale moreover they are not available for long periods of time as was required in this study for the pre and post 1975 hourly analyses similar reasons have prompted other global scaling studies to use sub daily hourly precipitation data from reanalysis products such as era5 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021b era5 reanalysis rainfall data is known to perform well over india for the monsoon period compared to other reanalysis datasets such as global data assimilation forecasting system gdafs at ncmrwf ngfs singh et al 2021 era5 is also considered to be a better product for scaling studies ali et al 2021b hence era5 hourly precipitation data has been used in the present study as well moreover gridded daily 2 m dpt data from era5 was used in this study as it was found suitable for global scaling studies including in india moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021b ali mishra 2017 further the suitability of era5 s hourly precipitation data was checked with respect to the recently in 2020 publicly available developed regional reanalysis dataset indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa ashrit et al 2020 rani et al 2021 it provides hourly rainfall data with fine resolution 12 km 12 km for the indian region from 1979 to 2016 to compare era5 and imdaa data a scaling analysis was performed for kolkata ccu as an example using the regional reanalysis imdaa data however as imdaa data was not available before 1979 era5 data was considered for our analysis which examines pre 1975 and post 1975 scaling relationships although era5 air temperature data is also available to date surface air temperature data from imd was used in this study as it is derived from station observations the gridded daily maximum temperature at spatial resolution of 1 longitude 1 latitude was obtained from the archives of the national data centre at imd pune india for the period 1951 2016 the data is developed from 395 quality controlled stations and converted into gridded datasets using shepard s interpolation technique srivastava et al 2009 the imd dataset were downloaded from open access website http www imdpune gov in clim pred lrf new grided data download html maintained by the ministry of earth sciences government of india goi to generate some of the figures in this manuscript digital elevation model dem shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second global data was downloaded from united states geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros center through earthexplorer ee interface from its archive https earthexplorer usgs gov 3 methodology the downloaded rainfall and temperature datasets for all the locations were initially checked for quality the interpolation technique inverse distance weighting idw was applied to obtain the time series at the specific grid points of the required locations next a sequential mann kendall test or turning point analysis was performed on the precipitation extremes to check for change points in the time series for the period 1951 2016 results of the sequential mann kendall test have not been shown in the manuscript for the sake of brevity however a change point or turning point was observed for most of the cities during the 1970s in 1976 for ccu gau bom and bhubaneswar bbi in 1971 for aurangabad ixu in 1973 for ahmedabad amd in 1978 for bho and in 1979 for pnq hence 1975 was selected as a change point for a pre and post analysis while there are also records of climate shifts around 1998 ding et al 2013 lyon et al 2014 it was the global climate shift around 1975 that was prominently noted in many regions including india sahana et al 2015 chen et al 2018 dash and maity 2019 gupta and chavan 2021 you and ting 2021 hence it was decided to assess the change in scaling relationships for all the cities uniformly during the pre and post 1975 periods which is also supported by previous global and regional studies kulkarni 2012 vittal et al 2016 dash and maity 2019 3 1 scaling hourly precipitation extremes with temperature to compare with clausius clapeyron cc scaling rates for each location hourly precipitation p values greater than 0 3 mm recognized as wet hours in accordance with wet days lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 lenderink et al 2011 panthou et al 2014 were paired with the corresponding daily maximum temperature t as daily maximum temperature is most widely used for analysing scaling relationships ali and mishra 2017 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 herath and sarukkalige 2018 gao et al 2020 the same was followed in this study however daily or sub daily mean surface air temperature sat may also be used for analysing scaling relationships bao et al 2017 park and min 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 next the paired precipitation temperature data was sorted in ascending order of t and segregated into several bins each with a certain range of temperature interval this is known as the binning technique which is very widely used zhang et al 2017 ali et al 2018 herath and sarukkalige 2018 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021a a total of 15 bins were used and the median temperature in each bin was taken as its representative temperature fifteen bins were considered to be adequate for the analysis as some studies have used even fewer bins 10 bins barbero et al 2017 or 12 bins mishra et al 2012 wasko sharma 2014 bao et al 2017 ali et al 2021a within each bin the precipitation values were fitted to an empirical cumulative distribution function and the extreme precipitation 99th percentile pex was found for each representative temperature the logarithm of pex with median t was regressed to assess the scaling relationship of extreme rainfall with temperature wasko et al 2015 ali and mishra 2017 bao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the change in extreme precipitation from p 1 to p 2 with changes in temperature δ t was calculated thus 1 p 2 p 1 1 0 01 1 δ t where 1 c denotes the rate at which extreme precipitation changes with temperature which is often stated as the apparent scaling rate bao et al 2017 the regression slopes expressed as percentages were subsequently compared against the cc scaling rate of 6 8 k 1 3 2 probabilistic dependence of hourly precipitation extremes on temperature 3 2 1 marginal distribution of precipitation extremes and temperature among all the wet hours the precipitation values which were greater than the 99th percentile were considered as hourly precipitation extremes to assess their probabilistic dependence on daily maximum temperature the use of daily maximum temperature as the scaling variable rather than sub daily temperature in this study was based on the latest literature on scaling studies formayer and fritz 2016 ali and mishra 2017 park and min 2017 ali et al 2018 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021a the tendency of wetter hours to be associated with cooler daily maximum temperature due to local cooling after rain events will be reflected in this analysis as sub daily hourly precipitation extremes are of interest it is expected that wetter days and those with extreme daily precipitation can typically contribute to more of such hourly events in order to get the best fit marginal distribution of hourly precipitation extremes and daily maximum temperature for each location several probability distributions including gumbel gamma logistic weibull lognormal and skew exponential power distributions were fitted the best fit marginal distribution was selected based on akaike s information criterion aic values akaike 1974 and the worm plots of the residuals zhang et al 2015 kang et al 2019 the generalized additive models in location scale and shape gamlss framework was used to determine the parameters location scale and shape of the fitted marginals it allows the modelling of up to four parameters in a distribution family and has been used successfully in numerous hydrological studies to fit two parameter and three parameter distributions stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 villarini et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 debele et al 2017 the r package gamlss was used to fit the marginal distributions and select the best fit marginal 3 2 2 modelling joint probabilistic dependence of hourly precipitation extremes and temperature using bivariate copula the joint probabilistic distribution of hourly precipitation extremes and temperature was modelled through bivariate copulas a copula is a multivariate distribution c with uniformly distributed marginal u 0 1 on 0 1 according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 every multivariate distribution f with marginals f 1 x 1 f n x n could be written as 2 f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n for a n dimensional copula c equation 2 can be written as c u 1 u n f f 1 1 u 1 f n 1 u n where the f i 1 u i s are the inverse distribution functions of the marginals the joint density function f for a continuous f with strictly increasing continuous marginal densities f 1 f n is 3 f x 1 x n c 1 n f 1 x 1 f n x n f 1 x 1 f n x n for some uniquely identified n variate copula density c 1 n for the bivariate case eq 3 was reduced to 4 f x 1 x 2 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 where c 12 denotes the appropriate pair copula density for the pair of transformed variables f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 thus the conditional density function of the pair copula is given as 5 f x 1 x 2 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 and the conditional distribution function is given as 6 f x 1 x 2 c x 1 x 2 f x 1 f x 2 f x 2 the pair wise copula construction method aas et al 2009 was used in the analysis offering the flexibility to scale up to multivariate vine copulas if needed joe 1997 bedford and cooke 2002 genest and favre 2007 acar et al 2012 a total of 40 copulas were tested to describe the pair wise dependence structure of hourly extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature based on the lowest aic values the best copula was selected for all the locations the r package copula was used to implement the copula modelling and select the best fit copula 4 results and discussions 4 1 comparing the performance of era5 dataset and regional reanalyses imdaa to assess the suitability of era5 precipitation data a recently developed in 2020 and publicly available regional reanalysis dataset indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa was explored which provides hourly rainfall data with a fine resolution 12 km 12 km from 1979 to 2016 only for the indian region ashrit et al 2020 rani et al 2021 scaling analysis was performed for one location ccu as an example using the precipitation data from regional reanalysis dataset imdaa and era5 the scaling coefficients observed from imdaa hourly rainfall data were more or less in agreement with the era5 hourly rainfall dataset although the actual values were not very close the plots are shown in fig 2 a and b as imdaa data before 1979 is not available era5 data was suitable for our analysis to examine pre 1975 and post 1975 scaling relationships 4 2 scaling of hourly extreme precipitation with coincident temperature as mentioned earlier the scaling relationships of hourly extreme precipitation pex with daily maximum temperature t in the selected cities were analysed for the pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods the monsoon and non monsoon periods were analysed separately the comparison with cc scaling is shown in fig 3 and summarized in table 2 to understand the scaling results more clearly information about p values and coefficient of determination r2 of the regression coefficients are provided separately in the table along with the scaling coefficient the statistically significant at 5 level of significance scaling rates are in bold to study scaling behaviour across different climatic regions the 14 selected locations were grouped into different climatic zones regions following ali and mishra 2017 bho nag gau and lko were grouped under humid subtropical zone bbi maa ccu and trz under tropical wet and dry zone bom pnq and ixu under tropical wet zone jai under arid zones and amd and del under semi arid zones in our analysis we observed a wide range of scaling behaviour close to cc rate 6 7 c negative scaling as well as positive super cc scaling in the humid subtropical region scaling rate varied from 2 7 to 7 5 c and 0 4 to 10 2 c in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons respectively except in gau with 1 61 c during pre 1975 in the monsoon season in the tropical wet and dry zone the scaling rate varied from 0 3 to 4 5 c in the monsoon season and from 2 3 to 11 4 c in the non monsoon season except in trz in the tropical wet zone the scaling rate varied from 1 to 8 8 c in the monsoon season and from 0 28 to 14 6 c in the non monsoon season except in pnq in the arid zone the scaling range was from 5 to 5 8 c in the monsoon season and 1 6 to 1 7 c in the non monsoon season in the semi arid zone the scaling rate varied from 4 8 to 12 5 c in the monsoon season while both negative and positive scaling rates were observed in the non monsoon season thus the scaling relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature is not always consistent with the cc rate and fluctuates considerably among regions and seasons as noted in earlier studies berg et al 2009 utsumi et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 a negative scaling rate was mostly observed over tropical regions tropical wet tropical wet and dry and humid subtropical this is consistent with the study of ali et al 2018 and ali and mishra 2017 in which a majority of stations showed negative cc rate median 3 2 k with t the negative scaling rate in tropical regions could be attributed to variations in humidity and soil conditions at higher temperatures lenderink et al 2011 bao et al 2017 ali et al 2018 in tropical and sub tropical regions with an increase in precipitation events there was an increase in local cooling which reduces the temperature thus extreme precipitation events move to the lower temperature bins which reduces the scaling rate bao et al 2017 ali et al 2018 barbero et al 2018 gao et al 2020 thus negative scaling rate may be the result of temporary cooling effect wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 or due to limitations of atmospheric moisture at higher temperatures zhang et al 2017 herath and sarukkalige 2018 barbero et al 2018 gao et al 2018 on the other hand super cc scaling rates may be observed due to a transition between large scale stratiform low temperatures and convective storm types high temperatures berg and haerter 2013 it was observed that monsoon scaling was negative everywhere it was positive only in pnq about 3 c and trz 0 3 c during 1976 2016 in fact at pnq the scaling coefficient changed from 3 1 pre 1975 to 3 2 post 1975 this may have been due to the possible alteration in the type of extreme rainfall events experienced over time extreme precipitation may result from localized intense convective events or be driven by the wide movement of moisture from distant sources where temperatures are quite different from the local temperature zhang et al 2017 the formation of deep convections complex topographical features and the influence of large scale hydroclimatic teleconnections on rainfall patterns make scaling relationships more complex in tropical belts moustakis et al 2020 at a few cities such as bho jai and bom during the monsoon season the scaling coefficient was comparable in magnitude but opposite in direction to the cc scaling rate in most of these locations the coefficient value slightly decreased after the 1975 climate shift at amd the magnitude of the scaling coefficient was largest at 12 which is opposite in sign and almost twice the cc rate this is in contrast to previous studies where steeper scaling rates have been reported to be of positive sign and are often the result of excess latent heat released during intense short duration rainfall loriaux etal 2013 it may be noted that in ixu bho maa pnq del and nagpur nag in the monsoon season and amd bbi bom lucknow lko ccu jai and gau in the non monsoon season the values in neighbouring temperature bins were very scattered so the variation was large and a peaking nature was observed amd bho gau jai lko nag del such a peaking nature has been reported in scaling studies worldwide hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 mishra et al 2012 park min 2017 wang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 indicating that all scaling relationships are not always linear in fact the relationship of extreme precipitation with temperature is examined further in the copula based analysis presented in section 4 5 however for most cities the scaling relationship is more or less linear so the linear regression as done conventionally fits well 4 3 scaling of hourly precipitation extremes with coincident dpt the scaling relationship of hourly extreme precipitation pex with daily dew point temperature dpt for the pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods in six selected cities was analysed separately for the monsoon and non monsoon seasons for the remaining cities the era5 dpt values were found to be unexpected and unreliable for scaling analysis the comparison against cc scaling is shown in fig 4 and summarized in table 3 it may be observed from table 3 that with dpt as the scaling variable significant positive super cc scaling was quite recurrent in maa gau and trz monsoon pre 1975 maa non monsoon pre 1975 trz monsoon post 1975 and gau and bom non monsoon post 1975 stronger super cc scaling coefficient was observed in some of the locations when using dpt compared to maximum air temperature which is in line with previous findings moustakis et al 2020 specifically non monsoon scaling was found positive everywhere with maa being strongly positive during pre 1975 31 and post 1975 15 periods monsoon scaling showed negative relationship in both pre and post 1975 for bbi and ccu positive scaling was observed for maa gau and trz in both pre and post 1975 periods in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons most locations bbi in pre and post 1975 gau and bom in pre 1975 non monsoon maa and gau in post 1975 monsoon followed the cc rate 6 7 c while super cc rates were attained in both pre and post 1975 for maa 15 31 c in non monsoon and trz 14 18 c in monsoon seasons negative scaling coefficient was observed in bbi 7 12 c and ccu 3 5 c in both pre and post 1975 and in bom 1 for the pre 1975 monsoon season in bom the scaling coefficient for monsoon was lower than that for the non monsoon season when maximum temperature was used as a scaling variable however it was the opposite in the case of dpt for bbi gau ccu and bom for monsoon scaling in both pre and post 1975 the regression line is clustered at the higher end of the dpt and the relationship is not really linear fig 4 a similar observation was reported using maximum surface air temperature as the scaling variable the range of dpt corresponding to hourly precipitation extremes in monsoon was quite small compared to those in non monsoon extremes for these aforementioned locations the sample points in the different bins were scattered in the monsoon season unlike in the non monsoon season to describe the scaling results in a more concise and clear manner table 4 shows a comparison of our main findings vis à vis observations from previous studies along with possible mechanisms 4 4 seasonal pex t relationships pre and post 1975 fig 5 shows the maximum temperature corresponding to the rainy days with extreme precipitation 99th percentile for both monsoon and non monsoon months during the pre 1975 and post 1975 periods the magenta pre 1975 and red post 1975 colours represents monsoon season whereas cyan pre 1975 and blue post 1975 color represents the non monsoon season web version of the paper may be referred for the color legends it can be observed that there is a shift in the median temperature associated with the 99th percentile rainfall after 1975 for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons in the non monsoon months the shift is most predominant for bhopal bho ahmedabad amd bhubaneswar bbi and nagpur nag the range of temperature values associated with monsoon extremes is much smaller compared to those of non monsoon extremes except for the cities guwahati gau mumbai bom and pune pnq in chennai maa kolkata ccu guwahati gau and new delhi del the median temperature associated with extremes are similar across both seasons in contrast in jaipur jai and lucknow lko the median temperature value associated with non monsoon extremes was much lower than that in the monsoon season the range of temperature values associated with non monsoon extremes was however much wider only two cities bom and pnq both located in western india had substantially higher median temperatures for non monsoon extremes compared to monsoon extremes it can be seen from fig 6 a that for the monsoon months pnq bom gau nag and ccu were the locations far away from the 45 line indicating that the scaling rate was altered considerably after 1975 for the non monsoon months fig 6b amd ixu bom maa gau and pnq were the locations for which the scaling rate altered after 1975 4 5 probabilistic dependence of hourly precipitation extremes with coincident temperature the joint bivariate distribution of hourly precipitation extremes with daily maximum temperature t was developed and the conditional distribution of pex given t 25 c and t 35 c for both monsoon and non monsoon months are shown in figs 7 and 8 for pre 1975 and post 1975 periods it may be noted that the temperature range varies much beyond t 25 c and t 35 c for many of the locations particularly jai and lko for these two locations as the frequency of extreme rainfall events is the highest around 30 c during the monsoon season see histograms fig 7a d additional cdf plots fig 7e and f were included at an intermediate t 30 c however to keep the pre and post 1975 analysis uniform for all locations and to provide a brief summary of the varying cdfs conditioned on temperature only two temperature values t 25 c and t 35 c were selected for further analysis across all the locations the cdfs for some of the selected locations are shown here in the main manuscript others may be found in the supplementary document fig s1 in all the figures the dotted lines in blue green and red show the cdf pre 1975 whereas the solid lines in blue green and red show the cdf post 1975 at jaipur post 1975 the non exceedance probability of pex given t 25 c is located below those corresponding to t 25 c and 30 c i e p pex pex t 35 p pex pex t 30 p pex pex t 25 in the case of lko it was observed that the non exceedance probability of a certain value of pex given t 35 c was located above those corresponding to t 25 c and 30 c i e p pex pex t 25 p pex pex t 30 p pex pex t 35 in both pre and post 1975 this suggests that on an average heavier rainfall events occur at 25 c compared to 30 c and 35 c this observation is in contrast to the findings of sharma and mujumdar 2019 in the mahanadi basin in south central india in bom fig 8a the shape of the cdf given t 35 c i e p p e x p e x t 35 is very different from pre 1975 compared to all the other three cdfs of the monsoon season the median rainfall ranges from 0 to 3 mm for all the four cases in the monsoon season for most locations including bom fig 8a c and g it was observed that the non exceedance probability of a certain value of pex given t 35 c are located above those corresponding to t 25 c i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 in both pre and post 1975 periods and the median value of pex increased with a decrease in the conditioning variable t in bom in the non monsoon months fig 8b pre 1975 p p e x p e x t 35 p p e x p e x t 25 however the opposite was observed post 1975 i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 thus the nature of dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature had shifted post 1975 in bom fig 8a and b in del fig 8c and d in the monsoon season the nature of the cdf was similar pre and post 1975 i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 however in the non monsoon season the nature of dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature was in contrast i e p p e x p e x t 35 p p e x p e x t 25 this association was also observed in bbi in non monsoon months fig 8f this is in contrast to most of the locations for monsoon season nag maa bho amd bom del and trz where the non exceedance probability of a certain value of pex given higher values of t was located above those corresponding to lower values of t i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 for both the periods and seasons in bbi fig 8e and f it was also notable that the median rainfall corresponding to t 25 c and 35 c was low around 3 mm in monsoon months but substantially high in non monsoon months around 5 mm post 1975 in trz fig 8g and h show that the median value of pex conditioned on both temperatures in the monsoon season was around 3 mm pre 1975 but much higher up to 7 mm post 1975 in non monsoon months the median rainfall remained 2 5 mm both pre and post 1975 it may be noted that this study has some limitations it is based on point locations and the scaling rates could be higher than those obtained by performing the analysis on data pooled over a climatic zone the influence of local dynamics can produce higher scaling rates which may be averaged out resulting in lower scaling rates when the data is pooled ali et al 2021a on the other hand the underestimation of storm types occupying different temperature ranges can lead to an underestimation of the scaling rates moustakis et al 2020 this limits the suitability of coarse reanalyses datasets in scaling analysis hence from this perspective the use of era5 datasets in this study may have produced lower than actual scaling rates this uncertainty in results is greater for regions experiencing strong convection which is affected by the local topography moustakis et al 2020 further there are very few studies addressing the influence of different precipitation types on scaling relationships and specifically the role of convective precipitation in scaling relationships however park and min 2017 studied patterns of temperature and extreme precipitation scaling over south korea and observed that the scaling coefficient changed from cc rate to super cc rate for total and stratiform precipitation extremes and convective extreme precipitation respectively 5 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the scaling relationship of hourly extreme precipitation with daily maximum temperature t and dew point temperature dpt in selected cities across different climatic regimes of india for pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods results of the analysis suggest that scaling coefficient of sub daily monsoon rainfall extremes was negative in all the cities in the study except pune where it was positive about 3 c during 1976 2016 the negative scaling rates noted in most locations were in agreement with earlier studies of tropical regions including india hardwick jones et al 2010 vittal et al 2016 ali mishra 2017 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021a this may be attributed to cooling as a result of antecedent rainfall hence scaling relationships with temperatures of preceding days may be explored in future studies the scaling of non monsoon rainfall extremes with temperature was found to be mildly positive almost everywhere and approximately equal to the cc scaling rate both pre and post 1975 for the non monsoon season a considerable negative scaling was observed only in pune in some cases the scaling coefficients were large in magnitude but not statistically significant bom with t pre and post 1975 non monsoon bbi maa and trz with dpt post 1975 non monsoon and bom with dpt post 1975 monsoon this indicates that the linear regression line does not fit well and the relationship between t and log p is rather non linear however for some regions the linear fit was remarkably suitable for bbi r2 0 74 using t as the scaling variable and ccu r2 0 60 pre 1975 in the non monsoon season after 1975 a similar inference holds good for bbi and gau in the non monsoon season r2 0 65 and for amd r2 0 63 in the monsoon season seasonal pex t relationships for pre and post 1975 analyses indicate that there is an increase in the median temperature in bhubaneswar mumbai jaipur lucknow and pune associated with 99th percentile rainfall post 1975 for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons it was observed that the non exceedance probability of a certain value of rainfall extreme given higher values of t are higher compared to lower values of t i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 for most of the locations throughout the periods of the study however some cities like new delhi exhibited an opposite relationship especially for non monsoon rainfall extremes results of the dpt analysis indicate a stronger super cc scaling coefficient for some of the locations compared to using maximum air temperature which aligns with previous findings moustakis et al 2020 positive and super cc scaling was observed for the monsoon season in some locations and for the non monsoon season in a few locations despite the limitations of hourly data available from reanalysis datasets this study paves the way for an understanding of the regional and seasonal distribution of hourly hydrologic extremes in india key to planning infrastructure development in urban india the study can be spatially extended to represent all topographical and climatic variations by incorporating more cities covering the entire country moreover it would be interesting to temporally extend the analysis into the future incorporating 21st century climate projections through coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 global climate models gcms

3088,this study presents a scaling analysis of extremes in hourly precipitation with coincident temperature in 14 urban locations across india for monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons and examines the probabilistic association through bivariate copula using gridded hourly rainfall and dew point temperature dpt datasets from era5 reanalysis and daily maximum temperature from the india meteorology department imd it examines how far the scaling relationships of sub daily precipitation extremes with temperature deviate from the clausius clapeyron cc scaling across different climatic regimes in india pre and post 1975 analyses were conducted to evaluate if the scaling relationships have altered in line with the global climate shift of the 1970s findings from the study indicate that during the monsoon the scaling relationship was negative in all the cities except pune pnq during the post 1975 period in fact in most of the locations e g bhopal bho jaipur jai and mumbai bom the scaling coefficient for monsoon rainfall extremes decreased after the 1975 global climate shift during the non monsoon season the scaling coefficient was slightly positive almost everywhere and approximately equal to the cc scaling rate both pre and post 1975 the only exception being in pnq where a negative scaling was observed the joint probabilistic distributions for bom showed that the non exceedance probability of extreme rainfall was higher when conditioned on higher temperatures in the monsoon season however the opposite was observed in the non monsoon season pre 1975 a similar distinct seasonal feature was noticed in a few other locations including new delhi del using dpt as the scaling variable chennai maa guwahati gau and tiruchirappalli trz showed positive scaling in both pre and post 1975 in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons unlike with maximum air temperature super cc scaling was observed with dpt in the monsoon season for trz pre and post 1975 and for maa and gau pre 1975 and also in the non monsoon season for maa pre and post 1975 and for gau and bom post 1975 this analysis is expected to provide useful insights into the regional and seasonal distribution of hydrological extremes for a subsequent assessment of their impacts on the design of urban infrastructure keywords clausius clapeyron cc relationship hourly precipitation extremes temperature conditional dependence monsoon 1 introduction scientific literature suggests the likelihood of greater intensity of extreme hydrologic events due to global warming and climate change alexander et al 2006 donat et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the increasing magnitude and frequency of extreme events due to climate change accentuates the risk of more floods and droughts underlining the need to take these into account while developing infrastructure in the future guerreiro et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 according to the clausius clapeyron cc scaling as temperature increases the water holding capacity of the atmosphere also increases at an approximate rate of 6 8 c hardwick jones et al 2010 prein et al 2017 blenkinsop et al 2017 wang et al 2021 thus extreme rainfall on a daily scale is considered to exhibit a similar scaling relationship with temperature prein et al 2017 however latitudinal characteristics temperature effects duration of rainfall events and dynamic responses to climate change are known to impact regional temperature precipitation scaling relationships beyond the expected thermodynamic response rate lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 hardwick jones et al 2010 shaw et al 2011 utsumi et al 2011 mishra et al 2012 panthou et al 2014 vittal et al 2016 ali and mishra 2017 for instance sub daily rainfall extremes in australia were found to exhibit both positive and negative scaling with temperature depending on the station s location and the duration of rainfall events herath and sarukkalige 2018 most precipitation temperature scaling studies have used maximum air temperature as the scaling variable ali and mishra 2017 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 gao et al 2020 however some studies suggest that surface air temperature alone is not a good predictor of rainfall extremes and prefer dpt as a scaling variable as it can exclude the effects of the humidity limitations panthou et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 in india the scaling relationship between precipitation extremes and dpt provides more robust results for the sensitivity of rainfall extremes under a warming climate compared to surface air temperature since convection largely contributes to precipitation lenderink et al 2011 ali mishra 2017 compared to daily rainfall extremes the scaling of sub daily rainfall extremes is even more difficult to assess due to the shortage of and inconsistency in observation records available at such finer temporal scale westra et al 2014 barbero et al 2017 lewis et al 2019 studies suggest that hourly or multi hourly rainfall variation with coincident temperature can exhibit a super cc relationship at higher and intermediate temperature ranges lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 lenderink et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 for instance lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 observed that at temperatures exceeding 12 c hourly precipitation extremes increased at a rate close to 14 c in large parts of europe hourly scaling rates were also found to be higher and twice the cc scaling rate in hong kong and the netherlands lenderink et al 2011 and varying between cc rate and super cc rate in austria schroeer kirchengast 2018 south korea park and min 2017 the usa mishra et al 2012 prein et al 2017 ali et al 2021a australia europe japan india and malaysia ali et al 2021a in china the scaling rate was found to be close to the cc rate at lower temperatures but was super cc rate at higher temperatures wang et al 2018 even triple the cc rates were observed for hourly precipitation events in australia guerreiro et al 2018 on the other hand some studies noted negative scaling relationships between precipitation extremes and surface air temperature which were attributed to local cooling or in storm effects which reduce the scaling rate ali and mishra 2017 bao et al 2017 in order to assess the risks related to urban floods or floods in steeper catchments with lower infiltration the relationship of sub daily precipitation extremes with temperature needs to be explored moreover it has been established that there was a shift in global climate around the 1970s gupta and chavan 2021 you and ting 2021 this has been observed in india in the form of a consistent rise in mean surface air temperature after 1975 kulkarni 2012 sahana et al 2015 observed a significant delay in the onset of summer monsoon in india due to changes in large scale circulation related to the regime shift during pre and post 1976 77 the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr was found to have decreased post 1976 which is attributed to a deficit in rainfall over the core monsoon zone in fact deficit in the monsoon rainfall became more frequent and excess in monsoon rainfall became less frequent during the post 1976 period kulkarni 2012 the frequency of short break spells and moderate active spells in the indian summer monsoon have increased over central india after 1977 singh 2013 dash and maity 2019 evaluated the spatio temporal trends of 11 precipitation based climate indices over india using daily precipitation data all the indices were found to show an increasing trend during post 1975 compared to pre 1975 the study showed an increase in short duration precipitation events rx1day over a larger area compared to long duration precipitation events rx5day further vittal et al 2016 noted an increase in the frequency of lower percentile precipitation post 1975 thus it is hypothesized that the scaling relationship of precipitation extremes with coincident temperature may have altered around the 1970s serving as the basis for this study previous evidence suggests that the rainfall temperature scaling relationship may have varied seasonally as observed in australia wasko and sharma 2014 and europe berg et al 2009 shaw et al 2011 and mishra et al 2012 since most regions in india receive about 70 80 of the annual rainfall during the monsoon kumar et al 2010 deshpande et al 2012 naidu et al 2017 the causal factors and behaviour of extreme rainfall events in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons differ this calls for a separate analysis of the temperature precipitation scaling for monsoon and non monsoon periods this study aims to address the following research questions i how far does the scaling relationship of sub daily precipitation extremes with temperature deviate from cc scaling across different climatic regimes in india ii were these scaling relationships altered in accordance with the global climate shift of the 1970s iii are the scaling relationships of monsoon rainfall extremes distinct from those of non monsoon extremes to answer these questions we conducted a pre and post climate shift analysis of hourly rainfall extremes with coincident temperature in 14 urban locations across india for monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons this paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents the study area and data used section 3 presents the detailed methodology section 4 enumerates the results and discussions and section 5 furnishes the summary and conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area a total of 14 locations across india were considered in this study their selection was done to provide a proper representation of different climatic regions across india the details of these locations are presented in fig 1 and summarised in table 1 the international airlines and airports iata acronyms are used to denote the names of the cities as per imd india has four climatological seasons winter january to february summer or pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to september and post monsoon october to december dash and maity 2019 the precipitation pattern in the country is strongly periodic and the monsoon season receives approximately 75 of the annual rainfall kumar et al 2010 deshpande et al 2012 naidu et al 2017 hence the study analyses the monsoon june july august and september hereafter jjas and non monsoon seasons all months other than jjas separately further since precipitation patterns experienced some changes post 1975 kulkarni 2012 singh 2013 vittal et al 2016 a separate analysis was conducted for monsoon and non monsoon seasons for the pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods 2 2 data gridded rainfall data with high temporal resolution hourly and spatial resolution 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude was used from era5 climate data store for the period 1951 2016 era5 is a fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis of global climate and weather dataset produced by copernicus climate change service c3s the data assimilation system used to produce era5 is ifs cycle 41r2 4d var hersbach et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 era5 reanalysis is a successor of era interim reanalysis and was initially available from 1979 to date the hourly preliminary back extension 1950 1978 was recently made available for public use it is well known that sub daily precipitation extremes in reanalysis data have limitations however alternative datasets like global summary of the day gsod climate prediction center morphing method cmorph and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm have greater limitations in terms of continuity and are mostly available at a daily scale rather than hourly scale moreover they are not available for long periods of time as was required in this study for the pre and post 1975 hourly analyses similar reasons have prompted other global scaling studies to use sub daily hourly precipitation data from reanalysis products such as era5 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021b era5 reanalysis rainfall data is known to perform well over india for the monsoon period compared to other reanalysis datasets such as global data assimilation forecasting system gdafs at ncmrwf ngfs singh et al 2021 era5 is also considered to be a better product for scaling studies ali et al 2021b hence era5 hourly precipitation data has been used in the present study as well moreover gridded daily 2 m dpt data from era5 was used in this study as it was found suitable for global scaling studies including in india moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021b ali mishra 2017 further the suitability of era5 s hourly precipitation data was checked with respect to the recently in 2020 publicly available developed regional reanalysis dataset indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa ashrit et al 2020 rani et al 2021 it provides hourly rainfall data with fine resolution 12 km 12 km for the indian region from 1979 to 2016 to compare era5 and imdaa data a scaling analysis was performed for kolkata ccu as an example using the regional reanalysis imdaa data however as imdaa data was not available before 1979 era5 data was considered for our analysis which examines pre 1975 and post 1975 scaling relationships although era5 air temperature data is also available to date surface air temperature data from imd was used in this study as it is derived from station observations the gridded daily maximum temperature at spatial resolution of 1 longitude 1 latitude was obtained from the archives of the national data centre at imd pune india for the period 1951 2016 the data is developed from 395 quality controlled stations and converted into gridded datasets using shepard s interpolation technique srivastava et al 2009 the imd dataset were downloaded from open access website http www imdpune gov in clim pred lrf new grided data download html maintained by the ministry of earth sciences government of india goi to generate some of the figures in this manuscript digital elevation model dem shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second global data was downloaded from united states geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros center through earthexplorer ee interface from its archive https earthexplorer usgs gov 3 methodology the downloaded rainfall and temperature datasets for all the locations were initially checked for quality the interpolation technique inverse distance weighting idw was applied to obtain the time series at the specific grid points of the required locations next a sequential mann kendall test or turning point analysis was performed on the precipitation extremes to check for change points in the time series for the period 1951 2016 results of the sequential mann kendall test have not been shown in the manuscript for the sake of brevity however a change point or turning point was observed for most of the cities during the 1970s in 1976 for ccu gau bom and bhubaneswar bbi in 1971 for aurangabad ixu in 1973 for ahmedabad amd in 1978 for bho and in 1979 for pnq hence 1975 was selected as a change point for a pre and post analysis while there are also records of climate shifts around 1998 ding et al 2013 lyon et al 2014 it was the global climate shift around 1975 that was prominently noted in many regions including india sahana et al 2015 chen et al 2018 dash and maity 2019 gupta and chavan 2021 you and ting 2021 hence it was decided to assess the change in scaling relationships for all the cities uniformly during the pre and post 1975 periods which is also supported by previous global and regional studies kulkarni 2012 vittal et al 2016 dash and maity 2019 3 1 scaling hourly precipitation extremes with temperature to compare with clausius clapeyron cc scaling rates for each location hourly precipitation p values greater than 0 3 mm recognized as wet hours in accordance with wet days lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 lenderink et al 2011 panthou et al 2014 were paired with the corresponding daily maximum temperature t as daily maximum temperature is most widely used for analysing scaling relationships ali and mishra 2017 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 herath and sarukkalige 2018 gao et al 2020 the same was followed in this study however daily or sub daily mean surface air temperature sat may also be used for analysing scaling relationships bao et al 2017 park and min 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 next the paired precipitation temperature data was sorted in ascending order of t and segregated into several bins each with a certain range of temperature interval this is known as the binning technique which is very widely used zhang et al 2017 ali et al 2018 herath and sarukkalige 2018 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021a a total of 15 bins were used and the median temperature in each bin was taken as its representative temperature fifteen bins were considered to be adequate for the analysis as some studies have used even fewer bins 10 bins barbero et al 2017 or 12 bins mishra et al 2012 wasko sharma 2014 bao et al 2017 ali et al 2021a within each bin the precipitation values were fitted to an empirical cumulative distribution function and the extreme precipitation 99th percentile pex was found for each representative temperature the logarithm of pex with median t was regressed to assess the scaling relationship of extreme rainfall with temperature wasko et al 2015 ali and mishra 2017 bao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the change in extreme precipitation from p 1 to p 2 with changes in temperature δ t was calculated thus 1 p 2 p 1 1 0 01 1 δ t where 1 c denotes the rate at which extreme precipitation changes with temperature which is often stated as the apparent scaling rate bao et al 2017 the regression slopes expressed as percentages were subsequently compared against the cc scaling rate of 6 8 k 1 3 2 probabilistic dependence of hourly precipitation extremes on temperature 3 2 1 marginal distribution of precipitation extremes and temperature among all the wet hours the precipitation values which were greater than the 99th percentile were considered as hourly precipitation extremes to assess their probabilistic dependence on daily maximum temperature the use of daily maximum temperature as the scaling variable rather than sub daily temperature in this study was based on the latest literature on scaling studies formayer and fritz 2016 ali and mishra 2017 park and min 2017 ali et al 2018 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021a the tendency of wetter hours to be associated with cooler daily maximum temperature due to local cooling after rain events will be reflected in this analysis as sub daily hourly precipitation extremes are of interest it is expected that wetter days and those with extreme daily precipitation can typically contribute to more of such hourly events in order to get the best fit marginal distribution of hourly precipitation extremes and daily maximum temperature for each location several probability distributions including gumbel gamma logistic weibull lognormal and skew exponential power distributions were fitted the best fit marginal distribution was selected based on akaike s information criterion aic values akaike 1974 and the worm plots of the residuals zhang et al 2015 kang et al 2019 the generalized additive models in location scale and shape gamlss framework was used to determine the parameters location scale and shape of the fitted marginals it allows the modelling of up to four parameters in a distribution family and has been used successfully in numerous hydrological studies to fit two parameter and three parameter distributions stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 villarini et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 debele et al 2017 the r package gamlss was used to fit the marginal distributions and select the best fit marginal 3 2 2 modelling joint probabilistic dependence of hourly precipitation extremes and temperature using bivariate copula the joint probabilistic distribution of hourly precipitation extremes and temperature was modelled through bivariate copulas a copula is a multivariate distribution c with uniformly distributed marginal u 0 1 on 0 1 according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 every multivariate distribution f with marginals f 1 x 1 f n x n could be written as 2 f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n for a n dimensional copula c equation 2 can be written as c u 1 u n f f 1 1 u 1 f n 1 u n where the f i 1 u i s are the inverse distribution functions of the marginals the joint density function f for a continuous f with strictly increasing continuous marginal densities f 1 f n is 3 f x 1 x n c 1 n f 1 x 1 f n x n f 1 x 1 f n x n for some uniquely identified n variate copula density c 1 n for the bivariate case eq 3 was reduced to 4 f x 1 x 2 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 where c 12 denotes the appropriate pair copula density for the pair of transformed variables f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 thus the conditional density function of the pair copula is given as 5 f x 1 x 2 c 12 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 1 x 1 and the conditional distribution function is given as 6 f x 1 x 2 c x 1 x 2 f x 1 f x 2 f x 2 the pair wise copula construction method aas et al 2009 was used in the analysis offering the flexibility to scale up to multivariate vine copulas if needed joe 1997 bedford and cooke 2002 genest and favre 2007 acar et al 2012 a total of 40 copulas were tested to describe the pair wise dependence structure of hourly extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature based on the lowest aic values the best copula was selected for all the locations the r package copula was used to implement the copula modelling and select the best fit copula 4 results and discussions 4 1 comparing the performance of era5 dataset and regional reanalyses imdaa to assess the suitability of era5 precipitation data a recently developed in 2020 and publicly available regional reanalysis dataset indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa was explored which provides hourly rainfall data with a fine resolution 12 km 12 km from 1979 to 2016 only for the indian region ashrit et al 2020 rani et al 2021 scaling analysis was performed for one location ccu as an example using the precipitation data from regional reanalysis dataset imdaa and era5 the scaling coefficients observed from imdaa hourly rainfall data were more or less in agreement with the era5 hourly rainfall dataset although the actual values were not very close the plots are shown in fig 2 a and b as imdaa data before 1979 is not available era5 data was suitable for our analysis to examine pre 1975 and post 1975 scaling relationships 4 2 scaling of hourly extreme precipitation with coincident temperature as mentioned earlier the scaling relationships of hourly extreme precipitation pex with daily maximum temperature t in the selected cities were analysed for the pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods the monsoon and non monsoon periods were analysed separately the comparison with cc scaling is shown in fig 3 and summarized in table 2 to understand the scaling results more clearly information about p values and coefficient of determination r2 of the regression coefficients are provided separately in the table along with the scaling coefficient the statistically significant at 5 level of significance scaling rates are in bold to study scaling behaviour across different climatic regions the 14 selected locations were grouped into different climatic zones regions following ali and mishra 2017 bho nag gau and lko were grouped under humid subtropical zone bbi maa ccu and trz under tropical wet and dry zone bom pnq and ixu under tropical wet zone jai under arid zones and amd and del under semi arid zones in our analysis we observed a wide range of scaling behaviour close to cc rate 6 7 c negative scaling as well as positive super cc scaling in the humid subtropical region scaling rate varied from 2 7 to 7 5 c and 0 4 to 10 2 c in the monsoon and non monsoon seasons respectively except in gau with 1 61 c during pre 1975 in the monsoon season in the tropical wet and dry zone the scaling rate varied from 0 3 to 4 5 c in the monsoon season and from 2 3 to 11 4 c in the non monsoon season except in trz in the tropical wet zone the scaling rate varied from 1 to 8 8 c in the monsoon season and from 0 28 to 14 6 c in the non monsoon season except in pnq in the arid zone the scaling range was from 5 to 5 8 c in the monsoon season and 1 6 to 1 7 c in the non monsoon season in the semi arid zone the scaling rate varied from 4 8 to 12 5 c in the monsoon season while both negative and positive scaling rates were observed in the non monsoon season thus the scaling relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature is not always consistent with the cc rate and fluctuates considerably among regions and seasons as noted in earlier studies berg et al 2009 utsumi et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 a negative scaling rate was mostly observed over tropical regions tropical wet tropical wet and dry and humid subtropical this is consistent with the study of ali et al 2018 and ali and mishra 2017 in which a majority of stations showed negative cc rate median 3 2 k with t the negative scaling rate in tropical regions could be attributed to variations in humidity and soil conditions at higher temperatures lenderink et al 2011 bao et al 2017 ali et al 2018 in tropical and sub tropical regions with an increase in precipitation events there was an increase in local cooling which reduces the temperature thus extreme precipitation events move to the lower temperature bins which reduces the scaling rate bao et al 2017 ali et al 2018 barbero et al 2018 gao et al 2020 thus negative scaling rate may be the result of temporary cooling effect wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 or due to limitations of atmospheric moisture at higher temperatures zhang et al 2017 herath and sarukkalige 2018 barbero et al 2018 gao et al 2018 on the other hand super cc scaling rates may be observed due to a transition between large scale stratiform low temperatures and convective storm types high temperatures berg and haerter 2013 it was observed that monsoon scaling was negative everywhere it was positive only in pnq about 3 c and trz 0 3 c during 1976 2016 in fact at pnq the scaling coefficient changed from 3 1 pre 1975 to 3 2 post 1975 this may have been due to the possible alteration in the type of extreme rainfall events experienced over time extreme precipitation may result from localized intense convective events or be driven by the wide movement of moisture from distant sources where temperatures are quite different from the local temperature zhang et al 2017 the formation of deep convections complex topographical features and the influence of large scale hydroclimatic teleconnections on rainfall patterns make scaling relationships more complex in tropical belts moustakis et al 2020 at a few cities such as bho jai and bom during the monsoon season the scaling coefficient was comparable in magnitude but opposite in direction to the cc scaling rate in most of these locations the coefficient value slightly decreased after the 1975 climate shift at amd the magnitude of the scaling coefficient was largest at 12 which is opposite in sign and almost twice the cc rate this is in contrast to previous studies where steeper scaling rates have been reported to be of positive sign and are often the result of excess latent heat released during intense short duration rainfall loriaux etal 2013 it may be noted that in ixu bho maa pnq del and nagpur nag in the monsoon season and amd bbi bom lucknow lko ccu jai and gau in the non monsoon season the values in neighbouring temperature bins were very scattered so the variation was large and a peaking nature was observed amd bho gau jai lko nag del such a peaking nature has been reported in scaling studies worldwide hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 mishra et al 2012 park min 2017 wang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 indicating that all scaling relationships are not always linear in fact the relationship of extreme precipitation with temperature is examined further in the copula based analysis presented in section 4 5 however for most cities the scaling relationship is more or less linear so the linear regression as done conventionally fits well 4 3 scaling of hourly precipitation extremes with coincident dpt the scaling relationship of hourly extreme precipitation pex with daily dew point temperature dpt for the pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods in six selected cities was analysed separately for the monsoon and non monsoon seasons for the remaining cities the era5 dpt values were found to be unexpected and unreliable for scaling analysis the comparison against cc scaling is shown in fig 4 and summarized in table 3 it may be observed from table 3 that with dpt as the scaling variable significant positive super cc scaling was quite recurrent in maa gau and trz monsoon pre 1975 maa non monsoon pre 1975 trz monsoon post 1975 and gau and bom non monsoon post 1975 stronger super cc scaling coefficient was observed in some of the locations when using dpt compared to maximum air temperature which is in line with previous findings moustakis et al 2020 specifically non monsoon scaling was found positive everywhere with maa being strongly positive during pre 1975 31 and post 1975 15 periods monsoon scaling showed negative relationship in both pre and post 1975 for bbi and ccu positive scaling was observed for maa gau and trz in both pre and post 1975 periods in both monsoon and non monsoon seasons most locations bbi in pre and post 1975 gau and bom in pre 1975 non monsoon maa and gau in post 1975 monsoon followed the cc rate 6 7 c while super cc rates were attained in both pre and post 1975 for maa 15 31 c in non monsoon and trz 14 18 c in monsoon seasons negative scaling coefficient was observed in bbi 7 12 c and ccu 3 5 c in both pre and post 1975 and in bom 1 for the pre 1975 monsoon season in bom the scaling coefficient for monsoon was lower than that for the non monsoon season when maximum temperature was used as a scaling variable however it was the opposite in the case of dpt for bbi gau ccu and bom for monsoon scaling in both pre and post 1975 the regression line is clustered at the higher end of the dpt and the relationship is not really linear fig 4 a similar observation was reported using maximum surface air temperature as the scaling variable the range of dpt corresponding to hourly precipitation extremes in monsoon was quite small compared to those in non monsoon extremes for these aforementioned locations the sample points in the different bins were scattered in the monsoon season unlike in the non monsoon season to describe the scaling results in a more concise and clear manner table 4 shows a comparison of our main findings vis à vis observations from previous studies along with possible mechanisms 4 4 seasonal pex t relationships pre and post 1975 fig 5 shows the maximum temperature corresponding to the rainy days with extreme precipitation 99th percentile for both monsoon and non monsoon months during the pre 1975 and post 1975 periods the magenta pre 1975 and red post 1975 colours represents monsoon season whereas cyan pre 1975 and blue post 1975 color represents the non monsoon season web version of the paper may be referred for the color legends it can be observed that there is a shift in the median temperature associated with the 99th percentile rainfall after 1975 for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons in the non monsoon months the shift is most predominant for bhopal bho ahmedabad amd bhubaneswar bbi and nagpur nag the range of temperature values associated with monsoon extremes is much smaller compared to those of non monsoon extremes except for the cities guwahati gau mumbai bom and pune pnq in chennai maa kolkata ccu guwahati gau and new delhi del the median temperature associated with extremes are similar across both seasons in contrast in jaipur jai and lucknow lko the median temperature value associated with non monsoon extremes was much lower than that in the monsoon season the range of temperature values associated with non monsoon extremes was however much wider only two cities bom and pnq both located in western india had substantially higher median temperatures for non monsoon extremes compared to monsoon extremes it can be seen from fig 6 a that for the monsoon months pnq bom gau nag and ccu were the locations far away from the 45 line indicating that the scaling rate was altered considerably after 1975 for the non monsoon months fig 6b amd ixu bom maa gau and pnq were the locations for which the scaling rate altered after 1975 4 5 probabilistic dependence of hourly precipitation extremes with coincident temperature the joint bivariate distribution of hourly precipitation extremes with daily maximum temperature t was developed and the conditional distribution of pex given t 25 c and t 35 c for both monsoon and non monsoon months are shown in figs 7 and 8 for pre 1975 and post 1975 periods it may be noted that the temperature range varies much beyond t 25 c and t 35 c for many of the locations particularly jai and lko for these two locations as the frequency of extreme rainfall events is the highest around 30 c during the monsoon season see histograms fig 7a d additional cdf plots fig 7e and f were included at an intermediate t 30 c however to keep the pre and post 1975 analysis uniform for all locations and to provide a brief summary of the varying cdfs conditioned on temperature only two temperature values t 25 c and t 35 c were selected for further analysis across all the locations the cdfs for some of the selected locations are shown here in the main manuscript others may be found in the supplementary document fig s1 in all the figures the dotted lines in blue green and red show the cdf pre 1975 whereas the solid lines in blue green and red show the cdf post 1975 at jaipur post 1975 the non exceedance probability of pex given t 25 c is located below those corresponding to t 25 c and 30 c i e p pex pex t 35 p pex pex t 30 p pex pex t 25 in the case of lko it was observed that the non exceedance probability of a certain value of pex given t 35 c was located above those corresponding to t 25 c and 30 c i e p pex pex t 25 p pex pex t 30 p pex pex t 35 in both pre and post 1975 this suggests that on an average heavier rainfall events occur at 25 c compared to 30 c and 35 c this observation is in contrast to the findings of sharma and mujumdar 2019 in the mahanadi basin in south central india in bom fig 8a the shape of the cdf given t 35 c i e p p e x p e x t 35 is very different from pre 1975 compared to all the other three cdfs of the monsoon season the median rainfall ranges from 0 to 3 mm for all the four cases in the monsoon season for most locations including bom fig 8a c and g it was observed that the non exceedance probability of a certain value of pex given t 35 c are located above those corresponding to t 25 c i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 in both pre and post 1975 periods and the median value of pex increased with a decrease in the conditioning variable t in bom in the non monsoon months fig 8b pre 1975 p p e x p e x t 35 p p e x p e x t 25 however the opposite was observed post 1975 i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 thus the nature of dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature had shifted post 1975 in bom fig 8a and b in del fig 8c and d in the monsoon season the nature of the cdf was similar pre and post 1975 i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 however in the non monsoon season the nature of dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature was in contrast i e p p e x p e x t 35 p p e x p e x t 25 this association was also observed in bbi in non monsoon months fig 8f this is in contrast to most of the locations for monsoon season nag maa bho amd bom del and trz where the non exceedance probability of a certain value of pex given higher values of t was located above those corresponding to lower values of t i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 for both the periods and seasons in bbi fig 8e and f it was also notable that the median rainfall corresponding to t 25 c and 35 c was low around 3 mm in monsoon months but substantially high in non monsoon months around 5 mm post 1975 in trz fig 8g and h show that the median value of pex conditioned on both temperatures in the monsoon season was around 3 mm pre 1975 but much higher up to 7 mm post 1975 in non monsoon months the median rainfall remained 2 5 mm both pre and post 1975 it may be noted that this study has some limitations it is based on point locations and the scaling rates could be higher than those obtained by performing the analysis on data pooled over a climatic zone the influence of local dynamics can produce higher scaling rates which may be averaged out resulting in lower scaling rates when the data is pooled ali et al 2021a on the other hand the underestimation of storm types occupying different temperature ranges can lead to an underestimation of the scaling rates moustakis et al 2020 this limits the suitability of coarse reanalyses datasets in scaling analysis hence from this perspective the use of era5 datasets in this study may have produced lower than actual scaling rates this uncertainty in results is greater for regions experiencing strong convection which is affected by the local topography moustakis et al 2020 further there are very few studies addressing the influence of different precipitation types on scaling relationships and specifically the role of convective precipitation in scaling relationships however park and min 2017 studied patterns of temperature and extreme precipitation scaling over south korea and observed that the scaling coefficient changed from cc rate to super cc rate for total and stratiform precipitation extremes and convective extreme precipitation respectively 5 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the scaling relationship of hourly extreme precipitation with daily maximum temperature t and dew point temperature dpt in selected cities across different climatic regimes of india for pre 1975 1951 1975 and post 1975 1976 2016 periods results of the analysis suggest that scaling coefficient of sub daily monsoon rainfall extremes was negative in all the cities in the study except pune where it was positive about 3 c during 1976 2016 the negative scaling rates noted in most locations were in agreement with earlier studies of tropical regions including india hardwick jones et al 2010 vittal et al 2016 ali mishra 2017 moustakis et al 2020 ali et al 2021a this may be attributed to cooling as a result of antecedent rainfall hence scaling relationships with temperatures of preceding days may be explored in future studies the scaling of non monsoon rainfall extremes with temperature was found to be mildly positive almost everywhere and approximately equal to the cc scaling rate both pre and post 1975 for the non monsoon season a considerable negative scaling was observed only in pune in some cases the scaling coefficients were large in magnitude but not statistically significant bom with t pre and post 1975 non monsoon bbi maa and trz with dpt post 1975 non monsoon and bom with dpt post 1975 monsoon this indicates that the linear regression line does not fit well and the relationship between t and log p is rather non linear however for some regions the linear fit was remarkably suitable for bbi r2 0 74 using t as the scaling variable and ccu r2 0 60 pre 1975 in the non monsoon season after 1975 a similar inference holds good for bbi and gau in the non monsoon season r2 0 65 and for amd r2 0 63 in the monsoon season seasonal pex t relationships for pre and post 1975 analyses indicate that there is an increase in the median temperature in bhubaneswar mumbai jaipur lucknow and pune associated with 99th percentile rainfall post 1975 for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons it was observed that the non exceedance probability of a certain value of rainfall extreme given higher values of t are higher compared to lower values of t i e p p e x p e x t 25 p p e x p e x t 35 for most of the locations throughout the periods of the study however some cities like new delhi exhibited an opposite relationship especially for non monsoon rainfall extremes results of the dpt analysis indicate a stronger super cc scaling coefficient for some of the locations compared to using maximum air temperature which aligns with previous findings moustakis et al 2020 positive and super cc scaling was observed for the monsoon season in some locations and for the non monsoon season in a few locations despite the limitations of hourly data available from reanalysis datasets this study paves the way for an understanding of the regional and seasonal distribution of hourly hydrologic extremes in india key to planning infrastructure development in urban india the study can be spatially extended to represent all topographical and climatic variations by incorporating more cities covering the entire country moreover it would be interesting to temporally extend the analysis into the future incorporating 21st century climate projections through coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 global climate models gcms

control strategies that integrate pre disaster prevention in disaster scheduling and post disaster reconstruction in view of the many deficiencies in current flood disaster resilience research in terms of uncertainty measurement dynamic regulation and management decision making a new method for the analysis of the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision making based on the fuzzy mathematical theory improved bayesian belief network bbn is proposed a case study was conducted in 15 state owned farms under the jurisdiction of the jiansanjiang branch in heilongjiang province china the model predicts the resilience level with missing indicators a diagnostic analysis of the correlation between indicators and resilience improvement and a sensitivity analysis of the dynamic evaluation of the importance of indicators are performed and fuzzy decisions are made to quantify different decision making schemes the results show that when a single indicator is missing the prediction accuracy exceeds 80 however the lack of economic indicators has a substantial impact on the results and the accuracy is reduced to 63 3 indicating that economic indicators are the key dimension affecting the evaluation of flood disaster resilience levels in the study area which also provides a focus for previous data collection efforts the diagnostic analysis constructs an index sequence to guide the improvement in resilience in which the water surface rate and rainfall are the most direct driving forces affecting resilience on this basis the differences in the driving forces of each farm are further analyzed in detail sensitivity analysis shows that rainfall per capita gdp and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery are the indicators that occur most frequently among the top three sensitivity indicators of all farms the 859 farm chuangye farm and nongjiang farm are typical farms with a high sensitivity to rainfall and economic indicators fuzzy decision making takes the comprehensive grade score of implementation motivation as a quantitative evaluation criterion which provides guidance for decision making based on the two

request 1 introduction floods are major natural disasters that cannot be ignored in the development of human society due to their many inducing factors their strong suddenness their high frequency and their wide range of influence according to statistics from 2001 to 2018 the frequency of floods among various natural disasters in the world was as high as 48 6 resulting in a cumulative economic loss of 5 000 108 us dollars and 3 470 deaths perera et al 2019 in recent years climate change has led to the frequent occurrence of extreme rainfall events increasing the probability of floods and posing an enormous threat to the safety of people s lives and property goodarzi et al 2019a goodarzi et al 2019b at the annual meeting of the world economic forum in january 2020 experts released a list of risks for the next 10 years with issues such as extreme weather major natural disasters and the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation topping the list yamamoto et al 2021 the rising trend of flood disasters cannot be alleviated in the short term and there is now an urgent need for human society to seek optimal flood disaster response measures and realize the harmonious development of humans and water holling 1973 applied resilience theory to ecosystem research in the 1970 s and defined resilience as the resilience of an ecosystem that is the ability to restore the original state after being affected by ecological disturbance factors in the past flood prevention and control schemes separated the affected body from the entire disaster system and their prevention and control effects were often limited aerts et al 2018 the emergence of flood disaster resilience theory compensates for this defect it comprehensively considers pre disaster prevention in disaster scheduling and post disaster reconstruction at the same time combined with the correlation analysis of local natural economic and political factors flood prevention and control plans are three dimensional and comprehensive and the effect of flood disaster prevention and control is significantly improved luo et al 2021 the theory of flood disaster resilience has attracted increasing attention from the public therefore building a set of driving mechanism analyses and management decision making systems aimed at flood disaster resilience and integrating multidomain factors is the preferred choice for effective flood prevention and control and the harmonious development of humans and water at present research on flood disaster resilience is divided into qualitative and quantitative directions qualitatively driessen et al 2018 and o donnell et al 2020 have developed a variety of governance schemes and strategies to guide the improvement of flood disaster resilience schelfaut et al 2011 proposed a comprehensive risk management approach that takes economic factors into account and applies the concept of flood resilience to practice o sullivan et al 2012 examined the importance of information and explored the impact of information penetration on flood resilience quantitatively there is a significant difference between studies that do and do not apply a model in terms of nonmodel studies keating et al 2017 restemeyer et al 2015 and adedeji et al 2018 established a variety of flood disaster resilience heuristic frameworks deepening the understanding of the concept of flood disaster resilience and helping guide the construction of flood disaster resilience evaluation systems campbell et al 2019 used the internet and mobile devices to collect and evaluate data analyze the baseline of flood disaster resilience and delineate resilience levels similar to qualitative analysis flood disaster resilience studies without models are characterized by strong subjectivity contingency and weak applicability therefore it is difficult to comprehensively calculate and assess the impact of flood disasters thus the use of models to study flood disaster resilience is indispensable in terms of studies utilizing a model liu et al 2019 used r clustering for index screening kotzee reyers 2016 used principal component analysis pca to screen indicators and constructed a comprehensive resilience index liu et al 2020 used the driving forces pressure state impact response dpsir method to build an index evaluation system david et al 2017 constructed a sociohydrological model that incorporates institutions and groups into its consideration of flood disaster resilience orencio and fujii 2013 and moghadas et al 2019 used the analytic hierarchy process to evaluate the level of flood disaster resilience liu et al 2021 constructed a model based on elite opposition based selfish herd optimizer support vector regression eo sho svr used this model to evaluate resilience to regional flood disasters and described the differences in resilience in time and space however current research is often limited to static management and control focusing on the screening of resilience indicators the establishment of evaluation systems and the weight analysis of influencing factors the constructed models perform poorly in controlling key factors in real time and guiding decision making planning in addition due to the large space time span complex factor correlation and high uncertainty in resilience theory the causal relationship between associated nodes is difficult to distinguish which poses severe challenges to factor analysis dynamic diagnosis and macrocontrol finding a model that can analyze the quantitative relationship between flood disaster resilience and various factors is key to solving the problems above huang et al 2021 took urban floods as the research object constructed a flood inundation risk assessment model based on a bayesian belief network bbn analyzed the key disaster causing factor chain of urban floods quantitatively analyzed the causes of risks and provided a reference for early risk warning wu et al 2020 combined ontology and the bbn to evaluate the flood disaster risk in zhengzhou reducing the subjectivity brought by the construction of cause and effect diagrams based on the experience and knowledge of experts abebe et al 2018 proposed a flood vulnerability assessment model based on a geographical information system gis and a bbn to diagnose floods in different areas of the city of toronto to explain the reasons for changes in the frequency of floods and to predict the flood vulnerability index fvi the bbn model has obvious advantages in analyzing the quantitative relationship between the evaluation results and factors accordingly this study relies on the characteristics of the bbn to combine probability theory and graph theory to quantify the uncertainty of factors with probability uses the joint probability to reveal the correlation between different constraints and performs a dynamic multiperspective analysis of flood disaster resilience goodarzi et al 2019a goodarzi et al 2019b the bbn has excellent scalability and adaptability to emergent problems if new data or influencing factors are included in a study the bbn can adjust the structure and import new data at any time without having to remodel forio et al 2020 the evaluation result of the traditional bbn for different decisions is the probability distribution of flood disaster resilience levels since it is difficult to set the evaluation criteria for decision making comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different decisions is difficult on this basis the core idea of this study is to introduce fuzzy mathematical theory quantify the final evaluation results and provide a basis for management decision making by constructing an indicator of implementation motivation the position of flood disaster resilience and the protection of life and property safety are considered as a whole and the parameter settings of indicators are optimized by means of a genetic algorithm in the comprehensive evaluation the uncertainty introduced by the boundary between grades is reduced by the membership function so that the final evaluation is more systematic and the evaluation structure is more objective on the basis of the characteristics of bbn which is good at analyzing the complex nonlinear relationship between various indicators this approach can realize a deep exploration of the mechanism of flood disaster resilience construction based on the previous rating open up new perspectives for flood control construction and finally provide detailed and comprehensive guidance on decision making schemes this study combines the bbn and fuzzy mathematical theory to analyze the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and to provide guidance for management decision making the specific research objectives are as follows 1 based on the good compatibility of the bbn model with uncertainty the resilience level of flood disasters with missing index data is predicted and the resilience evaluation mechanism is explored 2 the bbn model is used to conduct dynamic multiperspective analysis and the mechanism of flood disaster resilience construction is revealed through diagnostic analysis and sensitivity analysis 3 a decision support system with implementation motivation as the evaluation criterion is built a genetic algorithm is used to avoid the introduction of expert subjectivity in the construction of this indicator and a membership function is used to reduce the uncertainty of the level boundary to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the decision making scheme 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the jiansanjiang branch of beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd is located on the sanjiang plain in the area where the wusuli river heilongjiang river and songhua river converge the geographical coordinates are between 46 49 48 12 north latitude and 132 31 134 32 east longitude and the area has a cold temperate monsoon climate with its flat terrain fertile land and rich resources the region is famous for producing green and high quality rice thus it is reputed to be china s green rice capital the jurisdiction is divided into 15 farms as shown in fig 1 the total area of the jurisdiction is 123 47 104 hm2 of which the cultivated land area is 78 99 104 hm2 the total amount of water resources is 25 77 108 m3 and the average amount of water resources per hectare of cultivated land is 2 070 m3 the annual rainfall is approximately 550 600 mm mainly concentrated in the summer and autumn seasons the rainfall from july to september alone accounts for half of the annual total the six plain swampy rivers in the jurisdiction all share the common characteristics of narrow and curved riverbeds in the lower reaches and it is very easy for water to accumulate and cause flood disasters during the flood season in recent years to increase production and vigorously promote rice cultivation most of the dry fields of the jiansanjiang branch have been transformed into paddy fields to cope with the problem of increasing water demand farmers have built their own water diversion projects the equipment often does not have matching flood control facilities and targeted post maintenance which increases the hidden danger of flooding the annual grain output of the jiansanjiang branch accounts for 12 23 of the national total constituting the ballast stone of china s food security therefore it is necessary to study the flood disaster resilience evaluation and regulation of the jiansanjiang branch 2 2 data sources the basic data come from china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd based on the classification and calculation of the heilongjiang reclamation area statistical yearbook 1998 2019 jiansanjiang agricultural reclamation yearbook 2017 2019 jiansanjiang administration water conservancy comprehensive annual report 1997 2016 and jiansanjiang agricultural reclamation statistical yearbook 1997 2016 22 year indicator data for the 15 farms in terms of the natural environment social environment and economy were obtained on this basis using previous research results on flood disaster recovery assessment eo sho svr was used to obtain 22 year resilience rating data for the 15 farms liu et al 2021 3 methodology 3 1 construction of the indicator system no unified criterion exists for selecting flood disaster resilience indicators and resilience reveals a comprehensive prevention and control strategy involving multiple fields referring to previous studies hu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 this paper selects 9 indicators covering the natural environment social environment and economy to analyze the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision making the organizational structure is shown in fig 2 and the definitions and descriptions of the indicators are shown in table 1 3 2 principle of the bbn the core theoretical basis of the bbn is that individuals have subjective a priori judgments about the world but these judgments are revised as individuals gradually gain knowledge about the world to maintain an open attitude toward the world cheng greiner 2001 morris 1983 the bayesian school believes that event probability p z is a random variable and it proposes a way of thinking about understanding information 1 p z q o b t a i n p z q where p z is the prior distribution which represents the initial understanding q obtain is the new information acquired during the process p z q is the posterior distribution which represents the revised cognition after gaining knowledge the bbn model combines probability theory with graph theory uses a directed acyclic graph dag to reveal the structure of the problem and then uses a conditional probability table cpt to quantify the dependencies between nodes hsu 2004 park cho 2012 its basic structure is shown in fig 3 the joint probability is constructed using all the nodes of the research object then the joint probability is expressed as follows through the chain rule and the total probability formula 2 p f m o b s p f p m f p s f b where f m o b s is the node set of the research object even if a problem as simple as that shown in fig 3 involves only 5 nodes assuming that each node variable has only 2 states its joint probability must calculate 2n 1 n 5 different probability values when the number of nodes n increases further the workload of data processing and calculation will be very large and the bbn will determine the distribution of each parameter through learning unless an enormous amount of data is provided to estimate the probability of these parameters the model is prone to underfitting which is very unfavorable for application purposes to reduce the complexity the bbn model proposes two assumptions the conditional independence assumption and the local probability assumption 1 the conditional independence assumption uses the d separation criterion to judge the independence between nodes if all paths from x to y are blocked the situation shown in fig 4 then x and y are said to be separated by z that is x and y are independent of the z condition geiger et al 1990 neal 2000 2 the local probability assumption specifies that a node is affected only by its parent node a node variable can be regarded as a random function of its parent node revealing the nature of the variable s dependence on its parent node based on the above assumptions and the chain rule the joint probability formula can be obtained as follows qazi et al 2018 sakib et al 2021 3 p f m o b s p f p m p o f m p b m p s o where the conditional probability is constructed based on the causal relationship from this generalization the joint probability formula of the bbn can be obtained as follows qazi et al 2018 sakib et al 2021 4 p k p k 1 k 2 k n i n p k i r k i where k k1 k2 kn represents the set of all node variables in the causal graph r ki is the set of parent nodes of ki 3 3 bbn structure construction bbn structure construction is based on dag design a dag consists of nodes and lines with one way arrows between them a dag is fast to build and has excellent scalability as a one way and unclosed graph structure it is very suitable for characterizing the correlation between research objects in the case of excluding the influence of other interfering factors simply relying on the causal relationship between objects to establish a network diagram a dag can be effectively applied to the identification of key factors tennant et al 2021 the methods are divided into two categories manual network structure design and automatic network structure design manual design relies on the experience and expertise of experts to analyze the causal relationship between nodes to build a network graph the tail of the arrow tail connects to the cause object and the arrow points to the result object this dag structure can clearly represent the logical relationships between nodes but the structure depends on the judgment of experts and has strong subjectivity the automatic network structure relies on powerful computing power and selects the dag with the highest score based on the selected network evaluation criteria and structure search rules the judging criteria are divided into two categories bayesian scoring and constrained evaluation the essence of bayesian scoring is to pursue maximization of the posterior probability that is to maximize the value of formula 5 cooper herskovits 1992 heckerman et al 1995 constrained evaluation is based on the independent testing of training data first building an undirected structure and then relying on the independence between nodes to build a dag verma pearl 2022 the connecting arrows of the dag constructed in this way no longer rely on the causal relationship in the objective world rather they rely on the dependence of the data between the nodes in the case of high uncertainty constrained evaluation has better accuracy but is not conducive to causal analysis 5 log p c r log p c log p r g where c is the network topology and r is the given sample set an important goal of this research is diagnostic reasoning thus automatic network structures are clearly inappropriate to overcome the strong subjectivity of the manual network structure the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between 9 indicators formula 6 pan et al 2021 an appropriate threshold was selected and the indicator pairs larger than the threshold were selected to establish a correlation relationship through causal logic analysis determine the arrow points and build the final dag this procedure not only ensures that the network maps the logical relationship of real problems but also reduces subjectivity to a certain extent 6 s pq k 1 n p k p q k q k 1 n p k p 2 k 1 n q k q 2 where p and q are the index data sets for the correlation calculation and p and q are the index averages respectively 3 4 bbn inference the bbn has powerful reasoning functions that can perform operations such as prediction causal reasoning and diagnostic analysis arroyo figueroa sucar 2013 ellis wong 2008 khanafer et al 2008 after constructing the causal analysis graph and importing the prior probability of the root node and the cpt of the leaf node the probability distribution of each leaf node can be obtained by marginalizing the other nodes the formula is as follows 7 p k i m p k 1 k 2 k n where m 1 2 i 1 i 1 n and p ki represents the probability distribution of node ki logical inference ability is an important feature of the bbn model after the values of some node variables are given the probability distribution of the value of the target node can be quantitatively given even when there is a certain lack of data and high uncertainty the model makes highly accurate predictions sun et al 2006 the core idea is to use the posterior probability the formula is as follows 8 p k i t p k i p t k i p t where t is the set of nodes that provide variable values and p ki t represents the probability distribution of ki nodes under known evidence 3 5 bbn sensitivity analysis the causal analysis diagram shows that the target node and multiple other nodes are related to each other the contribution of each node to the target object is different the importance of related nodes to the target node can be dynamically analyzed using sensitivity analysis which plays an important role in key factor analysis laskey 1995 since the posterior probability varies with the parent node variable sensitivity analysis is usually conducted using the birnbaum measure bm castillo et al 1997 li et al 2019 the formula is as follows 9 bm f j 1 2 max p t i f j p t i p t i p t i min p t i f j p t i where t is the sensitive target node and ti i 1 2 m is the value of the node variable f is the sensitivity measurement node and fj j 1 2 n is the value of the node variable 3 6 fuzzy mathematical decision optimization when using the bbn model for decision support after giving the value of each index node the result is the probability distribution of the value of the target node research on flood disaster resilience gives only the probability distribution of flood disaster resilience levels and it is difficult for decision makers to choose among different schemes moreover the focus of flood disaster resilience is a region s comprehensive prevention and control capability with regard to flood disasters which is not entirely consistent with the position of policymakers as the manager of a region the local government must prioritize the safety of people s lives and property its purpose is to serve people and it takes the interests of people as the starting point of its work therefore for the jiansanjiang branch this paper uses flood resilience regional population and regional gdp to construct a judgment indicator i e implementation momentum formula 10 which comprehensively considers flood disaster resilience population and the economy it provides guidelines for decision makers to make choices 10 imp n r p p min p max p min w p e e min e max e min w e where p is the regional population e is the gross farm product w is the importance score r is the resilience rating and n is the confidence level the value of n is selected based on the degree of trust of the decision maker and n 0 8 in this study for the value of the importance of population and gdp the r index is introduced into the consideration range the r index reflects the mismatch between the degree of economic agglomeration and the degree of population agglomeration in a region and its value is close to 1 in mature economic regions blanchard fischer 1989 by jointly considering the r index and importance levels wp and we the evaluation function is constructed the formula is as follows 11 min gd p j g d p p o p j p o p w p w e 2 s t w p w e 10 w p 0 w e 0 where gdpj and popj are the economic scale and population scale of the jiansanjiang branch respectively gdp and pop are the national economic size and population size respectively the total focus of policymakers on population and the economy is quantified as 10 the genetic algorithm was first proposed in the 1970s to search for optimal solutions by simulating natural selection and the genetic mechanism of darwin s theory of evolution after years of development the algorithm has become very mature and stable and has been widely used in machine learning adaptive control and signal processing katoch et al 2021 when solving combinatorial optimization problems better optimization results can be obtained quickly compared with the traditional algorithm that iteratively seeks the optimal solution from a single initial value the genetic algorithm starts the search from a string set which is conducive to global optimization and avoids obtaining local optimal solutions lambora et al 2019 the algorithm has a small information requirement for the research problem and has a strong fault tolerant ability which makes it a good choice for the calculation of formula 11 based on the 22 year data status of the 15 farms in this study the size of the population is set to 5000 the maximum number of iterations is 200 the crossover probability and mutation probability are 0 9 and 0 001 respectively and the precision of the function variable is 10 7 the final result is wp 5 47 and we 4 53 deterministic mathematical theory makes judgments in terms of yes and no or 0 and 1 therefore it is not suitable for solving this practical problem thus fuzzy mathematical theory is a good way to address the uncertainty in the boundaries of different levels of implementation motivation arqub et al 2017 by constructing a membership function implementation motivation is mapped to the 0 1 interval which is used to judge the degree of membership in different levels of implementation motivation thereby reducing the uncertainty of level judgment bezdek 1973 jiang et al 2009 to achieve a more accurate level division of implementation motivation based on the data characteristics and previous research experience the k th parabolic membership function is selected for operation k 2 and the formulas are shown in 12 13 and 14 compared with triangle and trapezoid membership functions the k th parabolic membership function emphasizes the contribution of the main interval more and weakens the contribution of the boundary interval jain sharma 2020 which is very consistent with the viewpoint of this study 12 l x 1 x χ δ x δ χ 2 χ x δ 0 δ x 13 l x x α β α 2 α x β 1 β x χ δ x δ χ 2 χ x δ 0 x α o r δ x 14 l x 0 x α x α β α 2 α x β 1 β x the membership function structure selected in this paper is shown in fig 5 where β and χ are the upper and lower critical values with a membership degree of 1 and α and δ are the upper and lower critical values with a membership degree of 0 finally the probability value determined by the bbn model is used as the value weight and the final score is obtained via fuzzy comprehensive evaluation cheng tao 2010 jiang et al 2009 the formula is as follows 15 c i 1 m λ i j 1 n l ij s j where c represents the comprehensive grade score λi represents the probability value corresponding to resilience level i lij represents the degree of membership of resilience level i in implementation motivation level j and sj represents the score of implementation motivation level j 3 7 research process framework this study uses python to implement the model through which prediction with missing indicators diagnostic reasoning and sensitivity analysis on the resilience of the fifteen farms of the jiansanjiang branch are conducted fuzzy mathematical theory is introduced to quantify the implementation motivation to provide guidance for decision makers in regard to management decisions between different farms the improvement process of the bnn based on fuzzy mathematical theory and the analysis process of flood disaster resilience data using the improved model are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure this research can be divided into three parts preliminary preparation model building and data analysis the specific steps are as follows step 1 establish the flood disaster resilience index system step 2 collect and organize the data of the selected indicators and use the natural discontinuity method to divide the index level step 3 conduct correlation analysis and causal logic analysis between indicators to construct a dag step 4 establish the implementation motivation indicator through formula 10 determine the importance of population and the economy through formula 11 and the genetic algorithm and use membership functions 12 13 14 to introduce fuzzy mathematical concepts into the evaluation system formula 15 is used to build the final decision evaluation system step 5 build an optimized bbn model and import the data to complete the preparatory work for driving mechanism analysis and management decision making step 6 use formulas 7 and 8 to perform prediction with missing indicators and diagnosis analysis of flood disaster resilience step 7 conduct sensitivity analysis on the 15 farms through formulas 8 and 9 step 8 quantify the decision making scheme by virtue of the established decision making evaluation system and conduct a quantitative comparison step 9 use the analysis results to guide the construction of farm flood control management step 10 in practice test whether the approach meets expectations of the analysis of the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience if it does go to step 11 otherwise repeat steps 1 9 step 11 end 4 results and analysis 4 1 dag construction pearson correlation coefficient analysis was performed on the selected 22 year data and the results are shown in fig 7 considering the limitation of the data volume if there are too many causal relationships among the 9 indicators the complexity of the network graph will be excessive and the existing data volume will not be able to support the subsequent data analysis to reduce the complexity of the network graph a strong restriction is imposed on all nodes in combination with the characteristics of the data that is each node cannot establish more than 3 associations therefore the threshold is chosen to be 0 36 that is nodes with s 0 36 or s 0 36 build causal relationships the indicator pairs that meet the requirements are deep forest coverage and rainfall rainfall and land average flood control investment gdp per capita and per capita output of grain land average flood control investment and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery and the per capita output of grain and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery causal analysis is then conducted and the final constructed dag is shown in fig 8 4 2 discretization of indicators at this stage the bbn is mainly used to address discrete probability thus the value of each indicator should be divided into a limited number of categories han coulibaly 2017 in this study the natural breaks method was selected to discretize the data this method selects the turning points in the data so that the data within the group have a high level of similarity and the differences between groups are large chen et al 2013 fariza et al 2017 this is the first step in model construction and it is also a crucial step for ensuring the accuracy of the model the specific classification results are shown in table 2 4 3 key points of bbn construction the designed dag and the data on the 15 farms are input into the model and the final results are shown in fig 9 the main points of model construction are as follows ankan and panda 2015 marcot et al 2006 1 regarding the method of parameter estimation pgmpy provides maximum likelihood estimation variable estimation and bayesian estimation among them maximum likelihood estimation and variable estimation are simple and convenient when considering a large amount of data but there is the problem of overfitting in this study it is very common to have missing data for earlier years and some nodes correspond to multiple parent nodes which will cause serious data dispersion thus these two parameter estimation methods are not suitable for this study bayesian estimation provides a pseudostate giving each node an equal prior distribution before processing the data avoiding extreme judgments making judgments conservative and alleviating the problem of overfitting 2 for the missing part in the original data mumpy is used additionally nan is used to replace the missing data formulas 4 and 8 show that the bbn has high compatibility with missing data and uncertainty 3 after the dag is built the causal correctness correlation and independence of the nodes must be checked and special attention must be paid to not having a ring structure for nodes that manually input the cpt the correctness of probability and statistical accounting must be ensured and the cpt must be consistent with the parent node 4 4 driving mechanism analysis and management decisions 4 4 1 prediction with missing indicators based on the 22 year data of 15 farms in jiansanjiang branch a total of 330 sets of resilience rating data were obtained seventy percent of the data are used to construct the training set and the other 30 are used as the test set since the data of each farm are collected in the order of the time axis the test set selects 90 sets of data in 6 years i e 1999 2003 2007 2010 2015 and 2018 and the other 240 sets of data are used as training data the prediction result is compared with the resilience level of the original data to judge the correctness of the prediction the accuracy of the prediction results is 90 to study the performance of the bbn in the absence of data this paper removes one of the 9 indicators for testing each time the absence of natural conditions has the least impact on the prediction when the water surface rate forest coverage rate and rainfall are missing the prediction accuracy is 84 85 5 and 88 9 respectively the absence of social environmental indicators has the second weakest impact after excluding the number of doctors per 10 000 people the proportion of water conservancy investment and land average flood control investment the accuracy is 82 1 84 4 and 83 3 respectively even for the economic indicators that have the greatest impact on accuracy an accuracy of more than 80 can be guaranteed in the absence of any single indicator further analysis of missing data was conducted and the three categories of indicators were eliminated in the absence of natural and social environment indicators the model can still ensure good prediction accuracy of 74 4 and 71 1 respectively in the absence of the economic category the prediction accuracy drops significantly to 63 3 detailed results are shown in fig 10 therefore the bbn can perform prediction with missing indicator data in the 22 year data for each farm the fluctuation of natural resources is small the disturbance to the evaluation of flood resilience is small and the impact of its absence is also small when making predictions with rapid social development the economic indicators change every year and their influence weights in forecasting are also relatively large to address the unavoidable practical problem of missing data for the early years the bbn model can ensure the smooth progress of resilience research with missing data and it provides a solution to the problem of missing data the prediction of the bbn with missing data also provides a reference for the focus of data collation and determines the priority of data collection in the case of limited personnel and time the priority sequence can ensure the efficiency of data collection work 4 4 2 diagnostic analysis diagnostic reasoning uses the bbn model to calculate the probability distribution of each cause under the condition of a given outcome regarding the flood disaster resilience of the jiansanjiang branch this study first sets the goal to pursue and then conducts reverse reasoning and analysis to find the largest possible cause of the goal then the index is used as a new result for the next round of analysis after layers of cycles the analysis of all indicators is completed first flood disaster resilience p f 5 1 is substituted into the bbn model the results show that the probability of the water surface rate p r 1 or r 2 0 3675 and the probability of rainfall p w 4 or w 5 0 3346 are the highest probability values among all indicators therefore the water surface rate and rainfall are the most direct drivers of flood resilience and are a priority for regional optimization which is consistent with the findings of other researchers chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 the water surface rate reflects the flood storage capacity of the area in the event of a flood in recent years to achieve growth in the value of agricultural output the jiansanjiang branch has increased the development of wasteland especially the conversion of wetlands to cultivated land which will seriously reduce the water surface rate and damage the flood storage capacity thereby affecting the flood disaster resilience of the region from 1998 to 2018 the arable land area of the jiansanjiang branch doubled and the water surface area decreased by 1 969 hm2 however directly implementing the policy of returning farmland is unrealistic first the primary industry of the jiansanjiang branch accounts for 60 of the total social output value and it is its economic lifeline second an overly decisive land policy would infringe upon the interests of a vast number of farmers which would cause dissatisfaction among the farmers and disputes over cultivated land would also lead to social instability therefore the government s work should focus on the management and control of cultivated land development such as formulating development guidelines and strictly implementing the approval process furthermore the government should carry out arable land reform in a targeted manner and gradually rectify unreasonable arable land for example illegal cultivation between the riverbed and the embankment is not compliant and greatly affects the water surface rate the government can take this issue as the first step for rectification for rainfall as an indicator the focus should be on increasing the emphasis on extreme rainfall zhang et al 2018 we must excel in the preparation of flood control plans the scheduling of flood season personnel and the detection and maintenance of flood control equipment and we must implement a policy of early preparation rapid response and orderly action the second step is to substitute p f 5 w 5 r 1 1 as the result into the bbn model and the per capita output of grain probability is p g 4 or g 5 0 2101 which is the most important driving force then the per capita output of grain is taken as the result and brought into the bbn model based on the steps above the main driving force diagnosed is gradually set as the known condition for the iterative operation finally an index sequence can be assembled based on the strength of the driving force as shown in fig 11 the driving forces ranking 3 to 5 are the per capita output of grain gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery economic indicators are the most important driving force after the natural environment especially in the environment where the economy of the jiansanjiang branch maintains steady growth year by year economic indicators are an effective means of building resilience to flood disasters gu et al 2019 the index sequence reveals the strong and weak relationships between the 9 indicators and the improvement of flood disaster resilience provides the priorities for resilience construction and can guide the planning and regulation of the construction of the jiansanjiang branch on this basis diagnostic reasoning refined to each farm is conducted to identify the differences and spatial distribution of the driving force of each farm fig 11 shows that most of the farms and the jiansanjiang branch have the same macrodiagnostic reasoning with natural indicators as the most direct driving force for three farms i e qindeli daxing and hongwei two of the top three driving forces are natural indicators the top three driving forces for qianshao are all natural force indicators which reflects the strong priority of natural indicators in the construction of flood resilience the five farms in the central part of the jiansanjiang branch are driven by economic indicators as the most direct driving force yalvhe is the most typical farm among them and the top three driving forces are all economic indicators the distribution of farms with economic indicators as the most direct driving force is concentrated reflecting a relatively clear regional distribution law 4 4 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis identifies the importance of each indicator by quantifying the degree of impact of each indicator on flood disaster resilience starting from the cause on the basis of historical data the focus is on the disturbance of a change in a single index to flood disaster resilience and the sensitivity of each index to different farms is calculated based on formula 9 to conduct a dynamic evaluation of sensitive factors by virtue of the formula s accurate discrimination of the change in resilience precise data analysis can be performed the data on the 15 farms in the jiansanjiang branch are substituted into the bbn and a model for each farm is established as shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows that rainfall is the most important indicator and cannot be ignored in the entire jiansanjiang region its sensitivity ranks among the top three among 10 farms which shows the importance of rainfall in regulating resilience to flood disasters in the jiansanjiang branch this result is followed by gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery which are in the top three for 9 farms and even the last indicator in the economic category the per capita output of grain which ranks relatively high among various farms economic construction is an important means of enhancing flood disaster resilience existing research also shows that economic factors directly affect flooding lin et al 2016 liu et al 2017 regardless of the flood threat or post disaster reconstruction areas with high economic levels have sufficient material reserves to handle a crisis for example 859 farm chuangye and nongjiang are typical representatives of this situation however some farms have significantly different indicator sensitivities revealing differences in the key factors among these farms qindeli has the highest sensitivity to land average flood control investment and the number of doctors per 10 000 people qianfeng has the highest sensitivity to the proportion of water conservancy investment and land average flood control investment qianshao has the highest sensitivity to forest coverage and the proportion of water conservancy investment when regulating these farms the resource tilt should be adjusted based on the level of sensitivity and the construction investment of high sensitivity indicators should be appropriately increased to achieve a more efficient flood disaster resilience improvement however a low sensitivity indicator does not necessarily mean that it is not important for flood resilience taking qianshao as an example we find that the sensitivity of this farm to the per capita output of grain is low which is in sharp contrast to the high sensitivity of other farms to the per capita output of grain additionally from the previous diagnostic analysis the per capita output of grain and the flood disaster resilience construction of the entire jiansanjiang branch are very strongly correlated observing the 22 year data on qianshao we see that its per capita output of grain shows little change which cannot provide a sufficient disturbance to qianshao s flood disaster resilience finally the sensitivity calculated by formula 9 is low therefore when using sensitivity to analyze the key factors of flood disaster resilience the results must be viewed dialectically high sensitivity indicators must receive attention but low sensitivity indicators should be judged based on whether the original data are single 4 4 4 fuzzy decisions the bbn model has the function of decision support simulating various decisions in the decision making stage in view of the existing conditions of a farm decision makers can make various assumptions on the basis of flood disaster resilience the optimized bbn model introduces implementation motivation as an indicator and takes personal and property safety which decision makers are more concerned with as the foundation the implementation motivation scores of different flood disaster resilience levels of each farm are calculated and the natural discontinuity method is used to divide them into five levels based on previous experience and professional knowledge each grade is scored then implementation motivation and the membership function are combined to construct the final evaluation system the results are shown in table 3 eight farms namely qixing qindeli daxing qianjin qianshao qianfeng honghe and nongjiang with low flood disaster resilience are selected as planning objects taking 2018 as the status quo year and 2023 and 2028 as the planning years the decision making assumptions are as follows decision 1 a commitment is made to build the core functional area of modern agriculture based on the reclamation area and to develop the modern planting industry and deep processing industry the planting structure will be optimized the irrigation coefficient of farmland will be regulated the wasteland in the reclamation area will be rationally developed and a planting industrialization system will be built the goal of increasing grain production capacity will drive regional economic development achieve an increase of 10 t person in per capita grain output every 5 years and an increase of 2 104 yuan in per capita gdp every 5 years and improve the construction of flood disaster resilience from an economic perspective decision 2 starting from ensuring farm water security and food security and vigorously developing water conservancy for people s livelihood the construction of water conservancy projects will be strengthened in view of the weak disaster resistance of farmland with the aim of improving water conservancy infrastructure and supporting facilities it is proposed to increase the proportion of water conservancy investment by 3 every 5 years and to increase the investment of 220 yuan hm2 in land average waterlogging prevention fees every 5 years to build flood disaster resilience from the perspective of the social environment the details of the specific decision making plan are shown in table 4 based on each indicator level in 2018 the model is run after level adjustment based on table 4 the comprehensive grade score of each farm is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 in the scenario simulation for the 8 selected farms both decision 1 and decision 2 have a positive impact on flood control in 2023 the comprehensive grade scores of decision 1 and decision 2 increase by a similar rate 2 57 and 2 64 respectively which means that the improvement effects on flood prevention and control are similar in 2028 the increase in the comprehensive grade score of decision 1 is significantly higher than that of decision 2 i e 7 48 and 5 62 respectively that is the flood control effect of decision 1 is better than that of decision 2 for different farms the two decisions are significantly different decision 1 is the most effective for qianjin while for qianfeng the prevention and control effect is weakly improved after the first 5 year plan but significantly improved after the second 5 year plan decision 2 works best for qianfeng both decision 1 and decision 2 have little effect on flood control in nongjiang for each farm there are also significant differences in the effects of the two decisions in 2023 decision 1 is better than decision 2 for qianjin while the opposite is true for qianfeng and the flood control effect of both decisions is similar for the other 6 farms in 2028 for qixing and qianjin decision 1 is better than decision 2 in particular decision 1 significantly improves the flood prevention and control of qianjin by contrast decision 2 is better than decision 1 for qindeli and qianfeng 5 discussion in the field of flood disaster resilience research in view of the current situation of limited research progress on the complex nonlinear relationship between various indicators especially for an environment full of uncertainties the selection of the bbn model for research has strong applicability and fit and it can be used to analyze the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience from multiple perspectives the bbn model is used to study the impact weight construction driving force and sensitivity factors of the evaluation indicators of flood disaster resilience and to gradually explore the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience 1 bbn model features in the current research on flood disaster resilience evaluation support vector machines random deep forests and projection pursuit have achieved good results however these models are highly sensitive to missing data chen et al 2020 which impacts flood disaster resilience theory bbn can solve this problem and is an effective means to promote the development of this theory the first step in the construction of the bbn is to build a dag based on the causal analysis between each node which ensures good compatibility between the model and the research problem in previous key factor research of the jiansanjiang branch liu et al 2021 analyzed the importance of the natural environment and economy to resilience and liu et al 2020 focused on the impact of economic development on resilience the qualitative conclusions of the above research are generally consistent with this research but the identification of key factors is performed via weight analysis which is a static method the core principle is the contribution rate of each index to the assessment of resilience that is the horizontal comparison between the indexes the sensitivity analysis of bbn is a dynamic key factor identification method it identifies key factors from the perspective of the disturbance of the factors to the target it not only performs the key analysis between the indicators but also quantitatively depicts the effect of each indicator on the improvement of resilience moreover this study further refines the identification of key factors to farm units and conducts more detailed and targeted research the model itself also has certain limitations and it is not good at dynamic analysis in the direction of the time axis the accuracy of data analysis is affected mainly by the quality of the data and how to improve the resolution of the data will be the focus of follow up research the complexity of the dag is limited by the amount of data collected with the deepening of research on the correlation of indicators the density of data collection in space and the frequency of collection in time must be increased 2 bbn model optimization regarding the decision making function of the traditional bnn only the probability distribution of flood disaster resilience is given and it cannot be well applied to the evaluation of different decision making schemes first it is not easy to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different probability distributions second flood disaster resilience and the decision maker s position on alternatives are not unified therefore the implementation motivation indicator is constructed and flood disaster resilience population and the economy are considered together so that the evaluation angle is more in line with the manager s position furthermore a single numerical value is used to quantify different decision making schemes which can provide a reliable basis for the comparison of different decisions since the construction of the implementation motivation indicator will introduce uncertainty if it is not controlled it will affect the accuracy of the evaluation between different schemes højberg and refsgaard 2005 xia 2001 in response to this problem this paper has conducted a series of optimizations when constructing the implementation motivation indicator there is no clear criterion for the setting of the importance of population and the economy which is often determined by the knowledge and experience of experts thus it is limited by the knowledge structure and individual cognition of experts and subjective factors are included in the model which is not conducive to an objective and accurate judgment this paper establishes a simultaneous equation of importance and the r index takes into account the national macroeconomy and population and establishes constraints through the incompatibility of regional economic agglomeration and population agglomeration using the excellent search ability of the genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution within the value range and relying on the powerful computing power of a computer prevents the intervention of subjective factors from ever occurring the delineation of the implementation motivation indicator grade boundary introduces considerable uncertainty into the grade assessment which affects the rationality of decision making this paper introduces fuzzy number theory into the final evaluation selects the type of membership function based on the characteristics of the data uses the membership function to reduce the uncertainty of the boundary conducts a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and eliminates the uncertainty introduced when constructing the implementation motivation indicator making the decision evaluation more objective 3 flood disaster resilience construction path selection during the period studied from the perspective of the jiansanjiang branch flood disaster resilience showed an upward trend the growth rate was slow in the early stage and it accelerated substantially starting in 2008 however the growth rate slowed in 2015 and individual farms even showed a downward trend in the level of resilience combining the driving force analysis and the basic data of the indicators we see that the most direct driving forces are the water surface rate and rainfall but the changes in the research period are small and it is difficult to affect the construction of flood disaster resilience economic indicators are the next most important driving force observing the basic data we see that from 2005 to 2015 the per capita output of grain and gdp per capita grew steadily from 2015 to 2018 these two indicators leveled off and even declined for individual farms the improvement in flood disaster resilience of the jiansanjiang branch depends mainly on economic growth since the jiansanjiang branch is mainly engaged in the production and processing of agricultural products and has a single economic structure there are hidden dangers behind the steadily improving resilience to flood disasters and the decline in resilience of individual farms is affected by bottlenecks in economic development however eliminating hidden dangers by optimizing the economic system is unrealistic the status quo of jiansanjiang branch construction based on agricultural production is determined by natural conditions agriculture is its advantage and holds great significance for the country s food strategy deployment therefore the construction of flood disaster resilience must start from the natural and social environments from a long term perspective the natural environment holds decisive significance for enhancing flood disaster resilience but for the current stage the solution to hidden dangers must start from the construction of the social environment for the construction of the social environment sensitivity analysis and planning can be combined and high sensitivity indicators can achieve a greater level of flood disaster resilience improvement through lower investment through the scenario simulation in fuzzy decision making decision 2 carefully describes the impact of the proportion of water conservancy investment and land average flood control investment on the flood disaster resilience of each farm for high sensitivity farms key construction can be performed while for low sensitivity farms such as nongjiang and honghe the resilience index system should be enriched for more in depth research 6 conclusion with the aim of analyzing the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision making 22 years of data for 15 farms under the jurisdiction of the jiansanjiang branch were selected as the research object and the bbn model was used for the corresponding analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was adopted to reduce the subjectivity of the dag the implementation motivation indicator was constructed to guide decision making and the uncertainty of the boundary was reduced by incorporating fuzzy mathematical theory 1 when predicting flood resilience levels this study focuses on the predictive ability with missing data the lack of a single indicator has little effect on prediction accuracy and an accuracy of more than 80 can be guaranteed if the natural environment category and social environment category are missing the prediction accuracy is still 74 4 and 71 1 respectively however if economic indicators are missing the prediction accuracy will drop significantly to 63 3 which shows the importance of economic indicators for predicting resilience levels missing prediction ensures the smooth progress of research with incomplete data and provides guidance for the focus of data collection 2 diagnostic analysis of the jiansanjiang branch found that rainfall and the water surface rate are the most direct driving forces affecting flood disaster resilience and they are also the focus of jiansanjiang branch s work to improve flood disaster resilience these driving forces are followed by three indicators i e the per capita output of grain gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery which reflect the importance of economic construction for flood disaster resilience diagnostic analysis obtains an index sequence through reverse logical reasoning which can reduce the blindness of regulation and correctly guide the improvement of flood disaster resilience on this basis a detailed diagnosis of each farm was conducted commonalities were summarized and differences were identified there are clear regularities in the types of driving forces for the improvement of flood disaster resilience for the five farms in the central region economic indicators are the most direct driving force while for the surrounding farms natural indicators are the most direct driving force among them the yalu river and qianshao are typical representatives of these two categories 3 sensitivity analysis was separately performed on each farm to identify the sensitive factors of each farm for 10 of the farms the top three factors were rainfall followed by gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery most of the farms in the jiansanjiang branch are highly sensitive to rainfall and economic indicators the 859 farm chuangye farm and nongjiang farms are typical representatives of this type however some farms such as qindeli qianfeng and qianshao have distinct differences in sensitivities increasing the emphasis on high sensitivity indicators and the targeted construction of each farm will help improve the efficiency of flood disaster resilience 4 in terms of decision support this study is based on flood disaster resilience introduces the position of decision makers takes the safety of life and property into account and takes the comprehensive grade score of implementation motivation as the final basis of judgment a comprehensive comparison of different decisions is made through the differences in the comprehensive grade scores across time and space between farms credit authorship contribution statement dong liu conceptualization methodology tianyu sun writing review editing deping liu software validation qiang fu conceptualization

was handled by jiri simunek editor in chief with the assistance of zaher mundher yaseen associate editor flood disaster resilience management and decision making are comprehensive prevention and control strategies that integrate pre disaster prevention in disaster scheduling and post disaster reconstruction in view of the many deficiencies in current flood disaster resilience research in terms of uncertainty measurement dynamic regulation and management decision making a new method for the analysis of the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision making based on the fuzzy mathematical theory improved bayesian belief network bbn is proposed a case study was conducted in 15 state owned farms under the jurisdiction of the jiansanjiang branch in heilongjiang province china the model predicts the resilience level with missing indicators a diagnostic analysis of the correlation between indicators and resilience improvement and a sensitivity analysis of the dynamic evaluation of the importance of indicators are performed and fuzzy decisions are made to quantify different decision making schemes the results show that when a single indicator is missing the prediction accuracy exceeds 80 however the lack of economic indicators has a substantial impact on the results and the accuracy is reduced to 63 3 indicating that economic indicators are the key dimension affecting the evaluation of flood disaster resilience levels in the study area which also provides a focus for previous data collection efforts the diagnostic analysis constructs an index sequence to guide the improvement in resilience in which the water surface rate and rainfall are the most direct driving forces affecting resilience on this basis the differences in the driving forces of each farm are further analyzed in detail sensitivity analysis shows that rainfall per capita gdp and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery are the indicators that occur most frequently among the top three sensitivity indicators of all farms the 859 farm chuangye farm and nongjiang farm are typical farms with a high sensitivity to rainfall and economic indicators fuzzy decision making takes the comprehensive grade score of implementation motivation as a quantitative evaluation criterion which provides guidance for decision making based on the two dimensions of time and space keywords bayesian belief network fuzzy mathematics flood disaster resilience driving mechanisms management decisions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are major natural disasters that cannot be ignored in the development of human society due to their many inducing factors their strong suddenness their high frequency and their wide range of influence according to statistics from 2001 to 2018 the frequency of floods among various natural disasters in the world was as high as 48 6 resulting in a cumulative economic loss of 5 000 108 us dollars and 3 470 deaths perera et al 2019 in recent years climate change has led to the frequent occurrence of extreme rainfall events increasing the probability of floods and posing an enormous threat to the safety of people s lives and property goodarzi et al 2019a goodarzi et al 2019b at the annual meeting of the world economic forum in january 2020 experts released a list of risks for the next 10 years with issues such as extreme weather major natural disasters and the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation topping the list yamamoto et al 2021 the rising trend of flood disasters cannot be alleviated in the short term and there is now an urgent need for human society to seek optimal flood disaster response measures and realize the harmonious development of humans and water holling 1973 applied resilience theory to ecosystem research in the 1970 s and defined resilience as the resilience of an ecosystem that is the ability to restore the original state after being affected by ecological disturbance factors in the past flood prevention and control schemes separated the affected body from the entire disaster system and their prevention and control effects were often limited aerts et al 2018 the emergence of flood disaster resilience theory compensates for this defect it comprehensively considers pre disaster prevention in disaster scheduling and post disaster reconstruction at the same time combined with the correlation analysis of local natural economic and political factors flood prevention and control plans are three dimensional and comprehensive and the effect of flood disaster prevention and control is significantly improved luo et al 2021 the theory of flood disaster resilience has attracted increasing attention from the public therefore building a set of driving mechanism analyses and management decision making systems aimed at flood disaster resilience and integrating multidomain factors is the preferred choice for effective flood prevention and control and the harmonious development of humans and water at present research on flood disaster resilience is divided into qualitative and quantitative directions qualitatively driessen et al 2018 and o donnell et al 2020 have developed a variety of governance schemes and strategies to guide the improvement of flood disaster resilience schelfaut et al 2011 proposed a comprehensive risk management approach that takes economic factors into account and applies the concept of flood resilience to practice o sullivan et al 2012 examined the importance of information and explored the impact of information penetration on flood resilience quantitatively there is a significant difference between studies that do and do not apply a model in terms of nonmodel studies keating et al 2017 restemeyer et al 2015 and adedeji et al 2018 established a variety of flood disaster resilience heuristic frameworks deepening the understanding of the concept of flood disaster resilience and helping guide the construction of flood disaster resilience evaluation systems campbell et al 2019 used the internet and mobile devices to collect and evaluate data analyze the baseline of flood disaster resilience and delineate resilience levels similar to qualitative analysis flood disaster resilience studies without models are characterized by strong subjectivity contingency and weak applicability therefore it is difficult to comprehensively calculate and assess the impact of flood disasters thus the use of models to study flood disaster resilience is indispensable in terms of studies utilizing a model liu et al 2019 used r clustering for index screening kotzee reyers 2016 used principal component analysis pca to screen indicators and constructed a comprehensive resilience index liu et al 2020 used the driving forces pressure state impact response dpsir method to build an index evaluation system david et al 2017 constructed a sociohydrological model that incorporates institutions and groups into its consideration of flood disaster resilience orencio and fujii 2013 and moghadas et al 2019 used the analytic hierarchy process to evaluate the level of flood disaster resilience liu et al 2021 constructed a model based on elite opposition based selfish herd optimizer support vector regression eo sho svr used this model to evaluate resilience to regional flood disasters and described the differences in resilience in time and space however current research is often limited to static management and control focusing on the screening of resilience indicators the establishment of evaluation systems and the weight analysis of influencing factors the constructed models perform poorly in controlling key factors in real time and guiding decision making planning in addition due to the large space time span complex factor correlation and high uncertainty in resilience theory the causal relationship between associated nodes is difficult to distinguish which poses severe challenges to factor analysis dynamic diagnosis and macrocontrol finding a model that can analyze the quantitative relationship between flood disaster resilience and various factors is key to solving the problems above huang et al 2021 took urban floods as the research object constructed a flood inundation risk assessment model based on a bayesian belief network bbn analyzed the key disaster causing factor chain of urban floods quantitatively analyzed the causes of risks and provided a reference for early risk warning wu et al 2020 combined ontology and the bbn to evaluate the flood disaster risk in zhengzhou reducing the subjectivity brought by the construction of cause and effect diagrams based on the experience and knowledge of experts abebe et al 2018 proposed a flood vulnerability assessment model based on a geographical information system gis and a bbn to diagnose floods in different areas of the city of toronto to explain the reasons for changes in the frequency of floods and to predict the flood vulnerability index fvi the bbn model has obvious advantages in analyzing the quantitative relationship between the evaluation results and factors accordingly this study relies on the characteristics of the bbn to combine probability theory and graph theory to quantify the uncertainty of factors with probability uses the joint probability to reveal the correlation between different constraints and performs a dynamic multiperspective analysis of flood disaster resilience goodarzi et al 2019a goodarzi et al 2019b the bbn has excellent scalability and adaptability to emergent problems if new data or influencing factors are included in a study the bbn can adjust the structure and import new data at any time without having to remodel forio et al 2020 the evaluation result of the traditional bbn for different decisions is the probability distribution of flood disaster resilience levels since it is difficult to set the evaluation criteria for decision making comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different decisions is difficult on this basis the core idea of this study is to introduce fuzzy mathematical theory quantify the final evaluation results and provide a basis for management decision making by constructing an indicator of implementation motivation the position of flood disaster resilience and the protection of life and property safety are considered as a whole and the parameter settings of indicators are optimized by means of a genetic algorithm in the comprehensive evaluation the uncertainty introduced by the boundary between grades is reduced by the membership function so that the final evaluation is more systematic and the evaluation structure is more objective on the basis of the characteristics of bbn which is good at analyzing the complex nonlinear relationship between various indicators this approach can realize a deep exploration of the mechanism of flood disaster resilience construction based on the previous rating open up new perspectives for flood control construction and finally provide detailed and comprehensive guidance on decision making schemes this study combines the bbn and fuzzy mathematical theory to analyze the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and to provide guidance for management decision making the specific research objectives are as follows 1 based on the good compatibility of the bbn model with uncertainty the resilience level of flood disasters with missing index data is predicted and the resilience evaluation mechanism is explored 2 the bbn model is used to conduct dynamic multiperspective analysis and the mechanism of flood disaster resilience construction is revealed through diagnostic analysis and sensitivity analysis 3 a decision support system with implementation motivation as the evaluation criterion is built a genetic algorithm is used to avoid the introduction of expert subjectivity in the construction of this indicator and a membership function is used to reduce the uncertainty of the level boundary to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the decision making scheme 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the jiansanjiang branch of beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd is located on the sanjiang plain in the area where the wusuli river heilongjiang river and songhua river converge the geographical coordinates are between 46 49 48 12 north latitude and 132 31 134 32 east longitude and the area has a cold temperate monsoon climate with its flat terrain fertile land and rich resources the region is famous for producing green and high quality rice thus it is reputed to be china s green rice capital the jurisdiction is divided into 15 farms as shown in fig 1 the total area of the jurisdiction is 123 47 104 hm2 of which the cultivated land area is 78 99 104 hm2 the total amount of water resources is 25 77 108 m3 and the average amount of water resources per hectare of cultivated land is 2 070 m3 the annual rainfall is approximately 550 600 mm mainly concentrated in the summer and autumn seasons the rainfall from july to september alone accounts for half of the annual total the six plain swampy rivers in the jurisdiction all share the common characteristics of narrow and curved riverbeds in the lower reaches and it is very easy for water to accumulate and cause flood disasters during the flood season in recent years to increase production and vigorously promote rice cultivation most of the dry fields of the jiansanjiang branch have been transformed into paddy fields to cope with the problem of increasing water demand farmers have built their own water diversion projects the equipment often does not have matching flood control facilities and targeted post maintenance which increases the hidden danger of flooding the annual grain output of the jiansanjiang branch accounts for 12 23 of the national total constituting the ballast stone of china s food security therefore it is necessary to study the flood disaster resilience evaluation and regulation of the jiansanjiang branch 2 2 data sources the basic data come from china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd based on the classification and calculation of the heilongjiang reclamation area statistical yearbook 1998 2019 jiansanjiang agricultural reclamation yearbook 2017 2019 jiansanjiang administration water conservancy comprehensive annual report 1997 2016 and jiansanjiang agricultural reclamation statistical yearbook 1997 2016 22 year indicator data for the 15 farms in terms of the natural environment social environment and economy were obtained on this basis using previous research results on flood disaster recovery assessment eo sho svr was used to obtain 22 year resilience rating data for the 15 farms liu et al 2021 3 methodology 3 1 construction of the indicator system no unified criterion exists for selecting flood disaster resilience indicators and resilience reveals a comprehensive prevention and control strategy involving multiple fields referring to previous studies hu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 this paper selects 9 indicators covering the natural environment social environment and economy to analyze the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision making the organizational structure is shown in fig 2 and the definitions and descriptions of the indicators are shown in table 1 3 2 principle of the bbn the core theoretical basis of the bbn is that individuals have subjective a priori judgments about the world but these judgments are revised as individuals gradually gain knowledge about the world to maintain an open attitude toward the world cheng greiner 2001 morris 1983 the bayesian school believes that event probability p z is a random variable and it proposes a way of thinking about understanding information 1 p z q o b t a i n p z q where p z is the prior distribution which represents the initial understanding q obtain is the new information acquired during the process p z q is the posterior distribution which represents the revised cognition after gaining knowledge the bbn model combines probability theory with graph theory uses a directed acyclic graph dag to reveal the structure of the problem and then uses a conditional probability table cpt to quantify the dependencies between nodes hsu 2004 park cho 2012 its basic structure is shown in fig 3 the joint probability is constructed using all the nodes of the research object then the joint probability is expressed as follows through the chain rule and the total probability formula 2 p f m o b s p f p m f p s f b where f m o b s is the node set of the research object even if a problem as simple as that shown in fig 3 involves only 5 nodes assuming that each node variable has only 2 states its joint probability must calculate 2n 1 n 5 different probability values when the number of nodes n increases further the workload of data processing and calculation will be very large and the bbn will determine the distribution of each parameter through learning unless an enormous amount of data is provided to estimate the probability of these parameters the model is prone to underfitting which is very unfavorable for application purposes to reduce the complexity the bbn model proposes two assumptions the conditional independence assumption and the local probability assumption 1 the conditional independence assumption uses the d separation criterion to judge the independence between nodes if all paths from x to y are blocked the situation shown in fig 4 then x and y are said to be separated by z that is x and y are independent of the z condition geiger et al 1990 neal 2000 2 the local probability assumption specifies that a node is affected only by its parent node a node variable can be regarded as a random function of its parent node revealing the nature of the variable s dependence on its parent node based on the above assumptions and the chain rule the joint probability formula can be obtained as follows qazi et al 2018 sakib et al 2021 3 p f m o b s p f p m p o f m p b m p s o where the conditional probability is constructed based on the causal relationship from this generalization the joint probability formula of the bbn can be obtained as follows qazi et al 2018 sakib et al 2021 4 p k p k 1 k 2 k n i n p k i r k i where k k1 k2 kn represents the set of all node variables in the causal graph r ki is the set of parent nodes of ki 3 3 bbn structure construction bbn structure construction is based on dag design a dag consists of nodes and lines with one way arrows between them a dag is fast to build and has excellent scalability as a one way and unclosed graph structure it is very suitable for characterizing the correlation between research objects in the case of excluding the influence of other interfering factors simply relying on the causal relationship between objects to establish a network diagram a dag can be effectively applied to the identification of key factors tennant et al 2021 the methods are divided into two categories manual network structure design and automatic network structure design manual design relies on the experience and expertise of experts to analyze the causal relationship between nodes to build a network graph the tail of the arrow tail connects to the cause object and the arrow points to the result object this dag structure can clearly represent the logical relationships between nodes but the structure depends on the judgment of experts and has strong subjectivity the automatic network structure relies on powerful computing power and selects the dag with the highest score based on the selected network evaluation criteria and structure search rules the judging criteria are divided into two categories bayesian scoring and constrained evaluation the essence of bayesian scoring is to pursue maximization of the posterior probability that is to maximize the value of formula 5 cooper herskovits 1992 heckerman et al 1995 constrained evaluation is based on the independent testing of training data first building an undirected structure and then relying on the independence between nodes to build a dag verma pearl 2022 the connecting arrows of the dag constructed in this way no longer rely on the causal relationship in the objective world rather they rely on the dependence of the data between the nodes in the case of high uncertainty constrained evaluation has better accuracy but is not conducive to causal analysis 5 log p c r log p c log p r g where c is the network topology and r is the given sample set an important goal of this research is diagnostic reasoning thus automatic network structures are clearly inappropriate to overcome the strong subjectivity of the manual network structure the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between 9 indicators formula 6 pan et al 2021 an appropriate threshold was selected and the indicator pairs larger than the threshold were selected to establish a correlation relationship through causal logic analysis determine the arrow points and build the final dag this procedure not only ensures that the network maps the logical relationship of real problems but also reduces subjectivity to a certain extent 6 s pq k 1 n p k p q k q k 1 n p k p 2 k 1 n q k q 2 where p and q are the index data sets for the correlation calculation and p and q are the index averages respectively 3 4 bbn inference the bbn has powerful reasoning functions that can perform operations such as prediction causal reasoning and diagnostic analysis arroyo figueroa sucar 2013 ellis wong 2008 khanafer et al 2008 after constructing the causal analysis graph and importing the prior probability of the root node and the cpt of the leaf node the probability distribution of each leaf node can be obtained by marginalizing the other nodes the formula is as follows 7 p k i m p k 1 k 2 k n where m 1 2 i 1 i 1 n and p ki represents the probability distribution of node ki logical inference ability is an important feature of the bbn model after the values of some node variables are given the probability distribution of the value of the target node can be quantitatively given even when there is a certain lack of data and high uncertainty the model makes highly accurate predictions sun et al 2006 the core idea is to use the posterior probability the formula is as follows 8 p k i t p k i p t k i p t where t is the set of nodes that provide variable values and p ki t represents the probability distribution of ki nodes under known evidence 3 5 bbn sensitivity analysis the causal analysis diagram shows that the target node and multiple other nodes are related to each other the contribution of each node to the target object is different the importance of related nodes to the target node can be dynamically analyzed using sensitivity analysis which plays an important role in key factor analysis laskey 1995 since the posterior probability varies with the parent node variable sensitivity analysis is usually conducted using the birnbaum measure bm castillo et al 1997 li et al 2019 the formula is as follows 9 bm f j 1 2 max p t i f j p t i p t i p t i min p t i f j p t i where t is the sensitive target node and ti i 1 2 m is the value of the node variable f is the sensitivity measurement node and fj j 1 2 n is the value of the node variable 3 6 fuzzy mathematical decision optimization when using the bbn model for decision support after giving the value of each index node the result is the probability distribution of the value of the target node research on flood disaster resilience gives only the probability distribution of flood disaster resilience levels and it is difficult for decision makers to choose among different schemes moreover the focus of flood disaster resilience is a region s comprehensive prevention and control capability with regard to flood disasters which is not entirely consistent with the position of policymakers as the manager of a region the local government must prioritize the safety of people s lives and property its purpose is to serve people and it takes the interests of people as the starting point of its work therefore for the jiansanjiang branch this paper uses flood resilience regional population and regional gdp to construct a judgment indicator i e implementation momentum formula 10 which comprehensively considers flood disaster resilience population and the economy it provides guidelines for decision makers to make choices 10 imp n r p p min p max p min w p e e min e max e min w e where p is the regional population e is the gross farm product w is the importance score r is the resilience rating and n is the confidence level the value of n is selected based on the degree of trust of the decision maker and n 0 8 in this study for the value of the importance of population and gdp the r index is introduced into the consideration range the r index reflects the mismatch between the degree of economic agglomeration and the degree of population agglomeration in a region and its value is close to 1 in mature economic regions blanchard fischer 1989 by jointly considering the r index and importance levels wp and we the evaluation function is constructed the formula is as follows 11 min gd p j g d p p o p j p o p w p w e 2 s t w p w e 10 w p 0 w e 0 where gdpj and popj are the economic scale and population scale of the jiansanjiang branch respectively gdp and pop are the national economic size and population size respectively the total focus of policymakers on population and the economy is quantified as 10 the genetic algorithm was first proposed in the 1970s to search for optimal solutions by simulating natural selection and the genetic mechanism of darwin s theory of evolution after years of development the algorithm has become very mature and stable and has been widely used in machine learning adaptive control and signal processing katoch et al 2021 when solving combinatorial optimization problems better optimization results can be obtained quickly compared with the traditional algorithm that iteratively seeks the optimal solution from a single initial value the genetic algorithm starts the search from a string set which is conducive to global optimization and avoids obtaining local optimal solutions lambora et al 2019 the algorithm has a small information requirement for the research problem and has a strong fault tolerant ability which makes it a good choice for the calculation of formula 11 based on the 22 year data status of the 15 farms in this study the size of the population is set to 5000 the maximum number of iterations is 200 the crossover probability and mutation probability are 0 9 and 0 001 respectively and the precision of the function variable is 10 7 the final result is wp 5 47 and we 4 53 deterministic mathematical theory makes judgments in terms of yes and no or 0 and 1 therefore it is not suitable for solving this practical problem thus fuzzy mathematical theory is a good way to address the uncertainty in the boundaries of different levels of implementation motivation arqub et al 2017 by constructing a membership function implementation motivation is mapped to the 0 1 interval which is used to judge the degree of membership in different levels of implementation motivation thereby reducing the uncertainty of level judgment bezdek 1973 jiang et al 2009 to achieve a more accurate level division of implementation motivation based on the data characteristics and previous research experience the k th parabolic membership function is selected for operation k 2 and the formulas are shown in 12 13 and 14 compared with triangle and trapezoid membership functions the k th parabolic membership function emphasizes the contribution of the main interval more and weakens the contribution of the boundary interval jain sharma 2020 which is very consistent with the viewpoint of this study 12 l x 1 x χ δ x δ χ 2 χ x δ 0 δ x 13 l x x α β α 2 α x β 1 β x χ δ x δ χ 2 χ x δ 0 x α o r δ x 14 l x 0 x α x α β α 2 α x β 1 β x the membership function structure selected in this paper is shown in fig 5 where β and χ are the upper and lower critical values with a membership degree of 1 and α and δ are the upper and lower critical values with a membership degree of 0 finally the probability value determined by the bbn model is used as the value weight and the final score is obtained via fuzzy comprehensive evaluation cheng tao 2010 jiang et al 2009 the formula is as follows 15 c i 1 m λ i j 1 n l ij s j where c represents the comprehensive grade score λi represents the probability value corresponding to resilience level i lij represents the degree of membership of resilience level i in implementation motivation level j and sj represents the score of implementation motivation level j 3 7 research process framework this study uses python to implement the model through which prediction with missing indicators diagnostic reasoning and sensitivity analysis on the resilience of the fifteen farms of the jiansanjiang branch are conducted fuzzy mathematical theory is introduced to quantify the implementation motivation to provide guidance for decision makers in regard to management decisions between different farms the improvement process of the bnn based on fuzzy mathematical theory and the analysis process of flood disaster resilience data using the improved model are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure this research can be divided into three parts preliminary preparation model building and data analysis the specific steps are as follows step 1 establish the flood disaster resilience index system step 2 collect and organize the data of the selected indicators and use the natural discontinuity method to divide the index level step 3 conduct correlation analysis and causal logic analysis between indicators to construct a dag step 4 establish the implementation motivation indicator through formula 10 determine the importance of population and the economy through formula 11 and the genetic algorithm and use membership functions 12 13 14 to introduce fuzzy mathematical concepts into the evaluation system formula 15 is used to build the final decision evaluation system step 5 build an optimized bbn model and import the data to complete the preparatory work for driving mechanism analysis and management decision making step 6 use formulas 7 and 8 to perform prediction with missing indicators and diagnosis analysis of flood disaster resilience step 7 conduct sensitivity analysis on the 15 farms through formulas 8 and 9 step 8 quantify the decision making scheme by virtue of the established decision making evaluation system and conduct a quantitative comparison step 9 use the analysis results to guide the construction of farm flood control management step 10 in practice test whether the approach meets expectations of the analysis of the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience if it does go to step 11 otherwise repeat steps 1 9 step 11 end 4 results and analysis 4 1 dag construction pearson correlation coefficient analysis was performed on the selected 22 year data and the results are shown in fig 7 considering the limitation of the data volume if there are too many causal relationships among the 9 indicators the complexity of the network graph will be excessive and the existing data volume will not be able to support the subsequent data analysis to reduce the complexity of the network graph a strong restriction is imposed on all nodes in combination with the characteristics of the data that is each node cannot establish more than 3 associations therefore the threshold is chosen to be 0 36 that is nodes with s 0 36 or s 0 36 build causal relationships the indicator pairs that meet the requirements are deep forest coverage and rainfall rainfall and land average flood control investment gdp per capita and per capita output of grain land average flood control investment and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery and the per capita output of grain and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery causal analysis is then conducted and the final constructed dag is shown in fig 8 4 2 discretization of indicators at this stage the bbn is mainly used to address discrete probability thus the value of each indicator should be divided into a limited number of categories han coulibaly 2017 in this study the natural breaks method was selected to discretize the data this method selects the turning points in the data so that the data within the group have a high level of similarity and the differences between groups are large chen et al 2013 fariza et al 2017 this is the first step in model construction and it is also a crucial step for ensuring the accuracy of the model the specific classification results are shown in table 2 4 3 key points of bbn construction the designed dag and the data on the 15 farms are input into the model and the final results are shown in fig 9 the main points of model construction are as follows ankan and panda 2015 marcot et al 2006 1 regarding the method of parameter estimation pgmpy provides maximum likelihood estimation variable estimation and bayesian estimation among them maximum likelihood estimation and variable estimation are simple and convenient when considering a large amount of data but there is the problem of overfitting in this study it is very common to have missing data for earlier years and some nodes correspond to multiple parent nodes which will cause serious data dispersion thus these two parameter estimation methods are not suitable for this study bayesian estimation provides a pseudostate giving each node an equal prior distribution before processing the data avoiding extreme judgments making judgments conservative and alleviating the problem of overfitting 2 for the missing part in the original data mumpy is used additionally nan is used to replace the missing data formulas 4 and 8 show that the bbn has high compatibility with missing data and uncertainty 3 after the dag is built the causal correctness correlation and independence of the nodes must be checked and special attention must be paid to not having a ring structure for nodes that manually input the cpt the correctness of probability and statistical accounting must be ensured and the cpt must be consistent with the parent node 4 4 driving mechanism analysis and management decisions 4 4 1 prediction with missing indicators based on the 22 year data of 15 farms in jiansanjiang branch a total of 330 sets of resilience rating data were obtained seventy percent of the data are used to construct the training set and the other 30 are used as the test set since the data of each farm are collected in the order of the time axis the test set selects 90 sets of data in 6 years i e 1999 2003 2007 2010 2015 and 2018 and the other 240 sets of data are used as training data the prediction result is compared with the resilience level of the original data to judge the correctness of the prediction the accuracy of the prediction results is 90 to study the performance of the bbn in the absence of data this paper removes one of the 9 indicators for testing each time the absence of natural conditions has the least impact on the prediction when the water surface rate forest coverage rate and rainfall are missing the prediction accuracy is 84 85 5 and 88 9 respectively the absence of social environmental indicators has the second weakest impact after excluding the number of doctors per 10 000 people the proportion of water conservancy investment and land average flood control investment the accuracy is 82 1 84 4 and 83 3 respectively even for the economic indicators that have the greatest impact on accuracy an accuracy of more than 80 can be guaranteed in the absence of any single indicator further analysis of missing data was conducted and the three categories of indicators were eliminated in the absence of natural and social environment indicators the model can still ensure good prediction accuracy of 74 4 and 71 1 respectively in the absence of the economic category the prediction accuracy drops significantly to 63 3 detailed results are shown in fig 10 therefore the bbn can perform prediction with missing indicator data in the 22 year data for each farm the fluctuation of natural resources is small the disturbance to the evaluation of flood resilience is small and the impact of its absence is also small when making predictions with rapid social development the economic indicators change every year and their influence weights in forecasting are also relatively large to address the unavoidable practical problem of missing data for the early years the bbn model can ensure the smooth progress of resilience research with missing data and it provides a solution to the problem of missing data the prediction of the bbn with missing data also provides a reference for the focus of data collation and determines the priority of data collection in the case of limited personnel and time the priority sequence can ensure the efficiency of data collection work 4 4 2 diagnostic analysis diagnostic reasoning uses the bbn model to calculate the probability distribution of each cause under the condition of a given outcome regarding the flood disaster resilience of the jiansanjiang branch this study first sets the goal to pursue and then conducts reverse reasoning and analysis to find the largest possible cause of the goal then the index is used as a new result for the next round of analysis after layers of cycles the analysis of all indicators is completed first flood disaster resilience p f 5 1 is substituted into the bbn model the results show that the probability of the water surface rate p r 1 or r 2 0 3675 and the probability of rainfall p w 4 or w 5 0 3346 are the highest probability values among all indicators therefore the water surface rate and rainfall are the most direct drivers of flood resilience and are a priority for regional optimization which is consistent with the findings of other researchers chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 the water surface rate reflects the flood storage capacity of the area in the event of a flood in recent years to achieve growth in the value of agricultural output the jiansanjiang branch has increased the development of wasteland especially the conversion of wetlands to cultivated land which will seriously reduce the water surface rate and damage the flood storage capacity thereby affecting the flood disaster resilience of the region from 1998 to 2018 the arable land area of the jiansanjiang branch doubled and the water surface area decreased by 1 969 hm2 however directly implementing the policy of returning farmland is unrealistic first the primary industry of the jiansanjiang branch accounts for 60 of the total social output value and it is its economic lifeline second an overly decisive land policy would infringe upon the interests of a vast number of farmers which would cause dissatisfaction among the farmers and disputes over cultivated land would also lead to social instability therefore the government s work should focus on the management and control of cultivated land development such as formulating development guidelines and strictly implementing the approval process furthermore the government should carry out arable land reform in a targeted manner and gradually rectify unreasonable arable land for example illegal cultivation between the riverbed and the embankment is not compliant and greatly affects the water surface rate the government can take this issue as the first step for rectification for rainfall as an indicator the focus should be on increasing the emphasis on extreme rainfall zhang et al 2018 we must excel in the preparation of flood control plans the scheduling of flood season personnel and the detection and maintenance of flood control equipment and we must implement a policy of early preparation rapid response and orderly action the second step is to substitute p f 5 w 5 r 1 1 as the result into the bbn model and the per capita output of grain probability is p g 4 or g 5 0 2101 which is the most important driving force then the per capita output of grain is taken as the result and brought into the bbn model based on the steps above the main driving force diagnosed is gradually set as the known condition for the iterative operation finally an index sequence can be assembled based on the strength of the driving force as shown in fig 11 the driving forces ranking 3 to 5 are the per capita output of grain gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery economic indicators are the most important driving force after the natural environment especially in the environment where the economy of the jiansanjiang branch maintains steady growth year by year economic indicators are an effective means of building resilience to flood disasters gu et al 2019 the index sequence reveals the strong and weak relationships between the 9 indicators and the improvement of flood disaster resilience provides the priorities for resilience construction and can guide the planning and regulation of the construction of the jiansanjiang branch on this basis diagnostic reasoning refined to each farm is conducted to identify the differences and spatial distribution of the driving force of each farm fig 11 shows that most of the farms and the jiansanjiang branch have the same macrodiagnostic reasoning with natural indicators as the most direct driving force for three farms i e qindeli daxing and hongwei two of the top three driving forces are natural indicators the top three driving forces for qianshao are all natural force indicators which reflects the strong priority of natural indicators in the construction of flood resilience the five farms in the central part of the jiansanjiang branch are driven by economic indicators as the most direct driving force yalvhe is the most typical farm among them and the top three driving forces are all economic indicators the distribution of farms with economic indicators as the most direct driving force is concentrated reflecting a relatively clear regional distribution law 4 4 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis identifies the importance of each indicator by quantifying the degree of impact of each indicator on flood disaster resilience starting from the cause on the basis of historical data the focus is on the disturbance of a change in a single index to flood disaster resilience and the sensitivity of each index to different farms is calculated based on formula 9 to conduct a dynamic evaluation of sensitive factors by virtue of the formula s accurate discrimination of the change in resilience precise data analysis can be performed the data on the 15 farms in the jiansanjiang branch are substituted into the bbn and a model for each farm is established as shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows that rainfall is the most important indicator and cannot be ignored in the entire jiansanjiang region its sensitivity ranks among the top three among 10 farms which shows the importance of rainfall in regulating resilience to flood disasters in the jiansanjiang branch this result is followed by gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery which are in the top three for 9 farms and even the last indicator in the economic category the per capita output of grain which ranks relatively high among various farms economic construction is an important means of enhancing flood disaster resilience existing research also shows that economic factors directly affect flooding lin et al 2016 liu et al 2017 regardless of the flood threat or post disaster reconstruction areas with high economic levels have sufficient material reserves to handle a crisis for example 859 farm chuangye and nongjiang are typical representatives of this situation however some farms have significantly different indicator sensitivities revealing differences in the key factors among these farms qindeli has the highest sensitivity to land average flood control investment and the number of doctors per 10 000 people qianfeng has the highest sensitivity to the proportion of water conservancy investment and land average flood control investment qianshao has the highest sensitivity to forest coverage and the proportion of water conservancy investment when regulating these farms the resource tilt should be adjusted based on the level of sensitivity and the construction investment of high sensitivity indicators should be appropriately increased to achieve a more efficient flood disaster resilience improvement however a low sensitivity indicator does not necessarily mean that it is not important for flood resilience taking qianshao as an example we find that the sensitivity of this farm to the per capita output of grain is low which is in sharp contrast to the high sensitivity of other farms to the per capita output of grain additionally from the previous diagnostic analysis the per capita output of grain and the flood disaster resilience construction of the entire jiansanjiang branch are very strongly correlated observing the 22 year data on qianshao we see that its per capita output of grain shows little change which cannot provide a sufficient disturbance to qianshao s flood disaster resilience finally the sensitivity calculated by formula 9 is low therefore when using sensitivity to analyze the key factors of flood disaster resilience the results must be viewed dialectically high sensitivity indicators must receive attention but low sensitivity indicators should be judged based on whether the original data are single 4 4 4 fuzzy decisions the bbn model has the function of decision support simulating various decisions in the decision making stage in view of the existing conditions of a farm decision makers can make various assumptions on the basis of flood disaster resilience the optimized bbn model introduces implementation motivation as an indicator and takes personal and property safety which decision makers are more concerned with as the foundation the implementation motivation scores of different flood disaster resilience levels of each farm are calculated and the natural discontinuity method is used to divide them into five levels based on previous experience and professional knowledge each grade is scored then implementation motivation and the membership function are combined to construct the final evaluation system the results are shown in table 3 eight farms namely qixing qindeli daxing qianjin qianshao qianfeng honghe and nongjiang with low flood disaster resilience are selected as planning objects taking 2018 as the status quo year and 2023 and 2028 as the planning years the decision making assumptions are as follows decision 1 a commitment is made to build the core functional area of modern agriculture based on the reclamation area and to develop the modern planting industry and deep processing industry the planting structure will be optimized the irrigation coefficient of farmland will be regulated the wasteland in the reclamation area will be rationally developed and a planting industrialization system will be built the goal of increasing grain production capacity will drive regional economic development achieve an increase of 10 t person in per capita grain output every 5 years and an increase of 2 104 yuan in per capita gdp every 5 years and improve the construction of flood disaster resilience from an economic perspective decision 2 starting from ensuring farm water security and food security and vigorously developing water conservancy for people s livelihood the construction of water conservancy projects will be strengthened in view of the weak disaster resistance of farmland with the aim of improving water conservancy infrastructure and supporting facilities it is proposed to increase the proportion of water conservancy investment by 3 every 5 years and to increase the investment of 220 yuan hm2 in land average waterlogging prevention fees every 5 years to build flood disaster resilience from the perspective of the social environment the details of the specific decision making plan are shown in table 4 based on each indicator level in 2018 the model is run after level adjustment based on table 4 the comprehensive grade score of each farm is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 in the scenario simulation for the 8 selected farms both decision 1 and decision 2 have a positive impact on flood control in 2023 the comprehensive grade scores of decision 1 and decision 2 increase by a similar rate 2 57 and 2 64 respectively which means that the improvement effects on flood prevention and control are similar in 2028 the increase in the comprehensive grade score of decision 1 is significantly higher than that of decision 2 i e 7 48 and 5 62 respectively that is the flood control effect of decision 1 is better than that of decision 2 for different farms the two decisions are significantly different decision 1 is the most effective for qianjin while for qianfeng the prevention and control effect is weakly improved after the first 5 year plan but significantly improved after the second 5 year plan decision 2 works best for qianfeng both decision 1 and decision 2 have little effect on flood control in nongjiang for each farm there are also significant differences in the effects of the two decisions in 2023 decision 1 is better than decision 2 for qianjin while the opposite is true for qianfeng and the flood control effect of both decisions is similar for the other 6 farms in 2028 for qixing and qianjin decision 1 is better than decision 2 in particular decision 1 significantly improves the flood prevention and control of qianjin by contrast decision 2 is better than decision 1 for qindeli and qianfeng 5 discussion in the field of flood disaster resilience research in view of the current situation of limited research progress on the complex nonlinear relationship between various indicators especially for an environment full of uncertainties the selection of the bbn model for research has strong applicability and fit and it can be used to analyze the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience from multiple perspectives the bbn model is used to study the impact weight construction driving force and sensitivity factors of the evaluation indicators of flood disaster resilience and to gradually explore the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience 1 bbn model features in the current research on flood disaster resilience evaluation support vector machines random deep forests and projection pursuit have achieved good results however these models are highly sensitive to missing data chen et al 2020 which impacts flood disaster resilience theory bbn can solve this problem and is an effective means to promote the development of this theory the first step in the construction of the bbn is to build a dag based on the causal analysis between each node which ensures good compatibility between the model and the research problem in previous key factor research of the jiansanjiang branch liu et al 2021 analyzed the importance of the natural environment and economy to resilience and liu et al 2020 focused on the impact of economic development on resilience the qualitative conclusions of the above research are generally consistent with this research but the identification of key factors is performed via weight analysis which is a static method the core principle is the contribution rate of each index to the assessment of resilience that is the horizontal comparison between the indexes the sensitivity analysis of bbn is a dynamic key factor identification method it identifies key factors from the perspective of the disturbance of the factors to the target it not only performs the key analysis between the indicators but also quantitatively depicts the effect of each indicator on the improvement of resilience moreover this study further refines the identification of key factors to farm units and conducts more detailed and targeted research the model itself also has certain limitations and it is not good at dynamic analysis in the direction of the time axis the accuracy of data analysis is affected mainly by the quality of the data and how to improve the resolution of the data will be the focus of follow up research the complexity of the dag is limited by the amount of data collected with the deepening of research on the correlation of indicators the density of data collection in space and the frequency of collection in time must be increased 2 bbn model optimization regarding the decision making function of the traditional bnn only the probability distribution of flood disaster resilience is given and it cannot be well applied to the evaluation of different decision making schemes first it is not easy to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different probability distributions second flood disaster resilience and the decision maker s position on alternatives are not unified therefore the implementation motivation indicator is constructed and flood disaster resilience population and the economy are considered together so that the evaluation angle is more in line with the manager s position furthermore a single numerical value is used to quantify different decision making schemes which can provide a reliable basis for the comparison of different decisions since the construction of the implementation motivation indicator will introduce uncertainty if it is not controlled it will affect the accuracy of the evaluation between different schemes højberg and refsgaard 2005 xia 2001 in response to this problem this paper has conducted a series of optimizations when constructing the implementation motivation indicator there is no clear criterion for the setting of the importance of population and the economy which is often determined by the knowledge and experience of experts thus it is limited by the knowledge structure and individual cognition of experts and subjective factors are included in the model which is not conducive to an objective and accurate judgment this paper establishes a simultaneous equation of importance and the r index takes into account the national macroeconomy and population and establishes constraints through the incompatibility of regional economic agglomeration and population agglomeration using the excellent search ability of the genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution within the value range and relying on the powerful computing power of a computer prevents the intervention of subjective factors from ever occurring the delineation of the implementation motivation indicator grade boundary introduces considerable uncertainty into the grade assessment which affects the rationality of decision making this paper introduces fuzzy number theory into the final evaluation selects the type of membership function based on the characteristics of the data uses the membership function to reduce the uncertainty of the boundary conducts a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and eliminates the uncertainty introduced when constructing the implementation motivation indicator making the decision evaluation more objective 3 flood disaster resilience construction path selection during the period studied from the perspective of the jiansanjiang branch flood disaster resilience showed an upward trend the growth rate was slow in the early stage and it accelerated substantially starting in 2008 however the growth rate slowed in 2015 and individual farms even showed a downward trend in the level of resilience combining the driving force analysis and the basic data of the indicators we see that the most direct driving forces are the water surface rate and rainfall but the changes in the research period are small and it is difficult to affect the construction of flood disaster resilience economic indicators are the next most important driving force observing the basic data we see that from 2005 to 2015 the per capita output of grain and gdp per capita grew steadily from 2015 to 2018 these two indicators leveled off and even declined for individual farms the improvement in flood disaster resilience of the jiansanjiang branch depends mainly on economic growth since the jiansanjiang branch is mainly engaged in the production and processing of agricultural products and has a single economic structure there are hidden dangers behind the steadily improving resilience to flood disasters and the decline in resilience of individual farms is affected by bottlenecks in economic development however eliminating hidden dangers by optimizing the economic system is unrealistic the status quo of jiansanjiang branch construction based on agricultural production is determined by natural conditions agriculture is its advantage and holds great significance for the country s food strategy deployment therefore the construction of flood disaster resilience must start from the natural and social environments from a long term perspective the natural environment holds decisive significance for enhancing flood disaster resilience but for the current stage the solution to hidden dangers must start from the construction of the social environment for the construction of the social environment sensitivity analysis and planning can be combined and high sensitivity indicators can achieve a greater level of flood disaster resilience improvement through lower investment through the scenario simulation in fuzzy decision making decision 2 carefully describes the impact of the proportion of water conservancy investment and land average flood control investment on the flood disaster resilience of each farm for high sensitivity farms key construction can be performed while for low sensitivity farms such as nongjiang and honghe the resilience index system should be enriched for more in depth research 6 conclusion with the aim of analyzing the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision making 22 years of data for 15 farms under the jurisdiction of the jiansanjiang branch were selected as the research object and the bbn model was used for the corresponding analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was adopted to reduce the subjectivity of the dag the implementation motivation indicator was constructed to guide decision making and the uncertainty of the boundary was reduced by incorporating fuzzy mathematical theory 1 when predicting flood resilience levels this study focuses on the predictive ability with missing data the lack of a single indicator has little effect on prediction accuracy and an accuracy of more than 80 can be guaranteed if the natural environment category and social environment category are missing the prediction accuracy is still 74 4 and 71 1 respectively however if economic indicators are missing the prediction accuracy will drop significantly to 63 3 which shows the importance of economic indicators for predicting resilience levels missing prediction ensures the smooth progress of research with incomplete data and provides guidance for the focus of data collection 2 diagnostic analysis of the jiansanjiang branch found that rainfall and the water surface rate are the most direct driving forces affecting flood disaster resilience and they are also the focus of jiansanjiang branch s work to improve flood disaster resilience these driving forces are followed by three indicators i e the per capita output of grain gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery which reflect the importance of economic construction for flood disaster resilience diagnostic analysis obtains an index sequence through reverse logical reasoning which can reduce the blindness of regulation and correctly guide the improvement of flood disaster resilience on this basis a detailed diagnosis of each farm was conducted commonalities were summarized and differences were identified there are clear regularities in the types of driving forces for the improvement of flood disaster resilience for the five farms in the central region economic indicators are the most direct driving force while for the surrounding farms natural indicators are the most direct driving force among them the yalu river and qianshao are typical representatives of these two categories 3 sensitivity analysis was separately performed on each farm to identify the sensitive factors of each farm for 10 of the farms the top three factors were rainfall followed by gdp per capita and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery most of the farms in the jiansanjiang branch are highly sensitive to rainfall and economic indicators the 859 farm chuangye farm and nongjiang farms are typical representatives of this type however some farms such as qindeli qianfeng and qianshao have distinct differences in sensitivities increasing the emphasis on high sensitivity indicators and the targeted construction of each farm will help improve the efficiency of flood disaster resilience 4 in terms of decision support this study is based on flood disaster resilience introduces the position of decision makers takes the safety of life and property into account and takes the comprehensive grade score of implementation motivation as the final basis of judgment a comprehensive comparison of different decisions is made through the differences in the comprehensive grade scores across time and space between farms credit authorship contribution statement dong liu conceptualization methodology tianyu sun writing review editing deping liu software validation qiang fu conceptualization
