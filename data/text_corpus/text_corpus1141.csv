5705,low lying low relief coastal cities have seen increased flooding due to climate change in these cities stormwater pipe outlets can be inundated by coastal waters at high tide or from storm surge making drainage impossible the objective of this research is to assess the utility of model predictive control mpc of stormwater actuators to reduce flooding in a coastal urban setting made worse by sea level rise the stormwater system and the control scenarios are simulated using the united states environmental protection agency storm water management model swmm5 coupled with a python library swmm mpc the study area is norfolk virginia usa a city which is particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding a simulated 2 year 12 h design storm and sea level rise scenarios up to 3 5 ft are applied to the model for three control scenarios 1 a passive system 2 a passive system with a tide gate backflow preventer and 3 a tide gate and three actuators a pump a valve and an inflatable dam controlled through mpc flooding in the passive system reached a tipping point and increased dramatically after a sea level rise of 1 6 ft the addition of a tide gate greatly mitigated this increase in flooding mpc further reduced overall flooding with an average effective percent reduction of 32 the rate of the increase in flooding was significantly smaller with mpc than without mpc also reduced maximum node flood volume by an average of 52 for sea level increases of 2 0 ft and above in addition to the installation of a tide gate our results suggest that the use of actuators controlled by mpc could significantly reduce overall flood volumes and reduce flood severity at individual nodes in coastal cities keywords stormwater real time control smart stormwater coastal flooding sea level rise 1 introduction coastal urban flooding is likely to increase globally in the coming decades in addition to more intense rainfall berggren et al 2012 neumann et al 2015 which can affect any city expected sea level rise slr church et al 2013 makes coastal cities particularly vulnerable to increased flooding in coastal cities the water level of the receiving water body has a large impact on drainage and flooding when receiving water levels are above the system outlets system pipes cannot drain efficiently when this happens during a storm event backups can occur in such cases not only is there a decrease in the amount of volume available in the system but the hydraulic head is also decreased slowing the rate of drainage if the receiving water levels are high enough water can backflow into stormwater pipes eventually reaching city streets and causing flooding even with no rainfall at all slr will make these problems worse as the average water level at system outfalls increases in addition to the magnitude of the tide cycle the timing of the tide cycle can significantly influence flooding in coastal cities for these cities the stormwater outfalls could be inundated at high tide and completely free at low tide thus the ability for the stormwater system to drain runoff from the city may be affected by the timing of the storm s runoff relative to the timing of the tide cycle one strategy for mitigating flooding in coastal cities is the use of real time control rtc rtc of stormwater systems consists of three major components 1 real time sensors 2 system analysis and 3 actuators sensors e g rain gauges water level sensors flow meters provide real time information on system states given the real time system states and any forecasted inputs a control decision is made based on either offline or online system analysis the control decision selected through the analysis is then implemented by actuators e g pumps gates valves which affect the behavior of the system until the next control decision schütze et al 2004 conventional stormwater systems are driven by gravity and behave statically rtc systems on the other hand employ actuators to counteract gravity and control the storage and flow of water dynamically using rtc a stormwater system can be managed in a more optimal way kerkez et al 2016 for example there may be under utilized capacity in the system in the form of unused storage in a pond or in the pipes themselves that could be utilized with rtc devices if the existing capacity is used more effectively there is less need for expensive expansions of physical infrastructure rtc in urban drainage systems has been primarily explored implemented and evaluated for combined sewer systems css with the primary objective of minimizing combined sewer overflows csos meneses et al 2018 garofalo et al 2017 nobre et al 2005 schütze et al 2004 although the research on rtc for css has been well developed in the literature there has been a smaller but growing amount of research on the use and utility of rtc in separate sewer systems which are used in most modern cities wong and kerkez 2018 research on benefits that rtc systems could provide for flood resilience in coastal cities is limited it is therefore the intent of this paper to characterize the utility of rtc for flood reduction specifically an implementation of model predictive control mpc puig et al 2009 cembrano et al 2004 schütze et al 2004 gelormino and ricker 1994 in a separated sewer system subjected to various slr scenarios while the use of rtc systems could benefit coastal cities globally the geographic focus of our study is the coastal city of norfolk virginia usa norfolk is part of a region which is experiencing faster than average slr due to land subsidence mitchell et al 2013 therefore the conditions being seen now in norfolk and its neighboring cities could be seen in coastal cities globally in the decades to come we will assess the current and future utility of mpc systems in norfolk using a simulation model the environmental protection agency epa stormwater management model version 5 swmm5 in the swmm5 model three scenarios will be simulated with increasing sea levels 1 the passive scenario representing the current state of the system 2 the passive scenario with the addition of a tide gate a mechanical device used to prevent backflow into the system and 3 the tide gate scenario with the addition of actuators controlled by mpc the simulated flood volumes from the three system scenarios will be compared and flood reduction from mpc calculated the increasing receiving water levels will then be related to slr scenarios in addition to increasing the sea level at the stormwater outfalls we will also vary the timing of the tide cycle relative to the rainfall and assess the effect of this factor on flooding in the remainder of this paper we present details about our methods including the study area of norfolk va the mpc scenarios explored and the rainfall and tidal conditions used we then present the results which demonstrate the utility of mpc in terms of flood reduction with increasing sea levels finally we discuss the results and relate the increasing receiving water levels to potential slr scenarios 2 methods 2 1 study area norfolk va usa served as the study area for this research fig 1 norfolk is a peninsula with several inland streams and much of the city is within close proximity to a tidally influenced water body the city is low lying with low topographic relief because of these geographic conditions norfolk experiences frequent flooding sadler et al 2018 ezer and atkinson 2014 mitchell et al 2013 atkinson et al 2012 given the size of the city and the complexity of the stormwater system with all its features subcatchments pipes channels junctions ponds etc our study focused on a subsection of the city the neighborhood called the hague the hague approximately three square miles is home to many of norfolk s most historic buildings and cultural attractions the hague is also key to the city s connectivity as it is adjacent to the city government buildings and the regional hospital in addition to its importance to norfolk the hague area is one of the most flood prone of the city 2 2 storm event and base tidal conditions there are two main factors that affect flooding in low lying coastal cities rainfall and tidal conditions because this paper is primarily focused on the utility of mpc over time given slr the rainfall event in all the simulations was kept constant and the tidal conditions were varied the rainfall event we used was a 2 year 12 h storm event 3 08 in bonnin et al 2018 with an scs type ii temporal distribution mockus 2012 fig 2 we chose a smaller event because we wanted the focus of the analysis on an event that would occur more frequently and because flooding from an extreme event would be difficult to impact with rtc because simulations were for events lasting a day or less other meteorological conditions such as evapotranspiration were not considered therefore the time of day of the simulated rainfall does not affect the simulation as long as the timing relative to the tide is the same observations from the sewells point tide gauging station fig 1 operated and maintained by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa 2019 served as the baseline tide conditions in the simulations hourly water level observations from a typical 24 h tide cycle were taken as a base tidal boundary condition in the simulations the tide cycle fig 2 was the hourly water level recorded at the sewells point station on august 8 2018 this day was selected because the 24 h tidal range 2 78 ft was very similar to the station s all time average 24 h tidal range 2 76 ft and because the day had a very typical tide cycle without unusual effects from wind or other factors 2 3 increasing tide levels to estimate the utility of mpc with slr the baseline hourly tidal conditions were increased in magnitude to cover a range of possible slr scenarios the hourly tide levels were increased by 0 5 foot increments up to 3 5 ft for a total of seven elevated water levels the increases in tide level were then correlated to region specific slr estimates from mitchell et al 2013 who adjusted global slr estimates with local land subsidence rates 2 4 computational model the computational model used to simulate the stormwater system in the study area was epa swmm5 it was selected based on its general use as a 1d stormwater system model and its ability to simulate stormwater system actuators burger et al 2014 swmm5 solves the st venant equations numerically to simulate dynamic routing in a stormwater system the use of dynamic wave routing is particularly important in simulating coastal systems because the systems often experience backflow from tidally influenced receiving waters in a swmm5 simulation each node has a maximum depth usually the distance from the invert elevation to the ground surface elevation when the simulated water exceeds the maximum depth at a node the excess water volume is recorded as flood volume by swmm5 at the end of a simulation both the accumulated flood volume at each node and the combined flood volume across all the nodes together is reported a swmm5 model of the hague neighborhood was obtained from the city of norfolk fig 3 the city of norfolk verified that the model behavior sufficiently represented the behavior of the physical system the model consists of 208 nodes with a wall clock time of approximately 0 5 min for running a 24 h simulation of a 12 h storm event on an 8 core desktop computer the system drains to a tidally influenced water body and a water level boundary condition was implemented at the outfall to simulate the influence of the tidal water body at the receiving waters fig 4 shows the elevation profile of the nodes closest to the outfall of the system this elevation profile is important to understanding the drainage system when the sea water exceeds the surface elevation of the node with the lowest surface elevation in the system 3 41 ft at node e143274 the sea water exits node that node causing flooding even without rainfall this is referred in coastal cities as sunny day flooding sweet et al 2016 this occurs in the hague system at high tide when the base tide cycle is increased in magnitude by 1 6 ft 2 5 addition of tide gate before simulating mpc in the system a tide gate was added to the outfall of the passive swmm5 model a tide gate is a passive device used to prevent backflow from a receiving water body the use of a tide gate was explored because the installation of a tide gate could become an important approach for minimizing tidal flooding in coastal cities as the likelihood of backflow increases with slr in swmm5 simulations tide gates are assumed to be 100 effective at preventing backflow through the system outfall that is even when the tidal boundary condition exceeds the elevation of the outfall water will not backflow into the system additionally in a swmm5 simulation water cannot flow out of an outfall with a tide gate when the outfall is inundated 2 6 addition of mpc three actuators for mitigating flooding in coastal cities were simulated in the mpc scenario first a valve at the outlet of a simulated pond point a in fig 3 was used to control the storage volume in the pond second a pump point b in fig 3 was simulated to increase the hydraulic head in the stormwater pipes this is particularly important in a low relief coastal city because the contribution of elevation head to the total hydraulic head is very small third and finally an inflatable dam was simulated to utilize inline storage in the stormwater pipes point c in fig 3 although these controls were simulated in the hague area such controls or different combinations of controls would likely be useful in many coastal cities globally since many coastal cities share similar geographic characteristics low relief low elevation the control approach in the mpc scenario was simulated using the swmm mpc python library sadler et al 2019 the main parameters in running swmm mpc include cost function parameters genetic algorithm parameters and control parameters the cost function in these simulations was the total amount of flooding that occurred in the simulation as reported in the swmm5 output for the genetic algorithm six generations were used including the initial generation with twenty individuals in the initial generation the control horizon was 30 min and the control time step was 15 min meaning that the algorithm was searching for two control settings for each actuator at every time step in the model see table 1 we estimated the time of concentration from the passive swmm model results to be 26 min the control horizon of 30 min therefore should be sufficient to prepare for and respond to the runoff response from a rainfall event although the control time step is 15 min the control algorithm still accounts for the rainfall at the 6 min simulation interval in mpc the control strategy for each actuator is determined and can be changed at every control time step 15 min in this case this makes the approach flexible that flexibility however comes at a higher computational cost since the control strategy is determined by running many iterations of the simulation model at each time step given the computational cost of running this library the mpc scenarios were executed on a high performance computer with 20 computational cores and 128 gb of ram the 15 min control time step is perhaps coarser than ideal given the time of concentration and the potential for flashy runoff response in urban watersheds to move to a finer resolution with the same control horizon however would significantly increase computational expense 2 6 1 assessment of mpc with slr to assess the utility of adding mpc in the hague stormwater system the storm event and tidal conditions described above were input into swmm mpc for each of the tidal and gate scenarios the amount of flooding that occurred in the mpc scenario was compared to the amount of flooding that occurred in the scenario with the tide gate the percent reduction of total flooding and the maximum flooding at a single node between the mpc and the tide gate scenarios was also calculated in preliminary simulations it was found that the runoff from the rainfall event alone caused flooding at some nodes that were not affected at all by tidal conditions or mpc the majority of this flooding occurred upstream of the controls at three nodes see fig 3 therefore because the volume of flooding at these three nodes in total 0 582 10 6 gallons could not be reduced with any mpc strategy it was not taken into account when calculating the percent decrease in total flooding instead an effective percent reduction of total flooding was calculated 1 effectivepercentreduction f g eff f r eff f g eff and 2 f g eff f g f uneff 3 f r eff f r f uneff where f g and f r are the total simulated flood volumes in the tide gate and mpc scenario respectively and f uneff is the flood volume unaffected by mpc and tidal conditions 0 582x 10 6 gallons in this case 2 7 timing of tide cycle in addition to the magnitude of the tide levels the timing of the tide cycle relative to the timing of a rainfall event can impact drainage and flooding in a coastal stormwater system therefore as well as analyzing changes in flooding with increasing the magnitude of tide levels the main focus of this study the timing of the tide cycle relative to the 2 year 12 h design rainfall event was also varied to assess the effect of the timing of the tide cycle the timing of the rainfall event was held constant while base tide cycle was shifted in 1 h increments from 0 11 h this was done under increases in sea level as above up to 3 5 ft increase in 0 5 ft increments in total this resulted in 96 model runs 12 variations in timing 8 increases in sea level for each increase in sea level the amount of flooding changed based on the timing of the tide cycle to quantify the impact of this timing the difference in flood volume was computed between the timing that caused the maximum flood volume and the timing that caused the minimum flood volume the difference between the maximum flood volume and minimum flood volume for a given amount of slr i is given as 4 δ f i max j 0 t f ij min j 0 t f ij where f is the total simulated flood volume j is the shift in tide cycle timing and t is the number of hourly shifts in our case 12 because there is likely a significant increase in total flooding with increasing slr the normalized difference in flooding between the tide cycle timing that caused the maximum flooding and the timing that caused the minimum flooding was also found the normalized difference for a given amount of slr was found by dividing the difference by the average of the flooding across all tide cycle timings for that amount of slr for a given amount of slr i this was computed as 5 δ f i norm max j 0 t f ij min j 0 t f ij 1 t j 0 t f ij because the timing of the tide cycle would affect both the mpc and passive systems similarly the different timings were only simulated on the passive case 2 8 comparison with regional slr scenarios and extreme water levels to put the modeled scenarios of 0 3 5 ft of slr in context the results were compared to regional slr predictions and locally observed historic extreme water levels the regional slr predictions took into account both global slr and regional land subsidence mitchell et al 2013 these predictions were made for high medium and low emission scenarios local extreme water levels were obtained for comparison from the sewells point tide station noaa 2020 3 results 3 1 flooding with slr in passive scenario fig 5 a shows the amount of flooding in the passive system given increases in sea level the amount of flooding remains fairly constant between no increase in sea level and an increase in sea level of 1 5 ft however there is a dramatic increase in flooding between increases of 1 5 ft and 2 0 ft this occurs because with an increase of 2 0 ft the elevation of the high tide 3 8 ft exceeds the 3 41 ft land surface elevation at node e143274 see fig 4 a sea level increase of 1 6 ft therefore becomes a tipping point and any increase in sea level beyond this causes much more flooding this is seen in the substantial increases in flood volume with each increase in sea level above 1 5 ft 3 2 flood reduction with addition of tide gate the impact of adding a tide gate to the outfall of the system dramatically reduced flooding with increasing sea levels compared to the passive system fig 5b this reduction was most evident with sea level increases of 2 0 ft and higher when the vast majority of the flooding was tidally driven with lower sea levels the effect was less significant this is most striking between increases in sea level of 1 5 ft and 2 0 ft the addition of the tide gate with a 1 5 ft increase in sea level reduced total flooding from 1 3 10 6 gallons to 1 1 10 6 gallons a reduction of 15 in contrast with a sea level increase of 2 0 ft the addition of a tide gate reduced the total flood volume from 8 7 10 6 gallons to 1 7 10 6 gallons an 80 reduction when sea level was increased to 3 5 ft flooding was reduced from 49 6 10 6 gallons to 3 3 10 6 gallons a 93 reduction 3 3 flood reduction with tide gate and mpc fig 5c shows the amount of flooding seen in the tide gate and mpc scenario given increases in sea level like in the tide gate scenario the total amount of flooding increases with increasing sea level however the rate of increase is slower compared to flooding in the situation without mpc see fig 6 the actuators in the mpc are able to reduce flooding at a rate higher than the tide gate alone for example from a 3 ft to a 3 5 ft increase in sea level the flooding increases by 18 without mpc with mpc the increase is only 9 mpc reduced flooding by at least 40 for each of the sea level increases below 2 0 ft fig 7 above 2 0 ft increases in sea level the percent reduction generally increased with increases in sea level up to a 35 reduction in flooding with a sea level increase of 3 5 ft in addition to reducing the total flood volume mpc reduced the maximum node flood volume with sea level increases of 2 0 ft and above fig 8 the largest reduction of maximum node flood volumes was 70 at node e143274 with a 3 5 ft sea level increase from 2 2 10 6 gallons without mpc to 0 65 10 6 gallons with mpc fig 9 shows the amount the three controls were utilized for the 0 3 5 ft slr scenarios in general each of the three controls were utilized more as the slr increased the increase of use of the orifice was not as related to the amount of slr compared to the inflatable dam and the pump this may be because it is much further from the coast than the inflatable dam and the pump the pump was utilized much more often and for longer with slr of 1 5 ft and greater the average pump run time with slr of 0 1 0 ft was 5 25 h whereas the average for slr of 1 5 3 5 ft was 18 45 h the pump time peaked at the 2 0 ft slr and then decreased this is correlated with the amount of time that the water had to drain between tide cycles which decreased with increasing slr it is possible that the use of the pump to send water more quickly downstream became less helpful with less time to drain that water 3 4 timing of tide cycle in a similar trend to the increase in flooding with slr the difference between the maximum and minimum flood volumes from different timings also increases substantially starting with a sea level increase of 2 0 ft fig 10 the difference between the maximum and minimum flood volumes however does not follow the same trend when divided by the average flood volume at each sea level increase fig 11 the largest normalized difference in fact occurs at a slr increase of 1 5 ft these results suggest that following a sea level increase of 2 0 ft the tidal flood volume is so large that the flood volume from the rainfall event and thus the timing of the tide cycle relative to the rainfall makes an increasingly smaller impact 3 5 comparison with local slr scenarios and extreme water levels fig 12 shows slr estimates specific to south east virginia mitchell et al 2013 as sea level increases with time a normal tide cycle will become increasingly problematic for coastal cities based on our analysis above there will be a dramatic increase in tidal flooding in this case study region once the high tide reaches 3 41 ft this would be an increase of the base tide cycle in fig 2 of 1 6 ft shown as the dashed line in fig 12 when this threshold is crossed we would expect to see street flooding from a typical daily tide cycle at high tide based on the slr estimates from mitchell et al 2013 the 1 6 ft threshold could be crossed as early as the year 2035 for norfolk in the high emission scenario and by 2060 for the low scenario the use of rtc for stormwater systems will become increasingly valuable with increasing average sea level in the coming decades however under current conditions storm surge and astronomical tides alone can already elevate sea levels temporarily to the point where rtc would be useful for example since 2000 four storms hurricanes isabel 2003 irene 2011 and sandy 2012 and a powerful nor easter 2009 each caused storm surge that reached over 3 93 ft 1 2 m in our study region the astronomical tide alone has a 99 likelihood of reaching 2 85 ft 0 87 meters each year in norfolk based on the 1983 2001 tidal epoch see fig 13 this is well above the 1 6 ft threshold showing that norfolk now experiences and will continue to experience flooding from the highest tide of each year the results of this analysis suggest that with the addition of a tide gate the introduction of active controls through mpc could significantly reduce flooding caused by similar storm surge and astronomical tide events 4 discussion although the use of a tide gate makes a greater difference in overall flooding compared to the passive scenario the use of mpc further improves the system performance not only does mpc reduce the overall volume of flooding but it also reduces the maximum node flood volume thus more evenly distributing the flood volume across the nodes in the system less severe flooding at any given node could mean less disruption and or damage to the community in our analysis the utility of mpc in terms of percent flood volume reduction and absolute flood volume reduction generally increased with increasing sea levels the largest increases in utility occurred with higher increases 3 0 ft and 3 5 ft this suggests that as coastal cities consider investment and mitigation alternatives the investment in rtc and mpc could provide a greater return on investment in coming years to make the results and inferences more complete future work should be done to quantify uncertainty in the results one source of uncertainty in this analysis includes the model itself and how well it represents the physical system swmm5 is a 1d model and therefore cannot simulate some aspects of coastal flooding for example swmm5 only records a volume of water that is flooded from a given node and does not simulate the depth of flooding given detailed land elevation data however this could be calculated using the height above nearest drainage method hand nobre et al 2011 or a similar method knowing the depth of flooding and the reduction of depth by mpc would be another way to assess the utility of mpc another uncertainty in the results is in the optimality of the control strategies found in the mpc scenario by swmm mpc the swmm5 model is used as a black box model without the optimizer having any knowledge of the underlying mathematical structure of the governing equations because of this the control strategies found by swmm mpc cannot be guaranteed to be optimal future work could be done to analyze the optimality of the strategies found through swmm mpc in this analysis we simulated three actuators these were chosen in an ad hoc manner based on the behavior of the model and the constraints of the physical system a methodology for systematically selecting which actuators should be used and where they should be placed would be a useful extension of this work such a methodology could be especially useful as coastal cities seek adaptation alternatives the monetary cost for adding controls into the system could be added to the cost function as an important practical consideration for municipalities optimizing the placement and selection of controls could be an addition to the swmm mpc software because the focus of this study was on flooding impacts due to slr the rainfall magnitude and intensity were not changed however climate change in addition to causing slr is anticipated to increase rainfall intensity berggren et al 2012 neumann et al 2015 it would therefore be useful in addition to increasing sea level in the simulations to increase rainfall intensity and or volume with time a recent study in the region quantified increases in design storm rainfall volumes with climate change smirnov et al 2018 by analyzing historic rainfall data and climate models the authors recommend 20 higher rainfall volumes for design storms these projections could be used to adjust design storms and run additional scenarios using the methods of this study barriers to adoption of rtc for stormwater systems by municipalities include costs and risk monetary costs include the costs of the equipment installation and maintenance the cost of installation and maintenance can be especially high in cities with limited available space for example the location of the simulated inflatable dam in our study is a busy intersection near cultural attractions government buildings and the city s downtown area the city of norfolk would therefore have to take into consideration both the cost of the disruption to the community as well as the capital costs of construction when weighing against the benefits less straightforward to estimate and perhaps a larger barrier than monetary cost is that of potential risks of rtc systems in stormwater infrastructure although successfully deployed in some cities for combined sewer systems the use of rtc in separated sewer systems is still new schütze et al 2004 provide some suggestions for overcoming institutional barriers for adopting rtc systems although primarily focused on combined sewer systems many of the suggestions apply to separated sewer systems as well a key suggestion made by the authors in regards to safety and risk when implementing rtc is that in the worst case scenario the rtc system should perform as well or better than the system before the installation of the rtc additionally schütze et al 2004 suggests that equipment failure should be considered inevitable and therefore redundancy should be built into the system finally the authors emphasize the need to involve and educate municipality stormwater personnel from the beginning stages and potentially begin with an operator in the loop approach until trust in the system is built given rtc systems reliance on real time communications costs and risks will include those associated with information technology infrastructure costs can include communication costs data storage costs and data access display portal costs associated risks include breaches in cyber security in which cyber criminals could either disable the rtc system or use it to intentionally cause damage or disruption as municipalities consider rtc systems they must have personnel in place specifically trained to prevent and address such attacks 5 conclusions in this research we assessed the utility of model predictive control mpc for reducing flooding in a coastal city with sea level rise slr the study area was a neighborhood in norfolk va usa a city particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding a 2 year 12 h design storm along with various tide scenarios were input into a swmm5 model of the study area this event was used because we were only considering non extreme rainfall and tidal conditions e g not hurricane level events to simulate a range of slr scenarios the base tide cycle was increased in 0 5 ft increments up to 3 5 ft the tidal increases were input for three scenarios 1 a passive system system as it currently behaves 2 the passive system with the addition of a tide gate and 3 the system with the addition of a tide gate and actuators controlled through mpc three actuators were simulated in the mpc scenario a valve at the outlet of a pond a pump to increase head and an inflatable dam to utilize inline storage the control strategies for the actuators were found using the swmm mpc library with a genetic algorithm as the optimization method flooding in the passive system increased dramatically after an increase in sea level of 1 6 ft the addition of a tide gate greatly mitigated this increase in flooding mpc further reduced overall flooding with an average effective percent reduction across slr scenarios of 32 the rate of the increase in flooding was significantly smaller with mpc than without mpc also reduced maximum node flood volume by an average of 52 for sea level increases of 2 0 ft and above it is anticipated that slr will make coastal cities more vulnerable to tidally and rainfall driven flooding in addition to the installation of a tide gate our results suggest that the use of actuators controlled by mpc could significantly reduce overall flood volumes and reduce flood severity at individual nodes in coastal cities transforming traditionally static gravity driven stormwater systems into dynamic adaptive ones could reap large benefits in cumulative reduced flood volumes over the decades 6 data model and script availability the data models and scripts used to produce the results of this study are available from hydroshare

5705,low lying low relief coastal cities have seen increased flooding due to climate change in these cities stormwater pipe outlets can be inundated by coastal waters at high tide or from storm surge making drainage impossible the objective of this research is to assess the utility of model predictive control mpc of stormwater actuators to reduce flooding in a coastal urban setting made worse by sea level rise the stormwater system and the control scenarios are simulated using the united states environmental protection agency storm water management model swmm5 coupled with a python library swmm mpc the study area is norfolk virginia usa a city which is particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding a simulated 2 year 12 h design storm and sea level rise scenarios up to 3 5 ft are applied to the model for three control scenarios 1 a passive system 2 a passive system with a tide gate backflow preventer and 3 a tide gate and three actuators a pump a valve and an inflatable dam controlled through mpc flooding in the passive system reached a tipping point and increased dramatically after a sea level rise of 1 6 ft the addition of a tide gate greatly mitigated this increase in flooding mpc further reduced overall flooding with an average effective percent reduction of 32 the rate of the increase in flooding was significantly smaller with mpc than without mpc also reduced maximum node flood volume by an average of 52 for sea level increases of 2 0 ft and above in addition to the installation of a tide gate our results suggest that the use of actuators controlled by mpc could significantly reduce overall flood volumes and reduce flood severity at individual nodes in coastal cities keywords stormwater real time control smart stormwater coastal flooding sea level rise 1 introduction coastal urban flooding is likely to increase globally in the coming decades in addition to more intense rainfall berggren et al 2012 neumann et al 2015 which can affect any city expected sea level rise slr church et al 2013 makes coastal cities particularly vulnerable to increased flooding in coastal cities the water level of the receiving water body has a large impact on drainage and flooding when receiving water levels are above the system outlets system pipes cannot drain efficiently when this happens during a storm event backups can occur in such cases not only is there a decrease in the amount of volume available in the system but the hydraulic head is also decreased slowing the rate of drainage if the receiving water levels are high enough water can backflow into stormwater pipes eventually reaching city streets and causing flooding even with no rainfall at all slr will make these problems worse as the average water level at system outfalls increases in addition to the magnitude of the tide cycle the timing of the tide cycle can significantly influence flooding in coastal cities for these cities the stormwater outfalls could be inundated at high tide and completely free at low tide thus the ability for the stormwater system to drain runoff from the city may be affected by the timing of the storm s runoff relative to the timing of the tide cycle one strategy for mitigating flooding in coastal cities is the use of real time control rtc rtc of stormwater systems consists of three major components 1 real time sensors 2 system analysis and 3 actuators sensors e g rain gauges water level sensors flow meters provide real time information on system states given the real time system states and any forecasted inputs a control decision is made based on either offline or online system analysis the control decision selected through the analysis is then implemented by actuators e g pumps gates valves which affect the behavior of the system until the next control decision schütze et al 2004 conventional stormwater systems are driven by gravity and behave statically rtc systems on the other hand employ actuators to counteract gravity and control the storage and flow of water dynamically using rtc a stormwater system can be managed in a more optimal way kerkez et al 2016 for example there may be under utilized capacity in the system in the form of unused storage in a pond or in the pipes themselves that could be utilized with rtc devices if the existing capacity is used more effectively there is less need for expensive expansions of physical infrastructure rtc in urban drainage systems has been primarily explored implemented and evaluated for combined sewer systems css with the primary objective of minimizing combined sewer overflows csos meneses et al 2018 garofalo et al 2017 nobre et al 2005 schütze et al 2004 although the research on rtc for css has been well developed in the literature there has been a smaller but growing amount of research on the use and utility of rtc in separate sewer systems which are used in most modern cities wong and kerkez 2018 research on benefits that rtc systems could provide for flood resilience in coastal cities is limited it is therefore the intent of this paper to characterize the utility of rtc for flood reduction specifically an implementation of model predictive control mpc puig et al 2009 cembrano et al 2004 schütze et al 2004 gelormino and ricker 1994 in a separated sewer system subjected to various slr scenarios while the use of rtc systems could benefit coastal cities globally the geographic focus of our study is the coastal city of norfolk virginia usa norfolk is part of a region which is experiencing faster than average slr due to land subsidence mitchell et al 2013 therefore the conditions being seen now in norfolk and its neighboring cities could be seen in coastal cities globally in the decades to come we will assess the current and future utility of mpc systems in norfolk using a simulation model the environmental protection agency epa stormwater management model version 5 swmm5 in the swmm5 model three scenarios will be simulated with increasing sea levels 1 the passive scenario representing the current state of the system 2 the passive scenario with the addition of a tide gate a mechanical device used to prevent backflow into the system and 3 the tide gate scenario with the addition of actuators controlled by mpc the simulated flood volumes from the three system scenarios will be compared and flood reduction from mpc calculated the increasing receiving water levels will then be related to slr scenarios in addition to increasing the sea level at the stormwater outfalls we will also vary the timing of the tide cycle relative to the rainfall and assess the effect of this factor on flooding in the remainder of this paper we present details about our methods including the study area of norfolk va the mpc scenarios explored and the rainfall and tidal conditions used we then present the results which demonstrate the utility of mpc in terms of flood reduction with increasing sea levels finally we discuss the results and relate the increasing receiving water levels to potential slr scenarios 2 methods 2 1 study area norfolk va usa served as the study area for this research fig 1 norfolk is a peninsula with several inland streams and much of the city is within close proximity to a tidally influenced water body the city is low lying with low topographic relief because of these geographic conditions norfolk experiences frequent flooding sadler et al 2018 ezer and atkinson 2014 mitchell et al 2013 atkinson et al 2012 given the size of the city and the complexity of the stormwater system with all its features subcatchments pipes channels junctions ponds etc our study focused on a subsection of the city the neighborhood called the hague the hague approximately three square miles is home to many of norfolk s most historic buildings and cultural attractions the hague is also key to the city s connectivity as it is adjacent to the city government buildings and the regional hospital in addition to its importance to norfolk the hague area is one of the most flood prone of the city 2 2 storm event and base tidal conditions there are two main factors that affect flooding in low lying coastal cities rainfall and tidal conditions because this paper is primarily focused on the utility of mpc over time given slr the rainfall event in all the simulations was kept constant and the tidal conditions were varied the rainfall event we used was a 2 year 12 h storm event 3 08 in bonnin et al 2018 with an scs type ii temporal distribution mockus 2012 fig 2 we chose a smaller event because we wanted the focus of the analysis on an event that would occur more frequently and because flooding from an extreme event would be difficult to impact with rtc because simulations were for events lasting a day or less other meteorological conditions such as evapotranspiration were not considered therefore the time of day of the simulated rainfall does not affect the simulation as long as the timing relative to the tide is the same observations from the sewells point tide gauging station fig 1 operated and maintained by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa 2019 served as the baseline tide conditions in the simulations hourly water level observations from a typical 24 h tide cycle were taken as a base tidal boundary condition in the simulations the tide cycle fig 2 was the hourly water level recorded at the sewells point station on august 8 2018 this day was selected because the 24 h tidal range 2 78 ft was very similar to the station s all time average 24 h tidal range 2 76 ft and because the day had a very typical tide cycle without unusual effects from wind or other factors 2 3 increasing tide levels to estimate the utility of mpc with slr the baseline hourly tidal conditions were increased in magnitude to cover a range of possible slr scenarios the hourly tide levels were increased by 0 5 foot increments up to 3 5 ft for a total of seven elevated water levels the increases in tide level were then correlated to region specific slr estimates from mitchell et al 2013 who adjusted global slr estimates with local land subsidence rates 2 4 computational model the computational model used to simulate the stormwater system in the study area was epa swmm5 it was selected based on its general use as a 1d stormwater system model and its ability to simulate stormwater system actuators burger et al 2014 swmm5 solves the st venant equations numerically to simulate dynamic routing in a stormwater system the use of dynamic wave routing is particularly important in simulating coastal systems because the systems often experience backflow from tidally influenced receiving waters in a swmm5 simulation each node has a maximum depth usually the distance from the invert elevation to the ground surface elevation when the simulated water exceeds the maximum depth at a node the excess water volume is recorded as flood volume by swmm5 at the end of a simulation both the accumulated flood volume at each node and the combined flood volume across all the nodes together is reported a swmm5 model of the hague neighborhood was obtained from the city of norfolk fig 3 the city of norfolk verified that the model behavior sufficiently represented the behavior of the physical system the model consists of 208 nodes with a wall clock time of approximately 0 5 min for running a 24 h simulation of a 12 h storm event on an 8 core desktop computer the system drains to a tidally influenced water body and a water level boundary condition was implemented at the outfall to simulate the influence of the tidal water body at the receiving waters fig 4 shows the elevation profile of the nodes closest to the outfall of the system this elevation profile is important to understanding the drainage system when the sea water exceeds the surface elevation of the node with the lowest surface elevation in the system 3 41 ft at node e143274 the sea water exits node that node causing flooding even without rainfall this is referred in coastal cities as sunny day flooding sweet et al 2016 this occurs in the hague system at high tide when the base tide cycle is increased in magnitude by 1 6 ft 2 5 addition of tide gate before simulating mpc in the system a tide gate was added to the outfall of the passive swmm5 model a tide gate is a passive device used to prevent backflow from a receiving water body the use of a tide gate was explored because the installation of a tide gate could become an important approach for minimizing tidal flooding in coastal cities as the likelihood of backflow increases with slr in swmm5 simulations tide gates are assumed to be 100 effective at preventing backflow through the system outfall that is even when the tidal boundary condition exceeds the elevation of the outfall water will not backflow into the system additionally in a swmm5 simulation water cannot flow out of an outfall with a tide gate when the outfall is inundated 2 6 addition of mpc three actuators for mitigating flooding in coastal cities were simulated in the mpc scenario first a valve at the outlet of a simulated pond point a in fig 3 was used to control the storage volume in the pond second a pump point b in fig 3 was simulated to increase the hydraulic head in the stormwater pipes this is particularly important in a low relief coastal city because the contribution of elevation head to the total hydraulic head is very small third and finally an inflatable dam was simulated to utilize inline storage in the stormwater pipes point c in fig 3 although these controls were simulated in the hague area such controls or different combinations of controls would likely be useful in many coastal cities globally since many coastal cities share similar geographic characteristics low relief low elevation the control approach in the mpc scenario was simulated using the swmm mpc python library sadler et al 2019 the main parameters in running swmm mpc include cost function parameters genetic algorithm parameters and control parameters the cost function in these simulations was the total amount of flooding that occurred in the simulation as reported in the swmm5 output for the genetic algorithm six generations were used including the initial generation with twenty individuals in the initial generation the control horizon was 30 min and the control time step was 15 min meaning that the algorithm was searching for two control settings for each actuator at every time step in the model see table 1 we estimated the time of concentration from the passive swmm model results to be 26 min the control horizon of 30 min therefore should be sufficient to prepare for and respond to the runoff response from a rainfall event although the control time step is 15 min the control algorithm still accounts for the rainfall at the 6 min simulation interval in mpc the control strategy for each actuator is determined and can be changed at every control time step 15 min in this case this makes the approach flexible that flexibility however comes at a higher computational cost since the control strategy is determined by running many iterations of the simulation model at each time step given the computational cost of running this library the mpc scenarios were executed on a high performance computer with 20 computational cores and 128 gb of ram the 15 min control time step is perhaps coarser than ideal given the time of concentration and the potential for flashy runoff response in urban watersheds to move to a finer resolution with the same control horizon however would significantly increase computational expense 2 6 1 assessment of mpc with slr to assess the utility of adding mpc in the hague stormwater system the storm event and tidal conditions described above were input into swmm mpc for each of the tidal and gate scenarios the amount of flooding that occurred in the mpc scenario was compared to the amount of flooding that occurred in the scenario with the tide gate the percent reduction of total flooding and the maximum flooding at a single node between the mpc and the tide gate scenarios was also calculated in preliminary simulations it was found that the runoff from the rainfall event alone caused flooding at some nodes that were not affected at all by tidal conditions or mpc the majority of this flooding occurred upstream of the controls at three nodes see fig 3 therefore because the volume of flooding at these three nodes in total 0 582 10 6 gallons could not be reduced with any mpc strategy it was not taken into account when calculating the percent decrease in total flooding instead an effective percent reduction of total flooding was calculated 1 effectivepercentreduction f g eff f r eff f g eff and 2 f g eff f g f uneff 3 f r eff f r f uneff where f g and f r are the total simulated flood volumes in the tide gate and mpc scenario respectively and f uneff is the flood volume unaffected by mpc and tidal conditions 0 582x 10 6 gallons in this case 2 7 timing of tide cycle in addition to the magnitude of the tide levels the timing of the tide cycle relative to the timing of a rainfall event can impact drainage and flooding in a coastal stormwater system therefore as well as analyzing changes in flooding with increasing the magnitude of tide levels the main focus of this study the timing of the tide cycle relative to the 2 year 12 h design rainfall event was also varied to assess the effect of the timing of the tide cycle the timing of the rainfall event was held constant while base tide cycle was shifted in 1 h increments from 0 11 h this was done under increases in sea level as above up to 3 5 ft increase in 0 5 ft increments in total this resulted in 96 model runs 12 variations in timing 8 increases in sea level for each increase in sea level the amount of flooding changed based on the timing of the tide cycle to quantify the impact of this timing the difference in flood volume was computed between the timing that caused the maximum flood volume and the timing that caused the minimum flood volume the difference between the maximum flood volume and minimum flood volume for a given amount of slr i is given as 4 δ f i max j 0 t f ij min j 0 t f ij where f is the total simulated flood volume j is the shift in tide cycle timing and t is the number of hourly shifts in our case 12 because there is likely a significant increase in total flooding with increasing slr the normalized difference in flooding between the tide cycle timing that caused the maximum flooding and the timing that caused the minimum flooding was also found the normalized difference for a given amount of slr was found by dividing the difference by the average of the flooding across all tide cycle timings for that amount of slr for a given amount of slr i this was computed as 5 δ f i norm max j 0 t f ij min j 0 t f ij 1 t j 0 t f ij because the timing of the tide cycle would affect both the mpc and passive systems similarly the different timings were only simulated on the passive case 2 8 comparison with regional slr scenarios and extreme water levels to put the modeled scenarios of 0 3 5 ft of slr in context the results were compared to regional slr predictions and locally observed historic extreme water levels the regional slr predictions took into account both global slr and regional land subsidence mitchell et al 2013 these predictions were made for high medium and low emission scenarios local extreme water levels were obtained for comparison from the sewells point tide station noaa 2020 3 results 3 1 flooding with slr in passive scenario fig 5 a shows the amount of flooding in the passive system given increases in sea level the amount of flooding remains fairly constant between no increase in sea level and an increase in sea level of 1 5 ft however there is a dramatic increase in flooding between increases of 1 5 ft and 2 0 ft this occurs because with an increase of 2 0 ft the elevation of the high tide 3 8 ft exceeds the 3 41 ft land surface elevation at node e143274 see fig 4 a sea level increase of 1 6 ft therefore becomes a tipping point and any increase in sea level beyond this causes much more flooding this is seen in the substantial increases in flood volume with each increase in sea level above 1 5 ft 3 2 flood reduction with addition of tide gate the impact of adding a tide gate to the outfall of the system dramatically reduced flooding with increasing sea levels compared to the passive system fig 5b this reduction was most evident with sea level increases of 2 0 ft and higher when the vast majority of the flooding was tidally driven with lower sea levels the effect was less significant this is most striking between increases in sea level of 1 5 ft and 2 0 ft the addition of the tide gate with a 1 5 ft increase in sea level reduced total flooding from 1 3 10 6 gallons to 1 1 10 6 gallons a reduction of 15 in contrast with a sea level increase of 2 0 ft the addition of a tide gate reduced the total flood volume from 8 7 10 6 gallons to 1 7 10 6 gallons an 80 reduction when sea level was increased to 3 5 ft flooding was reduced from 49 6 10 6 gallons to 3 3 10 6 gallons a 93 reduction 3 3 flood reduction with tide gate and mpc fig 5c shows the amount of flooding seen in the tide gate and mpc scenario given increases in sea level like in the tide gate scenario the total amount of flooding increases with increasing sea level however the rate of increase is slower compared to flooding in the situation without mpc see fig 6 the actuators in the mpc are able to reduce flooding at a rate higher than the tide gate alone for example from a 3 ft to a 3 5 ft increase in sea level the flooding increases by 18 without mpc with mpc the increase is only 9 mpc reduced flooding by at least 40 for each of the sea level increases below 2 0 ft fig 7 above 2 0 ft increases in sea level the percent reduction generally increased with increases in sea level up to a 35 reduction in flooding with a sea level increase of 3 5 ft in addition to reducing the total flood volume mpc reduced the maximum node flood volume with sea level increases of 2 0 ft and above fig 8 the largest reduction of maximum node flood volumes was 70 at node e143274 with a 3 5 ft sea level increase from 2 2 10 6 gallons without mpc to 0 65 10 6 gallons with mpc fig 9 shows the amount the three controls were utilized for the 0 3 5 ft slr scenarios in general each of the three controls were utilized more as the slr increased the increase of use of the orifice was not as related to the amount of slr compared to the inflatable dam and the pump this may be because it is much further from the coast than the inflatable dam and the pump the pump was utilized much more often and for longer with slr of 1 5 ft and greater the average pump run time with slr of 0 1 0 ft was 5 25 h whereas the average for slr of 1 5 3 5 ft was 18 45 h the pump time peaked at the 2 0 ft slr and then decreased this is correlated with the amount of time that the water had to drain between tide cycles which decreased with increasing slr it is possible that the use of the pump to send water more quickly downstream became less helpful with less time to drain that water 3 4 timing of tide cycle in a similar trend to the increase in flooding with slr the difference between the maximum and minimum flood volumes from different timings also increases substantially starting with a sea level increase of 2 0 ft fig 10 the difference between the maximum and minimum flood volumes however does not follow the same trend when divided by the average flood volume at each sea level increase fig 11 the largest normalized difference in fact occurs at a slr increase of 1 5 ft these results suggest that following a sea level increase of 2 0 ft the tidal flood volume is so large that the flood volume from the rainfall event and thus the timing of the tide cycle relative to the rainfall makes an increasingly smaller impact 3 5 comparison with local slr scenarios and extreme water levels fig 12 shows slr estimates specific to south east virginia mitchell et al 2013 as sea level increases with time a normal tide cycle will become increasingly problematic for coastal cities based on our analysis above there will be a dramatic increase in tidal flooding in this case study region once the high tide reaches 3 41 ft this would be an increase of the base tide cycle in fig 2 of 1 6 ft shown as the dashed line in fig 12 when this threshold is crossed we would expect to see street flooding from a typical daily tide cycle at high tide based on the slr estimates from mitchell et al 2013 the 1 6 ft threshold could be crossed as early as the year 2035 for norfolk in the high emission scenario and by 2060 for the low scenario the use of rtc for stormwater systems will become increasingly valuable with increasing average sea level in the coming decades however under current conditions storm surge and astronomical tides alone can already elevate sea levels temporarily to the point where rtc would be useful for example since 2000 four storms hurricanes isabel 2003 irene 2011 and sandy 2012 and a powerful nor easter 2009 each caused storm surge that reached over 3 93 ft 1 2 m in our study region the astronomical tide alone has a 99 likelihood of reaching 2 85 ft 0 87 meters each year in norfolk based on the 1983 2001 tidal epoch see fig 13 this is well above the 1 6 ft threshold showing that norfolk now experiences and will continue to experience flooding from the highest tide of each year the results of this analysis suggest that with the addition of a tide gate the introduction of active controls through mpc could significantly reduce flooding caused by similar storm surge and astronomical tide events 4 discussion although the use of a tide gate makes a greater difference in overall flooding compared to the passive scenario the use of mpc further improves the system performance not only does mpc reduce the overall volume of flooding but it also reduces the maximum node flood volume thus more evenly distributing the flood volume across the nodes in the system less severe flooding at any given node could mean less disruption and or damage to the community in our analysis the utility of mpc in terms of percent flood volume reduction and absolute flood volume reduction generally increased with increasing sea levels the largest increases in utility occurred with higher increases 3 0 ft and 3 5 ft this suggests that as coastal cities consider investment and mitigation alternatives the investment in rtc and mpc could provide a greater return on investment in coming years to make the results and inferences more complete future work should be done to quantify uncertainty in the results one source of uncertainty in this analysis includes the model itself and how well it represents the physical system swmm5 is a 1d model and therefore cannot simulate some aspects of coastal flooding for example swmm5 only records a volume of water that is flooded from a given node and does not simulate the depth of flooding given detailed land elevation data however this could be calculated using the height above nearest drainage method hand nobre et al 2011 or a similar method knowing the depth of flooding and the reduction of depth by mpc would be another way to assess the utility of mpc another uncertainty in the results is in the optimality of the control strategies found in the mpc scenario by swmm mpc the swmm5 model is used as a black box model without the optimizer having any knowledge of the underlying mathematical structure of the governing equations because of this the control strategies found by swmm mpc cannot be guaranteed to be optimal future work could be done to analyze the optimality of the strategies found through swmm mpc in this analysis we simulated three actuators these were chosen in an ad hoc manner based on the behavior of the model and the constraints of the physical system a methodology for systematically selecting which actuators should be used and where they should be placed would be a useful extension of this work such a methodology could be especially useful as coastal cities seek adaptation alternatives the monetary cost for adding controls into the system could be added to the cost function as an important practical consideration for municipalities optimizing the placement and selection of controls could be an addition to the swmm mpc software because the focus of this study was on flooding impacts due to slr the rainfall magnitude and intensity were not changed however climate change in addition to causing slr is anticipated to increase rainfall intensity berggren et al 2012 neumann et al 2015 it would therefore be useful in addition to increasing sea level in the simulations to increase rainfall intensity and or volume with time a recent study in the region quantified increases in design storm rainfall volumes with climate change smirnov et al 2018 by analyzing historic rainfall data and climate models the authors recommend 20 higher rainfall volumes for design storms these projections could be used to adjust design storms and run additional scenarios using the methods of this study barriers to adoption of rtc for stormwater systems by municipalities include costs and risk monetary costs include the costs of the equipment installation and maintenance the cost of installation and maintenance can be especially high in cities with limited available space for example the location of the simulated inflatable dam in our study is a busy intersection near cultural attractions government buildings and the city s downtown area the city of norfolk would therefore have to take into consideration both the cost of the disruption to the community as well as the capital costs of construction when weighing against the benefits less straightforward to estimate and perhaps a larger barrier than monetary cost is that of potential risks of rtc systems in stormwater infrastructure although successfully deployed in some cities for combined sewer systems the use of rtc in separated sewer systems is still new schütze et al 2004 provide some suggestions for overcoming institutional barriers for adopting rtc systems although primarily focused on combined sewer systems many of the suggestions apply to separated sewer systems as well a key suggestion made by the authors in regards to safety and risk when implementing rtc is that in the worst case scenario the rtc system should perform as well or better than the system before the installation of the rtc additionally schütze et al 2004 suggests that equipment failure should be considered inevitable and therefore redundancy should be built into the system finally the authors emphasize the need to involve and educate municipality stormwater personnel from the beginning stages and potentially begin with an operator in the loop approach until trust in the system is built given rtc systems reliance on real time communications costs and risks will include those associated with information technology infrastructure costs can include communication costs data storage costs and data access display portal costs associated risks include breaches in cyber security in which cyber criminals could either disable the rtc system or use it to intentionally cause damage or disruption as municipalities consider rtc systems they must have personnel in place specifically trained to prevent and address such attacks 5 conclusions in this research we assessed the utility of model predictive control mpc for reducing flooding in a coastal city with sea level rise slr the study area was a neighborhood in norfolk va usa a city particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding a 2 year 12 h design storm along with various tide scenarios were input into a swmm5 model of the study area this event was used because we were only considering non extreme rainfall and tidal conditions e g not hurricane level events to simulate a range of slr scenarios the base tide cycle was increased in 0 5 ft increments up to 3 5 ft the tidal increases were input for three scenarios 1 a passive system system as it currently behaves 2 the passive system with the addition of a tide gate and 3 the system with the addition of a tide gate and actuators controlled through mpc three actuators were simulated in the mpc scenario a valve at the outlet of a pond a pump to increase head and an inflatable dam to utilize inline storage the control strategies for the actuators were found using the swmm mpc library with a genetic algorithm as the optimization method flooding in the passive system increased dramatically after an increase in sea level of 1 6 ft the addition of a tide gate greatly mitigated this increase in flooding mpc further reduced overall flooding with an average effective percent reduction across slr scenarios of 32 the rate of the increase in flooding was significantly smaller with mpc than without mpc also reduced maximum node flood volume by an average of 52 for sea level increases of 2 0 ft and above it is anticipated that slr will make coastal cities more vulnerable to tidally and rainfall driven flooding in addition to the installation of a tide gate our results suggest that the use of actuators controlled by mpc could significantly reduce overall flood volumes and reduce flood severity at individual nodes in coastal cities transforming traditionally static gravity driven stormwater systems into dynamic adaptive ones could reap large benefits in cumulative reduced flood volumes over the decades 6 data model and script availability the data models and scripts used to produce the results of this study are available from hydroshare

5706,the similarity brings great convenience to the description of the dam break flows the previous works mainly focus on the similarity of dam break flows under the condition of dry bed downstream in view of the fact that there is often a certain tail water depth in a river this paper deals with both the gravity similarity and self similarity of dam break flows in a horizontal and smooth channel with a wet bed downstream condition by using both physical and numerical models in the laboratory tests the digital image processing technique is adopted for flow measurement providing water surface profiles stage hydrographs and cross sectional mean velocity three different upstream depths and ten water depth ratios α i e the ratio of initial downstream water depth against the upstream water depth ranging from 0 05 to 0 9 are considered the numerical simulations on the vertical two dimensional experiments are carried out using a computational fluid dynamics solver providing velocity profiles in addition to the hydraulic parameters obtained in experiments the following observations are made 1 the water surface profiles stage hydrographs mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles are shown to satisfy the gravity similarity well 2 the gravity similarity characteristic of the vertical velocity profiles in the reservoir performs better than that in the flooded area 3 the water surface profiles mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles approximately satisfy the self similarity after a period of time for α 0 3 4 the undulations both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front destroy the self similarity of dam break flow for α 0 3 except that the self similarity is valid in two non undulation areas located upstream the extra negative wave and in the neighborhood of dam site after a period of time 5 the gravity similarity could be applied in the small scaled physical model of dam break flow and the water depth ratio must be considered when applying the self similarity 6 the measurements and numerical simulations with the large eddy simulation les model show satisfactory agreement implying that the les modeling is a viable approach for accurately predicting the dam break flows with a wet bed downstream condition keywords dam break flow gravity similarity self similarity wet bed digital image processing large eddy simulation les 1 introduction dam break floods often result in significant loss of life and property bosa and petti 2013 haltas et al 2016 the propagation characteristic of dam break flows have always been the research focus whitham 1955 chen and simons 1979 bukreev and gusev 2005 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 wang et al 2016 2017 2018 turhan et al 2019 similar phenomena exist in many hydraulic problems stansby et al 1998 balachandar et al 2000 leal et al 2006 dey et al 2018 the gravity similarity refers to that when the force is mainly gravity other forces are relatively small and could be ignored the froude numbers of two similar systems should be equal the hydraulic problems in prototype could be solved in a small scaled model by using the characteristics of gravity similarity if the spatial distribution characteristics of flow at different time can be obtained from one another by a similarity transformation this phenomenon is called self similar barenblatt 1996 the self similarity simplifies the calculation process and the flow description it brings great convenience for analyzing the flow properties as a referential solution for a dry frictionless horizontal channel of rectangular cross section the solution presented by ritter 1892 has an important and well known feature of self similarity as a referential for wet bed conditions downstream from the dam site stoker s 1957 solution considering the influence of the initial downstream water depth is also self similar under the conditions of horizontal channel and zero friction wu et al 1993 1999 established similarity solutions of dam break waves in the case of a prismatic channel with complex section shape in dry bed downstream and a trapezoidal section in wet bed downstream respectively and proposed that the dam break flow movement has the characteristic of self similarity chen et al 2011 theoretically confirmed the self similarity of dam break flow in a horizontal and smooth channel by introducing scale transformations in saint venant equations the measured water surface profiles both in wet and dry bed conditions by stansby et al 1998 under two different initial upstream depths are shown to satisfy approximately froude scaling or gravity similarity the velocity profiles in the dry bed case acquired by larocque et al 2013a b are self similar at different distances upstream of the dam and under different initial head the literatures survey suggests that the similarity of dam break flow is still not analyzed sufficiently for example when the tail water depth is relatively large the analytical models on the base of the saint venant equations e g ritter 1892 stoker 1957 wu et al 1993 1999 are unable to describe the water surface fluctuations downstream stansby et al 1998 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 therefore they cannot be used for investigating the similarity of dam break flow although the gravity similarity of dam break flow is suggested by stansby et al 1998 on the base of the measured surface profiles under two different upstream depths in the case of wet bed downstream there is lack of the self similarity analysis the conclusion for the self similarity of velocity profiles drawn by larocque et al 2013a b are limited to the dry bed case there is often a certain water depth downstream of a dam in practice what are the characteristics of similarity for the dam break flow under wet bed conditions e g water surface profile flow velocity etc how does the tail water depth affect the similarity obviously it is difficult to find answers for these questions from existing research results in this paper the combination of physical and numerical experiments will be used to analyze the similarity of dam break flow in wet bed downstream the physical experiments are carried out in a self made large scale flume under the condition of three different reservoir depths and ten different tailwater depths the evolution of dam break flows is synchronously recorded by eight adjacent ccd cameras meanwhile both the stage hydrographs and the water surface profiles are directly acquired from the recorded video images processed by means of the image processing technique the commercially available computational fluid dynamics cfd software package flow 3d is used to simulate the flow fields the hydraulic characteristics of dam break flow will be analyzed from the similarity s view 2 experimental setup 2 1 instruments the experimental flume with a rectangular cross section and flat bottom is 18 m long and 1 m wide which is divided into two parts i e reservoir and downstream flooded area by a 15 mm thick fiberglass board at the location of 8 37 m as shown in fig 1 where a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system is specified the flume is made of transparent tempered glass which is supported by steel skeleton a tailwater gate is located at the downstream end of the flume for providing wet bed conditions the maximum time for

acceleration of gravity taking as 9 81 m s2 eight ccd cameras are arranged to capture the evolution of the flow at the flume side with a distance of 1 4 m they are simultaneously turned on by a wireless remote control the lens is a wide angle lens with a resolution of 1920 1440 and the shooting speed is 48 frames per second 2 2 data acquisition technique the process of experimental data acquisition is mainly divided into two steps the first step is to obtain the external and internal parameters of each camera by using the calibration plate and the calibration toolbox in matlab the mathworks and inc 2016 next using these data and the calibration function to obtain the corrected image the second step is to perform image analysis based on the corrected image to obtain the stage hydrographs and the water surface profiles more details can be found in the literatures liu et al 2018 2019b 3 numerical simulation 3 1 turbulence model and tru vof method as an alternative cost effective means of simulating dam break flows cfd complements experimental fluid dynamics by providing reliable and detailed results of the flow filed because it is quite difficult to conduct detailed measurements of these flows due to the highly transient nature of dam break flows the software package flow 3d is widely used for simulating the movement of dam break flow kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 oertel and bung 2012 turhan et al 2019 larocque et al 2013a b compared the results from les and k ε models both in simulating 2d and 3d dam break flows and suggested that the les model performs better than k ε model for capturing the local details of flow fields therefore the les model is adopted in present study the tru vof volume of fluid method is selected to capture the free surface and mainly consists of three parts flow science inc 2016 one is to locate the surface the other is to track the fluid surface when the free surface moves to the calculation grid and the third is to apply the boundary condition of the surface hirt and nichols 1981 improved vof method the prototype of the tru vof technology and then simulated the dam break flow it is found that the improved vof method has great ability to capture the free surface compared to other methods 3 2 computational domain initial and boundary conditions a vertical two dimensional dam break flow is considered in the numerical simulation the computational domain is consistent with the physical model the lifting of the gate initially arranged in the flume is simulated by the gmo general moving objects module the sensitivity of the grid size is tested during the calculation simulations conducted with four grid sizes i e δx δz 0 003 m 0 005 m 0 01 m and 0 015 m shows insignificant differences in results when the grid size is smaller than 0 005 m based on the consideration of accuracy and computational time the grid sizes of δx δz 0 005 m are used corresponding to the grid number are 216 000 360 000 and 504 000 for hu 0 2 m 0 4 m and 0 6 m respectively the initial condition is defined by designating areas of water both in the reservoir and the flooded channel to specified levels with air filling the rest of the grid according to the physical model conditions the top boundary is specified as the atmospheric pressure the downstream boundary as the outflow the upstream end and bottom as solid walls and the side as symmetry the dam break flow is significantly influenced by the initial water depths in the upstream and downstream reaches kocaman 2008 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 turhan et al 2019 to analyze the effect of those initial conditions on the similarity of dam break flow three initial upstream water depths and ten water depth ratios defined as α hd hu where hd initial downstream water depth are considered both in the physical and numerical simulations as shown in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 propagation pattern of dam break flows the evolution of dam break flows with different α at hu 0 4 m is analyzed in the initial stage of the dam break flow i e t 0 417 s there will appear water leaps due to the blocking of the downstream still water the deformation of water surface gradually decreases with increasing α the shape of water leaps is similar to a sickle when α 0 05 and 0 1 and looks like a small mountain when α 0 2 the bulge amplitude gradually decreases when the value of α increases as shown in fig 2 a for 0 05 α 0 2 both the rarefaction wave zone and steady zone are formed in the whole evolution area liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 2020 moreover the water depth in the steady zone is essentially stable and the water surface in the reservoir does not fluctuate for α 0 3 extra negative waves liu et al 2019a take place and propagate toward the reservoir from the dam site which results in fluctuations of water surface in the rarefaction wave the wavelength of extra negative waves gradually decreases under the same α and the extra negative waves evolve faster as the α increases as shown in fig 2 b and c the water surface fluctuations are observed both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front when α 0 4 the first crest closest to the wave front liu et al 2019a exhibits significant aeration and attenuation when α 0 4 and 0 5 and these phenomena are more intense for α 0 4 as compared to that for α 0 5 the first crest no longer exhibits aeration and attenuation in the propagation process when α 0 6 and the series of waves move to the downstream channel in a more stable form it is found that the wave peak gradually declines and the wavelength gradually decreases with time the propagation speed of the first crest gradually decreases as the value of α increases although the undulations propagate both in the upstream and downstream directions from the dam site the flow pattern in the neighborhood of the dam site i e referred to as a non undulation area will tend to be non undular after a period of time another non undulation area is observed upstream of the extra negative wave 4 2 gravity similarity analysis in order to analyze the gravity similarity characteristic of dam break flows in the wet bed downstream the following scale is used to nondimensionalize hydraulic parameters 1 t t h u g 2 h h h u 3 u u g h u where t h and u represent the dimensionless time water depth and mean velocity respectively h and u are dimensional water depth and mean velocity respectively the dimensionless distance from the dam in the gravity similarity is calculated by x hu 4 2 1 water depth it is well knows that the evolution form of dam break flows is related to the value of α there will be extra negative waves propagating to the reservoir area when α 0 3 and a series of waves move in the downstream direction for α 0 4 the first crest will appear aeration and attenuation when α 0 4 and 0 5 thus the dam break flows with α 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 are selected for analysis in the case of three different upstream depth three dimensionless times t 2 48 4 95 and 9 90 are selected respectively the relative root mean square error rrmse is used for estimating the difference between numerical and physical results as expressed 4 rrmse 1 n i 1 n y i e i e i 2 100 where n is the total number of all measured data points yi is the numerical value ei is the measured value the measured and computed water surface profiles under three upstream depths for different values of α and t are presented in fig 3 in the initial stage of the dam break i e t 2 48 the water surfaces are distorted and the dimensionless water depth profiles are slightly different from each other under three different upstream depths however the movement of dam break flows essentially satisfies the gravity similarity at t 4 95 and 9 90 and both the extra negative waves in the reservoir and the series of waves in the downstream channel does not affect the characteristic of gravity similarity the dimensionless water surface profiles under different upstream depths are roughly coincident for a given value of α implying that the movement of the dam break flows is dominated by gravity the rrsme values are small and the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results the stage hydrographs under three upstream depths for different values of α are discussed at the positions of x hu 3 5 p1 11 p2 2 5 p3 and 11 p4 as shown in fig 4 in the reservoir the water depth declines after the arrival of the negative wave front the water level drop is observed earlier at p1 than that at p2 because the position p1 is closer to the dam site the stage hydrographs under three upstream depths overlap each other for a while after the arrival of the negative wave front at the upstream end of reservoir the curves with hu 0 6 m first deviate from the stage hydrographs with hu 0 2 m and then the deviation of curves with hu 0 4 m takes place the reason is that the reservoir length for different hu in experiments is not scaled on the base of the the upstream water depth ratio for example the reservoir length with hu 0 4 m and 0 6 m should be twice and triple that with hu 0 2 m respectively the water depths with hu 0 4 m and 0 6 m fall sharply from the inceptions of curve deviation because of the limited water volume stored in the reservoir in addition the deviation inception depends on the distance of the measurement position from the dam site for a given hu for instance the deviation at p1 closer to the dam is found later than that at p2 as a disturbance the deviation propagates in the downstream direction the stage hydrographs at a given location for different hu remain similar until the arrival of the deviation the water depth at p1 experiences a slight fluctuation after a period of drop when α 0 3 because of the extra negative waves the water depth fluctuates more obviously the inception of fluctuations occurs earlier the fluctuation frequency is larger and the wavelength is shorter for α 0 5 and 0 7 when compared with the case of α 0 3 the fluctuation at p2 occurs later than that at p1 as the position p2 is farther from the dam in the downstream channel the water levels at the measurement sections rise sharply due to the arrivals of dam break shock waves the water level rise takes place earlier at p3 than that at p4 because the position p3 is closer to the dam site similar stage hydrographs with three upstream water depths for a given α are observed for a period of time the deviations of curves with hu 0 4 m and 0 6 m from the stage hydrographs with hu 0 2 m are also found still resulting from the limited length of reservoir and flooded area the rarefaction wave zone extends toward downstream of the dam when α 0 1 resulting in a second rise on the graph at the position p3 which is closer to the dam site the second rise of the water level at p4 is not observed because the position p4 far away from the dam is beyond the affected area of the rarefaction wave the rarefaction wave zone does not extend toward the downstream of the dam when α 0 2 and 0 3 thus the second rise of water depth is no longer found at p3 the stage hydrographs both at p3 and p4 fluctuate significantly in the early stage when α 0 5 and 0 7 and gradually stabilize within a certain range after a period of time then second rises of the water depth are observed which are produced by the partially reflected waves from the tailwater gate the reflected waves produce fluctuations of water levels once again 4 2 2 mean velocity the cross sectional mean velocity is determined from the difference between the imaged inflow and outflow volumes at a certain section as expressed by eq 5 which is similar with the method used by cestero et al 2014 bento et al 2017 and melis et al 2019 5 u t w t δ t w t b h δ t where u t is the mean flow velocity at time t w t and w t δ t is the volumes for a certain section at the time t and t δt respectively b is the channel width δt is the time step taking 1 48 s the distributions of the mean velocity along the flume under different upstream water depths for different α are shown in fig 5 a zone with a relatively stable velocity is formed downstream of the dam when α 0 3 the velocity in the reservoir fluctuates significantly when α 0 3 resulting from the extra negative wave the velocity is also fluctuating due to the series of waves in the downstream side when α 0 5 however it is found that the gravity similarity characteristic still exists for the mean velocity the numerical simulations are in good agreement with measurements and the rrmse value for the numerical model decreases gradually as the value of α increases the variations of mean velocity at p1 p2 p3 and p4 with the time are shown in fig 6 the mean velocity in the reservoir climbs up first and then declines gradually when α 0 1 and 0 2 the mean velocity fluctuates in the later stage because of the extra negative waves when α 0 3 and the oscillation becomes more intensive as the value of α arises the mean velocity in some positions has a negative value when α 0 5 and 0 7 because the extra negative waves continuously propagate upward into the reservoir resulting in a reverse flow during some time intervals in the reach downstream of the dam the mean velocity drops slightly after a sharp rise due to the arrival of rarefaction wave front when α 0 1 while the mean velocities at p3 and p4 can be maintained for a while when α 0 2 and 0 3 the mean velocities for α 0 5 and 0 7 show significant fluctuations in the initial phase and will restore stability negative values of mean velocity are found in the downstream positions being produced by the reflected waves from the downstream gate which is used for providing wet bed conditions the gravity similarity characteristic still exist for the mean velocity under three different upstream water depths the numerical simulations are also consistent with the experimental results 4 2 3 horizontal and vertical velocity profiles the velocity components both in horizontal and vertical directions i e ux and uz under different α are also nondimensionalized by eq 3 for analyzing the gravity similarity characteristic the dimensionless time t 14 and several positions of x hu 0 2 5 5 10 are selected here the corresponding dimensional times and dimensional distances under three upstream depths are listed in table 2 the horizontal velocity profiles ux in the reservoir are characterized by a shear layer overlain by a stable layer as shown in fig 7 where hs represents the local water depth the velocity profiles at positions of x hu 2 5 and 5 are similar to those in the reservoir except that the velocity magnitude close to the water surface is significantly larger at the position of x hu 10 which is located in the wave front region the horizontal velocity profiles are shown to satisfy the gravity similarity fig 8 presents vertical velocity profiles uz under three upstream water depths where the leftward and rightward swings in the profiles indicate the downward and upward velocity direction respectively in the reservoir the vertical velocity linearly increases with the water depth and the profiles under three different upstream water depths are essentially coincident with each other at α 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 however the coincidence of velocity profiles is not found in the downstream channel when α 0 5 and 0 7 there are certain deviations at all considered locations except for the position of x hu 10 the gravity similarity characteristic of the vertical velocity in the flooded area is not good as that in the reservoir 4 3 self similarity analysis 4 3 1 water depth the dimensionless distance from the dam in the self similarity involves the independent variable t which differs from the one i e x hu in the gravity similarity as expressed by 6 x x t g h u substituting eq 1 into eq 6 yields x x thu thus the curves for three different upstream depths can also overlap each other at the same dimensionless time in the self similarity analysis therefore only the water surface profiles for the case of hu 0 4 m are used to analyze the characteristics of self similarity as shown in fig 9 the water surfaces are seriously distorted due to the water leaps in the initial stage of dam break flows t 2 48 when α 0 3 which cause the dimensionless water depth to be significantly different from that in other moments owing to the sharp change in the streamline curvature lauber and hager 1998 leal et al 2002 the water depths in the rarefaction wave zone are also different from those during t 2 48 9 90 for a period of time t 9 90 14 86 the dimensionless water surface profiles are basically coincident with each other and approximately satisfy self similarity when α 0 3 the dimensionless water surface profiles do not show self similar due to both the extra negative waves and the series of waves in downstream channel this may be explained as following the self similarity solutions derived from saint venant equations for dam break flows in the wet bed condition e g stoker 1957 wu et al 1999 chen et al 2011 may serve as a criterion for evaluating whether or not the movement of dam break flow is self similar and all of those solutions provide a parabolic rarefaction fan and a sharp shock front when α 0 3 the dam break wave propagation can be predicted by those self similarity solutions i e the self similarity law is valid for α 0 3 physical undulations are formed both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front which cannot be described with the aforementioned solutions liu et al 2019a it is indicated that the self similarity solution is limited to the condition of α 0 3 i e the self similarity law is not applicable to the case of α 0 3 from the previous analysis two non undulation areas which are approximately unaffected by undulations exist for large values of α the water surface profiles in the range of x 1 for α 0 5 and 0 7 are presented in fig 10 where the two non undulation areas are marked it is shown that the profiles are coincident with each other for different dimensionless times in these regions the numerical model could satisfactorily predict the water surface profiles along the channel 4 3 2 mean velocity the distributions of the cross sectional mean velocity under different dimensionless times are shown in fig 11 the peak velocity appears where the water leaps are formed in the initial stage of the dam break flow being significantly different from that at other locations the self similarity characteristic of the dam break flow begins to appear after a period of time when α 0 3 for α 0 3 the overall characteristics of self similarity are also destroyed because of the undulations both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front caused by the extra negative waves and the series of waves in downstream channel respectively however the distribution curves of mean velocity for large values of t in the two non undulation areas are self similar for a given α as shown in fig 12 4 3 3 horizontal and vertical velocity profiles for analyzing the self similarity characteristic both the horizontal and vertical velocity profiles at the dimensionless positions of x 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 and 0 are selected as shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively table 3 presents the corresponding dimensional times and distances it is worth noting that the horizontal velocity profiles at each position need a period of time to be self similar when α 0 3 the velocity profiles also show self similar when the time is relatively backward at x 0 8 to 0 4 when α 0 5 and 0 7 significant discrepancies among the horizontal velocity profiles are observed at x 0 6 and 0 8 for any time resulting from the undulations in the shock front it is seen that the vertical velocity magnitude at the same dimensionless position in the reservoir decreases gradually with time when α 0 5 and 0 7 the velocity direction is influenced by extra negative waves being obviously different from those for other water depth ratios the vertical velocity magnitude in the region of x 0 0 4 basically remains zero at t 19 80 it is indicated that this region is not affected by waves and the horizontal velocity dominates the flow although the velocity profiles at each position are basically coincident at t 14 86 and 19 80 when α 0 3 the vertical velocity is quite close to zero at these moments it does not indicate that it has good self similarity the velocity profiles are obviously affected both by extra negative waves and the series of waves in downstream channel when α 0 5 and 0 7 and the vertical velocity profiles are not self similar 5 conclusions in the present study both the gravity similarity and self similarity of dam break flows under the condition of wet bed downstream are investigated by both using physical and numerical models three different upstream water depths and ten different water depth ratios are considered the main findings are as follows water leaps are formed downstream of the dam in the initial stage with a wet bed downstream condition extra negative waves propagating in the upstream direction are observed in the reservoir when α 0 3 resulting in undulations in the rarefaction wave a series of waves propagating in the downstream direction emerge in the flooded area when α 0 4 producing undulations in the shock wave front aeration and attenuation in the shock wave front are found for α 0 4 and 0 5 and the series of waves move in a stable form when α 0 6 the water surface profiles stage hydrographs mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles in dam break flows show a great gravity similarity characteristic the vertical velocity profiles satisfy the gravity similarity law better in the reservoir when compared to that in the flooded area the self similarity characteristics of dam break flows not as good as the gravity similarity significantly depend on the tail water depth the water surface profiles mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles are shown to approximately satisfy the self similarity law after a period of time for α 0 3 the overall self similarity characteristics vanish due to the undulations both in the the rarefaction wave and the shock wave front for α 0 3 except for two non undulation areas where the flow presents self similar after a period of time the study shows that numerical simulations with the large eddy simulation les model are in satisfactory agreement with the measurements it is indicated that the les model can be used for accurately predicting the dam break flows with a wet bed downstream condition the findings contribute to the understanding of the effect of wet bed downstream conditions on the similarity of dam break flows it is indicated that the dam break flow in prototype can be studied in a small scaled physical model by using the gravity similarity and the water depths both in the upstream and downstream reaches must be considered when applying the self similarity because the self similar characteristics of the dam break flow are affected by the water depth ratio when α 0 3 credit authorship contribution statement bo wang conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing

5706,the similarity brings great convenience to the description of the dam break flows the previous works mainly focus on the similarity of dam break flows under the condition of dry bed downstream in view of the fact that there is often a certain tail water depth in a river this paper deals with both the gravity similarity and self similarity of dam break flows in a horizontal and smooth channel with a wet bed downstream condition by using both physical and numerical models in the laboratory tests the digital image processing technique is adopted for flow measurement providing water surface profiles stage hydrographs and cross sectional mean velocity three different upstream depths and ten water depth ratios α i e the ratio of initial downstream water depth against the upstream water depth ranging from 0 05 to 0 9 are considered the numerical simulations on the vertical two dimensional experiments are carried out using a computational fluid dynamics solver providing velocity profiles in addition to the hydraulic parameters obtained in experiments the following observations are made 1 the water surface profiles stage hydrographs mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles are shown to satisfy the gravity similarity well 2 the gravity similarity characteristic of the vertical velocity profiles in the reservoir performs better than that in the flooded area 3 the water surface profiles mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles approximately satisfy the self similarity after a period of time for α 0 3 4 the undulations both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front destroy the self similarity of dam break flow for α 0 3 except that the self similarity is valid in two non undulation areas located upstream the extra negative wave and in the neighborhood of dam site after a period of time 5 the gravity similarity could be applied in the small scaled physical model of dam break flow and the water depth ratio must be considered when applying the self similarity 6 the measurements and numerical simulations with the large eddy simulation les model show satisfactory agreement implying that the les modeling is a viable approach for accurately predicting the dam break flows with a wet bed downstream condition keywords dam break flow gravity similarity self similarity wet bed digital image processing large eddy simulation les 1 introduction dam break floods often result in significant loss of life and property bosa and petti 2013 haltas et al 2016 the propagation characteristic of dam break flows have always been the research focus whitham 1955 chen and simons 1979 bukreev and gusev 2005 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 wang et al 2016 2017 2018 turhan et al 2019 similar phenomena exist in many hydraulic problems stansby et al 1998 balachandar et al 2000 leal et al 2006 dey et al 2018 the gravity similarity refers to that when the force is mainly gravity other forces are relatively small and could be ignored the froude numbers of two similar systems should be equal the hydraulic problems in prototype could be solved in a small scaled model by using the characteristics of gravity similarity if the spatial distribution characteristics of flow at different time can be obtained from one another by a similarity transformation this phenomenon is called self similar barenblatt 1996 the self similarity simplifies the calculation process and the flow description it brings great convenience for analyzing the flow properties as a referential solution for a dry frictionless horizontal channel of rectangular cross section the solution presented by ritter 1892 has an important and well known feature of self similarity as a referential for wet bed conditions downstream from the dam site stoker s 1957 solution considering the influence of the initial downstream water depth is also self similar under the conditions of horizontal channel and zero friction wu et al 1993 1999 established similarity solutions of dam break waves in the case of a prismatic channel with complex section shape in dry bed downstream and a trapezoidal section in wet bed downstream respectively and proposed that the dam break flow movement has the characteristic of self similarity chen et al 2011 theoretically confirmed the self similarity of dam break flow in a horizontal and smooth channel by introducing scale transformations in saint venant equations the measured water surface profiles both in wet and dry bed conditions by stansby et al 1998 under two different initial upstream depths are shown to satisfy approximately froude scaling or gravity similarity the velocity profiles in the dry bed case acquired by larocque et al 2013a b are self similar at different distances upstream of the dam and under different initial head the literatures survey suggests that the similarity of dam break flow is still not analyzed sufficiently for example when the tail water depth is relatively large the analytical models on the base of the saint venant equations e g ritter 1892 stoker 1957 wu et al 1993 1999 are unable to describe the water surface fluctuations downstream stansby et al 1998 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 therefore they cannot be used for investigating the similarity of dam break flow although the gravity similarity of dam break flow is suggested by stansby et al 1998 on the base of the measured surface profiles under two different upstream depths in the case of wet bed downstream there is lack of the self similarity analysis the conclusion for the self similarity of velocity profiles drawn by larocque et al 2013a b are limited to the dry bed case there is often a certain water depth downstream of a dam in practice what are the characteristics of similarity for the dam break flow under wet bed conditions e g water surface profile flow velocity etc how does the tail water depth affect the similarity obviously it is difficult to find answers for these questions from existing research results in this paper the combination of physical and numerical experiments will be used to analyze the similarity of dam break flow in wet bed downstream the physical experiments are carried out in a self made large scale flume under the condition of three different reservoir depths and ten different tailwater depths the evolution of dam break flows is synchronously recorded by eight adjacent ccd cameras meanwhile both the stage hydrographs and the water surface profiles are directly acquired from the recorded video images processed by means of the image processing technique the commercially available computational fluid dynamics cfd software package flow 3d is used to simulate the flow fields the hydraulic characteristics of dam break flow will be analyzed from the similarity s view 2 experimental setup 2 1 instruments the experimental flume with a rectangular cross section and flat bottom is 18 m long and 1 m wide which is divided into two parts i e reservoir and downstream flooded area by a 15 mm thick fiberglass board at the location of 8 37 m as shown in fig 1 where a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system is specified the flume is made of transparent tempered glass which is supported by steel skeleton a tailwater gate is located at the downstream end of the flume for providing wet bed conditions the maximum time for lifting the gate is 0 25 s when the upstream depth is 0 6 m satisfying the transient dam failure condition suggested by lauber and hager 1998 i e t 2hu g 1 2 0 35 s hu is upstream water depth g is the acceleration of gravity taking as 9 81 m s2 eight ccd cameras are arranged to capture the evolution of the flow at the flume side with a distance of 1 4 m they are simultaneously turned on by a wireless remote control the lens is a wide angle lens with a resolution of 1920 1440 and the shooting speed is 48 frames per second 2 2 data acquisition technique the process of experimental data acquisition is mainly divided into two steps the first step is to obtain the external and internal parameters of each camera by using the calibration plate and the calibration toolbox in matlab the mathworks and inc 2016 next using these data and the calibration function to obtain the corrected image the second step is to perform image analysis based on the corrected image to obtain the stage hydrographs and the water surface profiles more details can be found in the literatures liu et al 2018 2019b 3 numerical simulation 3 1 turbulence model and tru vof method as an alternative cost effective means of simulating dam break flows cfd complements experimental fluid dynamics by providing reliable and detailed results of the flow filed because it is quite difficult to conduct detailed measurements of these flows due to the highly transient nature of dam break flows the software package flow 3d is widely used for simulating the movement of dam break flow kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 oertel and bung 2012 turhan et al 2019 larocque et al 2013a b compared the results from les and k ε models both in simulating 2d and 3d dam break flows and suggested that the les model performs better than k ε model for capturing the local details of flow fields therefore the les model is adopted in present study the tru vof volume of fluid method is selected to capture the free surface and mainly consists of three parts flow science inc 2016 one is to locate the surface the other is to track the fluid surface when the free surface moves to the calculation grid and the third is to apply the boundary condition of the surface hirt and nichols 1981 improved vof method the prototype of the tru vof technology and then simulated the dam break flow it is found that the improved vof method has great ability to capture the free surface compared to other methods 3 2 computational domain initial and boundary conditions a vertical two dimensional dam break flow is considered in the numerical simulation the computational domain is consistent with the physical model the lifting of the gate initially arranged in the flume is simulated by the gmo general moving objects module the sensitivity of the grid size is tested during the calculation simulations conducted with four grid sizes i e δx δz 0 003 m 0 005 m 0 01 m and 0 015 m shows insignificant differences in results when the grid size is smaller than 0 005 m based on the consideration of accuracy and computational time the grid sizes of δx δz 0 005 m are used corresponding to the grid number are 216 000 360 000 and 504 000 for hu 0 2 m 0 4 m and 0 6 m respectively the initial condition is defined by designating areas of water both in the reservoir and the flooded channel to specified levels with air filling the rest of the grid according to the physical model conditions the top boundary is specified as the atmospheric pressure the downstream boundary as the outflow the upstream end and bottom as solid walls and the side as symmetry the dam break flow is significantly influenced by the initial water depths in the upstream and downstream reaches kocaman 2008 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 turhan et al 2019 to analyze the effect of those initial conditions on the similarity of dam break flow three initial upstream water depths and ten water depth ratios defined as α hd hu where hd initial downstream water depth are considered both in the physical and numerical simulations as shown in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 propagation pattern of dam break flows the evolution of dam break flows with different α at hu 0 4 m is analyzed in the initial stage of the dam break flow i e t 0 417 s there will appear water leaps due to the blocking of the downstream still water the deformation of water surface gradually decreases with increasing α the shape of water leaps is similar to a sickle when α 0 05 and 0 1 and looks like a small mountain when α 0 2 the bulge amplitude gradually decreases when the value of α increases as shown in fig 2 a for 0 05 α 0 2 both the rarefaction wave zone and steady zone are formed in the whole evolution area liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 2020 moreover the water depth in the steady zone is essentially stable and the water surface in the reservoir does not fluctuate for α 0 3 extra negative waves liu et al 2019a take place and propagate toward the reservoir from the dam site which results in fluctuations of water surface in the rarefaction wave the wavelength of extra negative waves gradually decreases under the same α and the extra negative waves evolve faster as the α increases as shown in fig 2 b and c the water surface fluctuations are observed both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front when α 0 4 the first crest closest to the wave front liu et al 2019a exhibits significant aeration and attenuation when α 0 4 and 0 5 and these phenomena are more intense for α 0 4 as compared to that for α 0 5 the first crest no longer exhibits aeration and attenuation in the propagation process when α 0 6 and the series of waves move to the downstream channel in a more stable form it is found that the wave peak gradually declines and the wavelength gradually decreases with time the propagation speed of the first crest gradually decreases as the value of α increases although the undulations propagate both in the upstream and downstream directions from the dam site the flow pattern in the neighborhood of the dam site i e referred to as a non undulation area will tend to be non undular after a period of time another non undulation area is observed upstream of the extra negative wave 4 2 gravity similarity analysis in order to analyze the gravity similarity characteristic of dam break flows in the wet bed downstream the following scale is used to nondimensionalize hydraulic parameters 1 t t h u g 2 h h h u 3 u u g h u where t h and u represent the dimensionless time water depth and mean velocity respectively h and u are dimensional water depth and mean velocity respectively the dimensionless distance from the dam in the gravity similarity is calculated by x hu 4 2 1 water depth it is well knows that the evolution form of dam break flows is related to the value of α there will be extra negative waves propagating to the reservoir area when α 0 3 and a series of waves move in the downstream direction for α 0 4 the first crest will appear aeration and attenuation when α 0 4 and 0 5 thus the dam break flows with α 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 are selected for analysis in the case of three different upstream depth three dimensionless times t 2 48 4 95 and 9 90 are selected respectively the relative root mean square error rrmse is used for estimating the difference between numerical and physical results as expressed 4 rrmse 1 n i 1 n y i e i e i 2 100 where n is the total number of all measured data points yi is the numerical value ei is the measured value the measured and computed water surface profiles under three upstream depths for different values of α and t are presented in fig 3 in the initial stage of the dam break i e t 2 48 the water surfaces are distorted and the dimensionless water depth profiles are slightly different from each other under three different upstream depths however the movement of dam break flows essentially satisfies the gravity similarity at t 4 95 and 9 90 and both the extra negative waves in the reservoir and the series of waves in the downstream channel does not affect the characteristic of gravity similarity the dimensionless water surface profiles under different upstream depths are roughly coincident for a given value of α implying that the movement of the dam break flows is dominated by gravity the rrsme values are small and the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results the stage hydrographs under three upstream depths for different values of α are discussed at the positions of x hu 3 5 p1 11 p2 2 5 p3 and 11 p4 as shown in fig 4 in the reservoir the water depth declines after the arrival of the negative wave front the water level drop is observed earlier at p1 than that at p2 because the position p1 is closer to the dam site the stage hydrographs under three upstream depths overlap each other for a while after the arrival of the negative wave front at the upstream end of reservoir the curves with hu 0 6 m first deviate from the stage hydrographs with hu 0 2 m and then the deviation of curves with hu 0 4 m takes place the reason is that the reservoir length for different hu in experiments is not scaled on the base of the the upstream water depth ratio for example the reservoir length with hu 0 4 m and 0 6 m should be twice and triple that with hu 0 2 m respectively the water depths with hu 0 4 m and 0 6 m fall sharply from the inceptions of curve deviation because of the limited water volume stored in the reservoir in addition the deviation inception depends on the distance of the measurement position from the dam site for a given hu for instance the deviation at p1 closer to the dam is found later than that at p2 as a disturbance the deviation propagates in the downstream direction the stage hydrographs at a given location for different hu remain similar until the arrival of the deviation the water depth at p1 experiences a slight fluctuation after a period of drop when α 0 3 because of the extra negative waves the water depth fluctuates more obviously the inception of fluctuations occurs earlier the fluctuation frequency is larger and the wavelength is shorter for α 0 5 and 0 7 when compared with the case of α 0 3 the fluctuation at p2 occurs later than that at p1 as the position p2 is farther from the dam in the downstream channel the water levels at the measurement sections rise sharply due to the arrivals of dam break shock waves the water level rise takes place earlier at p3 than that at p4 because the position p3 is closer to the dam site similar stage hydrographs with three upstream water depths for a given α are observed for a period of time the deviations of curves with hu 0 4 m and 0 6 m from the stage hydrographs with hu 0 2 m are also found still resulting from the limited length of reservoir and flooded area the rarefaction wave zone extends toward downstream of the dam when α 0 1 resulting in a second rise on the graph at the position p3 which is closer to the dam site the second rise of the water level at p4 is not observed because the position p4 far away from the dam is beyond the affected area of the rarefaction wave the rarefaction wave zone does not extend toward the downstream of the dam when α 0 2 and 0 3 thus the second rise of water depth is no longer found at p3 the stage hydrographs both at p3 and p4 fluctuate significantly in the early stage when α 0 5 and 0 7 and gradually stabilize within a certain range after a period of time then second rises of the water depth are observed which are produced by the partially reflected waves from the tailwater gate the reflected waves produce fluctuations of water levels once again 4 2 2 mean velocity the cross sectional mean velocity is determined from the difference between the imaged inflow and outflow volumes at a certain section as expressed by eq 5 which is similar with the method used by cestero et al 2014 bento et al 2017 and melis et al 2019 5 u t w t δ t w t b h δ t where u t is the mean flow velocity at time t w t and w t δ t is the volumes for a certain section at the time t and t δt respectively b is the channel width δt is the time step taking 1 48 s the distributions of the mean velocity along the flume under different upstream water depths for different α are shown in fig 5 a zone with a relatively stable velocity is formed downstream of the dam when α 0 3 the velocity in the reservoir fluctuates significantly when α 0 3 resulting from the extra negative wave the velocity is also fluctuating due to the series of waves in the downstream side when α 0 5 however it is found that the gravity similarity characteristic still exists for the mean velocity the numerical simulations are in good agreement with measurements and the rrmse value for the numerical model decreases gradually as the value of α increases the variations of mean velocity at p1 p2 p3 and p4 with the time are shown in fig 6 the mean velocity in the reservoir climbs up first and then declines gradually when α 0 1 and 0 2 the mean velocity fluctuates in the later stage because of the extra negative waves when α 0 3 and the oscillation becomes more intensive as the value of α arises the mean velocity in some positions has a negative value when α 0 5 and 0 7 because the extra negative waves continuously propagate upward into the reservoir resulting in a reverse flow during some time intervals in the reach downstream of the dam the mean velocity drops slightly after a sharp rise due to the arrival of rarefaction wave front when α 0 1 while the mean velocities at p3 and p4 can be maintained for a while when α 0 2 and 0 3 the mean velocities for α 0 5 and 0 7 show significant fluctuations in the initial phase and will restore stability negative values of mean velocity are found in the downstream positions being produced by the reflected waves from the downstream gate which is used for providing wet bed conditions the gravity similarity characteristic still exist for the mean velocity under three different upstream water depths the numerical simulations are also consistent with the experimental results 4 2 3 horizontal and vertical velocity profiles the velocity components both in horizontal and vertical directions i e ux and uz under different α are also nondimensionalized by eq 3 for analyzing the gravity similarity characteristic the dimensionless time t 14 and several positions of x hu 0 2 5 5 10 are selected here the corresponding dimensional times and dimensional distances under three upstream depths are listed in table 2 the horizontal velocity profiles ux in the reservoir are characterized by a shear layer overlain by a stable layer as shown in fig 7 where hs represents the local water depth the velocity profiles at positions of x hu 2 5 and 5 are similar to those in the reservoir except that the velocity magnitude close to the water surface is significantly larger at the position of x hu 10 which is located in the wave front region the horizontal velocity profiles are shown to satisfy the gravity similarity fig 8 presents vertical velocity profiles uz under three upstream water depths where the leftward and rightward swings in the profiles indicate the downward and upward velocity direction respectively in the reservoir the vertical velocity linearly increases with the water depth and the profiles under three different upstream water depths are essentially coincident with each other at α 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 however the coincidence of velocity profiles is not found in the downstream channel when α 0 5 and 0 7 there are certain deviations at all considered locations except for the position of x hu 10 the gravity similarity characteristic of the vertical velocity in the flooded area is not good as that in the reservoir 4 3 self similarity analysis 4 3 1 water depth the dimensionless distance from the dam in the self similarity involves the independent variable t which differs from the one i e x hu in the gravity similarity as expressed by 6 x x t g h u substituting eq 1 into eq 6 yields x x thu thus the curves for three different upstream depths can also overlap each other at the same dimensionless time in the self similarity analysis therefore only the water surface profiles for the case of hu 0 4 m are used to analyze the characteristics of self similarity as shown in fig 9 the water surfaces are seriously distorted due to the water leaps in the initial stage of dam break flows t 2 48 when α 0 3 which cause the dimensionless water depth to be significantly different from that in other moments owing to the sharp change in the streamline curvature lauber and hager 1998 leal et al 2002 the water depths in the rarefaction wave zone are also different from those during t 2 48 9 90 for a period of time t 9 90 14 86 the dimensionless water surface profiles are basically coincident with each other and approximately satisfy self similarity when α 0 3 the dimensionless water surface profiles do not show self similar due to both the extra negative waves and the series of waves in downstream channel this may be explained as following the self similarity solutions derived from saint venant equations for dam break flows in the wet bed condition e g stoker 1957 wu et al 1999 chen et al 2011 may serve as a criterion for evaluating whether or not the movement of dam break flow is self similar and all of those solutions provide a parabolic rarefaction fan and a sharp shock front when α 0 3 the dam break wave propagation can be predicted by those self similarity solutions i e the self similarity law is valid for α 0 3 physical undulations are formed both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front which cannot be described with the aforementioned solutions liu et al 2019a it is indicated that the self similarity solution is limited to the condition of α 0 3 i e the self similarity law is not applicable to the case of α 0 3 from the previous analysis two non undulation areas which are approximately unaffected by undulations exist for large values of α the water surface profiles in the range of x 1 for α 0 5 and 0 7 are presented in fig 10 where the two non undulation areas are marked it is shown that the profiles are coincident with each other for different dimensionless times in these regions the numerical model could satisfactorily predict the water surface profiles along the channel 4 3 2 mean velocity the distributions of the cross sectional mean velocity under different dimensionless times are shown in fig 11 the peak velocity appears where the water leaps are formed in the initial stage of the dam break flow being significantly different from that at other locations the self similarity characteristic of the dam break flow begins to appear after a period of time when α 0 3 for α 0 3 the overall characteristics of self similarity are also destroyed because of the undulations both in the rarefaction wave and the shock front caused by the extra negative waves and the series of waves in downstream channel respectively however the distribution curves of mean velocity for large values of t in the two non undulation areas are self similar for a given α as shown in fig 12 4 3 3 horizontal and vertical velocity profiles for analyzing the self similarity characteristic both the horizontal and vertical velocity profiles at the dimensionless positions of x 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 and 0 are selected as shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively table 3 presents the corresponding dimensional times and distances it is worth noting that the horizontal velocity profiles at each position need a period of time to be self similar when α 0 3 the velocity profiles also show self similar when the time is relatively backward at x 0 8 to 0 4 when α 0 5 and 0 7 significant discrepancies among the horizontal velocity profiles are observed at x 0 6 and 0 8 for any time resulting from the undulations in the shock front it is seen that the vertical velocity magnitude at the same dimensionless position in the reservoir decreases gradually with time when α 0 5 and 0 7 the velocity direction is influenced by extra negative waves being obviously different from those for other water depth ratios the vertical velocity magnitude in the region of x 0 0 4 basically remains zero at t 19 80 it is indicated that this region is not affected by waves and the horizontal velocity dominates the flow although the velocity profiles at each position are basically coincident at t 14 86 and 19 80 when α 0 3 the vertical velocity is quite close to zero at these moments it does not indicate that it has good self similarity the velocity profiles are obviously affected both by extra negative waves and the series of waves in downstream channel when α 0 5 and 0 7 and the vertical velocity profiles are not self similar 5 conclusions in the present study both the gravity similarity and self similarity of dam break flows under the condition of wet bed downstream are investigated by both using physical and numerical models three different upstream water depths and ten different water depth ratios are considered the main findings are as follows water leaps are formed downstream of the dam in the initial stage with a wet bed downstream condition extra negative waves propagating in the upstream direction are observed in the reservoir when α 0 3 resulting in undulations in the rarefaction wave a series of waves propagating in the downstream direction emerge in the flooded area when α 0 4 producing undulations in the shock wave front aeration and attenuation in the shock wave front are found for α 0 4 and 0 5 and the series of waves move in a stable form when α 0 6 the water surface profiles stage hydrographs mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles in dam break flows show a great gravity similarity characteristic the vertical velocity profiles satisfy the gravity similarity law better in the reservoir when compared to that in the flooded area the self similarity characteristics of dam break flows not as good as the gravity similarity significantly depend on the tail water depth the water surface profiles mean velocity distribution and horizontal velocity profiles are shown to approximately satisfy the self similarity law after a period of time for α 0 3 the overall self similarity characteristics vanish due to the undulations both in the the rarefaction wave and the shock wave front for α 0 3 except for two non undulation areas where the flow presents self similar after a period of time the study shows that numerical simulations with the large eddy simulation les model are in satisfactory agreement with the measurements it is indicated that the les model can be used for accurately predicting the dam break flows with a wet bed downstream condition the findings contribute to the understanding of the effect of wet bed downstream conditions on the similarity of dam break flows it is indicated that the dam break flow in prototype can be studied in a small scaled physical model by using the gravity similarity and the water depths both in the upstream and downstream reaches must be considered when applying the self similarity because the self similar characteristics of the dam break flow are affected by the water depth ratio when α 0 3 credit authorship contribution statement bo wang conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing

5707,a stochastic rainfall generator is required to provide rainfall inputs for the analysis and mitigation of such hydrological or geologic hazards as floods and rain induced landslides this paper presents a new spatial temporal rainstorm generator for generating simultaneous rainfall processes at numerous locations considering the spatial correlation among these locations and interpolating the point processes into an areal rain field the generator is able to include the effect of climate change by adjusting the parameters of the marginal distributions of variables constituting rainfall events a case study on the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba one of the regions that are most prone to storm related disasters in the world is presented the performance of the proposed generator is excellent in reproducing the historical statistical characteristics of regional rainfall the model is adapted to climate change through extrapolation of the variation trend of the model parameters in the observation period to explore possible future scenarios of regional rainfall in gba the simulation results indicate a significant increase in rainfall extremes especially for short duration rainfall at the end of 21st century in gba keywords spatial temporal rain field generator rainstorm climate change natural hazards guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area flooding 1 introduction the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba fig 1 is a very densely populated metropolitan area consisting of 11 cities including hong kong macau guangzhou and shenzhen it is one of the regions with the strongest economic vitality in china however gba is one of the most disaster prone regions in the world and frequently suffers storm related hazards swiss re 2013 hallegatte et al 2013 according to swiss re 2013 gba is the world s most flood exposed urban area ranking first among major metropolitan areas around the world with around 12 million people potentially affected intense rainstorms are one of the major triggers of hydrological or geologic hazards such as floods wright et al 2014 gao et al 2019 landslides chen and zhang 2014 ran et al 2018 gao et al 2018b debris flows chen et al 2016 iadanza et al 2016 shen et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 etc the risks of storm related hazards are likely to become higher in gba in the future as a result of potentially more frequent and intense rainstorms due to global warming the capacity of the atmosphere to hold moisture will enhance which implies that extreme rainstorms will increase in terms of both frequency and intensity in south china a remarkable increasing trend in rainfall intensity and rainfall amount from extreme events is found in the pearl river basin from analysis of historical daily precipitation data zhang et al 2009 projections of heavy rainfall events from general circulation models of the fourth assessment report released by intergovernmental panel on climate change indicate a substantial increase in heavy rainfall frequency 35 9 50 2 increase over that in the period of 1980 1999 and intensity 2 8 6 4 increase over that in the period of 1980 1999 in south china at the end of 21st century chen et al 2012 apart from the total rainfall amount the spatial temporal variation of rainfall will also affect the response of hydrogeological systems by affecting the soil moisture groundwater level and discharge of catchments schuurmans and bierkens 2007 zhu et al 2018 to investigate the hazards related to rainfall it is necessary to project future regional rainstorm scenarios for engineering design and hazard prevention purposes considering the trend of climate change stochastic rainfall simulation models can be used to generate continuous rainfall processes to provide input for hazard investigation stochastic simulation of spatial temporal process of rainfall is challenging due to its intermittency and the spatial temporal cross correlation the intermittency characteristics of rainfall can be modelled by describing rainfall occurrence and rainfall intensity separately for rainfall occurrence based on point rainfall observations simple models for generating point synthetic rainfall sequences have been developed such as the markov renewal model haan et al 1976 foufoula georgiou and lettenmaier 1987 and the alternating renewal model acreman 1990 haberlandt 1998 haberlandt et al 2008 the variation of rainfall intensity rainfall pattern can be modelled with such methods as the random cascade model tang et al 2018 and the cluster analysis wu et al 2006 to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall multisite models are widely used when point observations are available for example wilks 1998 established a chain dependent process model for simultaneous simulation of daily precipitation occurrences and amounts at multiple locations serinaldi 2009 developed a model based on bivariate copula based mixed distributions to generate daily rainfall time series at multiple sites with no need for separating rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount in addition to the multisite models some models included space time correlation of rain events with random field theory bell 1987 established a model to describe the spatial pattern of precipitation by rescaling part of a correlated gaussian random field into a lognormal type allcroft and glasbey 2003 transformed rainfall to a thresholded gaussian variable and modelled the space time dependence structure as a gaussian markov random field the models mentioned above attempt to reproduce the characteristics of point or regional precipitation many of them involve a large number of parameters and complex estimation processes moreover how to take climate change into stochastic rainfall simulation models is still a challenge to investigate rainfall triggered hazards in gba which may become more severe in the future a rain field generator with a logical structure and the flexibility to include climate change is particularly necessary the primary objective of this paper is to develop a model for generating spatial temporal rainfall processes as inputs for hazard analysis with its parameters estimated from historical point observations from rainfall stations and adjustable for the trend of climate change section 2 will present the detailed development of the model followed by model parameter estimation and adaptation to climate change the performance of the model will be validated through a case study in gba with historical data in section 3 and the possible future variation of rainfall characteristics in gba will be systematically investigated in section 4 the spatial temporally varying rain fields produced by the proposed model can be further applied to large scale hydrological and geologic hazard analyses using distributed models such as rainfall runoff inundation analysis and regional rainfall induced landslide analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper 2 spatial temporal rain field generation considering climate change the proposed spatial temporal rain field generator generates rainfall sequences at multiple stations considering the inter station spatial correlation the framework of the generator is shown in fig 2 2 1 temporal rainfall modelling the intermittency feature of rainfall can be approximated as an alternating renewal process acreman 1990 haberlandt 1998 which models a system alternating between two states over time i e raining or not raining the occurrence interval time and rainfall amount can be characterised by three variables i e wet spell duration w dry spell duration d and average intensity i fig 3 herein the wet and dry spell durations are referred to as the duration of continuous raining i e the duration of a rainstorm event and the inter event duration respectively a basic assumption of the alternating renewal process is that pairs of the two states are independent when applying the alternating renewal process in modelling rainfall all the samples of wet spell and dry spell durations are often considered to be independent i e the neighbouring w and d are independent as well acreman 1990 haberlandt 1998 however the average intensity of rainfall during each wet spell is not independent of the wet spell duration the joint distribution of w and i with the consideration of their correlation can be described with a two dimensional copula nelsen 2007 bezak et al 2016 gao et al 2018a 1 f w i c f w w f i i θ where f w i is the joint cumulative distribution function of w and i fw w and fi i are the marginal cumulative distribution functions of w and i respectively c is the copula function that relates f w i to fw w and fi i and θ is the copula parameter representing the dependency the marginal distributions of w d and i can be estimated from historical point observations within the area of interest and rainfall event sequences can be produced by assembling sets of the three variables sampled from the corresponding distributions the temporal variation of rainfall intensity within a wet spell can be simplified as a predefined form of rainfall pattern although the rainfall pattern does have influence on the occurrence and process of rainfall triggered hazards a prescribed pattern form is easier to describe when the focus is on a relatively long term rainfall process for example the instantaneous rainfall intensity i t within each wet spell duration can be assumed to increase exponentially first and then decrease exponentially haberlandt et al 2008 2 i t i m e γ t t m where im a ib is the peak instantaneous rainfall intensity during the wet spell and assumed to be only related to the average rainfall intensity within the wet spell in a power form in which parameters a and b can be estimated by regression analysis tm is the time of peak intensity that is assumed to be uniformly distributed within the wet spell and generated randomly during the simulation and γ is an event specific parameter and can be obtained according to the balance of rainfall amount 3 0 t m i m e γ t t m d t t m w i m e γ t m t d t w i once w i im and tm have been determined eq 3 can be solved through the newton raphson method even for the same set of w and i different simulated values of tm still lead to temporally varying rainfall patterns combining the event sequences and the simulated rainfall patterns a time series of rainfall intensity reflecting the temporal variation of rainfall can be obtained 2 2 rain field generation including multisite spatial correlation the rain field for a specific area of interest can be described by the temporal rainfall processes at numerous stations the time series of rainfall for each station should be generated at the same time due to the connection between temporal and spatial variations of rainfall under the assumption that the spatial dependences of w d and i among stations are the same xiao et al 2017a zhu et al 2017 the inter station spatial correlation can be described with a prescribed spatial correlation function e g a gaussian correlation function 4 ρ pq exp τ pq δ 2 where ρpq is the correlation coefficient of the three variables between stations p and q τpq is the separation distance between stations p and q and δ is the spatial correlation parameter with the spatial correlation function any number of simultaneous rainfall events at numerous stations can be generated to generate rainfall sequences at ns stations a ns ns auto correlation matrix r ρpq is formed first according to the spatial correlation function then a ns 1 correlated standard normal random vector n can be obtained using the covariance matrix decomposition method li et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 5 n l u where l is a lower triangular matrix satisfying cholesky decomposition r ll t and u is a ns 1 independent standard normal random vector n can be transformed into other types of random vectors according to the variable distribution types note that d is independent of w and i while w and i are cross correlated for one rainfall event the ns 1 vectors of d w and i can be obtained as follows 1 randomly generate ns 3 potential samples of a standard uniformly distributed variable at ns stations with no dependence among all the samples 2 transform the first column of the potential samples into an independent standard normally distributed vector u d firstly then transform it into a standard normally distributed vector n d with inter station spatial correlation according to eq 5 the ns 1 vector of d for ns stations can be obtained by transforming n d to the selected marginal distribution of d 3 transform the last two columns of the potential samples into a pair of standard uniformly distributed variables obeying a given copula function with independency among stations 4 similar to step 2 transform the two vectors firstly into two standard normally distributed vectors u w and u i with spatial independency among stations and then into two standard normally distributed vectors n w and n i with inter station spatial correlation using eq 5 the wet spell duration series w and average rainfall intensity series i can then be obtained by transforming n w and n i to the selected marginal distributions of w and i repeatedly performing the above steps the matrices d w and i for ns stations with many realizations of rainfall events can be obtained after generating rainfall processes at multiple stations the areal distribution of rainfall at each snapshot can then be obtained by spatial interpolation using kriging oliver and webster 1990 xiao et al 2017b for which the parameters of range sill and nugget are estimated by fitting the empirical semivariogram with commonly used theoretical semivariogram models 2 3 estimation of model parameters to generate a rain field the first step is to select appropriate marginal and joint distributions for the three variables w d and i and to estimate the marginal distribution parameters and the copula parameter several candidate parametric distributions and copula models commonly used in hydroclimate study can be tried to fit the data samples the optimal model can be identified according to the akaike information criterion aic defined as tang et al 2013 chen and singh 2018 6 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k is the number of model parameters and l is the likelihood function reflecting the goodness of fit and is maximized through maximum likelihood estimation given a set of candidate models for fitting the data the preferred model is the one with the minimum aic value regarding the rainfall pattern the parameters in the power form of peak intensity can be obtained using regression analysis based on the pairwise data of the peak and average rainfall intensities for every wet spell furthermore the spatial correlation parameter δ for modelling the inter station spatial correlation of w d and i is required however δ is difficult to be directly estimated from observations instead it can be determined by minimizing the difference of a simultaneous rainfall feature between the generated rainfall and the observed rainfall in this paper the simultaneous rainfall feature is described by the correlation coefficients of the instantaneous rainfall intensity ρi approximated as the cumulative rainfall depth in a short period of time between different stations when rainfall occurs simultaneously given the marginal distributions of w d and i as well as the dependency between w and i the decay trend of the correlation coefficient against the separation distance between rainfall generation stations τ varies as the spatial correlation parameter δ changes for simplicity the pairs of stations are grouped into several lag bins according to seperation distances and the difference of the decay trends between the generated and observed rainfall is quantified by an objective index δ 7 δ δ j w j ρ i τ j ρ i τ j δ where τj is the mean separation distance of pairs of stations in the jth lag bin ρi τj is the mean value of ρi in the jth lag bin obtained from observation data ρi τj δ is the mean value of ρi in the jth lag bin obtained from generated data given a value of δ and wj is the weight of the jth lag bin to emphasize the importance of realistic reproduction of the simultaneous rainfall properties at close stations and can be taken as for example wj τmax τj τmax where τmax is the maximum value of τ j the most plausible value of δ is the one corresponding to the minimum objective index which will be further illustrated in section 3 2 2 4 adaptation to climate change there is sufficient flexibility for the proposed model to consider the variations of rainfall characteristics due to climate change for example adjustments can be made to the marginal distributions of w d and i for future scenarios to capture the variations of rainfall duration interval time and intensity while the correlation between w and i as well as the inter station spatial correlation can be considered as stationary for simplicity peres cancelliere 2018 lee singh 2019 trend of regional climate change is usually identified based on historical data analysis or climate projections from a regional climate model when long term historical observations are available the variation trends of w d and i can be explored and the parameters of the marginal distributions can be adjusted through extrapolation besides the statistic moments are usually easy to obtain from rainfall projection and the change of parameters can be transformed from projected statistic moments as the types of marginal distributions can be different for different samples the changing rates of the three variables can be evaluated with the change rates of statistical moments instead of the parameters of the marginal distributions 8 f n m n f m n r where fn is the change rate of the nth moment of a variable mn f and mn r are the nth moment of the variable in a future period and a reference period respectively for simplicity they are obtained through linear regression as demonstrated later in this paper 3 rain field generation for the greater bay area with historical data 3 1 study area and historical data the proposed rain field generator is applied to gba in south china gba has a humid subtropical monsoon climate characterised by clear rainy and dry seasons and the average annual rainfall is over 1300 mm generally the monthly rainfall amount in gba has two peaks annually and the largest rainfall amounts occur in june may and august most of gba is delta plain with smooth terrain surrounded by intermittent mountains and hills the topography of gba and locations of 41 rainfall stations are shown in fig 1 hourly rainfall data is recorded by these rainfall stations and daily rainfall data is available to the public additionally high resolution rainfall data is also available from the dataset of nasa tropical rainfall measuring mission huffman et al 2007 the temporal and spatial resolutions of the rainfall data are 3 h and 0 25 0 25 respectively the observation periods are the rainy seasons from may to august of each year from 1998 to 2017 the rainfall data in this paper is obtained from the nasa dataset observations at four representative stations guangzhou dongguan shenzhen and zhuhai in gba are shown in fig 4 3 2 determination of model parameters for gba the marginal distributions of variables w d and i are chosen based on the historical data at the locations of rainfall stations data from all the stations is pooled together to estimate the parameters for the marginal distributions and the joint distribution because gba is a meteorological homogeneous region chong lee 2015 and a large number of rain stations are located on the delta plain with low elevations which makes the effect of topography to be very low five candidate marginal distributions i e lognormal generalized extreme value exponential inverse gaussian and geometric distributions and four candidate copulas i e gaussian frank clayton and gumbel copulas are compared to fit the data in gba note that w and d are normalized by 3 0 in this study because 3 hour interval rainfall data is used as shown in table 1 the geometric distribution inverse gaussian distribution and exponential distribution are chosen to model the wet spell duration dry spell duration and average intensity respectively and the frank copula is selected to model the joint distribution between w and i due to their respective minimum aic values the corresponding model parameters as well as the parameters for peak intensity are provided in table 2 fig 5 illustrates that all the selected probability models fit the data very well with respect to the spatial correlation parameter δ a trial and error method is adopted for a series of discrete values with a certain interval to minimize the objective index δ because the variation trend of δ with δ is of concern and minor differences in δ have little impact on the simulation results the objective index δ is calculated from the mean value of a number of simulations with nine possible values of δ ranging from 200 to 600 km with an interval of 50 km and a value of δ 400 km corresponding to the minimum δ is chosen fig 6 a fig 6b demonstrates a consistent decay trend of simultaneous rainfall intensity with the separation distance based on simulated and observed data 3 3 validation of rainfall characteristics with all the parameters determined the rainfall processes of any duration can be generated within the study area one hundred realizations of 20 year rainfall 4 month for each year are generated and an example of generated rainfall at the four representative stations and the variation of the interpolated spatial distribution of 24 hour cumulative rainfall amount during a generated intensive rainstorm are shown in fig 7 table 3 compares four characteristics of the generated and observed rainfalls including average number of rainfall events average single event rainfall standard deviation of single event rainfall and total rainfall amount within 4 months all the four characteristics are well reproduced by the proposed rainfall generator in addition frequency analysis is conducted with the annual maximum time series of observed and generated rainfall amounts in four common durations i e 6 12 24 and 48 h it should be noted that the generated rainfall data from all the stations is pooled together as a single sample in the frequency analysis because of the short length of observation period in fact simply pooling data from different stations will include some samples with strong dependency i e the spatial correlation among stations can reduce the number of effective samples this kind of effect is ignored here because the analysis is just used for validation purpose for each realization the generalized extreme value distribution is used to fit the data and the rainfall amounts corresponding to several exceedance probability values are calculated the results are shown in fig 8 for different rainfall durations the observed values are mostly inside the 90 confidence interval of simulated values for a short duration i e 6 hour the observed values are a bit larger than the simulated results or near the upper bound these are understandable because the patterns of rainfall events are assumed to have a similar predefined profile i e an exponentially increase to the peak value first followed by an exponentially decrease the difference between the real temporal variation of rainfall and the assumed profile may cause bias especially for the cumulative rainfall amount in a short duration as a whole the generated rainfall is able to reproduce the statistical characteristics of observations including extreme events 4 generation of future rainfall scenarios for the greater bay area 4 1 adaptation to regional climate change in addition to learning the past characteristics of rainfall possible rainfall scenarios in the future are of great interest because it will significantly influence the magnitudes of rainfall triggered hazards and the strategies of risk mitigation in gba evidences of climate change in terms of precipitation in the study area have been documented in the literature zhang et al 2009 lenderink et al 2011 chen et al 2012 du et al 2016 a clear decreasing trend in rainy days and increasing trend in the intensity and amount of extreme rainstorms have been found in the past decades the parameters of the proposed model can be adjusted to consider the future trend of rainfall under climate change although the observation period of data in this paper is relatively short some trends can still be found the trends of inter annual variations of the parameters of the marginal distributions for the three variables characterising the process of rainfall are shown in fig 9 the inverse gaussian distribution is used to fit the samples of dry spell duration and the probability density function of the dry spell duration exhibits a clear trend to become less positively skewed which indicates that the probability of longer dry spell has increased over the past 20 years similarly the probability density function of the average intensity shows a trend that the rainfall has become more intense during the past two decades to consider the future rainfall scenarios of the study area the parameters of the marginal distributions of the three variables are extrapolated assuming the trend to be linear while the other parameters i e the dependency between w and i the relation between peak intensity and average intensity and the spatial correlation are assumed unchanged rainfall is generated with the adjusted parameters of the marginal distributions of w d and i during the period of 2080 2100 the moments of the three variables in the future period and the associated changing rates can be calculated frequency analysis is then carried out with the results of 100 realizations fig 10 compares the frequency distributions of simulated rainfall in the past and the future the upper bounds of the 90 intervals as well as the medians of rainfall amount for all the four durations show a significant upside shift especially for low frequency events for example the medians of future rainfall at the frequency of 0 01 increase by 11 3 8 1 8 9 and 7 6 for durations of 6 12 24 and 48 h respectively based on the trend extrapolation of the past 20 years the simulation results imply a major increase in rainfall extremes at the end of 21st century the increasing trend of short duration rainfall is particularly significant which indicates that flash floods and shallow slope failures related to short term and high intensity rainfall will become more frequent in the future in gba the extrapolation is suitable for preliminary evaluation of future rainfall scenarios more rigorous adjustments can be made based on projections from climate models 4 2 effect of spatial correlation in the proposed model the spatial correlation parameter δ is used to characterise the inter station correlation in section 4 1 the spatial correlation is assumed to be stationary in adaptation to climate change given that the variation of spatial correlation is difficult to evaluate in this section sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spatial correlation on the model performance in terms of the frequency based regional rainfall characteristics parameter δ is scaled to be one half and twice of the value i e 200 and 800 km estimated from the historical data different from the frequency analysis in section 3 3 the generated annual maximum time series from different stations are not simply pooled together in this case because the difference of inter station correlation will lead to different sample numbers instead a method using regional l moments modified from the method of probability weighted moments estimation hosking wallis 2005 is adopted here for regional frequency analysis the method of regional frequency analysis is used to estimate the frequency distribution of rainfall from the generalized extreme value distribution with parameters determined using regional averages of the mean l variance and l skewness this method is based on the meteorological homogeneity of the study area which has been verified by chong and lee 2015 the results of the regional frequency distribution with different rainfall durations are shown in fig 11 a stronger spatial correlation a larger δ value leads to higher uncertainties especially for low frequencies the differences of uncertainty intervals induced by δ decrease and tend to be similar as the frequency becomes larger for long duration rainfall i e 48 hour the uncertainty growth due to a larger δ for low frequency events is quite remarkable the upper bound of which increases by 44 7 for events with a frequency of 0 001 when δ is doubled except for the uncertainty there are no obvious differences between the magnitudes medians of 6 hour and 12 hour rainfall generated with different δ values which indicates that the variation of δ controlling the spatial distribution of rainfall within each specific time slot will not have a significant influence on the statistical characteristics of short duration regional rainfall for rainfall of long durations i e 24 hour and 48 hour the magnitudes medians of low frequency events will be smaller as the spatial correlation becomes stronger the inter station spatial correlation is very important in terms of uncertainty of statistical characteristics of generated rainfall and it is desirable to take the variation of spatial correlation parameter into account when adapting the model to climate change however since the differences of rainfall magnitudes caused by variation of δ are not very large for problems that concern only about the overall regional characteristics of rainfall the spatial correlation parameter still can be assumed to be stationary and even selected based on experience instead of choosing from a wide range and a predefined spatial correlation function suffices to capture the regional spatial variation feature on the other hand more attention should be paid to the description of spatial correlation to make the features of generated areal rainfall of each specific time slot more realistic and the effect of terrain should be considered in the spatial correlation analysis in areas with large variations in topography 5 summary and conclusions a spatial temporal rain field generator based on point observations is developed and applied to the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba which frequently suffers storm related hazards the major conclusions are as follows 1 the rain field generator simulates the spatial temporal rain field through an alternating renewal process in the time domain with the consideration of inter station spatial correlation in the space domain the statistical characteristics of the rainfall in gba is well reproduced by the rain field generator which demonstrates the model s ability as a tool for hazard analysis in gba 2 the rain field generator can be adapted for climate change with the parameters of the marginal distributions of three variables describing duration interval and intensity of rainfall events adjusted extrapolating the variation trends of the marginal distributions observed in the past 20 years in gba to the end of 21st century the simulation results show a significant increase in rainfall extremes in gba especially for short duration rainfall 3 the sensitivity of spatial correlation parameter quantifying the inter station correlation is investigated the uncertainty of generated rainfall will increase significantly for low frequency events as the correlation becomes stronger which underlines the importance of spatial correlation in regional rainfall modelling however the differences in the magnitudes of regional rainfall induced by spatial correlation are limited especially for short duration rainfall 4 the proposed rain field generator can be combined with physically based distributed models for hydrological and geologic hazard analyses in gba to investigate the future

5707,a stochastic rainfall generator is required to provide rainfall inputs for the analysis and mitigation of such hydrological or geologic hazards as floods and rain induced landslides this paper presents a new spatial temporal rainstorm generator for generating simultaneous rainfall processes at numerous locations considering the spatial correlation among these locations and interpolating the point processes into an areal rain field the generator is able to include the effect of climate change by adjusting the parameters of the marginal distributions of variables constituting rainfall events a case study on the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba one of the regions that are most prone to storm related disasters in the world is presented the performance of the proposed generator is excellent in reproducing the historical statistical characteristics of regional rainfall the model is adapted to climate change through extrapolation of the variation trend of the model parameters in the observation period to explore possible future scenarios of regional rainfall in gba the simulation results indicate a significant increase in rainfall extremes especially for short duration rainfall at the end of 21st century in gba keywords spatial temporal rain field generator rainstorm climate change natural hazards guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area flooding 1 introduction the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba fig 1 is a very densely populated metropolitan area consisting of 11 cities including hong kong macau guangzhou and shenzhen it is one of the regions with the strongest economic vitality in china however gba is one of the most disaster prone regions in the world and frequently suffers storm related hazards swiss re 2013 hallegatte et al 2013 according to swiss re 2013 gba is the world s most flood exposed urban area ranking first among major metropolitan areas around the world with around 12 million people potentially affected intense rainstorms are one of the major triggers of hydrological or geologic hazards such as floods wright et al 2014 gao et al 2019 landslides chen and zhang 2014 ran et al 2018 gao et al 2018b debris flows chen et al 2016 iadanza et al 2016 shen et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 etc the risks of storm related hazards are likely to become higher in gba in the future as a result of potentially more frequent and intense rainstorms due to global warming the capacity of the atmosphere to hold moisture will enhance which implies that extreme rainstorms will increase in terms of both frequency and intensity in south china a remarkable increasing trend in rainfall intensity and rainfall amount from extreme events is found in the pearl river basin from analysis of historical daily precipitation data zhang et al 2009 projections of heavy rainfall events from general circulation models of the fourth assessment report released by intergovernmental panel on climate change indicate a substantial increase in heavy rainfall frequency 35 9 50 2 increase over that in the period of 1980 1999 and intensity 2 8 6 4 increase over that in the period of 1980 1999 in south china at the end of 21st century chen et al 2012 apart from the total rainfall amount the spatial temporal variation of rainfall will also affect the response of hydrogeological systems by affecting the soil moisture groundwater level and discharge of catchments schuurmans and bierkens 2007 zhu et al 2018 to investigate the hazards related to rainfall it is necessary to project future regional rainstorm scenarios for engineering design and hazard prevention purposes considering the trend of climate change stochastic rainfall simulation models can be used to generate continuous rainfall processes to provide input for hazard investigation stochastic simulation of spatial temporal process of rainfall is challenging due to its intermittency and the spatial temporal cross correlation the intermittency characteristics of rainfall can be modelled by describing rainfall occurrence and rainfall intensity separately for rainfall occurrence based on point rainfall observations simple models for generating point synthetic rainfall sequences have been developed such as the markov renewal model haan et al 1976 foufoula georgiou and lettenmaier 1987 and the alternating renewal model acreman 1990 haberlandt 1998 haberlandt et al 2008 the variation of rainfall intensity rainfall pattern can be modelled with such methods as the random cascade model tang et al 2018 and the cluster analysis wu et al 2006 to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall multisite models are widely used when point observations are available for example wilks 1998 established a chain dependent process model for simultaneous simulation of daily precipitation occurrences and amounts at multiple locations serinaldi 2009 developed a model based on bivariate copula based mixed distributions to generate daily rainfall time series at multiple sites with no need for separating rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount in addition to the multisite models some models included space time correlation of rain events with random field theory bell 1987 established a model to describe the spatial pattern of precipitation by rescaling part of a correlated gaussian random field into a lognormal type allcroft and glasbey 2003 transformed rainfall to a thresholded gaussian variable and modelled the space time dependence structure as a gaussian markov random field the models mentioned above attempt to reproduce the characteristics of point or regional precipitation many of them involve a large number of parameters and complex estimation processes moreover how to take climate change into stochastic rainfall simulation models is still a challenge to investigate rainfall triggered hazards in gba which may become more severe in the future a rain field generator with a logical structure and the flexibility to include climate change is particularly necessary the primary objective of this paper is to develop a model for generating spatial temporal rainfall processes as inputs for hazard analysis with its parameters estimated from historical point observations from rainfall stations and adjustable for the trend of climate change section 2 will present the detailed development of the model followed by model parameter estimation and adaptation to climate change the performance of the model will be validated through a case study in gba with historical data in section 3 and the possible future variation of rainfall characteristics in gba will be systematically investigated in section 4 the spatial temporally varying rain fields produced by the proposed model can be further applied to large scale hydrological and geologic hazard analyses using distributed models such as rainfall runoff inundation analysis and regional rainfall induced landslide analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper 2 spatial temporal rain field generation considering climate change the proposed spatial temporal rain field generator generates rainfall sequences at multiple stations considering the inter station spatial correlation the framework of the generator is shown in fig 2 2 1 temporal rainfall modelling the intermittency feature of rainfall can be approximated as an alternating renewal process acreman 1990 haberlandt 1998 which models a system alternating between two states over time i e raining or not raining the occurrence interval time and rainfall amount can be characterised by three variables i e wet spell duration w dry spell duration d and average intensity i fig 3 herein the wet and dry spell durations are referred to as the duration of continuous raining i e the duration of a rainstorm event and the inter event duration respectively a basic assumption of the alternating renewal process is that pairs of the two states are independent when applying the alternating renewal process in modelling rainfall all the samples of wet spell and dry spell durations are often considered to be independent i e the neighbouring w and d are independent as well acreman 1990 haberlandt 1998 however the average intensity of rainfall during each wet spell is not independent of the wet spell duration the joint distribution of w and i with the consideration of their correlation can be described with a two dimensional copula nelsen 2007 bezak et al 2016 gao et al 2018a 1 f w i c f w w f i i θ where f w i is the joint cumulative distribution function of w and i fw w and fi i are the marginal cumulative distribution functions of w and i respectively c is the copula function that relates f w i to fw w and fi i and θ is the copula parameter representing the dependency the marginal distributions of w d and i can be estimated from historical point observations within the area of interest and rainfall event sequences can be produced by assembling sets of the three variables sampled from the corresponding distributions the temporal variation of rainfall intensity within a wet spell can be simplified as a predefined form of rainfall pattern although the rainfall pattern does have influence on the occurrence and process of rainfall triggered hazards a prescribed pattern form is easier to describe when the focus is on a relatively long term rainfall process for example the instantaneous rainfall intensity i t within each wet spell duration can be assumed to increase exponentially first and then decrease exponentially haberlandt et al 2008 2 i t i m e γ t t m where im a ib is the peak instantaneous rainfall intensity during the wet spell and assumed to be only related to the average rainfall intensity within the wet spell in a power form in which parameters a and b can be estimated by regression analysis tm is the time of peak intensity that is assumed to be uniformly distributed within the wet spell and generated randomly during the simulation and γ is an event specific parameter and can be obtained according to the balance of rainfall amount 3 0 t m i m e γ t t m d t t m w i m e γ t m t d t w i once w i im and tm have been determined eq 3 can be solved through the newton raphson method even for the same set of w and i different simulated values of tm still lead to temporally varying rainfall patterns combining the event sequences and the simulated rainfall patterns a time series of rainfall intensity reflecting the temporal variation of rainfall can be obtained 2 2 rain field generation including multisite spatial correlation the rain field for a specific area of interest can be described by the temporal rainfall processes at numerous stations the time series of rainfall for each station should be generated at the same time due to the connection between temporal and spatial variations of rainfall under the assumption that the spatial dependences of w d and i among stations are the same xiao et al 2017a zhu et al 2017 the inter station spatial correlation can be described with a prescribed spatial correlation function e g a gaussian correlation function 4 ρ pq exp τ pq δ 2 where ρpq is the correlation coefficient of the three variables between stations p and q τpq is the separation distance between stations p and q and δ is the spatial correlation parameter with the spatial correlation function any number of simultaneous rainfall events at numerous stations can be generated to generate rainfall sequences at ns stations a ns ns auto correlation matrix r ρpq is formed first according to the spatial correlation function then a ns 1 correlated standard normal random vector n can be obtained using the covariance matrix decomposition method li et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 5 n l u where l is a lower triangular matrix satisfying cholesky decomposition r ll t and u is a ns 1 independent standard normal random vector n can be transformed into other types of random vectors according to the variable distribution types note that d is independent of w and i while w and i are cross correlated for one rainfall event the ns 1 vectors of d w and i can be obtained as follows 1 randomly generate ns 3 potential samples of a standard uniformly distributed variable at ns stations with no dependence among all the samples 2 transform the first column of the potential samples into an independent standard normally distributed vector u d firstly then transform it into a standard normally distributed vector n d with inter station spatial correlation according to eq 5 the ns 1 vector of d for ns stations can be obtained by transforming n d to the selected marginal distribution of d 3 transform the last two columns of the potential samples into a pair of standard uniformly distributed variables obeying a given copula function with independency among stations 4 similar to step 2 transform the two vectors firstly into two standard normally distributed vectors u w and u i with spatial independency among stations and then into two standard normally distributed vectors n w and n i with inter station spatial correlation using eq 5 the wet spell duration series w and average rainfall intensity series i can then be obtained by transforming n w and n i to the selected marginal distributions of w and i repeatedly performing the above steps the matrices d w and i for ns stations with many realizations of rainfall events can be obtained after generating rainfall processes at multiple stations the areal distribution of rainfall at each snapshot can then be obtained by spatial interpolation using kriging oliver and webster 1990 xiao et al 2017b for which the parameters of range sill and nugget are estimated by fitting the empirical semivariogram with commonly used theoretical semivariogram models 2 3 estimation of model parameters to generate a rain field the first step is to select appropriate marginal and joint distributions for the three variables w d and i and to estimate the marginal distribution parameters and the copula parameter several candidate parametric distributions and copula models commonly used in hydroclimate study can be tried to fit the data samples the optimal model can be identified according to the akaike information criterion aic defined as tang et al 2013 chen and singh 2018 6 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k is the number of model parameters and l is the likelihood function reflecting the goodness of fit and is maximized through maximum likelihood estimation given a set of candidate models for fitting the data the preferred model is the one with the minimum aic value regarding the rainfall pattern the parameters in the power form of peak intensity can be obtained using regression analysis based on the pairwise data of the peak and average rainfall intensities for every wet spell furthermore the spatial correlation parameter δ for modelling the inter station spatial correlation of w d and i is required however δ is difficult to be directly estimated from observations instead it can be determined by minimizing the difference of a simultaneous rainfall feature between the generated rainfall and the observed rainfall in this paper the simultaneous rainfall feature is described by the correlation coefficients of the instantaneous rainfall intensity ρi approximated as the cumulative rainfall depth in a short period of time between different stations when rainfall occurs simultaneously given the marginal distributions of w d and i as well as the dependency between w and i the decay trend of the correlation coefficient against the separation distance between rainfall generation stations τ varies as the spatial correlation parameter δ changes for simplicity the pairs of stations are grouped into several lag bins according to seperation distances and the difference of the decay trends between the generated and observed rainfall is quantified by an objective index δ 7 δ δ j w j ρ i τ j ρ i τ j δ where τj is the mean separation distance of pairs of stations in the jth lag bin ρi τj is the mean value of ρi in the jth lag bin obtained from observation data ρi τj δ is the mean value of ρi in the jth lag bin obtained from generated data given a value of δ and wj is the weight of the jth lag bin to emphasize the importance of realistic reproduction of the simultaneous rainfall properties at close stations and can be taken as for example wj τmax τj τmax where τmax is the maximum value of τ j the most plausible value of δ is the one corresponding to the minimum objective index which will be further illustrated in section 3 2 2 4 adaptation to climate change there is sufficient flexibility for the proposed model to consider the variations of rainfall characteristics due to climate change for example adjustments can be made to the marginal distributions of w d and i for future scenarios to capture the variations of rainfall duration interval time and intensity while the correlation between w and i as well as the inter station spatial correlation can be considered as stationary for simplicity peres cancelliere 2018 lee singh 2019 trend of regional climate change is usually identified based on historical data analysis or climate projections from a regional climate model when long term historical observations are available the variation trends of w d and i can be explored and the parameters of the marginal distributions can be adjusted through extrapolation besides the statistic moments are usually easy to obtain from rainfall projection and the change of parameters can be transformed from projected statistic moments as the types of marginal distributions can be different for different samples the changing rates of the three variables can be evaluated with the change rates of statistical moments instead of the parameters of the marginal distributions 8 f n m n f m n r where fn is the change rate of the nth moment of a variable mn f and mn r are the nth moment of the variable in a future period and a reference period respectively for simplicity they are obtained through linear regression as demonstrated later in this paper 3 rain field generation for the greater bay area with historical data 3 1 study area and historical data the proposed rain field generator is applied to gba in south china gba has a humid subtropical monsoon climate characterised by clear rainy and dry seasons and the average annual rainfall is over 1300 mm generally the monthly rainfall amount in gba has two peaks annually and the largest rainfall amounts occur in june may and august most of gba is delta plain with smooth terrain surrounded by intermittent mountains and hills the topography of gba and locations of 41 rainfall stations are shown in fig 1 hourly rainfall data is recorded by these rainfall stations and daily rainfall data is available to the public additionally high resolution rainfall data is also available from the dataset of nasa tropical rainfall measuring mission huffman et al 2007 the temporal and spatial resolutions of the rainfall data are 3 h and 0 25 0 25 respectively the observation periods are the rainy seasons from may to august of each year from 1998 to 2017 the rainfall data in this paper is obtained from the nasa dataset observations at four representative stations guangzhou dongguan shenzhen and zhuhai in gba are shown in fig 4 3 2 determination of model parameters for gba the marginal distributions of variables w d and i are chosen based on the historical data at the locations of rainfall stations data from all the stations is pooled together to estimate the parameters for the marginal distributions and the joint distribution because gba is a meteorological homogeneous region chong lee 2015 and a large number of rain stations are located on the delta plain with low elevations which makes the effect of topography to be very low five candidate marginal distributions i e lognormal generalized extreme value exponential inverse gaussian and geometric distributions and four candidate copulas i e gaussian frank clayton and gumbel copulas are compared to fit the data in gba note that w and d are normalized by 3 0 in this study because 3 hour interval rainfall data is used as shown in table 1 the geometric distribution inverse gaussian distribution and exponential distribution are chosen to model the wet spell duration dry spell duration and average intensity respectively and the frank copula is selected to model the joint distribution between w and i due to their respective minimum aic values the corresponding model parameters as well as the parameters for peak intensity are provided in table 2 fig 5 illustrates that all the selected probability models fit the data very well with respect to the spatial correlation parameter δ a trial and error method is adopted for a series of discrete values with a certain interval to minimize the objective index δ because the variation trend of δ with δ is of concern and minor differences in δ have little impact on the simulation results the objective index δ is calculated from the mean value of a number of simulations with nine possible values of δ ranging from 200 to 600 km with an interval of 50 km and a value of δ 400 km corresponding to the minimum δ is chosen fig 6 a fig 6b demonstrates a consistent decay trend of simultaneous rainfall intensity with the separation distance based on simulated and observed data 3 3 validation of rainfall characteristics with all the parameters determined the rainfall processes of any duration can be generated within the study area one hundred realizations of 20 year rainfall 4 month for each year are generated and an example of generated rainfall at the four representative stations and the variation of the interpolated spatial distribution of 24 hour cumulative rainfall amount during a generated intensive rainstorm are shown in fig 7 table 3 compares four characteristics of the generated and observed rainfalls including average number of rainfall events average single event rainfall standard deviation of single event rainfall and total rainfall amount within 4 months all the four characteristics are well reproduced by the proposed rainfall generator in addition frequency analysis is conducted with the annual maximum time series of observed and generated rainfall amounts in four common durations i e 6 12 24 and 48 h it should be noted that the generated rainfall data from all the stations is pooled together as a single sample in the frequency analysis because of the short length of observation period in fact simply pooling data from different stations will include some samples with strong dependency i e the spatial correlation among stations can reduce the number of effective samples this kind of effect is ignored here because the analysis is just used for validation purpose for each realization the generalized extreme value distribution is used to fit the data and the rainfall amounts corresponding to several exceedance probability values are calculated the results are shown in fig 8 for different rainfall durations the observed values are mostly inside the 90 confidence interval of simulated values for a short duration i e 6 hour the observed values are a bit larger than the simulated results or near the upper bound these are understandable because the patterns of rainfall events are assumed to have a similar predefined profile i e an exponentially increase to the peak value first followed by an exponentially decrease the difference between the real temporal variation of rainfall and the assumed profile may cause bias especially for the cumulative rainfall amount in a short duration as a whole the generated rainfall is able to reproduce the statistical characteristics of observations including extreme events 4 generation of future rainfall scenarios for the greater bay area 4 1 adaptation to regional climate change in addition to learning the past characteristics of rainfall possible rainfall scenarios in the future are of great interest because it will significantly influence the magnitudes of rainfall triggered hazards and the strategies of risk mitigation in gba evidences of climate change in terms of precipitation in the study area have been documented in the literature zhang et al 2009 lenderink et al 2011 chen et al 2012 du et al 2016 a clear decreasing trend in rainy days and increasing trend in the intensity and amount of extreme rainstorms have been found in the past decades the parameters of the proposed model can be adjusted to consider the future trend of rainfall under climate change although the observation period of data in this paper is relatively short some trends can still be found the trends of inter annual variations of the parameters of the marginal distributions for the three variables characterising the process of rainfall are shown in fig 9 the inverse gaussian distribution is used to fit the samples of dry spell duration and the probability density function of the dry spell duration exhibits a clear trend to become less positively skewed which indicates that the probability of longer dry spell has increased over the past 20 years similarly the probability density function of the average intensity shows a trend that the rainfall has become more intense during the past two decades to consider the future rainfall scenarios of the study area the parameters of the marginal distributions of the three variables are extrapolated assuming the trend to be linear while the other parameters i e the dependency between w and i the relation between peak intensity and average intensity and the spatial correlation are assumed unchanged rainfall is generated with the adjusted parameters of the marginal distributions of w d and i during the period of 2080 2100 the moments of the three variables in the future period and the associated changing rates can be calculated frequency analysis is then carried out with the results of 100 realizations fig 10 compares the frequency distributions of simulated rainfall in the past and the future the upper bounds of the 90 intervals as well as the medians of rainfall amount for all the four durations show a significant upside shift especially for low frequency events for example the medians of future rainfall at the frequency of 0 01 increase by 11 3 8 1 8 9 and 7 6 for durations of 6 12 24 and 48 h respectively based on the trend extrapolation of the past 20 years the simulation results imply a major increase in rainfall extremes at the end of 21st century the increasing trend of short duration rainfall is particularly significant which indicates that flash floods and shallow slope failures related to short term and high intensity rainfall will become more frequent in the future in gba the extrapolation is suitable for preliminary evaluation of future rainfall scenarios more rigorous adjustments can be made based on projections from climate models 4 2 effect of spatial correlation in the proposed model the spatial correlation parameter δ is used to characterise the inter station correlation in section 4 1 the spatial correlation is assumed to be stationary in adaptation to climate change given that the variation of spatial correlation is difficult to evaluate in this section sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spatial correlation on the model performance in terms of the frequency based regional rainfall characteristics parameter δ is scaled to be one half and twice of the value i e 200 and 800 km estimated from the historical data different from the frequency analysis in section 3 3 the generated annual maximum time series from different stations are not simply pooled together in this case because the difference of inter station correlation will lead to different sample numbers instead a method using regional l moments modified from the method of probability weighted moments estimation hosking wallis 2005 is adopted here for regional frequency analysis the method of regional frequency analysis is used to estimate the frequency distribution of rainfall from the generalized extreme value distribution with parameters determined using regional averages of the mean l variance and l skewness this method is based on the meteorological homogeneity of the study area which has been verified by chong and lee 2015 the results of the regional frequency distribution with different rainfall durations are shown in fig 11 a stronger spatial correlation a larger δ value leads to higher uncertainties especially for low frequencies the differences of uncertainty intervals induced by δ decrease and tend to be similar as the frequency becomes larger for long duration rainfall i e 48 hour the uncertainty growth due to a larger δ for low frequency events is quite remarkable the upper bound of which increases by 44 7 for events with a frequency of 0 001 when δ is doubled except for the uncertainty there are no obvious differences between the magnitudes medians of 6 hour and 12 hour rainfall generated with different δ values which indicates that the variation of δ controlling the spatial distribution of rainfall within each specific time slot will not have a significant influence on the statistical characteristics of short duration regional rainfall for rainfall of long durations i e 24 hour and 48 hour the magnitudes medians of low frequency events will be smaller as the spatial correlation becomes stronger the inter station spatial correlation is very important in terms of uncertainty of statistical characteristics of generated rainfall and it is desirable to take the variation of spatial correlation parameter into account when adapting the model to climate change however since the differences of rainfall magnitudes caused by variation of δ are not very large for problems that concern only about the overall regional characteristics of rainfall the spatial correlation parameter still can be assumed to be stationary and even selected based on experience instead of choosing from a wide range and a predefined spatial correlation function suffices to capture the regional spatial variation feature on the other hand more attention should be paid to the description of spatial correlation to make the features of generated areal rainfall of each specific time slot more realistic and the effect of terrain should be considered in the spatial correlation analysis in areas with large variations in topography 5 summary and conclusions a spatial temporal rain field generator based on point observations is developed and applied to the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area gba which frequently suffers storm related hazards the major conclusions are as follows 1 the rain field generator simulates the spatial temporal rain field through an alternating renewal process in the time domain with the consideration of inter station spatial correlation in the space domain the statistical characteristics of the rainfall in gba is well reproduced by the rain field generator which demonstrates the model s ability as a tool for hazard analysis in gba 2 the rain field generator can be adapted for climate change with the parameters of the marginal distributions of three variables describing duration interval and intensity of rainfall events adjusted extrapolating the variation trends of the marginal distributions observed in the past 20 years in gba to the end of 21st century the simulation results show a significant increase in rainfall extremes in gba especially for short duration rainfall 3 the sensitivity of spatial correlation parameter quantifying the inter station correlation is investigated the uncertainty of generated rainfall will increase significantly for low frequency events as the correlation becomes stronger which underlines the importance of spatial correlation in regional rainfall modelling however the differences in the magnitudes of regional rainfall induced by spatial correlation are limited especially for short duration rainfall 4 the proposed rain field generator can be combined with physically based distributed models for hydrological and geologic hazard analyses in gba to investigate the future hazard scenarios under climate change in the next step credit authorship contribution statement yejia qiang data curation formal analysis writing original draft limin zhang conceptualization

5708,compound dry and hot events have received increasing attention due to their serious impacts on different sectors of the society understanding their variability is of critical importance for developing adaptation measures to reduce their adverse impacts previous studies have shown increased frequency of these compound events in past decades at regional and global scales however the investigation of changes in their severity has been rather rare the objective of this study is to evaluate severity changes of compound dry and hot events for the warm season during the period 1961 2012 in china using two indices namely standardized compound event indicator scei and standardized dry hot index sdhi based on monthly precipitation and temperature results show a significant increase in the severity of compound dry and hot events in most parts of china which is mainly dominated by temperature compared to precipitation in addition significant increase of the spatial extent of compound dry and hot events at different severity levels in china is observed with more areas affected by these compound events after the 1990s for large regions from northeast to southwest china severe conditions of compound dry and hot events are shown to be associated with high risk of agricultural droughts both the two indices show similar trends in the severity of compound dry and hot events which indicates the robustness of increased spatial and temporal patterns highlighting the pressing need for improved understanding to reduce their adverse impacts keywords compound event dry and hot event severity extreme 1 introduction under the warming climate severe droughts and hot events have increased in recent decades over many land areas across the globe beniston 2009 dai 2012 kirono et al 2017 zhou and liu 2018 among them a suite of drought events have been observed to be accompanied by concurrent hot events lyon 2009 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 sedlmeier et al 2017 which are commonly referred to as compound events seneviratne et al 2012 and may lead to even more impacts to the ecosystems and human society than individual events ciais et al 2005 leonard et al 2014 wolf et al 2016 livneh and hoerling 2016 under global warming some unusually severe droughts or hot extremes occurred in historical records may become norms and common events in the coming decades for many regions russo et al 2014 leng et al 2016 which could lead to more compound events and result in even more disastrous impacts to the society and environment therefore accurate assessments of the variability of compound dry and hot events are essential for improving our understanding of these events and reducing their impacts due to the multivariate nature of compound dry and hot events accurate characterizations of these events require integration of information from multiple contributing variables or properties leonard et al 2014 traditional assessments of compound dry and hot events mostly focus on the frequency variability which is commonly achieved based on defining concurrences of droughts and hot extremes for the period of interest using different thresholds hao et al 2013 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 zhou and liu 2018 this approach enables the detection of variations of compound event occurrences however it fails to distinguish severity levels of multiple compound events hence a joint indicator of multiple extremes or events plays an important role in this regard several joint indicators of climate extremes have been developed in recent years to assess different properties such as the severity and spatial extent taking into account multivariate factors associated with extremes kao and govindaraju 2010 gallant et al 2014 hao et al 2018 for example the climate extremes index cei has integrated several extremes by taking linear average of the areas covered by different extreme indicators gallant et al 2014 and has been commonly employed to assess changes of spatial extent the joint probability of multivariate random variables has also been employed to assess the severity of extreme events for instance kao and govindaraju 2010 proposed a joint deficit index jdi for combining meteorological and hydrological droughts using the copula based on joint distributions following the same concept hao et al 2019 proposed the standardized compound event indicator scei to assess the severity of compound dry and hot events by standardizing the joint probability of droughts and hot events these joint indices have provided useful tools to aid our understanding of the frequency spatial extent and severity of different extremes because of the complexity of climate extremes uncertainties may exist in assessing changes of droughts and hot extremes based on different indicators leading to different patterns of variability burke 2011 sheffield et al 2012 dai 2012 for example sheffield et al 2012 concluded little change in the severity and area of global droughts over the past several decades based on palmer drought severity index using physical penman monteith algorithm for estimating potential evaporation pdsi pm while dai 2012 showed an increase in global drought based on self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi for the hot event a consensus on the increase of high temperature extremes has been reached based on different definitions and indices perkins 2015 you et al 2017 however certain differences still exist in the changing pattern if different indicators are used perkins and alexander 2013 as for compound dry and hot events due to the inclusion of both drought and hot conditions changes in the property may be more complicated in addition as indices usually have their own advantages and disadvantages it is essential to compare the results from different indices to assess the robustness thus it is desirable to assess the changing pattern of compound dry and hot events from a multivariate multi index perspective the objective of this study is to evaluate changes of the severity of compound dry and hot events during summer season june july and august jja for the period 1961 2012 in china based on monthly precipitation and temperature data two compound event indicators are employed in this study to evaluate the severity changes of compound events the method used in this study is provided in section 2 data and results are presented in section 3 followed by the conclusion in section 4 2 method 2 1 copula model copulas have been widely used for constructing the joint distribution of multivariate random variables for a variety of applications in hydrology including deriving joint extreme indicator kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 the copula model c of two random variables x and y can be expressed as nelsen 2006 1 p x x y y c f x g y c u v where u f x and v g y are marginal distributions of random variables x and y respectively there are a variety of copula families used for modeling different dependence structures of random variables such as gaussian frank gumbel and clayton copula nelsen 2006 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 ayantobo et al 2018 gaussian copula is suitable to model both positive and negative dependences among multiple variables trivedi and zimmer 2005 hao et al 2017 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 thus we used gaussian copula to construct the joint distribution to derive the compound event indicator in this study in addition the conditional distribution can be employed to assess impacts of compound events on other variables such as soil moisture or agricultural drought the conditional distribution of x given y can be expressed as 2 p x x y y c u v v 2 2 extreme indices the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized temperature index sti were used to measure the dry and hot condition respectively since we focused on the summer season june july august jja we computed the spi and sti based on averaged precipitation and temperature during jja respectively the empirical gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 was used to estimate marginal distributions which was then transformed to spi and sti based on the standard normal distribution two indices to evaluate the severity of compound dry and hot events have been proposed recently namely standardized compound event indicator scei hao et al 2019 and standardized dry and hot index sdhi hao et al 2018 for two random variables x and y representing precipitation spi and temperature sti respectively the compound dry and hot event can be characterized as one variable x lower than or equal to a threshold x and the other variable y higher than a threshold y at the same time the joint probability p of the compound dry and hot event can then be expressed as 3 p p x x y y u c u v the joint probability p can be regarded as a measure of the severity of compound dry and hot events to facilitate the comparison with other indices the joint probability p was transformed to a uniform distribution by fitting a distribution f which was then standardized as an indicator to characterize the severity of compound dry and hot events the scei can be expressed as hao et al 2019 4 s c e i ϕ 1 f p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution f is the marginal cumulative distribution which remaps the joint probability to the uniform distribution to define the relative status of dry and hot conditions the ratio of the marginal probability or percentile of precipitation and temperature can be defined as a variable z hao et al 2018 5 z g 1 p g 2 t where g 1 p and g 2 t are marginal probabilities of precipitation and temperature respectively the sdhi based on the distribution of the variable z can be expressed as hao et al 2018 6 s d h i φ 1 f z the marginal distribution functions f g 1 and g 2 can be fitted based on the empirical gringorten plotting position formula to avoid assumptions of parametric distribution forms as both the scei and sdhi are developed based on the standard normal distribution values of the two indices fall within the same range as the commonly used spi and sti lower values of these two indices indicate more severe conditions of compound dry and hot events similar to the threshold of spi to characterize different categories of drought svoboda et al 2002 here we defined 5 categories of compound dry and hot conditions including ce0 abnormal compound dry hot condition ce1 moderate compound dry hot condition ce2 severe compound dry hot condition ce3 extreme compound dry hot condition ce4 exceptional compound dry hot condition as shown in table 1 2 3 mann kendall trend test the nonparametric mann kendall mk trend test with sen s slope evaluation method sen 1968 has been widely applied for trend analysis of hydro climatology series liu et al 2016 venkataraman et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2018 gu et al 2019 sinha et al 2019 the sen s slope of the trend is calculated as 7 s s m e d i a n x j x i j i where s s is the slope of the trend xi and xj are data values i j for the data series xt t 1 2 n the trend is considered to be significant at a 0 05 significance level when p value is less than 0 05 2 4 regression analysis the variability of the severity of compound dry and hot events may result from variations of precipitation and temperature following cheng et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 we used a multiple linear regression model to investigate contributions of precipitation and temperature to the severity trend the regression equation is expressed as follows 8 r a p b t c where r is the severity of compound events p and t are precipitation and temperature respectively a and b are corresponding regression coefficients c is a constant based on eq 8 the contributions of precipitation and temperature to the variation of compound event severity can be calculated as 9 cp a δ p δ r 100 10 c t b δ t δ r 100 where cp and ct are contributions of precipitation and temperature to the severity variation respectively δr δp and δt are changes in mean r precipitation and temperature respectively between the first and last 10 years the relative contribution of precipitation temperature can be obtained by dividing the absolute value of cp ct by the summation of the absolute values of cp and ct and multiplying 100 bai et al 2019 3 data and results 3 1 data monthly precipitation and temperature data at 0 5 spatial resolution from 1961 to 2012 were used in this study which were generated by integrating the information from 2472 meteorological stations across china by the national climatic center of china meteorological administration these precipitation and temperature datasets are available at http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn pre mon grid 0 5 html and http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn tem mon grid 0 5 html respectively in this study we only focused on the compound dry and hot event during the warm season i e jja as droughts and hot extremes usually have significant impacts on humanity and agriculture during summer coumou and robinson 2013 the average precipitation and temperature of the 3 months jja at each grid point were first obtained and then the scei and sdhi were computed based on eqs 4 and 6 in addition to assess the impact of compound events on soil moisture agricultural drought we used daily soil moisture data simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model with a spatial resolution of 0 25 during the same period 1961 2012 in this study obtained from http hydro igsnrr ac cn public vic outputs html zhang et al 2014 this dataset was converted into monthly data by averaging the daily data and bilinearly interpolated to the 0 5 spatial resolution 3 2 comparison of two indices to illustrate the performance of the two indices in characterizing the severity of compound dry and hot events fig 1 shows the scei and sdhi as well as the spi and sti during jja for the period 1961 2012 for the southwest region of china i e sichuan chongqing area which is marked in fig 2 these indices were computed based on mean precipitation and temperature during jja of each year which were obtained by taking spatial average of precipitation and temperature of all the grid points in this region for each month the low and negative spi value indicates severe conditions of drought while the high and positive sti value indicates hot conditions from fig 1 the study area experienced severe droughts during 1972 1994 1997 2006 and 2011 with low spi values and suffered from hot events during 1961 1972 1981 2006 and 2011 with high sti values two severe compound dry and hot events occurred during 2006 and 2011 with low values of scei 2 30 and 1 65 and sdhi 2 30 and 1 88 this is consistent with the previous studies lu et al 2013 li et al 2014 wang et al 2015 which show that this region has been struck by severe drought and hot conditions in 2006 and 2011 results of these two years indicate that both scei and sdhi are useful in depicting the severity of compound dry and hot events in addition for some years spi and sti show that either drought or hot condition occurred while the index scei sdhi may or may not show the compound condition depending on the relative condition of droughts and hot events for example the spi value of summer 1997 is 1 49 showing severe drought while the corresponding sti value is 0 32 indicating nonexistence of hot conditions in this year however both scei and sdhi show compound dry and hot conditions in 1997 scei 1 15 sdhi 1 36 this is an important property of the multivariate indicator of the compound event since severe impacts may be induced by contributing variables that are not at extreme level seneviratne et al 2012 however there are also some differences between the scei and sdhi for characterizing the severity of compound dry and hot events during some years although both scei and sdhi show the occurrence of compound events levels of the severity of the same compound event vary based on the two indices for example values of the scei and sdhi for jja during 1975 are 0 64 abnormal compound dry hot condition and 1 06 moderate compound dry hot condition respectively in addition for certain periods only one of the two indicators reveals compound dry and hot events for example values of the scei and sdhi for summer 1970 are 0 17 and 0 77 respectively overall though certain discrepancies exist these two indices provide useful measures for characterizing compound dry and hot events incorporating both dry and hot conditions 3 3 case study of 2006 the extreme drought accompanied by the hot event during summer 2006 in southwest china has brought disastrous impacts to the society and ecosystem which is unprecedented in local records wang et al 2015 here we focused on 2006 as a case study to assess the spatial pattern of the severity of compound dry and hot events based on the two indices scei and sdhi the spi and sti were also computed for comparisons as shown in fig 2 southwest china suffered from compound dry and hot conditions in 2006 especially for sichuan province and chongqing municipality marked in the figure in most of these regions the spi value is lower than 1 and the sti value is higher than 1 5 the values of both scei and sdhi are mostly lower than 1 5 more severe than ce2 category of compound dry and hot event compared with the spi scei and sdhi values are even lower indicating that high temperature has intensified the drought condition resulting in occurrences of the compound dry and hot event during summer 2006 in general the two indices scei and sdhi show similar spatial patterns of the severity of compound events nevertheless certain difference exists in the northwest region where severe and abnormal conditions of compound events are shown from scei and sdhi respectively 3 4 trend analysis of the severity of compound events in this section we evaluated the temporal variation of the severity of compound dry and hot events in china based on the two indices scei and sdhi using the nonparametric mk trend test the slope values of nonparametric mk trend test of the scei and sdhi as well as precipitation and temperature during jja for the period 1961 2012 are shown in fig 3 there is a decrease in the severity of compound dry and hot events an increase in values of the scei and sdhi in central regions and some parts of northwestern china this may be due to the effect of increased precipitation and decreased temperature in these regions as shown in fig 3c and d however for most parts of china except for some central and northwestern regions an increase in the severity of compound dry and hot events or decrease in index values is shown based on both scei and sdhi this is roughly in agreement with increased frequency of droughts and hot days over china in recent decades wang et al 2016 shi et al 2018 though the two indices show similar patterns in the trend of the severity of compound dry and hot events subtle differences remained for instance for parts of north china a significantly increasing trend is shown based on the index scei at a 0 05 significance level fig 3a while a non significant increase exists based on the sdhi fig 3b the increased trend of the severity of compound dry and hot events is likely affected by the individual or combined effect of variations of precipitation and temperature for example with the increase of temperature the severity of compound events is expected to increase with the unchanged precipitation in terms of the individual event many parts of northeastern and southwestern china show a decrease in precipitation while a significant increase in temperature is observed fig 3c and d these variations of precipitation and temperature are generally consistent with the results of previous studies zhai et al 2005 lu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 and may explain the increased trend of the severity of compound dry and hot events in northeastern and southwestern china in addition increased severity trend of compound dry and hot events is shown in large regions in western china with increased precipitation and temperature fig 3c and d it is likely that compared with precipitation variations the increased temperature dominated the increased severity of compound events in these regions to further explore relative contributions of precipitation and temperature variations to the severity trend of compound events we assessed the individual effect of the two variables based on the regression equation see method we focused on the region with increased severity or decreased index values of compound events and regions with decreased severity were masked out as shown in fig 4 the contribution of temperature dominates the increase of the severity of compound dry and hot events in most parts of china with the values mostly higher than 60 which are much larger than that of precipitation with most values lower than 40 for both the two indices these results indicate that a rise in the temperature likely dominates the increased severity of compound dry and hot events in china 3 5 areas affected by different severity levels here we defined spatial extent as the proportion of areas affected by compound dry and hot events we chose 0 5 0 8 and 1 3 which correspond to the ce0 ce1 and ce2 categories respectively as the thresholds of different severity levels the spatial extent of different severity levels was then obtained based on the number of grid points with compound event occurrences divided by the total number of grid points the changes in the spatial extent of compound dry and hot events based on the three thresholds of the scei and sdhi for jja during 1961 2012 in china are shown in fig 5 an increase in areas affected by different severity levels of compound dry and hot events is observed with higher increase rate in recent decades after around the 1990s this may be due to the remarkable increase in droughts as well as hot days in most parts of china since the 1990s ding et al 2009 yu et al 2014 the two indices generally show a similar pattern of increase in the spatial extent but there are some differences in the increase rate namely for the thresholds of 0 5 0 8 and 1 3 i e ce0 ce1 and ce2 categories the rate of increase in the spatial extent based on the scei is 0 06 decade 0 04 decade and 0 02 decade respectively which is larger than the corresponding increase rate based on the sdhi i e 0 04 decade 0 02 decade and 0 01 decade respectively all passed the significance test at the 0 05 significance level to further evaluate changes in the proportion of areas affected by compound dry and hot conditions the spatial extent based on each severity level was divided into two equal periods i e 1961 1986 and 1987 2012 we then explored variations of the spatial extent of different severity levels for the two periods using the boxplot as shown in fig 6 increase in areas covered by compound dry and hot events of different severity levels is observed in recent decades i e 1987 2012 for example the change in the median of the spatial extent during 1987 2012 relative to 1961 1986 ranges from 0 065 0 024 to 0 189 0 119 for the scei sdhi based on different thresholds of the severity compared with the sdhi a slightly larger increase has been observed based on scei additionally with increased severity level i e from 0 8 to 1 3 the magnitude of the increase in the spatial extent decreases generally the two indices show increased area affected by compound dry and hot events at different severity levels indicating the increasing risk of compound dry and hot events across china the consistency between the scei and sdhi at different severity thresholds indicates the robustness of the result 3 6 effects on agricultural drought the agricultural drought based on soil moisture has been shown to be affected by both precipitation and temperature evapotranspiration and is commonly referred to as a compound event manning et al 2018 here the standardized soil moisture index ssi was used as the measure of the agricultural drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 and computed in a similar manner to the spi and sti to explore impacts of the severity of compound dry and hot events on agricultural drought we computed the conditional probability of agricultural drought i e ssi 1 3 given severe conditions of compound dry and hot events i e scei 1 3 or sdhi 1 3 which can be obtained from eqs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 7 a high probability of soil moisture deficit is observed given the severe compound dry and hot conditions in most regions of eastern china where a strong link of droughts and hot extremes has been identified hao et al 2017 specifically most of the regions with high conditional probability are located in the strip from northeast to southwest china most of which are semi arid and semi humid regions or transitional regions between dry and wet climates the strong land atmosphere interaction or soil moisture temperature feedback may partly explain this pattern specifically decreased soil moisture e g from precipitation deficit leads to reduced evapotranspiration as well as evaporative cooling resulting in increased local temperature which further leads to high vapor pressure deficit vpd and evaporative demand causing potential decrease of soil moisture seneviratne et al 2010 zhang and wu 2011 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 in general these results confirm that strong dependence exists between the severity of compound dry and hot events and soil moisture in most regions from northeast to southwest china which indicates high likelihood of agricultural drought in large parts of these areas when compound dry and hot events occur posing threat to the agricultural production and management 4 conclusion we evaluated variations of the severity of compound dry and hot events of the warm season jja during 1961 2012 in china in this study using two compound indices standardized compound event indicator scei and standardized dry hot index sdhi based on monthly precipitation and temperature a significant increase in the severity of compound dry and hot events was observed in most parts of china except for some central and northwest regions the increased severity of compound dry and hot events was largely caused by temperature increase the area affected by compound dry and hot events at different severity levels showed an increase rate ranging from 0 01 decade to 0 06 decade more areas have been covered by these compound events in recent decades since the 1990s both the two indices showed similar spatial and temporal patterns of increase in the severity and spatial extent of compound events high probability of agricultural drought conditional on severe compound dry and hot conditions was observed over large regions of eastern china especially for the transitional regions between dry and wet climates findings from this study indicate that the risk of compound dry and hot events has increased in most parts of china and call for more preventive measures to mitigate their impacts note that compound dry and hot events resulting in a disaster does not only depend on the severity of the event but also on the exposure and vulnerability of the society and ecosystem experiencing extreme events barros and stocker 2012 thus more efforts are needed to assess the risk of compound dry and hot events incorporating these factors that lead to a disaster to a particular sector e g agricultural production in addition the performance of the index in characterizing compound events needs to be further evaluated based on comparisons with other indicators such as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the change in the severity of compound dry and hot events may result from multiple factors related to the occurrence of drought heat wave such as sea surface temperature anomaly hu et al 2012 atmospheric circulation anomaly zhang et al 2016 and anthropogenic activity wang et al 2015 attribution of causes for changes in the severity of compound dry and hot events needs improved efforts and will be conducted in our future studies results from this study are expected to provide useful references for understanding the risk of compound dry and hot events and mitigating their negative effects in china under global warming declaration of

perspective the objective of this study is to evaluate changes of the severity of compound dry and hot events during summer season june july and august jja for the period 1961 2012 in china based on monthly precipitation and temperature data two compound event indicators are employed in this study to evaluate the severity changes of compound events the method used in this study is provided in section 2 data and results are presented in section 3 followed by the conclusion in section 4 2 method 2 1 copula model copulas have been widely used for constructing the joint distribution of multivariate random variables for a variety of applications in hydrology including deriving joint extreme indicator kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 the copula model c of two random variables x and y can be expressed as nelsen 2006 1 p x x y y c f x g y c u v where u f x and v g y are marginal distributions of random variables x and y respectively there are a variety of copula families used for modeling different dependence structures of random variables such as gaussian frank gumbel and clayton copula nelsen 2006 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 ayantobo et al 2018 gaussian copula is suitable to model both positive and negative dependences among multiple variables trivedi and zimmer 2005 hao et al 2017 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 thus we used gaussian copula to construct the joint distribution to derive the compound event indicator in this study in addition the conditional distribution can be employed to assess impacts of compound events on other variables such as soil moisture or agricultural drought the conditional distribution of x given y can be expressed as 2 p x x y y c u v v 2 2 extreme indices the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized temperature index sti were used to measure the dry and hot condition respectively since we focused on the summer season june july august jja we computed the spi and sti based on averaged precipitation and temperature during jja respectively the empirical gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 was used to estimate marginal distributions which was then transformed to spi and sti based on the standard normal distribution two indices to evaluate the severity of compound dry and hot events have been proposed recently namely standardized compound event indicator scei hao et al 2019 and standardized dry and hot index sdhi hao et al 2018 for two random variables x and y representing precipitation spi and temperature sti respectively the compound dry and hot event can be characterized as one variable x lower than or equal to a threshold x and the other variable y higher than a threshold y at the same time the joint probability p of the compound dry and hot event can then be expressed as 3 p p x x y y u c u v the joint probability p can be regarded as a measure of the severity of compound dry and hot events to facilitate the comparison with other indices the joint probability p was transformed to a uniform distribution by fitting a distribution f which was then standardized as an indicator to characterize the severity of compound dry and hot events the scei can be expressed as hao et al 2019 4 s c e i ϕ 1 f p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution f is the marginal cumulative distribution which remaps the joint probability to the uniform distribution to define the relative status of dry and hot conditions the ratio of the marginal probability or percentile of precipitation and temperature can be defined as a variable z hao et al 2018 5 z g 1 p g 2 t where g 1 p and g 2 t are marginal probabilities of precipitation and temperature respectively the sdhi based on the distribution of the variable z can be expressed as hao et al 2018 6 s d h i φ 1 f z the marginal distribution functions f g 1 and g 2 can be fitted based on the empirical gringorten plotting position formula to avoid assumptions of parametric distribution forms as both the scei and sdhi are developed based on the standard normal distribution values of the two indices fall within the same range as the commonly used spi and sti lower values of these two indices indicate more severe conditions of compound dry and hot events similar to the threshold of spi to characterize different categories of drought svoboda et al 2002 here we defined 5 categories of compound dry and hot conditions including ce0 abnormal compound dry hot condition ce1 moderate compound dry hot condition ce2 severe compound dry hot condition ce3 extreme compound dry hot condition ce4 exceptional compound dry hot condition as shown in table 1 2 3 mann kendall trend test the nonparametric mann kendall mk trend test with sen s slope evaluation method sen 1968 has been widely applied for trend analysis of hydro climatology series liu et al 2016 venkataraman et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2018 gu et al 2019 sinha et al 2019 the sen s slope of the trend is calculated as 7 s s m e d i a n x j x i j i where s s is the slope of the trend xi and xj are data values i j for the data series xt t 1 2 n the trend is considered to be significant at a 0 05 significance level when p value is less than 0 05 2 4 regression analysis the variability of the severity of compound dry and hot events may result from variations of precipitation and temperature following cheng et al 2015 and wang et al 2016 we used a multiple linear regression model to investigate contributions of precipitation and temperature to the severity trend the regression equation is expressed as follows 8 r a p b t c where r is the severity of compound events p and t are precipitation and temperature respectively a and b are corresponding regression coefficients c is a constant based on eq 8 the contributions of precipitation and temperature to the variation of compound event severity can be calculated as 9 cp a δ p δ r 100 10 c t b δ t δ r 100 where cp and ct are contributions of precipitation and temperature to the severity variation respectively δr δp and δt are changes in mean r precipitation and temperature respectively between the first and last 10 years the relative contribution of precipitation temperature can be obtained by dividing the absolute value of cp ct by the summation of the absolute values of cp and ct and multiplying 100 bai et al 2019 3 data and results 3 1 data monthly precipitation and temperature data at 0 5 spatial resolution from 1961 to 2012 were used in this study which were generated by integrating the information from 2472 meteorological stations across china by the national climatic center of china meteorological administration these precipitation and temperature datasets are available at http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn pre mon grid 0 5 html and http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn tem mon grid 0 5 html respectively in this study we only focused on the compound dry and hot event during the warm season i e jja as droughts and hot extremes usually have significant impacts on humanity and agriculture during summer coumou and robinson 2013 the average precipitation and temperature of the 3 months jja at each grid point were first obtained and then the scei and sdhi were computed based on eqs 4 and 6 in addition to assess the impact of compound events on soil moisture agricultural drought we used daily soil moisture data simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model with a spatial resolution of 0 25 during the same period 1961 2012 in this study obtained from http hydro igsnrr ac cn public vic outputs html zhang et al 2014 this dataset was converted into monthly data by averaging the daily data and bilinearly interpolated to the 0 5 spatial resolution 3 2 comparison of two indices to illustrate the performance of the two indices in characterizing the severity of compound dry and hot events fig 1 shows the scei and sdhi as well as the spi and sti during jja for the period 1961 2012 for the southwest region of china i e sichuan chongqing area which is marked in fig 2 these indices were computed based on mean precipitation and temperature during jja of each year which were obtained by taking spatial average of precipitation and temperature of all the grid points in this region for each month the low and negative spi value indicates severe conditions of drought while the high and positive sti value indicates hot conditions from fig 1 the study area experienced severe droughts during 1972 1994 1997 2006 and 2011 with low spi values and suffered from hot events during 1961 1972 1981 2006 and 2011 with high sti values two severe compound dry and hot events occurred during 2006 and 2011 with low values of scei 2 30 and 1 65 and sdhi 2 30 and 1 88 this is consistent with the previous studies lu et al 2013 li et al 2014 wang et al 2015 which show that this region has been struck by severe drought and hot conditions in 2006 and 2011 results of these two years indicate that both scei and sdhi are useful in depicting the severity of compound dry and hot events in addition for some years spi and sti show that either drought or hot condition occurred while the index scei sdhi may or may not show the compound condition depending on the relative condition of droughts and hot events for example the spi value of summer 1997 is 1 49 showing severe drought while the corresponding sti value is 0 32 indicating nonexistence of hot conditions in this year however both scei and sdhi show compound dry and hot conditions in 1997 scei 1 15 sdhi 1 36 this is an important property of the multivariate indicator of the compound event since severe impacts may be induced by contributing variables that are not at extreme level seneviratne et al 2012 however there are also some differences between the scei and sdhi for characterizing the severity of compound dry and hot events during some years although both scei and sdhi show the occurrence of compound events levels of the severity of the same compound event vary based on the two indices for example values of the scei and sdhi for jja during 1975 are 0 64 abnormal compound dry hot condition and 1 06 moderate compound dry hot condition respectively in addition for certain periods only one of the two indicators reveals compound dry and hot events for example values of the scei and sdhi for summer 1970 are 0 17 and 0 77 respectively overall though certain discrepancies exist these two indices provide useful measures for characterizing compound dry and hot events incorporating both dry and hot conditions 3 3 case study of 2006 the extreme drought accompanied by the hot event during summer 2006 in southwest china has brought disastrous impacts to the society and ecosystem which is unprecedented in local records wang et al 2015 here we focused on 2006 as a case study to assess the spatial pattern of the severity of compound dry and hot events based on the two indices scei and sdhi the spi and sti were also computed for comparisons as shown in fig 2 southwest china suffered from compound dry and hot conditions in 2006 especially for sichuan province and chongqing municipality marked in the figure in most of these regions the spi value is lower than 1 and the sti value is higher than 1 5 the values of both scei and sdhi are mostly lower than 1 5 more severe than ce2 category of compound dry and hot event compared with the spi scei and sdhi values are even lower indicating that high temperature has intensified the drought condition resulting in occurrences of the compound dry and hot event during summer 2006 in general the two indices scei and sdhi show similar spatial patterns of the severity of compound events nevertheless certain difference exists in the northwest region where severe and abnormal conditions of compound events are shown from scei and sdhi respectively 3 4 trend analysis of the severity of compound events in this section we evaluated the temporal variation of the severity of compound dry and hot events in china based on the two indices scei and sdhi using the nonparametric mk trend test the slope values of nonparametric mk trend test of the scei and sdhi as well as precipitation and temperature during jja for the period 1961 2012 are shown in fig 3 there is a decrease in the severity of compound dry and hot events an increase in values of the scei and sdhi in central regions and some parts of northwestern china this may be due to the effect of increased precipitation and decreased temperature in these regions as shown in fig 3c and d however for most parts of china except for some central and northwestern regions an increase in the severity of compound dry and hot events or decrease in index values is shown based on both scei and sdhi this is roughly in agreement with increased frequency of droughts and hot days over china in recent decades wang et al 2016 shi et al 2018 though the two indices show similar patterns in the trend of the severity of compound dry and hot events subtle differences remained for instance for parts of north china a significantly increasing trend is shown based on the index scei at a 0 05 significance level fig 3a while a non significant increase exists based on the sdhi fig 3b the increased trend of the severity of compound dry and hot events is likely affected by the individual or combined effect of variations of precipitation and temperature for example with the increase of temperature the severity of compound events is expected to increase with the unchanged precipitation in terms of the individual event many parts of northeastern and southwestern china show a decrease in precipitation while a significant increase in temperature is observed fig 3c and d these variations of precipitation and temperature are generally consistent with the results of previous studies zhai et al 2005 lu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 and may explain the increased trend of the severity of compound dry and hot events in northeastern and southwestern china in addition increased severity trend of compound dry and hot events is shown in large regions in western china with increased precipitation and temperature fig 3c and d it is likely that compared with precipitation variations the increased temperature dominated the increased severity of compound events in these regions to further explore relative contributions of precipitation and temperature variations to the severity trend of compound events we assessed the individual effect of the two variables based on the regression equation see method we focused on the region with increased severity or decreased index values of compound events and regions with decreased severity were masked out as shown in fig 4 the contribution of temperature dominates the increase of the severity of compound dry and hot events in most parts of china with the values mostly higher than 60 which are much larger than that of precipitation with most values lower than 40 for both the two indices these results indicate that a rise in the temperature likely dominates the increased severity of compound dry and hot events in china 3 5 areas affected by different severity levels here we defined spatial extent as the proportion of areas affected by compound dry and hot events we chose 0 5 0 8 and 1 3 which correspond to the ce0 ce1 and ce2 categories respectively as the thresholds of different severity levels the spatial extent of different severity levels was then obtained based on the number of grid points with compound event occurrences divided by the total number of grid points the changes in the spatial extent of compound dry and hot events based on the three thresholds of the scei and sdhi for jja during 1961 2012 in china are shown in fig 5 an increase in areas affected by different severity levels of compound dry and hot events is observed with higher increase rate in recent decades after around the 1990s this may be due to the remarkable increase in droughts as well as hot days in most parts of china since the 1990s ding et al 2009 yu et al 2014 the two indices generally show a similar pattern of increase in the spatial extent but there are some differences in the increase rate namely for the thresholds of 0 5 0 8 and 1 3 i e ce0 ce1 and ce2 categories the rate of increase in the spatial extent based on the scei is 0 06 decade 0 04 decade and 0 02 decade respectively which is larger than the corresponding increase rate based on the sdhi i e 0 04 decade 0 02 decade and 0 01 decade respectively all passed the significance test at the 0 05 significance level to further evaluate changes in the proportion of areas affected by compound dry and hot conditions the spatial extent based on each severity level was divided into two equal periods i e 1961 1986 and 1987 2012 we then explored variations of the spatial extent of different severity levels for the two periods using the boxplot as shown in fig 6 increase in areas covered by compound dry and hot events of different severity levels is observed in recent decades i e 1987 2012 for example the change in the median of the spatial extent during 1987 2012 relative to 1961 1986 ranges from 0 065 0 024 to 0 189 0 119 for the scei sdhi based on different thresholds of the severity compared with the sdhi a slightly larger increase has been observed based on scei additionally with increased severity level i e from 0 8 to 1 3 the magnitude of the increase in the spatial extent decreases generally the two indices show increased area affected by compound dry and hot events at different severity levels indicating the increasing risk of compound dry and hot events across china the consistency between the scei and sdhi at different severity thresholds indicates the robustness of the result 3 6 effects on agricultural drought the agricultural drought based on soil moisture has been shown to be affected by both precipitation and temperature evapotranspiration and is commonly referred to as a compound event manning et al 2018 here the standardized soil moisture index ssi was used as the measure of the agricultural drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 and computed in a similar manner to the spi and sti to explore impacts of the severity of compound dry and hot events on agricultural drought we computed the conditional probability of agricultural drought i e ssi 1 3 given severe conditions of compound dry and hot events i e scei 1 3 or sdhi 1 3 which can be obtained from eqs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 7 a high probability of soil moisture deficit is observed given the severe compound dry and hot conditions in most regions of eastern china where a strong link of droughts and hot extremes has been identified hao et al 2017 specifically most of the regions with high conditional probability are located in the strip from northeast to southwest china most of which are semi arid and semi humid regions or transitional regions between dry and wet climates the strong land atmosphere interaction or soil moisture temperature feedback may partly explain this pattern specifically decreased soil moisture e g from precipitation deficit leads to reduced evapotranspiration as well as evaporative cooling resulting in increased local temperature which further leads to high vapor pressure deficit vpd and evaporative demand causing potential decrease of soil moisture seneviratne et al 2010 zhang and wu 2011 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 in general these results confirm that strong dependence exists between the severity of compound dry and hot events and soil moisture in most regions from northeast to southwest china which indicates high likelihood of agricultural drought in large parts of these areas when compound dry and hot events occur posing threat to the agricultural production and management 4 conclusion we evaluated variations of the severity of compound dry and hot events of the warm season jja during 1961 2012 in china in this study using two compound indices standardized compound event indicator scei and standardized dry hot index sdhi based on monthly precipitation and temperature a significant increase in the severity of compound dry and hot events was observed in most parts of china except for some central and northwest regions the increased severity of compound dry and hot events was largely caused by temperature increase the area affected by compound dry and hot events at different severity levels showed an increase rate ranging from 0 01 decade to 0 06 decade more areas have been covered by these compound events in recent decades since the 1990s both the two indices showed similar spatial and temporal patterns of increase in the severity and spatial extent of compound events high probability of agricultural drought conditional on severe compound dry and hot conditions was observed over large regions of eastern china especially for the transitional regions between dry and wet climates findings from this study indicate that the risk of compound dry and hot events has increased in most parts of china and call for more preventive measures to mitigate their impacts note that compound dry and hot events resulting in a disaster does not only depend on the severity of the event but also on the exposure and vulnerability of the society and ecosystem experiencing extreme events barros and stocker 2012 thus more efforts are needed to assess the risk of compound dry and hot events incorporating these factors that lead to a disaster to a particular sector e g agricultural production in addition the performance of the index in characterizing compound events needs to be further evaluated based on comparisons with other indicators such as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the change in the severity of compound dry and hot events may result from multiple factors related to the occurrence of drought heat wave such as sea surface temperature anomaly hu et al 2012 atmospheric circulation anomaly zhang et al 2016 and anthropogenic activity wang et al 2015 attribution of causes for changes in the severity of compound dry and hot events needs improved efforts and will be conducted in our future studies results from this study are expected to provide useful references for understanding the risk of compound dry and hot events and mitigating their negative effects in china under global warming declaration of

5709,covering a large portion of the northern conterminous united states 1 87 106 km2 the glacial aquifer serves as the primary water supply for 30 million public and domestic water users mean groundwater age groundwater age distribution and susceptibility to land surface contamination using a new metric susceptibility index si based on the full age distribution and less prone to bias than estimated mean age is reported for 168 public and domestic wells across the aquifer comparison of groundwater age metrics between well networks of varying spatial scale suggest an extensive sample network of equally spaced long screened interval wells can be used to characterize aquifer wide groundwater age estimated mean age ranges from 1 to 50 000 years and according to the composite age distribution approximately 63 percent of all sampled water recharged after 1950 i e modern and 18 percent of the sampled water was recharged greater than 10 000 years ago the later finding strongly suggests a connection between the glacial aquifer and underlying bedrock aquifers statistical analysis of glacial aquifer hydrogeology and age metrics show groundwater ages are young less than few 100 years and more susceptible to land surface contamination larger si in unconfined and shallow portions of the aquifer old groundwater greater than 1 000 years is more often associated with thicker sequences of fine grain sediments and or shallow bedrock calculated si is shown to be more strongly related to the number of land surface contaminants detected than mean age or fraction modern statistical analysis of si and hydrogeology indicates si is largely dictated by well depth and confinement this study demonstrates how sample network design can be used to characterize groundwater age of large aquifers with a limited number of samples and how interpretation of environmental tracers can be used to improve conceptual models of groundwater aquifers and identify groundwater susceptible to contamination keywords groundwater age distribution glacial aquifer susceptibility index hydrogeology 1 introduction the glacial aquifer system provides more water for public and domestic use 98 trillion liters per day in year 2000 than any other single aquifer in the nation maupin and barber 2005 maupin and arnold 2010 the groundwater pumped from the glacial aquifer supplies approximately 30 million people and constitutes nearly 5 percent of all drinking water in the united states haj et al 2018 yager et al 2019 the long term susceptibility and sustainability of the glacial aquifer system for drinking water supplies is of utmost importance groundwater age is a fundamental metric of groundwater flow systems and can be understood as the elapsed time between recharge once isolated from the atmosphere to groundwater sample collection the distribution of groundwater age represents the variability of ages from individual flow paths and integrates physical characteristics and processes

selection requiring the evaluation of the hydrogeology and physical dimensions of the flow system groundwater susceptibility is synonymous with groundwater vulnerability which the national research council 1993 defines as the tendency or likelihood for contaminants to reach a specific position in the ground water system in addition to the age distribution of water captured by the well groundwater susceptibility is a function of the presence of a contamination source and subsurface processes that effect transport and concentration of the contaminant focazio et al 2002 while contamination source and subsurface geochemistry need be evaluated on a case by case basis the age distribution describes the intrinsic susceptibility of groundwater conceptually the shape i e width and scale i e mean age of the age distribution describes this susceptibility for example wells with wide age distributions and old mean age will be slow to respond to introduction and removal of contamination sources conversely wells with narrow distributions and young mean age will capture contaminated water relatively quickly after introduction of the contaminant but return to background conditions over a shorter period of time given the wide spectrum of possible age distribution shapes and scales a standardized measure is needed to facilitate comparisons and evaluate the susceptibility of groundwater wells or springs in this study a combination of tracers for modern water recharged after 1950 tritium 3h sulfur hexafluoride sf6 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs tritiogenic helium 3hetrit and pre modern water recharged 1000 years before modern carbon 14 14c were used to parametrize lpms estimates of mean groundwater age the groundwater age distribution and susceptibility index si are presented for 168 public and domestic groundwater wells sampled from three networks in 2013 and 2014 as a part of the usgs national water quality assessment nawqa project arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 the differing purpose and design of three well networks see section 3 1 and supporting information a 1 3 was in part to represent distinct spatial areas as well as physical and chemical processes of glacial aquifer our investigation was used to address the following questions what extent do the results from each network overlap how representative of the larger groundwater flow system is a well network given the limited number samples that can be practically collected how do glacial aquifer and well characteristics indicate groundwater age which groundwater age metrics best predict intrinsic susceptibility we aimed to characterize groundwater age across the glacial aquifer by assessing the effects of network design on regional synthesis of the data comparison of hydrogeology and groundwater age metrics to improve understanding and provide context for age results and provide a framework for evaluation of environmental tracers for determination of groundwater age age distributions and the susceptibility of groundwater to land surface contamination 2 study area the glacial aquifer system as defined by yager et al 2019 is a series of confined and unconfined aquifers composed of quaternary sediments north of the maximum glacial extent in the conterminous united states the aquifer system extends from the atlantic northeast to the pacific northwest spanning an area of 1 87 106 km2 the glacial aquifer system includes all unconsolidated aquifers above bedrock north of the line of continental glaciation fig 1 and is not a single hydraulically connected system not all unconsolidated sediments north of the maximum extent of glaciation are glacial in origin and glacial sediments are not present everywhere in this region sediment provenance varies widely across the aquifer yager et al 2019 with components of felsic crystalline bedrock in the east metamorphic rock in the north central portion and mafic volcanic and plutonic rock in the far west the majority of bedrock underlying the glacial aquifer system however consists of sedimentary clastic and carbonate rock variability in land use recharge rates total aquifer thickness lateral continuity of confining and water bearing units and aquifer source material yager et al 2019 make the glacial aquifer physically and chemically complex warner and ayotte 2014 3 methods 3 1 sample networks three networks of wells in the glacial aquifer system fig 1 were sampled in 2013 and 2014 and collected samples were analyzed for environmental age tracers and other water quality parameters arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 the three networks differ in scale and purpose results from each network were compared to assess the effect of network scale and design on regional analysis of estimated groundwater age and susceptibility the largest network was the principal aquifer study pas designed to assess water quality conditions for public drinking water supplies across the glacial aquifer system stackelberg 2017 burow and belitz 2014 the 115 wells of the pas are equally spaced belitz et al 2010 generally have relatively long screened intervals 1 to 31 m across multiple glacial sediment units and are pumped at relatively high rates of 100 s liters per minute as dictated by demand the second well network was a model support study mss designed to provide physical and water quality data to support a regional groundwater flow modeling juckem et al 2017 the 29 wells of the mss are mixed use and have relatively short screened intervals 1 to 12 m in shallow and deep portions of the aquifer targeting specific geologic units one of the public supply wells in the mss is also in the pas well number glacpas1 45 and will be reported in section 4 2 the third well network was the flow path survey fps designed to assess the geochemical evolution of water quality in central wisconsin tesoriero et al 2007 saad 2008 the 25 wells of the fps are multi level monitoring wells along an approximate flow path saad 2008 with short screened intervals 1 m lpm age interpretations for fps samples which were collected in 2004 including 2 sites not sampled in 2014 and 2014 are presented here three stream bed well transects piezo 700 s piezo 800 s mp2s installed across the stream and perpendicular to flow were sampled in 2014 the transects consist of shallow piezometers installed on the right left and center of the stream channel additional sample network details are provided in the supplemental information a 1 3 3 2 chemical analysis water samples from the three well networks describe above were analyzed for a broad suite of inorganic and organic constituents as well as environmental tracers arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 for this study we used environmental tracer concentrations of tritium 3h sulfur hexafluoride sf6 tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit radiogenic helium 4 4herad and corrected carbon 14 14c for estimating groundwater age not all tracers were collected from every well 3hetrit and 4herad were calculated following methods described by solomon and cook 2000 and solomon 2000 dissolved gases argon nitrogen neon krypton and xenon were used to estimate recharge temperature excess air and gas fractionation using methods described by aeschbach hertig et al 2000 calculated tracer concentrations and dissolved gas model results including recharge temperatures excess air and noble gas fractionation are reported in solder et al 2018 a study of the major ion chemistry in relation to inorganic carbonate chemistry was used for correction of measured 14c concentrations solder and jurgens 2018 corrected 14c concentrations were determined with a novel implementation of inverse geochemical and analytical models of 14c dilution in conjunction with lumped parameter age modeling solder and jurgens 2018 details of sample collection analytical and interpretation procedures are provided in the supplemental information a 1 1 and the above references 3 3 groundwater age mean ages and groundwater age distributions were modeled by calibrating lumped parameter models lpms to measured environmental tracer data using a modified version of the program tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 tracerlpm simulates the tracer concentration at the time of sampling for each tracer based on the mean age distribution type and parameters and the respective atmospheric tracer history tracers used for age determination were presumed to be conservative or have a predictable decay accumulation rate tracers showing non conservative behavior were identified by comparing measured tracer data to each other and known atmospheric concentration histories tracers with inconsistent concentrations were excluded from subsequent analyses lpm parameters were varied to minimize the misfit i e sum of chi squared statistic χ2 between measured and simulated concentrations of the selected modeled tracers age interpretation was not possible at all sites due to sample loss or contaminated tracers the approach for assigning an age category premodern modern mixture and calibrating lpms varied for each sample on the basis of measured tracer concentrations samples with 3h concentrations greater than 4 tritium units tu were indicative of recharge after about 1950 above ground nuclear testing starting in early 1950s drastically increased 3h in the atmosphere and presence of 3h greater than 4 tu is clear indication of recent recharge i e modern groundwater such samples were usually accompanied with measurable amounts of 3hetrit and sf6 typically post 1970 recharge for sf6 samples with 3h less than 0 3 tu were indicative of recharge before about 1950 and usually accompanied with measured 14c activity less than 75 pmc and no measurable sf6 these two sample groups 3h 4 tu 3h 0 3 tu indicated by region specific estimates of 3h in precipitation michel 1989 suggested a single mixing model in lpm was appropriate samples that had 3h greater than 0 3 tu but less than 4 tu were suggestive of mixing between water parcels of differing ages and recharge sources such samples often contained measurable sf6 while 14c activity remained less than 75 pmc these mixed samples of pre 1950 and post 1950 recharge were modeled with a binary mixing model bmm the dispersion model was assumed for the old binary component with a dispersion parameter of 0 1 which simulated longitudinal dispersion approximately equal to a several kilometer scale aquifer gelhar et al 1992 appropriate age distributions for the young single mixtures and young component of the binary mixtures were determined from regional hydrogeology well logs and lpm model fit the full suite of available tracers and ancillary knowledge of the site surrounding wells and adjacent aquifers well construction land use location relative to surface water etc was considered during lpm selection and iterative model refinement final lpm interpretations were selected based on model fits and conceptual understanding of model type and parameters groundwater age estimates calculated by lpm were categorized as modern with estimated mean age less than 63 years pre modern with estimated mean age greater than 63 years or as a mixture when best fit by a bmm dissolved tracer concentrations from a number of wells within the glacial aquifer yielded conflicting results e g significant sf6 and low 3h and additional analysis was required the lpm interpretation procedure and tracer systematics are more fully described in the supplemental information a 1 2 3 4 assessment of environmental tracer sources the groundwater age interpretations were dependent on accurate accounting of environmental tracer sources whether in situ or atmospheric environmental tracers 3hetrit and sf6 in the glacial aquifer are primarily derived from 3h decay and equilibration of groundwater with the atmosphere respectively identification of a potential secondary tracer source or sink is required to evaluate the utility of the tracer in a given sample secondary sources and sinks if unaccounted for result in erroneous estimates of mean age the large number and spatial distribution of sites allowed for explicit identification of potential secondary sources and sinks in the glacial aquifer system tracer anomalies were calculated as the difference between lpm predicted and measured tracer concentrations expected concentrations of 3hetrit were based on a helium isotope mass balance solomon and cook 2000 solomon 2000 the 3h input and estimated age expected sf6 was based on equilibrium between groundwater and atmospheric sources after accounting for excess air in addition to the 3hetrit and sf6 anomalies we calculated the fraction of helium 4 derived from terrigenic sources 4heterr in relation to total measured helium 4 4heterr 4hetot solder et al 2018 values greater than 70 percent 4heterr were indication of possibly inaccurate 3hetrit calculated values and presence of a component of older water greater than a few 1000 years old 3 5 susceptibility index from the estimated groundwater age distribution we calculated a susceptibility index to provide a quantitative estimate of susceptibility of a well to land surface contamination the susceptibility index si is a relative measure of how quickly a conservative contaminant spilled within the recharge area of a well travels from the water table to the well via the groundwater system the si is different from the mean age in that the si takes into account the entire age distribution whereas the mean age is the first moment about zero of the age distribution as the si was determined using conservative tracers measuring travel time from the water table to sample collection well it does not account for transport properties and reactivity of contaminants or unsaturated zone travel time the si is calculated as the normalized hellinger distance between the cumulative distribution function cdf of age for the well of interest and a reference cdf the hellinger distance dh is defined by nikulin 2001 as 1 d h i 1 k p i q i 2 2 where p i and q i are the cumulative probability of the age distribution of interest and a reference age distribution respectively for a given age values for the hellinger distance range between 0 perfectly similar and perfectly dissimilar the susceptibility index is then calculated as 2 si 1 1 d h where the si ranges between 1 indicating young ages and a narrow age distribution and 0 indicating older ages and a broad age distribution for this metric the more rapidly a land surface contaminant arrives at the well the more susceptible the given well thus the reference cdf is defined as piston flow model with a mean age of 1 year the important difference between si and mean age can be illustrated by comparing the age distributions and si of hypothetical samples all with the same mean age of 200 years fig 2 the susceptibility of a well to land surface contamination is a function of the fraction and mean age of the young component of flow which will move the contaminant to the well rather than the overall mean age of the sample the concept of the si is particularly important for mixtures of water from differing recharge sources flow paths and groundwater ages for example bmm 2 has the highest si 0 41 of the hypothetical samples fig 2 and is binary mixture of water with mean ages of 5 and 5000 years only a small amount of old water needs to be mixed into a sample to bias the mean age older and potentially confuse interpretation of the mean age the susceptibility index takes into account the full age distribution and is less prone to bias than the mean age as an additional proof of concept calculated si for pas wells was compared to measured nitrate the herbicides atrazine metolachlor prometon and common herbicide degradates deethylatrazine deisopropylatrazine deethylhydroxyatrazine hydroxyatrazine metolachlor sulfonic acid alachlor sulfonic acid and acetochlor sulfonic acid these analytes were chosen because application of fertilizer and herbicide is relatively ubiquitous across the glacial aquifer and typical application procedures widely disperse the product at land surface i e non point source measured contaminant concentrations were converted to a presence absence metric i e detection based on the reported analytical detection limits and compared to the estimated mean age fraction modern and si to assess the utility of each age metric in determining the intrinsic groundwater susceptibility 3 6 composite age and si distributions age distributions represent the probability of a water parcel with a given estimated age occurring in a single sample full age distributions are presented in this study as cumulative probabilities and provide the fraction of sample younger than a given age i e proportion of sample recharged after a given year plots of cumulative age distributions are a useful visual representation of the extent of mixing and or dispersion in a sample wider distributions indicate a larger range of water parcel ages in a sample cumulative distributions of the si values were constructed for sets of samples by ordering the values and normalizing the number of samples within the sample set composite age distributions were constructed by averaging the cumulative age distributions of the wells of interest the composite distributions provide means of summary and characterization of age at selected wells the composite si distributions were plotted in reverse order 1 to 0 to better correlate with the respective composite age distributions i e young highly susceptible wells on the left to old low susceptibility wells on the right boxplots of mean age and si were included to illustrate the distribution of values that are represented by composite distributions a comparison of estimated mean age and si from each network was conducted and idealized statistical distributions were fit to the composite age distributions as described in supplemental information a 1 5 for comparison amongst sample groups and to other groundwater age studies composite age and best fit idealized distribution parameters are presented in the supplemental information a 2 3 3 7 statistical comparison of age metrics 3 7 1 comparison of groundwater age hydrogeology and well characteristics a comparison of age class estimated mean age and si calculated in this study to the hydrogeology from yager et al 2019 and well construction characteristics was conducted to investigate the primary controls on groundwater age and provide context for discussion the comparisons of hydrogeology and age presented in this study are representative of the given network the analysis has limited utility as a predictor of groundwater age using hydrogeology and well construction and should not be used to that end the statistical analysis was performed using the stats base package and vcd package meyer et al 2016 in r statistical software r core team 2016 methods for determination of hydrogeologic metrics are provided in the supplemental information a 1 4 and general well characteristics are provided in supplemental information table b 1 composite distributions and boxplots of estimated mean age and si were constructed for each category separated on 20th 40th 60th and 80th percentiles of the selected hydrogeologic and well metrics to illustrate the differences between the respective groups the relationships between the respective categorized hydrogeology metrics and age were formally evaluated using the cramer s v statistic 0 to 1 which is the analog to pearson s correlation coefficient for nominal variables only the hydrogeology metrics that are correlated with the age metrics at the 95 significance level are reported here it is important to point out that cramer s v does not indicate the direction inverse or proportional of the correlation the mean age and mean si for each category of a given hydrogeology metric were compared using a multiple comparisons test tukey s honest significant difference test at the 95 significance level 3 7 2 comparison of groundwater age between well networks mean age si and respective distributions from each sample network were used to assess the effect of sample network design e g spatial distribution well characteristics on mean age and si as the spatial scale of each network is vastly different fig 1 the immediately adjacent pas wells n 6 were compared to the full mss network and the adjacent mss wells n 3 were compared to the full fps network the relatively simple comparison of wells based on proximity is meant to provide some indication of the commonality between networks and whether a given network is representative of groundwater age in the entire flow system the mean age and mean si for each subset or full network of wells was compared using a multiple comparisons test tukey s honest significant difference test at the 95 significance level 4 results 4 1 groundwater age and susceptibility index lpm age distributions were assigned and susceptibility indices calculated at 168 individual groundwater wells in the glacial aquifer a summary of the lpm results table 1 show that mean estimated age was 2 400 years in the glacial aquifer and the majority of wells 56 percent classified as modern based on individual composite age distributions the fraction of modern recharge after 1950 and within the last 10 000 years e g holocene is also calculated for each sample supplemental information table c 1 based on the composite distribution of all wells on average 68 percent of water is modern recharge and 90 percent was recharged within the last 10 000 years table 1 on average mixtures consist of 45 percent modern water and the pre modern samples have approximately 10 percent modern water composite and best fit age distribution parameters are reported in the supplemental information a 2 3 4 2 pas well network groundwater age estimates for the pas network wells range from recent recharge with a mean age of 1 year to approximately 52 000 years table c 1 with a median estimated age of 40 years table 1 the 115 sites are approximately evenly distributed between modern and some component of pre modern water either in a mixture or entirely pre modern spatially groundwater east of ohio and west of central montana have a larger portion of modern water while pre modern water is more dominant in the west central portion of the aquifer fig 3 a interestingly the central region greatly varies between predominately modern and pre modern water with a significant number of wells indicated as mixtures modern and pre modern water the median si for the entire pas is 0 208 and spatially the si follows a similar pattern to the age class with higher susceptibility groundwater coincident with modern water in the glacial aquifer fig 3b chi squared fit of lpms to measured tracer data are generally very good with an average chi squared of 0 32 with 106 of the 114 samples having a chi squared value less than 1 only three sites glacpas1 82 u01 u13 have chi square values greater than 2 the single mixture dispersion model was most frequently n 50 the best fit to the tracer data with an average dispersion parameter of 0 2 lpms with an exponential component emm or pem were fit to 21 sites table c 1 one site glacpas1 14 was clearly pre modern based on 3h below detection limit and high percent 4heterr 0 89 unfortunately it was not possible to assign an estimated age with reasonable confidence because a 14c measurement was either not collected or the bottle broke prior to analysis based on the pas composite distribution for all samples 64 percent of water was recharged prior to 1953 table 1 and 82 percent recharged in the last 10 000 years estimated mean age fraction modern and si of pas wells were compared to detections i e above analytical detection limit of the land surface contaminants nitrate herbicides and their degradates fig 3c d e results indicate si has a stronger correlation to contaminant detection than the other age metrics 4 2 1 influence of hydrogeology and well characteristics on age exploratory analysis of the relationship between groundwater age and the hydrogeology or well characteristics fig 4 a indicates that relative contribution of a given age class systematically varies between the categories of select metrics depth to the top and bottom of the screened interval total well depth confinement depth to bedrock percent chance confined aquifer depth and the number of aquifers the depth of the screened interval top and bottom and total well depth display similar patterns and correlation fig 4b with the age metrics so only the total well depth metric is displayed in fig 4a for brevity the cramer s v statistic indicates that age class is correlated with 95 confidence to a larger number hydrogeology and well metrics while the categorical si has the stronger correlations fig 4b composite age and si distributions for each group of select hydrogeology and well metrics fig 5 allow a detailed examination of the relationship between age and hydrogeology the multiple comparison test indicates that the mean age and mean si have a statistically significant difference amongst the categories of well bottom depth fig 5a and confinement fig 5b while no significance difference in mean age and mean si was found between the categories of the other select metrics 4 2 2 environmental tracer uncertainties maps of the tracer anomalies in the pas fig 6 show variability in the 3hetrit anomaly while more spatially coherent localized regions of elevated sf6 and percent 4heterr are apparent the lack of spatial pattern in 3hetrit anomalies suggests additional factors such as error in he sampling and balance calculations are influencing the calculated tracer concentration conversely the sf6 and 4heterr positive anomalies are likely related to terrigenic sources 4 3 mss and fps well networks groundwater age estimates in the mss network range from 10 to 4 600 years table c 1 with a median estimated age of 310 years table 1 of the 28 sites in the mss network 11 sites are characterized as modern 15 sites are best fit by a mixture and 2 sites are predominately pre modern water table 1 based on the composite age distribution approximately 62 percent of water sampled from the mss network was recharged before 1953 and 99 percent was recharged in the last 10 000 years the median susceptibility index for all mss sites is 0 16 table 1 lpms are generally good fits to mss tracer data with an average χ2 of 0 05 the mss wells were most commonly fit by lpm s with some component of pem or epm table c 1 groundwater age estimates for the fps network wells sampled in 2004 and 2014 range from 2 to 52 years table c 1 with respective median ages of 31 and 29 years table 1 the median susceptibility index for all 2014 fps sites is 0 25 table 1 based on the composite age distribution approximately 96 percent of water sampled in 2014 from the fps network was recharged after 1950 and all water was recharged in the last 10 000 years lpm fits to tracer data is good with a mean χ2 of 0 4 with the exception of samples collected from fss1a and fss4b with respective χ2 fits of 2 2 and 7 fps network site were most commonly fit by the epm table c 1 samples collected along the flow path are overall similar but slightly younger that stream bed samples stream reach table 1 re interpreted ages of the fps 2004 network using lpms tables 1 and c 1 are not significantly different from apparent ages described in tesoriero et al 2007 4 4 groundwater age and si between well networks comparison of groundwater age metrics from the pas mss and fps 2014 networks show that the three networks have generally disparate composite distributions and mean estimated age and si table 1 and fig 7 selection of pas wells adjacent to the mss network show improvement in general match of the composite age and si distributions fig 7 and agreement between the fraction modern mean age of the modern fraction and the mean si table 2 the mean age of the pre modern fraction although in better agreement remains significantly different between the select pas and mss networks table 2 comparison of age distributions quantified as the hellinger distance dh eq 1 for pas and pas select to mss dh 5 17 and 4 48 respectively show improved agreement although minor the persistent disagreement between the pre modern components in the select pas and mss networks is possibly a result of the pas being deeper public supply wells with larger screened intervals and higher pumping rates which potentially captured older flow paths relative to the mss with a mixture of public supply and domestic wells comparison of the select mss to the fps 2014 network shows significant improvement in agreement in all metrics between the two networks fig 7 comparison of age distributions for mss and mss select to fps 2014 dh 3 97 and 0 7 respectively show significantly improved agreement the differences in mean estimated age and si between the select pas and mss and between the select mss and fps 2014 are not statistically significant with 95 confidence equal variance and unequal sample size tukey kramer test 5 discussion 5 1 sample network design analysis of scale results indicate better agreement between smaller networks and select wells of the larger networks table 2 and fig 7 on a broader scale this finding suggests the deep municipal wells of the pas network provide a reasonable representation of the glacial aquifer as a whole reasons that the pas appears to be representative likely include intentional equal spacing of wells across the aquifer following recommendations of belitz et al 2010 long well screen intervals and high well pumping rates dictated by municipal demands it is acknowledged that the comparison across scale is limited to a small region of the overall aquifer fig 1 and may not capture scalability of groundwater age in other regions of the aquifer however the pas provides a particularly good representation of the modern component of groundwater when compared to the other networks table 2 and fig 7 indicating that the modern fraction and overall susceptibility is reasonably represented by the pas wells we suggest that discussing groundwater age metrics across the glacial aquifer in terms of the results from the pas network is reasonable and such a scaling comparison is an improvement over blind characterization of an aquifer based on limited samples 5 2 groundwater age metrics groundwater age in the glacial aquifer is generally modern 64 percent modern based on pas composite distribution figs 5 and 7a although there is a clear presence of 1000s of year old water fig 3a table 1 figs 5 and 7a c spatially the northeast and northwest are dominated by modern water mean age of the one pre modern sample in washington being 63 2 years with the central portion of the region having a greater mixture of age classes fig 3a the presence of 1000s of year old water across the aquifer in an important finding and might be considered unusual given moderate median recharge rates and relatively shallow aquifer total depth yager et al 2019 but some portion of pre modern groundwater is not all together unexpected as the complex hydrogeology generally consisting of low permeability tills with lenses of sands and gravels conceptually supports the possibility of connate water within the glacial aquifer itself old groundwater may be a result of long flow paths in the deep confined permeable aquifer units or slow diffusion dominated transport in fine grain sediments the central portion of the glacial aquifer specifically the east and north central regions containing older groundwater fig 3a in fact coincides with deeper and more continuous sequences of layered till and permeable lenses yager et al 2019 pre modern water captured from the glacial aquifer in the south central southwest central and the west central regions fig 3a is more likely to have been sourced from another flow system the mentioned regions with large components of pre modern water have relatively high precipitation rates and limited depth of the quaternary glacial sediments yager et al 2019 making significant amounts of pre glacial retreat water 10 000 years old unlikely in the glacial sediments we propose that a hydrologic connection between the glacial and underlying bedrock aquifers is a more reasonable explanation for such large contributions of pre modern water than relatively hydraulically stagnant zones within the quaternary glacial sediments containing connate waters in the south central region the cambrian ordovician bedrock aquifer lloyd and lyke 1995 containing dominantly pre modern water stackelberg et al 2018 is thinly overlain by glacial sediments yager et al 2019 deep wells long screen intervals and high pumping rates at the public supply pas wells conceptually support capture of shallow bedrock aquifer water in the southwest and west central regions the presence of pre modern water fig 3a might similarly be explained by hydraulic connection to the cretaceous and paleozoic sedimentary bedrock aquifers whitehead 1996 olcott 1992 and fractured igneous and metamorphic bedrock aquifers olcott 1992 previous investigations have measured bedrock derived groundwater 3h below detection limit 0 8 tu for that study bartos et al 2002 and there is suggestion of localized hydraulic connection between shallow and deep aquifers strobel et al 2000 in the southwest and west central glacial aquifer although previous investigations have been limited in scope a hydraulic connection between shallow glacial sediments and the deeper bedrock systems seems a reasonable hypothesis supported by results from this study this finding has important implications in understanding and managing groundwater resources across the region 5 3 hydrogeology and well characteristics statistical analysis of hydrogeology and well characteristics to age in pas network indicates that the relative contribution of modern and pre modern water is affected by well depth confinement depth to the top of the aquifer depth to bedrock and aquifer complexity i e number of aquifers fig 4a the contributions of mixed waters are relatively constant in respect to well depth and depth to bedrock but follow a general pattern of increasing and then decreasing in relation to percent chance confined aquifer depth and number of aquifers that a component of modern and pre modern water either as mixture or solely pre modern is present in all categories of each metric illustrates the complexity of groundwater age in the glacial aquifer the formal evaluation of the correlation fig 4b supports that there is a statistically significant with 95 confidence effect of select hydrogeology on the respective age metrics although the correlations are generally modest cramer s v 0 5 to weak 0 2 age class is correlated to more hydrogeology metrics than either the categorical mean age or si while the categorical si is more strongly correlated fig 4b to select metrics composite distributions fig 5 provide a detailed illustration of the differences in age and si for the given hydrogeology metrics some overall findings of note include the median age and the width of the age distributions generally increase across the categories and each category has some component of 1 000 s of years old water across all the metrics the opposite is true for the si with the spread of values generally decreasing and more heavily skewed to lower si values across categories also of interest is that the shape of the age distributions are generally very similar with increasing width across the categories with the exception of highest percent chance confined fig 5d deepest depth to aquifer fig 5e and greater than 2 aquifers fig 5f the similarity in general shape is further manifestation of the broad range of ages in each category while the widening of age distributions indicates the increasing influence of flow path mixing across categories this increasing extent of mixing is in part related to the ever presence of modern water with an increased proportion of pre modern water but also likely influenced by additional longitudinal mixing along pre modern flow paths while there is an observable difference in age class proportion fig 4a mean age and si among the categories fig 5 and a statistically significant correlation between the age and hydrogeology metrics fig 4b multiple comparisons test indicates that only separation by well bottom depth fig 4a and 5a and confinement fig 4b and 5b resulted in statistically significant differences in mean age and si the lack of strong correlation between age and hydrogeology metrics and lack of clear differences in the mean age and si among the hydrogeology categories demonstrates the complexity of groundwater age as a metric integrating many well and aquifer properties more robust statistical analysis of the limited sample set considering the interdependency between hydrogeology metrics in relation to age could possibly be insightful but is outside the scope of this study 5 4 susceptibility index calculated values of si for the different networks and age classes show higher susceptibility larger si in shallow fps network wells and modern groundwater samples and lower susceptibility smaller si in pre modern samples table 1 similarly comparisons of si to hydrogeology in the pas network show decreasing values of si with increasing well bottom depth fig 5a confinement fig 5b percent chance confinement fig 5d and decreasing aquifer complexity fig 5f conceptually these findings are in agreement with what is expected shallow wells in unconfined portions of the aquifer have a greater likelihood of capturing land surface contaminants in fact statistically significant differences in mean si was found between differing well bottom depth fig 5a and confinement fig 5b the distribution of si values regardless of sample network is non normal and skewed to lower values figs 5 and 7b d as a result of how si is defined further investigation of si in other groundwater systems would be instructive si has a less distinct spatial pattern than age class fig 3a b but overall indicates a high level of susceptibility si 0 2 across the aquifer overall the findings of si presented here are consistent with the conceptual model of the glacial aquifer moderate recharge and shallow aquifer depth yager et al 2019 indicating a relatively high susceptibility of groundwater to land surface contamination comparison of the multiple age metrics mean age fraction modern and si to the number of land surface contaminants detected fig 3c d e shows the si provides the best correlation spearman s ρ 0 52 kendall s τ 0 38 with 95 confidence indicating a subtle but measurable improvement over mean age or fraction modern for predicting groundwater susceptibility with environmental tracers the comparison presented fig 3c d e somewhat controls for variability in source concentration application rates and uptake and transport by converting to a presence absence but is only meant to illustrate the differences between age metrics when compared to measured contaminant data it is worth emphasizing that the susceptibility index used here is a measure of relative susceptibility to land surface contaminants behaving conservatively and originating near the water table furthermore naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic and manganese are also of concern in the glacial aquifer under appropriate geochemical conditions e g kinetically limited reduction the concentration of such contaminants is inversely related to the age of a given parcel of water it is tempting then to use the si inversely 1 indicating lower and 0 indicating higher relative susceptibility to natural contamination while in theory the si is potentially useful in this manner the metric does not account for factors other than the age distribution any significant differences in geochemical conditions between sites may render the comparison of si meaningless cautious use of the si as a measure of susceptibility to natural or contamination behaving non conservatively is required 5 5 environmental tracer sources maps of tracer anomalies fig 6 are instructive in identify regions impacted by terrigenic tracer sources informing the age interpretations of this study calculated 3hetrit is sensitive to the assumed isotopic ratios of mantle and terrigenic helium sources and previous study has shown glacial sediments can be a significant source of terrigenic helium solomon 2000 appropriately so positive 3hetrit anomalies fig 6a occur more frequently at sites with high terrigenic helium fig 6b negative 3hetrit anomalies can be partly explained by the low solubility of helium making gas loss from sampling error or excess air degassing prior to sampling a primary issue the lack of clear spatial pattern fig 6a reflects the complexity of measuring and calculating reliable 3hetrit values in glacial terrains in contrast spatially coherent regions of high percent terrigenic helium 4heterr 4hetot fig 6b and terrigenic source of sf6 fig 6c indicate strong hydrogeologic and geologic controls high 4heterr is generally related to sites with some component of pre modern water figs 3 and 6b providing additional support of a hydrologic connection to bedrock aquifers where he has accumulated over a longer period elevated sf6 is coincident with intrusive volcanic bedrock namely in eastern minnesota and wisconsin and relatively shallow intrusive bodies in the northeastern states fig 6c 6 conclusion the unconfined and confined water bearing sediments of the glacial aquifer cover a large spatial extent 1 87 106 km2 and serve as a public water supply for 30 million people estimates of mean groundwater age groundwater age distribution and susceptibility to land surface contamination is of critical importance groundwater age metrics for 168 public and domestic wells from three sample networks are presented in this study to evaluate the aquifer groundwater age distributions from the largest network pas indicated groundwater is dominantly modern and recharged after 1950 63 percent this coincides with relatively high values of si susceptibility index which is better correlated with measured detections of contaminants than mean age or fraction modern groundwater both groundwater age and susceptibility index were statistically most influenced by well depth and confinement providing a conceptual check on the analysis and further illustrating the susceptibility of the generally shallow and unconfined glacial aquifer presence of 1000s year old water across the glacial aquifer suggests a hydrologic connection between the shallow sediments and deeper fractured bedrock groundwater sources pre modern groundwater originating in underlying bedrock aquifers is a more likely explanation than pre glacial retreat recharge for the observed fraction of 1000s year old water such exchanges between the aquifers provides a mechanism of transport for land surface and anthropogenic contaminants to the deep bedrock aquifer and geogenic contaminants accumulated over long periods to the shallow aquifer comparison of age metrics and hydrogeology in the pas indicates the fraction of pre modern water in a sample is systematically affected by the total well depth depth to bedrock depth to aquifer unit aquifer complexity and confinement the findings indicate groundwater resources of the glacial aquifer are vulnerable to contamination sourced both from land surface and deep geologic materials this study provides a framework and new methods for interpretation of environmental tracers in determination of groundwater age and susceptibility we show through comparison of groundwater age metrics across the spatial scales of three sample networks in the glacial aquifer pas mss and fps large to small a limited sample set can accurately characterize a complex continuous system specifically equally spaced deep long screened interval public supply wells provide a reasonable representation of modern groundwater age and susceptibility to contamination in the glacial aquifer inclusion of statistical analysis of the age metrics and hydrogeology was shown to provide vital context for understanding groundwater age results and help improve the conceptual model of the glacial aquifer maps of tracer anomalies presented here provide useful guidance both for interpretation and selection of appropriate tracers in terrains with deep sequences of fine grain sediments derived from old rock with high accumulated helium use of 3hetrit can be challenging igneous terrains even when deeply buried contribute significant amounts of terrigenic sf6 given the relative dearth of available environmental age tracers rather than selecting or discarding tracers based on geology alone an exploratory sampling and evaluation of a tracer s utility for a particular study is a practical approach further work to characterize groundwater using the presented methods will be of value to the scientific community and resource managers credit authorship contribution statement john

5709,covering a large portion of the northern conterminous united states 1 87 106 km2 the glacial aquifer serves as the primary water supply for 30 million public and domestic water users mean groundwater age groundwater age distribution and susceptibility to land surface contamination using a new metric susceptibility index si based on the full age distribution and less prone to bias than estimated mean age is reported for 168 public and domestic wells across the aquifer comparison of groundwater age metrics between well networks of varying spatial scale suggest an extensive sample network of equally spaced long screened interval wells can be used to characterize aquifer wide groundwater age estimated mean age ranges from 1 to 50 000 years and according to the composite age distribution approximately 63 percent of all sampled water recharged after 1950 i e modern and 18 percent of the sampled water was recharged greater than 10 000 years ago the later finding strongly suggests a connection between the glacial aquifer and underlying bedrock aquifers statistical analysis of glacial aquifer hydrogeology and age metrics show groundwater ages are young less than few 100 years and more susceptible to land surface contamination larger si in unconfined and shallow portions of the aquifer old groundwater greater than 1 000 years is more often associated with thicker sequences of fine grain sediments and or shallow bedrock calculated si is shown to be more strongly related to the number of land surface contaminants detected than mean age or fraction modern statistical analysis of si and hydrogeology indicates si is largely dictated by well depth and confinement this study demonstrates how sample network design can be used to characterize groundwater age of large aquifers with a limited number of samples and how interpretation of environmental tracers can be used to improve conceptual models of groundwater aquifers and identify groundwater susceptible

and scale i e mean age of the age distribution describes this susceptibility for example wells with wide age distributions and old mean age will be slow to respond to introduction and removal of contamination sources conversely wells with narrow distributions and young mean age will capture contaminated water relatively quickly after introduction of the contaminant but return to background conditions over a shorter period of time given the wide spectrum of possible age distribution shapes and scales a standardized measure is needed to facilitate comparisons and evaluate the susceptibility of groundwater wells or springs in this study a combination of tracers for modern water recharged after 1950 tritium 3h sulfur hexafluoride sf6 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs tritiogenic helium 3hetrit and pre modern water recharged 1000 years before modern carbon 14 14c were used to parametrize lpms estimates of mean groundwater age the groundwater age distribution and susceptibility index si are presented for 168 public and domestic groundwater wells sampled from three networks in 2013 and 2014 as a part of the usgs national water quality assessment nawqa project arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 the differing purpose and design of three well networks see section 3 1 and supporting information a 1 3 was in part to represent distinct spatial areas as well as physical and chemical processes of glacial aquifer our investigation was used to address the following questions what extent do the results from each network overlap how representative of the larger groundwater flow system is a well network given the limited number samples that can be practically collected how do glacial aquifer and well characteristics indicate groundwater age which groundwater age metrics best predict intrinsic susceptibility we aimed to characterize groundwater age across the glacial aquifer by assessing the effects of network design on regional synthesis of the data comparison of hydrogeology and groundwater age metrics to improve understanding and provide context for age results and provide a framework for evaluation of environmental tracers for determination of groundwater age age distributions and the susceptibility of groundwater to land surface contamination 2 study area the glacial aquifer system as defined by yager et al 2019 is a series of confined and unconfined aquifers composed of quaternary sediments north of the maximum glacial extent in the conterminous united states the aquifer system extends from the atlantic northeast to the pacific northwest spanning an area of 1 87 106 km2 the glacial aquifer system includes all unconsolidated aquifers above bedrock north of the line of continental glaciation fig 1 and is not a single hydraulically connected system not all unconsolidated sediments north of the maximum extent of glaciation are glacial in origin and glacial sediments are not present everywhere in this region sediment provenance varies widely across the aquifer yager et al 2019 with components of felsic crystalline bedrock in the east metamorphic rock in the north central portion and mafic volcanic and plutonic rock in the far west the majority of bedrock underlying the glacial aquifer system however consists of sedimentary clastic and carbonate rock variability in land use recharge rates total aquifer thickness lateral continuity of confining and water bearing units and aquifer source material yager et al 2019 make the glacial aquifer physically and chemically complex warner and ayotte 2014 3 methods 3 1 sample networks three networks of wells in the glacial aquifer system fig 1 were sampled in 2013 and 2014 and collected samples were analyzed for environmental age tracers and other water quality parameters arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 the three networks differ in scale and purpose results from each network were compared to assess the effect of network scale and design on regional analysis of estimated groundwater age and susceptibility the largest network was the principal aquifer study pas designed to assess water quality conditions for public drinking water supplies across the glacial aquifer system stackelberg 2017 burow and belitz 2014 the 115 wells of the pas are equally spaced belitz et al 2010 generally have relatively long screened intervals 1 to 31 m across multiple glacial sediment units and are pumped at relatively high rates of 100 s liters per minute as dictated by demand the second well network was a model support study mss designed to provide physical and water quality data to support a regional groundwater flow modeling juckem et al 2017 the 29 wells of the mss are mixed use and have relatively short screened intervals 1 to 12 m in shallow and deep portions of the aquifer targeting specific geologic units one of the public supply wells in the mss is also in the pas well number glacpas1 45 and will be reported in section 4 2 the third well network was the flow path survey fps designed to assess the geochemical evolution of water quality in central wisconsin tesoriero et al 2007 saad 2008 the 25 wells of the fps are multi level monitoring wells along an approximate flow path saad 2008 with short screened intervals 1 m lpm age interpretations for fps samples which were collected in 2004 including 2 sites not sampled in 2014 and 2014 are presented here three stream bed well transects piezo 700 s piezo 800 s mp2s installed across the stream and perpendicular to flow were sampled in 2014 the transects consist of shallow piezometers installed on the right left and center of the stream channel additional sample network details are provided in the supplemental information a 1 3 3 2 chemical analysis water samples from the three well networks describe above were analyzed for a broad suite of inorganic and organic constituents as well as environmental tracers arnold et al 2016 arnold et al 2017 for this study we used environmental tracer concentrations of tritium 3h sulfur hexafluoride sf6 tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit radiogenic helium 4 4herad and corrected carbon 14 14c for estimating groundwater age not all tracers were collected from every well 3hetrit and 4herad were calculated following methods described by solomon and cook 2000 and solomon 2000 dissolved gases argon nitrogen neon krypton and xenon were used to estimate recharge temperature excess air and gas fractionation using methods described by aeschbach hertig et al 2000 calculated tracer concentrations and dissolved gas model results including recharge temperatures excess air and noble gas fractionation are reported in solder et al 2018 a study of the major ion chemistry in relation to inorganic carbonate chemistry was used for correction of measured 14c concentrations solder and jurgens 2018 corrected 14c concentrations were determined with a novel implementation of inverse geochemical and analytical models of 14c dilution in conjunction with lumped parameter age modeling solder and jurgens 2018 details of sample collection analytical and interpretation procedures are provided in the supplemental information a 1 1 and the above references 3 3 groundwater age mean ages and groundwater age distributions were modeled by calibrating lumped parameter models lpms to measured environmental tracer data using a modified version of the program tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 tracerlpm simulates the tracer concentration at the time of sampling for each tracer based on the mean age distribution type and parameters and the respective atmospheric tracer history tracers used for age determination were presumed to be conservative or have a predictable decay accumulation rate tracers showing non conservative behavior were identified by comparing measured tracer data to each other and known atmospheric concentration histories tracers with inconsistent concentrations were excluded from subsequent analyses lpm parameters were varied to minimize the misfit i e sum of chi squared statistic χ2 between measured and simulated concentrations of the selected modeled tracers age interpretation was not possible at all sites due to sample loss or contaminated tracers the approach for assigning an age category premodern modern mixture and calibrating lpms varied for each sample on the basis of measured tracer concentrations samples with 3h concentrations greater than 4 tritium units tu were indicative of recharge after about 1950 above ground nuclear testing starting in early 1950s drastically increased 3h in the atmosphere and presence of 3h greater than 4 tu is clear indication of recent recharge i e modern groundwater such samples were usually accompanied with measurable amounts of 3hetrit and sf6 typically post 1970 recharge for sf6 samples with 3h less than 0 3 tu were indicative of recharge before about 1950 and usually accompanied with measured 14c activity less than 75 pmc and no measurable sf6 these two sample groups 3h 4 tu 3h 0 3 tu indicated by region specific estimates of 3h in precipitation michel 1989 suggested a single mixing model in lpm was appropriate samples that had 3h greater than 0 3 tu but less than 4 tu were suggestive of mixing between water parcels of differing ages and recharge sources such samples often contained measurable sf6 while 14c activity remained less than 75 pmc these mixed samples of pre 1950 and post 1950 recharge were modeled with a binary mixing model bmm the dispersion model was assumed for the old binary component with a dispersion parameter of 0 1 which simulated longitudinal dispersion approximately equal to a several kilometer scale aquifer gelhar et al 1992 appropriate age distributions for the young single mixtures and young component of the binary mixtures were determined from regional hydrogeology well logs and lpm model fit the full suite of available tracers and ancillary knowledge of the site surrounding wells and adjacent aquifers well construction land use location relative to surface water etc was considered during lpm selection and iterative model refinement final lpm interpretations were selected based on model fits and conceptual understanding of model type and parameters groundwater age estimates calculated by lpm were categorized as modern with estimated mean age less than 63 years pre modern with estimated mean age greater than 63 years or as a mixture when best fit by a bmm dissolved tracer concentrations from a number of wells within the glacial aquifer yielded conflicting results e g significant sf6 and low 3h and additional analysis was required the lpm interpretation procedure and tracer systematics are more fully described in the supplemental information a 1 2 3 4 assessment of environmental tracer sources the groundwater age interpretations were dependent on accurate accounting of environmental tracer sources whether in situ or atmospheric environmental tracers 3hetrit and sf6 in the glacial aquifer are primarily derived from 3h decay and equilibration of groundwater with the atmosphere respectively identification of a potential secondary tracer source or sink is required to evaluate the utility of the tracer in a given sample secondary sources and sinks if unaccounted for result in erroneous estimates of mean age the large number and spatial distribution of sites allowed for explicit identification of potential secondary sources and sinks in the glacial aquifer system tracer anomalies were calculated as the difference between lpm predicted and measured tracer concentrations expected concentrations of 3hetrit were based on a helium isotope mass balance solomon and cook 2000 solomon 2000 the 3h input and estimated age expected sf6 was based on equilibrium between groundwater and atmospheric sources after accounting for excess air in addition to the 3hetrit and sf6 anomalies we calculated the fraction of helium 4 derived from terrigenic sources 4heterr in relation to total measured helium 4 4heterr 4hetot solder et al 2018 values greater than 70 percent 4heterr were indication of possibly inaccurate 3hetrit calculated values and presence of a component of older water greater than a few 1000 years old 3 5 susceptibility index from the estimated groundwater age distribution we calculated a susceptibility index to provide a quantitative estimate of susceptibility of a well to land surface contamination the susceptibility index si is a relative measure of how quickly a conservative contaminant spilled within the recharge area of a well travels from the water table to the well via the groundwater system the si is different from the mean age in that the si takes into account the entire age distribution whereas the mean age is the first moment about zero of the age distribution as the si was determined using conservative tracers measuring travel time from the water table to sample collection well it does not account for transport properties and reactivity of contaminants or unsaturated zone travel time the si is calculated as the normalized hellinger distance between the cumulative distribution function cdf of age for the well of interest and a reference cdf the hellinger distance dh is defined by nikulin 2001 as 1 d h i 1 k p i q i 2 2 where p i and q i are the cumulative probability of the age distribution of interest and a reference age distribution respectively for a given age values for the hellinger distance range between 0 perfectly similar and perfectly dissimilar the susceptibility index is then calculated as 2 si 1 1 d h where the si ranges between 1 indicating young ages and a narrow age distribution and 0 indicating older ages and a broad age distribution for this metric the more rapidly a land surface contaminant arrives at the well the more susceptible the given well thus the reference cdf is defined as piston flow model with a mean age of 1 year the important difference between si and mean age can be illustrated by comparing the age distributions and si of hypothetical samples all with the same mean age of 200 years fig 2 the susceptibility of a well to land surface contamination is a function of the fraction and mean age of the young component of flow which will move the contaminant to the well rather than the overall mean age of the sample the concept of the si is particularly important for mixtures of water from differing recharge sources flow paths and groundwater ages for example bmm 2 has the highest si 0 41 of the hypothetical samples fig 2 and is binary mixture of water with mean ages of 5 and 5000 years only a small amount of old water needs to be mixed into a sample to bias the mean age older and potentially confuse interpretation of the mean age the susceptibility index takes into account the full age distribution and is less prone to bias than the mean age as an additional proof of concept calculated si for pas wells was compared to measured nitrate the herbicides atrazine metolachlor prometon and common herbicide degradates deethylatrazine deisopropylatrazine deethylhydroxyatrazine hydroxyatrazine metolachlor sulfonic acid alachlor sulfonic acid and acetochlor sulfonic acid these analytes were chosen because application of fertilizer and herbicide is relatively ubiquitous across the glacial aquifer and typical application procedures widely disperse the product at land surface i e non point source measured contaminant concentrations were converted to a presence absence metric i e detection based on the reported analytical detection limits and compared to the estimated mean age fraction modern and si to assess the utility of each age metric in determining the intrinsic groundwater susceptibility 3 6 composite age and si distributions age distributions represent the probability of a water parcel with a given estimated age occurring in a single sample full age distributions are presented in this study as cumulative probabilities and provide the fraction of sample younger than a given age i e proportion of sample recharged after a given year plots of cumulative age distributions are a useful visual representation of the extent of mixing and or dispersion in a sample wider distributions indicate a larger range of water parcel ages in a sample cumulative distributions of the si values were constructed for sets of samples by ordering the values and normalizing the number of samples within the sample set composite age distributions were constructed by averaging the cumulative age distributions of the wells of interest the composite distributions provide means of summary and characterization of age at selected wells the composite si distributions were plotted in reverse order 1 to 0 to better correlate with the respective composite age distributions i e young highly susceptible wells on the left to old low susceptibility wells on the right boxplots of mean age and si were included to illustrate the distribution of values that are represented by composite distributions a comparison of estimated mean age and si from each network was conducted and idealized statistical distributions were fit to the composite age distributions as described in supplemental information a 1 5 for comparison amongst sample groups and to other groundwater age studies composite age and best fit idealized distribution parameters are presented in the supplemental information a 2 3 3 7 statistical comparison of age metrics 3 7 1 comparison of groundwater age hydrogeology and well characteristics a comparison of age class estimated mean age and si calculated in this study to the hydrogeology from yager et al 2019 and well construction characteristics was conducted to investigate the primary controls on groundwater age and provide context for discussion the comparisons of hydrogeology and age presented in this study are representative of the given network the analysis has limited utility as a predictor of groundwater age using hydrogeology and well construction and should not be used to that end the statistical analysis was performed using the stats base package and vcd package meyer et al 2016 in r statistical software r core team 2016 methods for determination of hydrogeologic metrics are provided in the supplemental information a 1 4 and general well characteristics are provided in supplemental information table b 1 composite distributions and boxplots of estimated mean age and si were constructed for each category separated on 20th 40th 60th and 80th percentiles of the selected hydrogeologic and well metrics to illustrate the differences between the respective groups the relationships between the respective categorized hydrogeology metrics and age were formally evaluated using the cramer s v statistic 0 to 1 which is the analog to pearson s correlation coefficient for nominal variables only the hydrogeology metrics that are correlated with the age metrics at the 95 significance level are reported here it is important to point out that cramer s v does not indicate the direction inverse or proportional of the correlation the mean age and mean si for each category of a given hydrogeology metric were compared using a multiple comparisons test tukey s honest significant difference test at the 95 significance level 3 7 2 comparison of groundwater age between well networks mean age si and respective distributions from each sample network were used to assess the effect of sample network design e g spatial distribution well characteristics on mean age and si as the spatial scale of each network is vastly different fig 1 the immediately adjacent pas wells n 6 were compared to the full mss network and the adjacent mss wells n 3 were compared to the full fps network the relatively simple comparison of wells based on proximity is meant to provide some indication of the commonality between networks and whether a given network is representative of groundwater age in the entire flow system the mean age and mean si for each subset or full network of wells was compared using a multiple comparisons test tukey s honest significant difference test at the 95 significance level 4 results 4 1 groundwater age and susceptibility index lpm age distributions were assigned and susceptibility indices calculated at 168 individual groundwater wells in the glacial aquifer a summary of the lpm results table 1 show that mean estimated age was 2 400 years in the glacial aquifer and the majority of wells 56 percent classified as modern based on individual composite age distributions the fraction of modern recharge after 1950 and within the last 10 000 years e g holocene is also calculated for each sample supplemental information table c 1 based on the composite distribution of all wells on average 68 percent of water is modern recharge and 90 percent was recharged within the last 10 000 years table 1 on average mixtures consist of 45 percent modern water and the pre modern samples have approximately 10 percent modern water composite and best fit age distribution parameters are reported in the supplemental information a 2 3 4 2 pas well network groundwater age estimates for the pas network wells range from recent recharge with a mean age of 1 year to approximately 52 000 years table c 1 with a median estimated age of 40 years table 1 the 115 sites are approximately evenly distributed between modern and some component of pre modern water either in a mixture or entirely pre modern spatially groundwater east of ohio and west of central montana have a larger portion of modern water while pre modern water is more dominant in the west central portion of the aquifer fig 3 a interestingly the central region greatly varies between predominately modern and pre modern water with a significant number of wells indicated as mixtures modern and pre modern water the median si for the entire pas is 0 208 and spatially the si follows a similar pattern to the age class with higher susceptibility groundwater coincident with modern water in the glacial aquifer fig 3b chi squared fit of lpms to measured tracer data are generally very good with an average chi squared of 0 32 with 106 of the 114 samples having a chi squared value less than 1 only three sites glacpas1 82 u01 u13 have chi square values greater than 2 the single mixture dispersion model was most frequently n 50 the best fit to the tracer data with an average dispersion parameter of 0 2 lpms with an exponential component emm or pem were fit to 21 sites table c 1 one site glacpas1 14 was clearly pre modern based on 3h below detection limit and high percent 4heterr 0 89 unfortunately it was not possible to assign an estimated age with reasonable confidence because a 14c measurement was either not collected or the bottle broke prior to analysis based on the pas composite distribution for all samples 64 percent of water was recharged prior to 1953 table 1 and 82 percent recharged in the last 10 000 years estimated mean age fraction modern and si of pas wells were compared to detections i e above analytical detection limit of the land surface contaminants nitrate herbicides and their degradates fig 3c d e results indicate si has a stronger correlation to contaminant detection than the other age metrics 4 2 1 influence of hydrogeology and well characteristics on age exploratory analysis of the relationship between groundwater age and the hydrogeology or well characteristics fig 4 a indicates that relative contribution of a given age class systematically varies between the categories of select metrics depth to the top and bottom of the screened interval total well depth confinement depth to bedrock percent chance confined aquifer depth and the number of aquifers the depth of the screened interval top and bottom and total well depth display similar patterns and correlation fig 4b with the age metrics so only the total well depth metric is displayed in fig 4a for brevity the cramer s v statistic indicates that age class is correlated with 95 confidence to a larger number hydrogeology and well metrics while the categorical si has the stronger correlations fig 4b composite age and si distributions for each group of select hydrogeology and well metrics fig 5 allow a detailed examination of the relationship between age and hydrogeology the multiple comparison test indicates that the mean age and mean si have a statistically significant difference amongst the categories of well bottom depth fig 5a and confinement fig 5b while no significance difference in mean age and mean si was found between the categories of the other select metrics 4 2 2 environmental tracer uncertainties maps of the tracer anomalies in the pas fig 6 show variability in the 3hetrit anomaly while more spatially coherent localized regions of elevated sf6 and percent 4heterr are apparent the lack of spatial pattern in 3hetrit anomalies suggests additional factors such as error in he sampling and balance calculations are influencing the calculated tracer concentration conversely the sf6 and 4heterr positive anomalies are likely related to terrigenic sources 4 3 mss and fps well networks groundwater age estimates in the mss network range from 10 to 4 600 years table c 1 with a median estimated age of 310 years table 1 of the 28 sites in the mss network 11 sites are characterized as modern 15 sites are best fit by a mixture and 2 sites are predominately pre modern water table 1 based on the composite age distribution approximately 62 percent of water sampled from the mss network was recharged before 1953 and 99 percent was recharged in the last 10 000 years the median susceptibility index for all mss sites is 0 16 table 1 lpms are generally good fits to mss tracer data with an average χ2 of 0 05 the mss wells were most commonly fit by lpm s with some component of pem or epm table c 1 groundwater age estimates for the fps network wells sampled in 2004 and 2014 range from 2 to 52 years table c 1 with respective median ages of 31 and 29 years table 1 the median susceptibility index for all 2014 fps sites is 0 25 table 1 based on the composite age distribution approximately 96 percent of water sampled in 2014 from the fps network was recharged after 1950 and all water was recharged in the last 10 000 years lpm fits to tracer data is good with a mean χ2 of 0 4 with the exception of samples collected from fss1a and fss4b with respective χ2 fits of 2 2 and 7 fps network site were most commonly fit by the epm table c 1 samples collected along the flow path are overall similar but slightly younger that stream bed samples stream reach table 1 re interpreted ages of the fps 2004 network using lpms tables 1 and c 1 are not significantly different from apparent ages described in tesoriero et al 2007 4 4 groundwater age and si between well networks comparison of groundwater age metrics from the pas mss and fps 2014 networks show that the three networks have generally disparate composite distributions and mean estimated age and si table 1 and fig 7 selection of pas wells adjacent to the mss network show improvement in general match of the composite age and si distributions fig 7 and agreement between the fraction modern mean age of the modern fraction and the mean si table 2 the mean age of the pre modern fraction although in better agreement remains significantly different between the select pas and mss networks table 2 comparison of age distributions quantified as the hellinger distance dh eq 1 for pas and pas select to mss dh 5 17 and 4 48 respectively show improved agreement although minor the persistent disagreement between the pre modern components in the select pas and mss networks is possibly a result of the pas being deeper public supply wells with larger screened intervals and higher pumping rates which potentially captured older flow paths relative to the mss with a mixture of public supply and domestic wells comparison of the select mss to the fps 2014 network shows significant improvement in agreement in all metrics between the two networks fig 7 comparison of age distributions for mss and mss select to fps 2014 dh 3 97 and 0 7 respectively show significantly improved agreement the differences in mean estimated age and si between the select pas and mss and between the select mss and fps 2014 are not statistically significant with 95 confidence equal variance and unequal sample size tukey kramer test 5 discussion 5 1 sample network design analysis of scale results indicate better agreement between smaller networks and select wells of the larger networks table 2 and fig 7 on a broader scale this finding suggests the deep municipal wells of the pas network provide a reasonable representation of the glacial aquifer as a whole reasons that the pas appears to be representative likely include intentional equal spacing of wells across the aquifer following recommendations of belitz et al 2010 long well screen intervals and high well pumping rates dictated by municipal demands it is acknowledged that the comparison across scale is limited to a small region of the overall aquifer fig 1 and may not capture scalability of groundwater age in other regions of the aquifer however the pas provides a particularly good representation of the modern component of groundwater when compared to the other networks table 2 and fig 7 indicating that the modern fraction and overall susceptibility is reasonably represented by the pas wells we suggest that discussing groundwater age metrics across the glacial aquifer in terms of the results from the pas network is reasonable and such a scaling comparison is an improvement over blind characterization of an aquifer based on limited samples 5 2 groundwater age metrics groundwater age in the glacial aquifer is generally modern 64 percent modern based on pas composite distribution figs 5 and 7a although there is a clear presence of 1000s of year old water fig 3a table 1 figs 5 and 7a c spatially the northeast and northwest are dominated by modern water mean age of the one pre modern sample in washington being 63 2 years with the central portion of the region having a greater mixture of age classes fig 3a the presence of 1000s of year old water across the aquifer in an important finding and might be considered unusual given moderate median recharge rates and relatively shallow aquifer total depth yager et al 2019 but some portion of pre modern groundwater is not all together unexpected as the complex hydrogeology generally consisting of low permeability tills with lenses of sands and gravels conceptually supports the possibility of connate water within the glacial aquifer itself old groundwater may be a result of long flow paths in the deep confined permeable aquifer units or slow diffusion dominated transport in fine grain sediments the central portion of the glacial aquifer specifically the east and north central regions containing older groundwater fig 3a in fact coincides with deeper and more continuous sequences of layered till and permeable lenses yager et al 2019 pre modern water captured from the glacial aquifer in the south central southwest central and the west central regions fig 3a is more likely to have been sourced from another flow system the mentioned regions with large components of pre modern water have relatively high precipitation rates and limited depth of the quaternary glacial sediments yager et al 2019 making significant amounts of pre glacial retreat water 10 000 years old unlikely in the glacial sediments we propose that a hydrologic connection between the glacial and underlying bedrock aquifers is a more reasonable explanation for such large contributions of pre modern water than relatively hydraulically stagnant zones within the quaternary glacial sediments containing connate waters in the south central region the cambrian ordovician bedrock aquifer lloyd and lyke 1995 containing dominantly pre modern water stackelberg et al 2018 is thinly overlain by glacial sediments yager et al 2019 deep wells long screen intervals and high pumping rates at the public supply pas wells conceptually support capture of shallow bedrock aquifer water in the southwest and west central regions the presence of pre modern water fig 3a might similarly be explained by hydraulic connection to the cretaceous and paleozoic sedimentary bedrock aquifers whitehead 1996 olcott 1992 and fractured igneous and metamorphic bedrock aquifers olcott 1992 previous investigations have measured bedrock derived groundwater 3h below detection limit 0 8 tu for that study bartos et al 2002 and there is suggestion of localized hydraulic connection between shallow and deep aquifers strobel et al 2000 in the southwest and west central glacial aquifer although previous investigations have been limited in scope a hydraulic connection between shallow glacial sediments and the deeper bedrock systems seems a reasonable hypothesis supported by results from this study this finding has important implications in understanding and managing groundwater resources across the region 5 3 hydrogeology and well characteristics statistical analysis of hydrogeology and well characteristics to age in pas network indicates that the relative contribution of modern and pre modern water is affected by well depth confinement depth to the top of the aquifer depth to bedrock and aquifer complexity i e number of aquifers fig 4a the contributions of mixed waters are relatively constant in respect to well depth and depth to bedrock but follow a general pattern of increasing and then decreasing in relation to percent chance confined aquifer depth and number of aquifers that a component of modern and pre modern water either as mixture or solely pre modern is present in all categories of each metric illustrates the complexity of groundwater age in the glacial aquifer the formal evaluation of the correlation fig 4b supports that there is a statistically significant with 95 confidence effect of select hydrogeology on the respective age metrics although the correlations are generally modest cramer s v 0 5 to weak 0 2 age class is correlated to more hydrogeology metrics than either the categorical mean age or si while the categorical si is more strongly correlated fig 4b to select metrics composite distributions fig 5 provide a detailed illustration of the differences in age and si for the given hydrogeology metrics some overall findings of note include the median age and the width of the age distributions generally increase across the categories and each category has some component of 1 000 s of years old water across all the metrics the opposite is true for the si with the spread of values generally decreasing and more heavily skewed to lower si values across categories also of interest is that the shape of the age distributions are generally very similar with increasing width across the categories with the exception of highest percent chance confined fig 5d deepest depth to aquifer fig 5e and greater than 2 aquifers fig 5f the similarity in general shape is further manifestation of the broad range of ages in each category while the widening of age distributions indicates the increasing influence of flow path mixing across categories this increasing extent of mixing is in part related to the ever presence of modern water with an increased proportion of pre modern water but also likely influenced by additional longitudinal mixing along pre modern flow paths while there is an observable difference in age class proportion fig 4a mean age and si among the categories fig 5 and a statistically significant correlation between the age and hydrogeology metrics fig 4b multiple comparisons test indicates that only separation by well bottom depth fig 4a and 5a and confinement fig 4b and 5b resulted in statistically significant differences in mean age and si the lack of strong correlation between age and hydrogeology metrics and lack of clear differences in the mean age and si among the hydrogeology categories demonstrates the complexity of groundwater age as a metric integrating many well and aquifer properties more robust statistical analysis of the limited sample set considering the interdependency between hydrogeology metrics in relation to age could possibly be insightful but is outside the scope of this study 5 4 susceptibility index calculated values of si for the different networks and age classes show higher susceptibility larger si in shallow fps network wells and modern groundwater samples and lower susceptibility smaller si in pre modern samples table 1 similarly comparisons of si to hydrogeology in the pas network show decreasing values of si with increasing well bottom depth fig 5a confinement fig 5b percent chance confinement fig 5d and decreasing aquifer complexity fig 5f conceptually these findings are in agreement with what is expected shallow wells in unconfined portions of the aquifer have a greater likelihood of capturing land surface contaminants in fact statistically significant differences in mean si was found between differing well bottom depth fig 5a and confinement fig 5b the distribution of si values regardless of sample network is non normal and skewed to lower values figs 5 and 7b d as a result of how si is defined further investigation of si in other groundwater systems would be instructive si has a less distinct spatial pattern than age class fig 3a b but overall indicates a high level of susceptibility si 0 2 across the aquifer overall the findings of si presented here are consistent with the conceptual model of the glacial aquifer moderate recharge and shallow aquifer depth yager et al 2019 indicating a relatively high susceptibility of groundwater to land surface contamination comparison of the multiple age metrics mean age fraction modern and si to the number of land surface contaminants detected fig 3c d e shows the si provides the best correlation spearman s ρ 0 52 kendall s τ 0 38 with 95 confidence indicating a subtle but measurable improvement over mean age or fraction modern for predicting groundwater susceptibility with environmental tracers the comparison presented fig 3c d e somewhat controls for variability in source concentration application rates and uptake and transport by converting to a presence absence but is only meant to illustrate the differences between age metrics when compared to measured contaminant data it is worth emphasizing that the susceptibility index used here is a measure of relative susceptibility to land surface contaminants behaving conservatively and originating near the water table furthermore naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic and manganese are also of concern in the glacial aquifer under appropriate geochemical conditions e g kinetically limited reduction the concentration of such contaminants is inversely related to the age of a given parcel of water it is tempting then to use the si inversely 1 indicating lower and 0 indicating higher relative susceptibility to natural contamination while in theory the si is potentially useful in this manner the metric does not account for factors other than the age distribution any significant differences in geochemical conditions between sites may render the comparison of si meaningless cautious use of the si as a measure of susceptibility to natural or contamination behaving non conservatively is required 5 5 environmental tracer sources maps of tracer anomalies fig 6 are instructive in identify regions impacted by terrigenic tracer sources informing the age interpretations of this study calculated 3hetrit is sensitive to the assumed isotopic ratios of mantle and terrigenic helium sources and previous study has shown glacial sediments can be a significant source of terrigenic helium solomon 2000 appropriately so positive 3hetrit anomalies fig 6a occur more frequently at sites with high terrigenic helium fig 6b negative 3hetrit anomalies can be partly explained by the low solubility of helium making gas loss from sampling error or excess air degassing prior to sampling a primary issue the lack of clear spatial pattern fig 6a reflects the complexity of measuring and calculating reliable 3hetrit values in glacial terrains in contrast spatially coherent regions of high percent terrigenic helium 4heterr 4hetot fig 6b and terrigenic source of sf6 fig 6c indicate strong hydrogeologic and geologic controls high 4heterr is generally related to sites with some component of pre modern water figs 3 and 6b providing additional support of a hydrologic connection to bedrock aquifers where he has accumulated over a longer period elevated sf6 is coincident with intrusive volcanic bedrock namely in eastern minnesota and wisconsin and relatively shallow intrusive bodies in the northeastern states fig 6c 6 conclusion the unconfined and confined water bearing sediments of the glacial aquifer cover a large spatial extent 1 87 106 km2 and serve as a public water supply for 30 million people estimates of mean groundwater age groundwater age distribution and susceptibility to land surface contamination is of critical importance groundwater age metrics for 168 public and domestic wells from three sample networks are presented in this study to evaluate the aquifer groundwater age distributions from the largest network pas indicated groundwater is dominantly modern and recharged after 1950 63 percent this coincides with relatively high values of si susceptibility index which is better correlated with measured detections of contaminants than mean age or fraction modern groundwater both groundwater age and susceptibility index were statistically most influenced by well depth and confinement providing a conceptual check on the analysis and further illustrating the susceptibility of the generally shallow and unconfined glacial aquifer presence of 1000s year old water across the glacial aquifer suggests a hydrologic connection between the shallow sediments and deeper fractured bedrock groundwater sources pre modern groundwater originating in underlying bedrock aquifers is a more likely explanation than pre glacial retreat recharge for the observed fraction of 1000s year old water such exchanges between the aquifers provides a mechanism of transport for land surface and anthropogenic contaminants to the deep bedrock aquifer and geogenic contaminants accumulated over long periods to the shallow aquifer comparison of age metrics and hydrogeology in the pas indicates the fraction of pre modern water in a sample is systematically affected by the total well depth depth to bedrock depth to aquifer unit aquifer complexity and confinement the findings indicate groundwater resources of the glacial aquifer are vulnerable to contamination sourced both from land surface and deep geologic materials this study provides a framework and new methods for interpretation of environmental tracers in determination of groundwater age and susceptibility we show through comparison of groundwater age metrics across the spatial scales of three sample networks in the glacial aquifer pas mss and fps large to small a limited sample set can accurately characterize a complex continuous system specifically equally spaced deep long screened interval public supply wells provide a reasonable representation of modern groundwater age and susceptibility to contamination in the glacial aquifer inclusion of statistical analysis of the age metrics and hydrogeology was shown to provide vital context for understanding groundwater age results and help improve the conceptual model of the glacial aquifer maps of tracer anomalies presented here provide useful guidance both for interpretation and selection of appropriate tracers in terrains with deep sequences of fine grain sediments derived from old rock with high accumulated helium use of 3hetrit can be challenging igneous terrains even when deeply buried contribute significant amounts of terrigenic sf6 given the relative dearth of available environmental age tracers rather than selecting or discarding tracers based on geology alone an exploratory sampling and evaluation of a tracer s utility for a particular study is a practical approach further work to characterize groundwater using the presented methods will be of value to the scientific community and resource managers credit authorship contribution statement john
