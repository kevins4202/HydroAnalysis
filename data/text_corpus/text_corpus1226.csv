6130,hydrological simulations and forecasts are subject to various sources of uncertainties thiboult et al 2016 constructed a 50 000 member great ensemble that ultimately accounts for meteorological forcing uncertainty initial condition uncertainty and structural uncertainty this large 50 000 member ensemble can also be separated into sub components to untangle the three main sources of uncertainties mentioned above however in thiboult et al 2016 model outputs were simply pooled together considering equiprobable members this paper studies the use of bayesian model averaging bma to post process multimodel hydrological forecasts bma assigns multiple sets of weights on different models and may then generate more skillful and reliable probabilistic forecasts bma weights explicitly quantify the level of confidence one can have regarding each candidate hydrological model and lead to a predictive probabilistic density function pdf containing information about uncertainty the bma scheme improves the overall quality of forecasts mainly by maintaining the ensemble dispersion with the lead time it also has the ability to improve the reliability and skill of multimodel systems that only include two sources of uncertainties that the 50 000 member great ensemble using all forecasting tools i e multimodel enkf and meteorological ensemble forcing could predict jointly furthermore thiboult et al 2016 showed that the meteorological forecasts they used were somehow biased and unreliable on some catchments the bma scheme is capable to improve the accuracy and reliability of the hydrological forecasts in that case as well keywords hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts uncertainty hydrological post processing bayesian model averaging bma 1 introduction uncertainty in hydrometeorological forecasting systems mainly stems from three cascade sources 1 the earth s chaotic atmosphere makes forecasting unreliable at extended lead times 2 hydrological land surface conditions are highly variable spatially 3 hydrological models are approximations with varying forecast skill in representing water circulation processes therefore reliable and skillful hydrological forecasts are based on our best understanding of the interactions between the atmosphere and the land surface keane et al 2002 of the hydrological initial conditions and of the hydrological model parameters and inherent structure liu and gupta 2007 pointed out that different sources of uncertainty need specific tools to be deciphered efficiently over the past decades there have been substantial efforts to reduce uncertainty and improve hydrological forecasts to date rather than issuing a single deterministic forecast a growing chorus of voices is sounding that ensemble prediction systems eps are advanced tools to quantify the propagation of uncertainty in the form of probabilistic density functions palmer 2002 eps is way more skillful and reliable than current operational deterministic prediction systems that are devoid of uncertainty information especially for larger events for example boucher et al 2011 compared probabilistic and deterministic hydrological forecasts in an operational water resources management context and confirmed the superiority of the ensembles in order to better decipher meteorological forcing uncertainty meteorological ensemble prediction systems mepss were operated pioneerly in the 1990s by for example the european centre for medium range weather forecasts buizza and palmer 1995 palmer 1993 buizza 2005 the national center for environmental prediction toth and kalnay 1997 and the canadian meteorological center houtekamer et al 1996 the idea was to run a numerical weather prediction model given slightly different initial conditions that depict the chaotic nature of the atmosphere hydrological ensemble prediction systems hepss followed up promoted by the availability of meteorological ensemble products e g schaake et al 2007 cloke and pappenberger 2009 velázquez et al 2009 brochero et al 2012 boucher et al 2011 abaza et al 2017 given uncertainties in the hydrological initial conditions various sequential data assimilation approaches have been proposed to account for them for instance the ensemble kalman filter enkf e g evensen 1994 evensen et al 1994 reichle et al 2002 weerts and el serafy 2006 clark et al 2008a b mcmillan et al 2013 and the particle filter e g moradkhani et al 2012 thirel et al 2013 allow quantification and reduction of the initial conditions uncertainty however the enkf cannot alone maintain reliability with extended lead times since state variables uncertainty does not propagate much after the model spin up so the benefit of the enkf fades away with longer forecast horizons thiboult et al 2016 marty et al 2015 asserted that ensemble forecasting systems fail in considering model structural uncertainty if perturbations are only imposed on the initial and boundary conditions and parameters thus far a tremendous amount of hydrological models have been brought forward and developed for quantifying the spatiotemporal variations of streamflow fisher et al 2008 leuning et al 2008 yuan et al 2010 they attempt to capture the dominant processes in a catchmentto predictriverflows mockler et al 2016 however no hydrological model in existence today can convincingly claim that it is systematically superior to the others for all types of applications and under all conditions duan et al 2007 each one has specific strengths in capturing hydrological processes not to mention that in many cases model parametric uncertainties exist despite that numerous model calibration techniques e g multi parameter ensemble sets were examined and improved beven and binley 1992 vrugt et al 2003 mcenery et al 2005 researchers pointed out that the structural error inherent in any single model is unavoidable in this kind of ensemble strategy gourley and vieux 2006 clark et al 2008a poulin et al 2011 clark 2008b proposed a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures the framework for understanding structural errors fuse pooling a number of model predictions according to different weighting strategies has often proved efficient improving hydrological forecasts hagedorn et al 2005 raftery et al 2005 candille 2009 thiboult et al 2016 documented that the multimodel approach was also capable to partially compensate for the enkf decreasing effect by accounting for model structural uncertainties multimodel hepss may be exposed to some other uncertainty underestimation partly owing to the locally biased meteorological forecasts and partly because as already mentioned of the fading out of data assimilation with extended forecast horizons various hydrological statistical post processing approaches e g li et al 2017 have thus been developed as a necessary complementary element to the forecasting chain to compensate or treat uncertainties from outputs propagated from upstream sources examples of post processing methods include bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 wilson et al 2007 duan et al 2007 bayesian processor of ensemble marty et al 2015 the best member approach di narzo and cocchi 2016 kernel dressing methods roulston and smith 2003 fortin et al 2006 and general linear model post processor zhao et al 2011 ye et al 2014 hoeting et al 1999 pioneered the bayesian model averaging bma method using a finite mixture of probability density functions issued from different models or forecasts to represent the predictive distribution of the variable of interest bma estimates can provide a sharper and more reliable probability density function pdf for the probabilistic predictions when the weights have been determined by how well each member fits the training data for hydrological forecasts post processing bma has been substantiated as a more effective and efficient approach to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts when compared to the single best model or other multimodel ensemble methods ellison 2004 duan et al 2007 najafi et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 the main difficulty with bma in most of the above mentioned applications is that it always simplifies the ensemble forecast through a statistic of lower dimensionality the ensemble mean and therefore loses the information provided by the shape of the empirical distribution of the ensemble members whitaker and loughe 1998 marty et al 2015 the present study focuses on a multiple hydrological model application which turns out to be a more proper use of bma this is achieved by using the forecasts issued from a multimodel scheme composed of 20 lumped models implemented in the southern portion of the province of québec canada thiboult et al 2016 in addition the available hydrological ensemble prediction system heps allows the use of meteorological ensemble forcings and ensemble kalman filter enkf streamflow assimilation used either individually or together in producing the daily streamflow ensembles the enkf is employed to decipher the initial condition uncertainty the meteorological ensemble to account for the forcing uncertainty and the multimodel scheme to quantify the model structure error explicitly in practice however the higher technical requirements of a more accurate and reliable heps that contains all three forecasting tools restrict its application therefore we are interested in evaluating the capacity of bma as a post processing approach in improving the forecast skill of a heps that lacks one source of uncertainty e g forcing uncertainty initial condition uncertainty in comparison to ensembles issued exploiting all of the available forecasting tools improvements are also assessed using locally biased less reliable meteorological forecasts the hypothesis we want to verify is that an advanced multimodel ensemble that includes a rational post processing method will outperform the simply pooled ensemble prediction the final output of our bma implementation is a weighted mixture of gamma distributions the shape and scale parameters of each distribution forming this mixture are fitted daily to the hydrological streamflow predictions from each model this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the hydrometeorological data catchments clarification and hydrological models in section 3 we detail the methodology including the moving window scheme and the verification scores for assessing forecasts performance and reliability results of bma estimates based on different heps configurations and groups of catchments are gathered and discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 data 2 1 meteorological and hydrological data the hydrometeorological data used in this work were generated by thiboult et al 2016 who constructed 50 000 member ensembles that propose a comprehensive hydrometeorological forecasting framework one advantage of this database is that it could be divided up into simpler hepss table 1 by activating or not the following three forecasting tools multimodel ensemble pooling 20 conceptual lumped hydrological models ensemble kalman filter 50 member enkf and ensemble meteorological forcings 50 weather forecast members however in thiboult et al 2016 the model outputs were simply pooled together in order to account for the three sources of uncertainty table 1 details a partial selection of thiboult s previous systems as only systems based on multiple models was deemed within the research scope of this study three hepss investigated here were established by using three different probabilistic tools i e meteorological ensemble forcing enkf and multimodel scheme conjointly or alternatively as the reference heps system c activates all abovementioned forecasting tools and represents the enkf multimodel ensemble with meps forcing and input output perturbations by deactivating the enkf system a or the weather ensemble forcing system b simpler hepss are also studied to reveal the capacity of bma for compensating the forecast performance and reliability of a heps that lacks one source of uncertainty compared with the reference system the observed daily total precipitation minimum and maximum temperature and streamflow are from the direction de l expertise hydrique du québec dehq and extend from 1990 to 2010 the meteorological ensemble forecasts were retrieved from the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge database the 50 exchangeable members of precipitation and temperature with 6 hour time step and 10 day ahead forecasting horizon are from ecmwf fraley et al 2010 in addition the weather forecasts used in the previous research thiboult et al 2016 were aggregated at a daily time step starting at 06 00 est 12 00 utc and reduced to 9 days ahead the horizontal resolution of the meteorological forecasts was downscaled from 0 5 to 0 1 during data retrieval using bilinear interpolation gaborit et al 2012 to make forecasts more suitable for hydrological applications as for the streamflow database three periods are used 1990 2000 is committed to the model calibration october 2005 october 2008 to the hydrological model spin up and november 2008 december 2010 to the hydrological forecast assessment as shown in the average monthly hydrograph fig 1 these river systems are mainly active in the spring from march to may and to a lesser degree in autumn from september to november in this study streamflow simulations and 9 day ahead forecasts are available for each of the 20 lumped conceptual hydrological models detailed in table 2 as explained later section 3 2 simulations are very useful for attributing a weight to each model model selection is from perrin 2000 and seiller et al 2012 based on conceptual and structural diversity thiboult and anctil 2015 pointed out that these models perform better and are more competitive when combined or pooled together for a more detailed description of the properties and processes of the ensemble meteorological data multiple hydrological models and data assimilation readers are referred to thiboult et al 2016 2 2 catchments the available database includes 38 catchments located in the south of the province of québec canada fig 2 experiencing a mixed hydrological regime with a strong spring freshet since we seek to explore bma skill the very first thing we need to do is to clarify which catchment still has some room for improvement as our target catchment based on reference system c the specific forecast quality of each catchment was checked fig 3 reliability diagrams of all 38 catchments available in this study are divided into two groups specific description about reliability diagram may refer to section 3 3 within this article pre verification results show that with increasing lead times the reliability and performance of group 1 blue in fig 2 fades away fairly rapidly with time goes on while the qualities were well maintained in group 2 pink in fig 2 which implies the upstream three forecasting tools was more successful for group 2 catchments it is suspected that the meteorological forecasts are largely responsible for the lesser performance of group 1 catchments for two main reasons first some catchments of group 1 are quite small and distant from ecmwf grid points before downscaling second the presence of an inherent local bias within the meteorological ensemble forcing resulting in the south north contrast depicted in fig 2 therefore the accuracy and reliability of the hydrological forecasts of group 1 are still in need to be improved through post processing de facto identifying the catchments on which the study will focus more in depth table 3 3 methodology 3 1 bayesian model averaging bma bma is used in this study as a post processor for hydrological forecasts issued from a multimodel heps it assigns credibility to each candidate hydrological model and infers more reliable and skillful predictions bma provides a weighting strategy via a predictive probabilistic density function pdf that accounts for the relative performance of each available model the database is structured around dimensions of time t and model k and includes both simulations and forecasts assume that y is the target forecast variable here streamflow and that y t obs y 1 obs y 2 obs y t obs groups historical observed streamflows over time period t 1 t similarly x t sim x 1 t sim x 2 t sim x k t sim x k t sim and x t fcst x 1 t fcst x 2 t fcst x k t fcst x k t fcst consist respectively in the simulation and forecasts composed of k hydrological models for instance our hydrological ensemble prediction system may produce 2 500 ensemble members per model daily the pdf of the predictand y can then be expressed on the law of total probability 1 p y t x t sim k 1 k p y t m m k x t sim p m m k x t sim where m m k means that model m k is assumed correct for each valid time and p m m k x t sim indicates the predictive distribution of y given the model m k and ensemble members x t sim the weight w k p m m k x t sim with k 1 k w k 1 reflects the relative predictive contribution of the kth model within the training period t therefore eq 1 can be also expressed as 2 p y t x t sim k 1 k w k p y t m m k x t sim it is very important to stress that the original idea behind bma is the weighting and combining of models rather than individual ensemble members the result of bma is thus necessarily a weighted sum of pdf however in the recent literature several authors mention using bma where in reality they are applying a weighted average on forecast members e g duan et al 2007 rathinasamy et al 2013 in such cases since x k reduces to a single realization p y t m m k x t sim cannot be deduced from the ensemble members from each model a distribution typically a gaussian is rather fitted around each deterministic ensemble member using a chosen possibly calibrated mean and standard deviation in this paper we estimate p y t m m k x t sim by fitting a gamma distribution on the ensemble members from each of the 20 hydrological models this gamma distribution is defined by the shape parameter α k and scale parameter β k 3 p k t y t m m k x t sim g k t y t m m k α k t β k t 1 β k t α k t γ α k t y t α k t 1 exp y t β k t y t 0 the next step consists in inferring the bma weights w 1 w 2 w 20 and parameters θ α 1 β 1 α 2 β 2 α k β k in this study we employ the classic expectation maximization algorithm em dempster et al 1977 to maximize the log likelihood function l given here by 4 l w θ x t sim t 1 t l o g k 1 k w k t 1 β k t α k t γ α k t y t α k t 1 exp y t β k t this allows inferring the weights that best represent the credibility one should attribute to each of the 20 models 3 2 moving window scheme a moving window is implemented for calculating bma weights on a number of simulation observation pairs these weights are next applied to the next forecast observation pair to assess the forecast improvement after bma after various tests a moving window consisting of the previous 30 days was found an acceptable compromise between providing enough information to the bma to perform up to expectations while resorting to an implementation that is flexible to temporal changes in the database fig 4 the first concern is that over fitting might arise if the window length is too short secondly a monthly moving window may help us exploring the underlying specific and seasonal variational roles of each model among the 20 competing ones last but not least for practical purposes a 30 day length is more coherent and efficient in the real world with limited length for time series fig 4 illustrates the main flowchart of this study according to two dimensions containing time t and model k at time t for instance observed meteorological values p t t t 1 t 29 obs ε and t t t 1 t 29 obs ε with added precipitation and temperature perturbations ε and initial state variables θ t t 1 t 29 initial are used to drive the kth model to obtain the simulated streamflow x k t t 1 t 29 sim and the predicted state variable θ k t 30 pred for time t 30 the weight w k t 30 for the kth model is obtained by applying the em algorithm on this 30 day period meanwhile enkf is also conducted using the historical observed streamflows y t 30 obs ε for day t 30 to update the state variable θ k t 30 update meteorological ensemble forecasts p t t 29 δ t fcst and t t 29 δ t fcst with lead time δ t 1 2 9 updated state variable θ k t 30 update and bma weights w k t 30 k 1 2 20 are all used in forecast mode to generate the forecast streamflows x k t 29 δ t fcst k 1 2 20 δ t 1 2 9 3 3 statistical analysis ensemble forecasts are usually transformed into categorical forecasts or probability forecasts before assessing their performance eight verification metrics are used in this study for evaluating the performance of bma mostly in terms of accuracy and reliability it includes some common deterministic based metrics gupta et al 2009 proposed the kling gupta efficiency kge for evaluating model performance comprehensively kge was slightly modified later by kling et al 2012 i e marked as kge to avoid a cross correlation between the bias and variability ratios it can be used for the assessment of deterministic forecasts and is given by equations below 5 kg e r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 6 β μ y μ o 7 γ cv y cv o σ y μ y σ o μ o here r the correlation coefficient reflects the linear association between forecasts here the ensemble mean and observations μ y μ o and σ y σ o are the mean and the standard deviations of the deterministic forecasts observations time series cv is the coefficient of variation dimensionless the continuous ranked probability score crps matheson and winkler 1976 hersbach 2000 gneiting and raftery 2007 is used widely for verifying both the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic forecasts the mean continuous ranked probability score mcrps calculated as the average crps over the dataset is employed with series length t 8 mcprs 1 t t 1 t p t fcst y h y t y t obs 2 d y where y represents the predicted variable p t fcst y is the cumulative distribution function of the forecasts at time t and y t obs is the corresponding observations heaviside function h equals 0 when y t y t obs and h equals 1 when y t y t obs the perfect value of mcrps is 0 and in this study the spread skill plot ssp fortin et al 2014 compares the root mean square error of the ensemble mean and the square root of the average ensemble variance the spread the ssp can be used for assessing the reliability of an ensemble prediction system considering both bias and spread additional graphical verification insights about reliability can be gained from the reliability diagram predictive quantile quantile plot and the rank polar diagram as well the reliability diagram is conditioned on the forecasts it plots the observed frequency against the forecast probability where the range of forecast probabilities is divided into separate bins for instance 0 5 5 15 15 25 etc the reliability diagram may tell us how well the predicted probabilities of different events correspond to their observed frequencies reliability is indicated by the proximity of the plotted curve to the diagonal the deviation from the diagonal gives the conditional bias if the curve comes out below the line this indicates over forecasting points above the line indicate under forecasting the flatter the curve in the reliability diagram the less resolution it has climatology does not discriminate at all between events and non events and thus has no resolution the predictive quantile quantile plot is also used to verify whether the predictive distributions follow the same distribution as observations laio and tamea 2007 thyer et al 2009 biondi and de luca 2013 the horizontal axis represents the correct probabilistic forecast of realization o i i 1 2 n while the vertical axis denotes the empirical cumulative distribution r i n where n is the number and r i is the i th theoretical probability of realization moreover renard et al 2010 have proposed two indices to evaluate the degree of the departure from the diagonal line 9 α 1 n i 1 n p i r i n 10 ξ 1 1 n i 1 n β 11 β 1 1 i f z i 0 o r z i 1 0 otherwise here α represents the area between the qq curve and the bisector and varies between 0 5 and 0 with the perfect score α 1 the other index ξ quantifies the reliability through calculating the complement of the fraction of z i values equal to 0 or 1 ξ varies between 0 and 1 with the perfect condition ξ 1 the rank polar diagram rpolar diagram xu et al 2017 is an extension of the conventional rank histogram hamill 2001 wilks 2011 to verify whether the observed probability distribution is well represented by the ensembles hamill 2001 pointed out that the ensemble forecast that was reliable at each point would generate a uniform rank histogram however a flat rank histogram nevertheless could be generated from unreliable ensembles therefore xu et al 2017 proposed a modified criterion of rpolar diagram which was not only able to verify the overall reliability but also the partial reliability over different forecast intervals according to users specific preference or uniform intervals fig 5 demonstrates the schematic diagram of the rank polar diagram based on a synthetic ensemble with 25 members and 100 000 time steps observations are sampled from gaussian distributions n μ i σ i i 1 2 10 where μ i and σ i represent the mean and standard deviation of the ith quantile they can be divided into 10 quantiles 10 100 in descending order with black labels represented by the dashed radial lines in fig 5 the corresponding synthetic forecasts are 25 random ensemble values sampled from n μ i δ μ i σ i δ σ i with perturbations δ μ i and δ σ i and they are represented as the numbers on the external circle frequencies are indicated by the dashed circles with different percentages 5 10 with grey labels and the root mean square error rmsei eq 12 values for each quantile are marked by the blue x marks 12 rmse i 100 1 m 1 j 1 m 1 r j 1 m 1 2 where i represents the sequence number of the observational frequency interval m is the number of ensemble members and j represents the index for ensemble members r j represents the rank values of each ensemble member in the corresponding intervals besides in each quantile the values which are larger than 1 m 1 are colored red while the values which are less than 1 m 1 are colored cyan the red circle demonstrates the perfect rank with a radius value of 1 m 1 and the yellow fan area represents the highest discharge interval fig 5 shows an example of the use of the rpolar diagram for five different sets of synthetic ensemble forecasts the first one is perfectly reliable and is represented in the quantiles 90 and 100 the other four types are unreliable and represented in the other eight quantiles those synthetic forecasts were generated by adjusting δ μ i and δ σ i for reliable forecasts all the ranks lie close to the red circle i e perfect ranking the first and second quantiles with black labels of 90 and 100 in fig 5 show the case of δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 when both observations and forecasts are generated from the same distribution as for the other eight quantiles the u shaped rpolar diagram shows up in the 1st and 2nd quantiles black labels of 10 and 20 with δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 lack of variability the dome shaped rpolar diagram in the 3rd and 4th quantiles reveals an excess of variability with δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 in addition the under forecasting situation is depicted in the 5th and 6th quantiles with δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 and the over forecasting situation δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 shows up in the 7th and 8th quantiles a detailed description of the rpolar diagram s concepts and applications can be found in xu et al 2017 4 results as introduced earlier one objective of this study is to discriminate the relative level of confidence one can attribute to each hydrological model in a multimodel forecasting setup for different catchments this relative level of confidence translates into bma model weights ultimately we want to verify the hypothesis mentioned in the introduction according to which an advanced multimodel ensemble that includes bma would outperform simply pooled ensembles in short we want to test whether bma could help developing more skillful and reliable multimodel probabilistic hydrological predictions two aspects are mainly perceived 1 different hepss according to three forecasting tools multiple hydrological models ensemble kalman filter enkf and ensemble meteorological forcing are available to the project and present various levels of forecasting quality therefore whether bma could improve the forecast performance of different systems to the same good level is deemed worthy of investigation 2 because of the inherent local bias in the meteorological ensemble forecasts on some catchments the heps performance varies from one catchment to the other consequently bma was firstly applied to group 1 that displays lower initial performance values this will allow to test whether bma can improve forecasts performance to the same good level that is observed for the other group of catchments group 2 4 1 bma calibration and validation the database we had access to contains ensemble forecasts and simulations for each hydrological model since bma attributes weights to models not members we propose to calibrate those weights through model simulations and to apply them next on the forecasts forecasts for each model include several members that are equiprobable and correspond to different meteorological members therefore the weight attributed to a model must be divided by the number of members per model bma was first implemented on group 1 simulation observation pairs using a 30 day moving window evolving daily i e y 1 sim o b s y 2 sim o b s y 30 sim o b s as the first calibration window fig 4 validation was performed on the pair of simulated and observed streamflows that immediately follows the moving window i e y 31 sim o b s since both calibration and validation were conducted on simulations from the 20 models pooled together the structural uncertainty of each hydrological model is assumed to be reflected explicitly the weights that were obtained are displayed in figs 6 and 7 figs 6 and 7 should be interpreted together for exploring the variations in the contribution of each hydrological model in different catchments all the information about model simulations was initially gathered in 15 a catchments 20 models 730 30 day windows the final weight for each model was calculated by averaging over the whole time series therefore especially in fig 7 the summation of the 20 weights per catchment may not necessarily be equal to one in this study all 20 models are utilized jointly no subsets of models are explored actually bma weights shown next inform that they all contribute fig 6 shows the boxplot of the bma weights of all catchments per hydrological model some models are preferred among the 20 competing models with higher weights e g m05 m06 and m14 their boxes stand above the initial value of 0 05 equal weight which indicates that they are deemed more useful for most catchments for the famine catchment model m06 is attributed the highest weight this corresponds to the outlier for m06 shown on fig 6 in contrast some other models are deemed less useful for all catchments since even their maximum weight is less than 0 05 e g m03 m04 and m08 this situation is also illustrated by fig 7 where all rectangles corresponding to these models are very small besides the width of each box informs on the spread of weights on different catchments a wider box implies that it might contribute more on some catchments and less on others for instance the m13 box is the widest which reflects a usefulness that varies greatly among the different catchments and the difficulty to identify universal weights in fig 8 the accuracies of raw and post processed forecasts are compared for the median performing catchment eaton in terms of mcrps values the horizontal axis distinguishes between rawcal i e y 1 sim o b s y 2 sim o b s y n 30 sim o b s rawval i e y 31 sim o b s y 32 sim o b s y n sim o b s bmacal i e bma weights in calibration bmaval i e bma weights in validation kge values are slightly higher 1 4 compared to raw simulations and then increased by 9 3 over the validation interval showing that bma improved the model performance besides the mcrps decreased separately by 9 0 in calibration and by 9 7 in validation compared to raw simulations this confirms that the bma improved the simulation performance on both calibration and validation periods the square root of average ensemble variance ssp bmaval equals 1 179 which is close to ssp val 1 173 and demonstrates that ensemble reliability was well maintained fig 9 shows the overall reliability of competing raw simulations and bma results where dotted curves belong to individual catchments raw simulations show under dispersion in varying degrees depending on the catchment simulations that were post processed with bma display improved reliability turning out closer to the bisector line the predictive qq plots displayed in fig 10 also demonstrate the superiority of the simulations post processed using bma curves are closer to the diagonal line confirming that bma makes simulations more reliable in addition with decreasing α from 0 071 to 0 055 and increasing ξ from 0 992 to 0 996 the improvement of reliability through bma is further confirmed as mentioned above rank polar diagrams allow the interpretation of partial reliability for different discharge frequency intervals in this study the intervals were set to 10 uniform bins in a descending order fig 11 shows that bma improves not only the overall reliability fig 9 but also the partial reliability over different streamflow intervals however there still exist some over dispersive forecasts in the larger streamflow intervals yellow fan area 10 and 20 intervals because of the insufficient amount of data in theses intervals with very few simulation observation pairs in calibration the determination of model weights using the em algorithm or any algorithm is more uncertain 4 2 bma and structural uncertainty system c table 1 is the most reliable and skillful heps from the previous study thiboult et al 2016 owing to the simultaneous consideration of three sources of uncertainty structural initial condition and meteorological in comparison with system c multimodel hepss of a and b table 1 are more practical with lighter computational requirements for that reason operational forecasting systems often resemble systems a and b therefore we identified system c as target in testing whether the bma could improve forecasts performance group 1 to the same good level bma was firstly implemented on system a fig 12 compares the kge mcrps and spread of the multimodel ensemble issued from hepss a b c bmaa and bmab i e bma applied to system a and b colored boxes display the range of values for performance metrics over all catchments group 1 system c is deemed superior to system a as it considers the initial condition uncertainty using a 50 member enkf data assimilation procedure the overall performance of all three systems is very similar except for spread indeed system bmaa exhibits a larger spread than the other two systems for the 1 day lead time system c also has a larger spread than system a which is expected since system c accounts for initial condition uncertainty while system a does not the improvement of forecast performance of system b is at a similar pace except for the spread the fact that the spread of system b decreases fast with lead time is not surprising since the influence of data assimilation with enkf fades away rapidly target system c with smaller mcrps and larger ensemble spread that accounts for the 50 member probabilistic meteorological forecasts its predictive skill is better than system b bma applied to system b compensates the large differences in spread between system b and target system c over all forecast horizons substantial differences exist in terms of reliability between multimodel heps a b c bmaa and bmab fig 13 shows the superiority of bmaa and bmab in improving forecasts reliability indeed the curves for system bmaa are closer to the diagonal compared to systems a and c slight under forecasting i e forecast probabilities that are too low compared to the observed frequencies exists on some catchments for the shorter lead times however bmaa tends to provide more reliable forecasts with spread increasing for medium range forecasts 6 day and 9 day ahead as for system b previous research revealed that raw meps forcing was unable to fully balance the decrease in spread caused by the effect of data assimilation fading away with lead time thiboult et al 2016 the increasing bias and diminishing ensemble spread fig 12 accordingly lead to the deterioration of the reliability of both system b and c fig 13 however bma does not only compensate for the lack of diversity in the raw ensemble that does not include meps forcing system b but also improves over system c for medium range forecasts this result is attributable to the fact that the accuracy of meteorological forecasts also decreases with lead time predictive qq plots for multimodel hepss a b c bmaa and bmab in fig 14 point out to the same conclusions for 3 day ahead forecasts the curves in both system a and target system c lies below the diagonal first and then goes up the bisector subsequently showing that the ensemble forecasts have a narrow distribution moreover for longer lead times i e 9 day ahead the verification indices α decreases from 0 126 to 0 094 and ξ increases from 0 942 to 0 967 table 4 recall that α 0 and ξ 1 represent the case where forecasts are perfectly reliable the predictive qq curves of systems b and c also demonstrate narrow probabilistic forecast dispersion in addition the curves obtained for the bma post processed forecasts come out along the diagonal with more reliable indices α 0 087 and ξ 0 957 table 4 4 3 improvements of hydrological forecasts based on locally biased and unreliable meteorological forecasts buizza et al 2005 pointed out that meteorological ensemble predictions mepss typically tend to display underdispersion at least up to the seasonal range underdispersive ensemble forecasts might accordingly underestimate the probability of extreme events in hepss and lead end users to take suboptimal decisions fortin et al 2014 thiboult et al 2016 indicated that the enkf could not fully compensate for lower heps dispersion moreover the dispersion added by enkf at the onset of forecasts decreases rapidly with longer forecast horizons based on the above mentioned catchment separation in two groups bma was conducted on group 1 in order to test whether it could enhance the forecast performance values to the same good level as group 2 fig 15 display the accuracy and reliability of multimodel hepss with 50 member enkf and 50 member ensemble meteorological forcing in each group of catchments i e c 1 and c 2 and bma scheme applied to system c 1 i e bmac 1 the main difference between systems of c 1 and c 2 is weather the meteorology ensemble forcing is biased or not after post processing the forecast skill is well maintained especially for the ensemble dispersion fig 15 moreover bma also prevents the reliability to fade with longer horizons fig 16 the narrow probabilistic forecast dispersions were adjusted through bma and the resulting curves lie along the bisector the narrow probabilistic forecast dispersions revealed by the predictive qq plots of system c fig 17 were adjusted through bma and the resulting curves lie along the bisector in addition the verifying indices of decreased α and increased ξ table 4 also confirm that bma i e bmac 1 can even improve the original target system c 1 to the same good level as system c 2 5 conclusion seeking more accurate and reliable hydrological forecasts as much as sources of uncertainties cascaded through the meteorological hydrological forecast chain has been the recent focus of many operational agencies among all the probabilistic tools i e multimodel enkf meteorological ensemble forcing the structural error inherent to any single hydrological model remains unavoidable this is because the respective contribution of different models also depends on the characteristics of each specific catchment this work illustrates how bma can be implemented to generate model weights based on the likelihood of probabilistic predictions being correct given the observed values bma successfully improves over raw multimode forecasts especially for horizons between 6 to 9 day ahead some researchers provided evidence that multimodel ensemble forecasts performance relies on the skills of individual members many authors preferred to select a sub collection of models with high performance to build multimodel ensembles e g wang and overland 2012 chen et al 2015 thiboult et al 2016 also found that a simply pooled multimodel ensemble could partially improve forecast performance by accounting for structural uncertainty however the simply pooled ensemble of thiboult et al 2016 failed in maintaining forecasts reliability with lead time in this study all 20 models are involved in the bma implementation based on their separate individual contribution the results show that bma can compensate for lack of reliability in raw multimodel hepss which are exposed to the decreasing effect of data assimilation and possibly biased meteorological forecasts results show that bma can compensate for a lack of reliability in raw multimodel hepss which are exposed to the decreasing effect of data assimilation and possibly biased meteorological forecasts this result is attributable to the fact that the accuracy of meteorological forecasts and the effect of data assimilation fades away as forecasting horizon extends verification indices α and ξ for predictive distributions of each system table 4 confirm this finding for instance the curves of bma post processed forecasts i e bmaa and bmab are superior to not only the original systems of a and b but also to reference system c with higher α and larger ξ as lead time goes on moreover decreased α and increased ξ also reveal that bma i e bmac 1 can even improve the original target system c 1 to the same good level as system c 2 systems a and b are closer to typical forecasting systems utilized in operational centers worldwide reference system c is deemed superior to system a and b by accounting on all three major uncertainty sources along the hydrometeorological modeling chain the convenience of applying the bma method which only requires low computing time provides users with more flexible forecasting tools i e multimodel enkf and meteorological ensemble forcing to choose from when building a multimodel heps results herein demonstrate the ability of bma to increase forecast performance and reliability even for hepss that only include partial sources of uncertainties after post processing using bma those multimodel systems become as good as a concurrent system here system c using all forecasting tools jointly 6 author contribution statement jing xu françois anctil and marie amélie boucher designed the theoretical formalism jing xu performed the analytic

6130,hydrological simulations and forecasts are subject to various sources of uncertainties thiboult et al 2016 constructed a 50 000 member great ensemble that ultimately accounts for meteorological forcing uncertainty initial condition uncertainty and structural uncertainty this large 50 000 member ensemble can also be separated into sub components to untangle the three main sources of uncertainties mentioned above however in thiboult et al 2016 model outputs were simply pooled together considering equiprobable members this paper studies the use of bayesian model averaging bma to post process multimodel hydrological forecasts bma assigns multiple sets of weights on different models and may then generate more skillful and reliable probabilistic forecasts bma weights explicitly quantify the level of confidence one can have regarding each candidate hydrological model and lead to a predictive probabilistic density function pdf containing information about uncertainty the bma scheme improves the overall quality of forecasts mainly by maintaining the ensemble dispersion with the lead time it also has the ability to improve the reliability and skill of multimodel systems that only include two sources of uncertainties that the 50 000 member great ensemble using all forecasting tools i e multimodel enkf and meteorological ensemble forcing could predict jointly furthermore thiboult et al 2016 showed that the meteorological forecasts they used were somehow biased and unreliable on some catchments the bma scheme is capable to improve the accuracy and reliability of the hydrological forecasts in that case as well keywords hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts uncertainty hydrological post processing bayesian model averaging bma 1 introduction uncertainty in hydrometeorological forecasting systems mainly stems from three cascade sources 1 the earth s chaotic atmosphere makes forecasting unreliable at extended lead times 2 hydrological land surface conditions are highly variable spatially 3 hydrological models are approximations with varying forecast skill in representing water circulation processes therefore reliable and skillful hydrological forecasts are based on our best understanding of the interactions between the atmosphere and the land surface keane et al 2002 of the hydrological initial conditions and of the hydrological model parameters and inherent structure liu and gupta 2007 pointed out that different sources of uncertainty need specific tools to be deciphered efficiently over the past decades there have been substantial efforts to reduce uncertainty and improve hydrological forecasts to date rather than issuing a single deterministic forecast a growing chorus of voices is sounding that ensemble prediction systems eps are advanced tools to quantify the propagation of uncertainty in the form of probabilistic density functions palmer 2002 eps is way more skillful and reliable than current operational deterministic prediction systems that are devoid of uncertainty information especially for larger events for example boucher et al 2011 compared probabilistic and deterministic hydrological forecasts in an operational water resources management context and confirmed the superiority of the ensembles in order to better decipher meteorological forcing uncertainty meteorological ensemble prediction systems mepss were operated pioneerly in the 1990s by for example the european centre for medium range weather forecasts buizza and palmer 1995 palmer 1993 buizza 2005 the national center for environmental prediction toth and kalnay 1997 and the canadian meteorological center houtekamer et al 1996 the idea was to run a numerical weather prediction model given slightly different initial conditions that depict the chaotic nature of the atmosphere hydrological ensemble prediction systems hepss followed up promoted by the availability of meteorological ensemble products e g schaake et al 2007 cloke and pappenberger 2009 velázquez et al 2009 brochero et al 2012 boucher et al 2011 abaza et al 2017 given uncertainties in the hydrological initial conditions various sequential data assimilation approaches have been proposed to account for them for instance the ensemble kalman filter enkf e g evensen 1994 evensen et al 1994 reichle et al 2002 weerts and el serafy 2006 clark et al 2008a b mcmillan et al 2013 and the particle filter e g moradkhani et al 2012 thirel et al 2013 allow quantification and reduction of the initial conditions uncertainty however the enkf cannot alone maintain reliability with extended lead times since state variables uncertainty does not propagate much after the model spin up so the benefit of the enkf fades away with longer forecast horizons thiboult et al 2016 marty et al 2015 asserted that ensemble forecasting systems fail in considering model structural uncertainty if perturbations are only imposed on the initial and boundary conditions and parameters thus far a tremendous amount of hydrological models have been brought forward and developed for quantifying the spatiotemporal variations of streamflow fisher et al 2008 leuning et al 2008 yuan et al 2010 they attempt to capture the dominant processes in a catchmentto predictriverflows mockler et al 2016 however no hydrological model in existence today can convincingly claim that it is systematically superior to the others for all types of applications and under all conditions duan et al 2007 each one has specific strengths in capturing hydrological processes not to mention that in many cases model parametric uncertainties exist despite that numerous model calibration techniques e g multi parameter ensemble sets were examined and improved beven and binley 1992 vrugt et al 2003 mcenery et al 2005 researchers pointed out that the structural error inherent in any single model is unavoidable in this kind of ensemble strategy gourley and vieux 2006 clark et al 2008a poulin et al 2011 clark 2008b proposed a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures the framework for understanding structural errors fuse pooling a number of model predictions according to different weighting strategies has often proved efficient improving hydrological forecasts hagedorn et al 2005 raftery et al 2005 candille 2009 thiboult et al 2016 documented that the multimodel approach was also capable to partially compensate for the enkf decreasing effect by accounting for model structural uncertainties multimodel hepss may be exposed to some other uncertainty underestimation partly owing to the locally biased meteorological forecasts and partly because as already mentioned of the fading out of data assimilation with extended forecast horizons various hydrological statistical post processing approaches e g li et al 2017 have thus been developed as a necessary complementary element to the forecasting chain to compensate or treat uncertainties from outputs propagated from upstream sources examples of post processing methods include bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 wilson et al 2007 duan et al 2007 bayesian processor of ensemble marty et al 2015 the best member approach di narzo and cocchi 2016 kernel dressing methods roulston and smith 2003 fortin et al 2006 and general linear model post processor zhao et al 2011 ye et al 2014 hoeting et al 1999 pioneered the bayesian model averaging bma method using a finite mixture of probability density functions issued from different models or forecasts to represent the predictive distribution of the variable of interest bma estimates can provide a sharper and more reliable probability density function pdf for the probabilistic predictions when the weights have been determined by how well each member fits the training data for hydrological forecasts post processing bma has been substantiated as a more effective and efficient approach to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts when compared to the single best model or other multimodel ensemble methods ellison 2004 duan et al 2007 najafi et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 the main difficulty with bma in most of the above mentioned applications is that it always simplifies the ensemble forecast through a statistic of lower dimensionality the ensemble mean and therefore loses the information provided by the shape of the empirical distribution of the ensemble members whitaker and loughe 1998 marty et al 2015 the present study focuses on a multiple hydrological model application which turns out to be a more proper use of bma this is achieved by using the forecasts issued from a multimodel scheme composed of 20 lumped models implemented in the southern portion of the province of québec canada thiboult et al 2016 in addition the available hydrological ensemble prediction system heps allows the use of meteorological ensemble forcings and ensemble kalman filter enkf streamflow assimilation used either individually or together in producing the daily streamflow ensembles the enkf is employed to decipher the initial condition uncertainty the meteorological ensemble to account for the forcing uncertainty and the multimodel scheme to quantify the model structure error explicitly in practice however the higher technical requirements of a more accurate and reliable heps that contains all three forecasting tools restrict its application therefore we are interested in evaluating the capacity of bma as a post processing approach in improving the forecast skill of a heps that lacks one source of uncertainty e g forcing uncertainty initial condition uncertainty in comparison to ensembles issued exploiting all of the available forecasting tools improvements are also assessed using locally biased less reliable meteorological forecasts the hypothesis we want to verify is that an advanced multimodel ensemble that includes a rational post processing method will outperform the simply pooled ensemble prediction the final output of our bma implementation is a weighted mixture of gamma distributions the shape and scale parameters of each distribution forming this mixture are fitted daily to the hydrological streamflow predictions from each model this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the hydrometeorological data catchments clarification and hydrological models in section 3 we detail the methodology including the moving window scheme and the verification scores for assessing forecasts performance and reliability results of bma estimates based on different heps configurations and groups of catchments are gathered and discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 data 2 1 meteorological and hydrological data the hydrometeorological data used in this work were generated by thiboult et al 2016 who constructed 50 000 member ensembles that propose a comprehensive hydrometeorological forecasting framework one advantage of this database is that it could be divided up into simpler hepss table 1 by activating or not the following three forecasting tools multimodel ensemble pooling 20 conceptual lumped hydrological models ensemble kalman filter 50 member enkf and ensemble meteorological forcings 50 weather forecast members however in thiboult et al 2016 the model outputs were simply pooled together in order to account for the three sources of uncertainty table 1 details a partial selection of thiboult s previous systems as only systems based on multiple models was deemed within the research scope of this study three hepss investigated here were established by using three different probabilistic tools i e meteorological ensemble forcing enkf and multimodel scheme conjointly or alternatively as the reference heps system c activates all abovementioned forecasting tools and represents the enkf multimodel ensemble with meps forcing and input output perturbations by deactivating the enkf system a or the weather ensemble forcing system b simpler hepss are also studied to reveal the capacity of bma for compensating the forecast performance and reliability of a heps that lacks one source of uncertainty compared with the reference system the observed daily total precipitation minimum and maximum temperature and streamflow are from the direction de l expertise hydrique du québec dehq and extend from 1990 to 2010 the meteorological ensemble forecasts were retrieved from the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge database the 50 exchangeable members of precipitation and temperature with 6 hour time step and 10 day ahead forecasting horizon are from ecmwf fraley et al 2010 in addition the weather forecasts used in the previous research thiboult et al 2016 were aggregated at a daily time step starting at 06 00 est 12 00 utc and reduced to 9 days ahead the horizontal resolution of the meteorological forecasts was downscaled from 0 5 to 0 1 during data retrieval using bilinear interpolation gaborit et al 2012 to make forecasts more suitable for hydrological applications as for the streamflow database three periods are used 1990 2000 is committed to the model calibration october 2005 october 2008 to the hydrological model spin up and november 2008 december 2010 to the hydrological forecast assessment as shown in the average monthly hydrograph fig 1 these river systems are mainly active in the spring from march to may and to a lesser degree in autumn from september to november in this study streamflow simulations and 9 day ahead forecasts are available for each of the 20 lumped conceptual hydrological models detailed in table 2 as explained later section 3 2 simulations are very useful for attributing a weight to each model model selection is from perrin 2000 and seiller et al 2012 based on conceptual and structural diversity thiboult and anctil 2015 pointed out that these models perform better and are more competitive when combined or pooled together for a more detailed description of the properties and processes of the ensemble meteorological data multiple hydrological models and data assimilation readers are referred to thiboult et al 2016 2 2 catchments the available database includes 38 catchments located in the south of the province of québec canada fig 2 experiencing a mixed hydrological regime with a strong spring freshet since we seek to explore bma skill the very first thing we need to do is to clarify which catchment still has some room for improvement as our target catchment based on reference system c the specific forecast quality of each catchment was checked fig 3 reliability diagrams of all 38 catchments available in this study are divided into two groups specific description about reliability diagram may refer to section 3 3 within this article pre verification results show that with increasing lead times the reliability and performance of group 1 blue in fig 2 fades away fairly rapidly with time goes on while the qualities were well maintained in group 2 pink in fig 2 which implies the upstream three forecasting tools was more successful for group 2 catchments it is suspected that the meteorological forecasts are largely responsible for the lesser performance of group 1 catchments for two main reasons first some catchments of group 1 are quite small and distant from ecmwf grid points before downscaling second the presence of an inherent local bias within the meteorological ensemble forcing resulting in the south north contrast depicted in fig 2 therefore the accuracy and reliability of the hydrological forecasts of group 1 are still in need to be improved through post processing de facto identifying the catchments on which the study will focus more in depth table 3 3 methodology 3 1 bayesian model averaging bma bma is used in this study as a post processor for hydrological forecasts issued from a multimodel heps it assigns credibility to each candidate hydrological model and infers more reliable and skillful predictions bma provides a weighting strategy via a predictive probabilistic density function pdf that accounts for the relative performance of each available model the database is structured around dimensions of time t and model k and includes both simulations and forecasts assume that y is the target forecast variable here streamflow and that y t obs y 1 obs y 2 obs y t obs groups historical observed streamflows over time period t 1 t similarly x t sim x 1 t sim x 2 t sim x k t sim x k t sim and x t fcst x 1 t fcst x 2 t fcst x k t fcst x k t fcst consist respectively in the simulation and forecasts composed of k hydrological models for instance our hydrological ensemble prediction system may produce 2 500 ensemble members per model daily the pdf of the predictand y can then be expressed on the law of total probability 1 p y t x t sim k 1 k p y t m m k x t sim p m m k x t sim where m m k means that model m k is assumed correct for each valid time and p m m k x t sim indicates the predictive distribution of y given the model m k and ensemble members x t sim the weight w k p m m k x t sim with k 1 k w k 1 reflects the relative predictive contribution of the kth model within the training period t therefore eq 1 can be also expressed as 2 p y t x t sim k 1 k w k p y t m m k x t sim it is very important to stress that the original idea behind bma is the weighting and combining of models rather than individual ensemble members the result of bma is thus necessarily a weighted sum of pdf however in the recent literature several authors mention using bma where in reality they are applying a weighted average on forecast members e g duan et al 2007 rathinasamy et al 2013 in such cases since x k reduces to a single realization p y t m m k x t sim cannot be deduced from the ensemble members from each model a distribution typically a gaussian is rather fitted around each deterministic ensemble member using a chosen possibly calibrated mean and standard deviation in this paper we estimate p y t m m k x t sim by fitting a gamma distribution on the ensemble members from each of the 20 hydrological models this gamma distribution is defined by the shape parameter α k and scale parameter β k 3 p k t y t m m k x t sim g k t y t m m k α k t β k t 1 β k t α k t γ α k t y t α k t 1 exp y t β k t y t 0 the next step consists in inferring the bma weights w 1 w 2 w 20 and parameters θ α 1 β 1 α 2 β 2 α k β k in this study we employ the classic expectation maximization algorithm em dempster et al 1977 to maximize the log likelihood function l given here by 4 l w θ x t sim t 1 t l o g k 1 k w k t 1 β k t α k t γ α k t y t α k t 1 exp y t β k t this allows inferring the weights that best represent the credibility one should attribute to each of the 20 models 3 2 moving window scheme a moving window is implemented for calculating bma weights on a number of simulation observation pairs these weights are next applied to the next forecast observation pair to assess the forecast improvement after bma after various tests a moving window consisting of the previous 30 days was found an acceptable compromise between providing enough information to the bma to perform up to expectations while resorting to an implementation that is flexible to temporal changes in the database fig 4 the first concern is that over fitting might arise if the window length is too short secondly a monthly moving window may help us exploring the underlying specific and seasonal variational roles of each model among the 20 competing ones last but not least for practical purposes a 30 day length is more coherent and efficient in the real world with limited length for time series fig 4 illustrates the main flowchart of this study according to two dimensions containing time t and model k at time t for instance observed meteorological values p t t t 1 t 29 obs ε and t t t 1 t 29 obs ε with added precipitation and temperature perturbations ε and initial state variables θ t t 1 t 29 initial are used to drive the kth model to obtain the simulated streamflow x k t t 1 t 29 sim and the predicted state variable θ k t 30 pred for time t 30 the weight w k t 30 for the kth model is obtained by applying the em algorithm on this 30 day period meanwhile enkf is also conducted using the historical observed streamflows y t 30 obs ε for day t 30 to update the state variable θ k t 30 update meteorological ensemble forecasts p t t 29 δ t fcst and t t 29 δ t fcst with lead time δ t 1 2 9 updated state variable θ k t 30 update and bma weights w k t 30 k 1 2 20 are all used in forecast mode to generate the forecast streamflows x k t 29 δ t fcst k 1 2 20 δ t 1 2 9 3 3 statistical analysis ensemble forecasts are usually transformed into categorical forecasts or probability forecasts before assessing their performance eight verification metrics are used in this study for evaluating the performance of bma mostly in terms of accuracy and reliability it includes some common deterministic based metrics gupta et al 2009 proposed the kling gupta efficiency kge for evaluating model performance comprehensively kge was slightly modified later by kling et al 2012 i e marked as kge to avoid a cross correlation between the bias and variability ratios it can be used for the assessment of deterministic forecasts and is given by equations below 5 kg e r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 6 β μ y μ o 7 γ cv y cv o σ y μ y σ o μ o here r the correlation coefficient reflects the linear association between forecasts here the ensemble mean and observations μ y μ o and σ y σ o are the mean and the standard deviations of the deterministic forecasts observations time series cv is the coefficient of variation dimensionless the continuous ranked probability score crps matheson and winkler 1976 hersbach 2000 gneiting and raftery 2007 is used widely for verifying both the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic forecasts the mean continuous ranked probability score mcrps calculated as the average crps over the dataset is employed with series length t 8 mcprs 1 t t 1 t p t fcst y h y t y t obs 2 d y where y represents the predicted variable p t fcst y is the cumulative distribution function of the forecasts at time t and y t obs is the corresponding observations heaviside function h equals 0 when y t y t obs and h equals 1 when y t y t obs the perfect value of mcrps is 0 and in this study the spread skill plot ssp fortin et al 2014 compares the root mean square error of the ensemble mean and the square root of the average ensemble variance the spread the ssp can be used for assessing the reliability of an ensemble prediction system considering both bias and spread additional graphical verification insights about reliability can be gained from the reliability diagram predictive quantile quantile plot and the rank polar diagram as well the reliability diagram is conditioned on the forecasts it plots the observed frequency against the forecast probability where the range of forecast probabilities is divided into separate bins for instance 0 5 5 15 15 25 etc the reliability diagram may tell us how well the predicted probabilities of different events correspond to their observed frequencies reliability is indicated by the proximity of the plotted curve to the diagonal the deviation from the diagonal gives the conditional bias if the curve comes out below the line this indicates over forecasting points above the line indicate under forecasting the flatter the curve in the reliability diagram the less resolution it has climatology does not discriminate at all between events and non events and thus has no resolution the predictive quantile quantile plot is also used to verify whether the predictive distributions follow the same distribution as observations laio and tamea 2007 thyer et al 2009 biondi and de luca 2013 the horizontal axis represents the correct probabilistic forecast of realization o i i 1 2 n while the vertical axis denotes the empirical cumulative distribution r i n where n is the number and r i is the i th theoretical probability of realization moreover renard et al 2010 have proposed two indices to evaluate the degree of the departure from the diagonal line 9 α 1 n i 1 n p i r i n 10 ξ 1 1 n i 1 n β 11 β 1 1 i f z i 0 o r z i 1 0 otherwise here α represents the area between the qq curve and the bisector and varies between 0 5 and 0 with the perfect score α 1 the other index ξ quantifies the reliability through calculating the complement of the fraction of z i values equal to 0 or 1 ξ varies between 0 and 1 with the perfect condition ξ 1 the rank polar diagram rpolar diagram xu et al 2017 is an extension of the conventional rank histogram hamill 2001 wilks 2011 to verify whether the observed probability distribution is well represented by the ensembles hamill 2001 pointed out that the ensemble forecast that was reliable at each point would generate a uniform rank histogram however a flat rank histogram nevertheless could be generated from unreliable ensembles therefore xu et al 2017 proposed a modified criterion of rpolar diagram which was not only able to verify the overall reliability but also the partial reliability over different forecast intervals according to users specific preference or uniform intervals fig 5 demonstrates the schematic diagram of the rank polar diagram based on a synthetic ensemble with 25 members and 100 000 time steps observations are sampled from gaussian distributions n μ i σ i i 1 2 10 where μ i and σ i represent the mean and standard deviation of the ith quantile they can be divided into 10 quantiles 10 100 in descending order with black labels represented by the dashed radial lines in fig 5 the corresponding synthetic forecasts are 25 random ensemble values sampled from n μ i δ μ i σ i δ σ i with perturbations δ μ i and δ σ i and they are represented as the numbers on the external circle frequencies are indicated by the dashed circles with different percentages 5 10 with grey labels and the root mean square error rmsei eq 12 values for each quantile are marked by the blue x marks 12 rmse i 100 1 m 1 j 1 m 1 r j 1 m 1 2 where i represents the sequence number of the observational frequency interval m is the number of ensemble members and j represents the index for ensemble members r j represents the rank values of each ensemble member in the corresponding intervals besides in each quantile the values which are larger than 1 m 1 are colored red while the values which are less than 1 m 1 are colored cyan the red circle demonstrates the perfect rank with a radius value of 1 m 1 and the yellow fan area represents the highest discharge interval fig 5 shows an example of the use of the rpolar diagram for five different sets of synthetic ensemble forecasts the first one is perfectly reliable and is represented in the quantiles 90 and 100 the other four types are unreliable and represented in the other eight quantiles those synthetic forecasts were generated by adjusting δ μ i and δ σ i for reliable forecasts all the ranks lie close to the red circle i e perfect ranking the first and second quantiles with black labels of 90 and 100 in fig 5 show the case of δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 when both observations and forecasts are generated from the same distribution as for the other eight quantiles the u shaped rpolar diagram shows up in the 1st and 2nd quantiles black labels of 10 and 20 with δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 lack of variability the dome shaped rpolar diagram in the 3rd and 4th quantiles reveals an excess of variability with δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 in addition the under forecasting situation is depicted in the 5th and 6th quantiles with δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 and the over forecasting situation δ μ i 0 and δ σ i 0 shows up in the 7th and 8th quantiles a detailed description of the rpolar diagram s concepts and applications can be found in xu et al 2017 4 results as introduced earlier one objective of this study is to discriminate the relative level of confidence one can attribute to each hydrological model in a multimodel forecasting setup for different catchments this relative level of confidence translates into bma model weights ultimately we want to verify the hypothesis mentioned in the introduction according to which an advanced multimodel ensemble that includes bma would outperform simply pooled ensembles in short we want to test whether bma could help developing more skillful and reliable multimodel probabilistic hydrological predictions two aspects are mainly perceived 1 different hepss according to three forecasting tools multiple hydrological models ensemble kalman filter enkf and ensemble meteorological forcing are available to the project and present various levels of forecasting quality therefore whether bma could improve the forecast performance of different systems to the same good level is deemed worthy of investigation 2 because of the inherent local bias in the meteorological ensemble forecasts on some catchments the heps performance varies from one catchment to the other consequently bma was firstly applied to group 1 that displays lower initial performance values this will allow to test whether bma can improve forecasts performance to the same good level that is observed for the other group of catchments group 2 4 1 bma calibration and validation the database we had access to contains ensemble forecasts and simulations for each hydrological model since bma attributes weights to models not members we propose to calibrate those weights through model simulations and to apply them next on the forecasts forecasts for each model include several members that are equiprobable and correspond to different meteorological members therefore the weight attributed to a model must be divided by the number of members per model bma was first implemented on group 1 simulation observation pairs using a 30 day moving window evolving daily i e y 1 sim o b s y 2 sim o b s y 30 sim o b s as the first calibration window fig 4 validation was performed on the pair of simulated and observed streamflows that immediately follows the moving window i e y 31 sim o b s since both calibration and validation were conducted on simulations from the 20 models pooled together the structural uncertainty of each hydrological model is assumed to be reflected explicitly the weights that were obtained are displayed in figs 6 and 7 figs 6 and 7 should be interpreted together for exploring the variations in the contribution of each hydrological model in different catchments all the information about model simulations was initially gathered in 15 a catchments 20 models 730 30 day windows the final weight for each model was calculated by averaging over the whole time series therefore especially in fig 7 the summation of the 20 weights per catchment may not necessarily be equal to one in this study all 20 models are utilized jointly no subsets of models are explored actually bma weights shown next inform that they all contribute fig 6 shows the boxplot of the bma weights of all catchments per hydrological model some models are preferred among the 20 competing models with higher weights e g m05 m06 and m14 their boxes stand above the initial value of 0 05 equal weight which indicates that they are deemed more useful for most catchments for the famine catchment model m06 is attributed the highest weight this corresponds to the outlier for m06 shown on fig 6 in contrast some other models are deemed less useful for all catchments since even their maximum weight is less than 0 05 e g m03 m04 and m08 this situation is also illustrated by fig 7 where all rectangles corresponding to these models are very small besides the width of each box informs on the spread of weights on different catchments a wider box implies that it might contribute more on some catchments and less on others for instance the m13 box is the widest which reflects a usefulness that varies greatly among the different catchments and the difficulty to identify universal weights in fig 8 the accuracies of raw and post processed forecasts are compared for the median performing catchment eaton in terms of mcrps values the horizontal axis distinguishes between rawcal i e y 1 sim o

compared to raw simulations and then increased by 9 3 over the validation interval showing that bma improved the model performance besides the mcrps decreased separately by 9 0 in calibration and by 9 7 in validation compared to raw simulations this confirms that the bma improved the simulation performance on both calibration and validation periods the square root of average ensemble variance ssp bmaval equals 1 179 which is close to ssp val 1 173 and demonstrates that ensemble reliability was well maintained fig 9 shows the overall reliability of competing raw simulations and bma results where dotted curves belong to individual catchments raw simulations show under dispersion in varying degrees depending on the catchment simulations that were post processed with bma display improved reliability turning out closer to the bisector line the predictive qq plots displayed in fig 10 also demonstrate the superiority of the simulations post processed using bma curves are closer to the diagonal line confirming that bma makes simulations more reliable in addition with decreasing α from 0 071 to 0 055 and increasing ξ from 0 992 to 0 996 the improvement of reliability through bma is further confirmed as mentioned above rank polar diagrams allow the interpretation of partial reliability for different discharge frequency intervals in this study the intervals were set to 10 uniform bins in a descending order fig 11 shows that bma improves not only the overall reliability fig 9 but also the partial reliability over different streamflow intervals however there still exist some over dispersive forecasts in the larger streamflow intervals yellow fan area 10 and 20 intervals because of the insufficient amount of data in theses intervals with very few simulation observation pairs in calibration the determination of model weights using the em algorithm or any algorithm is more uncertain 4 2 bma and structural uncertainty system c table 1 is the most reliable and skillful heps from the previous study thiboult et al 2016 owing to the simultaneous consideration of three sources of uncertainty structural initial condition and meteorological in comparison with system c multimodel hepss of a and b table 1 are more practical with lighter computational requirements for that reason operational forecasting systems often resemble systems a and b therefore we identified system c as target in testing whether the bma could improve forecasts performance group 1 to the same good level bma was firstly implemented on system a fig 12 compares the kge mcrps and spread of the multimodel ensemble issued from hepss a b c bmaa and bmab i e bma applied to system a and b colored boxes display the range of values for performance metrics over all catchments group 1 system c is deemed superior to system a as it considers the initial condition uncertainty using a 50 member enkf data assimilation procedure the overall performance of all three systems is very similar except for spread indeed system bmaa exhibits a larger spread than the other two systems for the 1 day lead time system c also has a larger spread than system a which is expected since system c accounts for initial condition uncertainty while system a does not the improvement of forecast performance of system b is at a similar pace except for the spread the fact that the spread of system b decreases fast with lead time is not surprising since the influence of data assimilation with enkf fades away rapidly target system c with smaller mcrps and larger ensemble spread that accounts for the 50 member probabilistic meteorological forecasts its predictive skill is better than system b bma applied to system b compensates the large differences in spread between system b and target system c over all forecast horizons substantial differences exist in terms of reliability between multimodel heps a b c bmaa and bmab fig 13 shows the superiority of bmaa and bmab in improving forecasts reliability indeed the curves for system bmaa are closer to the diagonal compared to systems a and c slight under forecasting i e forecast probabilities that are too low compared to the observed frequencies exists on some catchments for the shorter lead times however bmaa tends to provide more reliable forecasts with spread increasing for medium range forecasts 6 day and 9 day ahead as for system b previous research revealed that raw meps forcing was unable to fully balance the decrease in spread caused by the effect of data assimilation fading away with lead time thiboult et al 2016 the increasing bias and diminishing ensemble spread fig 12 accordingly lead to the deterioration of the reliability of both system b and c fig 13 however bma does not only compensate for the lack of diversity in the raw ensemble that does not include meps forcing system b but also improves over system c for medium range forecasts this result is attributable to the fact that the accuracy of meteorological forecasts also decreases with lead time predictive qq plots for multimodel hepss a b c bmaa and bmab in fig 14 point out to the same conclusions for 3 day ahead forecasts the curves in both system a and target system c lies below the diagonal first and then goes up the bisector subsequently showing that the ensemble forecasts have a narrow distribution moreover for longer lead times i e 9 day ahead the verification indices α decreases from 0 126 to 0 094 and ξ increases from 0 942 to 0 967 table 4 recall that α 0 and ξ 1 represent the case where forecasts are perfectly reliable the predictive qq curves of systems b and c also demonstrate narrow probabilistic forecast dispersion in addition the curves obtained for the bma post processed forecasts come out along the diagonal with more reliable indices α 0 087 and ξ 0 957 table 4 4 3 improvements of hydrological forecasts based on locally biased and unreliable meteorological forecasts buizza et al 2005 pointed out that meteorological ensemble predictions mepss typically tend to display underdispersion at least up to the seasonal range underdispersive ensemble forecasts might accordingly underestimate the probability of extreme events in hepss and lead end users to take suboptimal decisions fortin et al 2014 thiboult et al 2016 indicated that the enkf could not fully compensate for lower heps dispersion moreover the dispersion added by enkf at the onset of forecasts decreases rapidly with longer forecast horizons based on the above mentioned catchment separation in two groups bma was conducted on group 1 in order to test whether it could enhance the forecast performance values to the same good level as group 2 fig 15 display the accuracy and reliability of multimodel hepss with 50 member enkf and 50 member ensemble meteorological forcing in each group of catchments i e c 1 and c 2 and bma scheme applied to system c 1 i e bmac 1 the main difference between systems of c 1 and c 2 is weather the meteorology ensemble forcing is biased or not after post processing the forecast skill is well maintained especially for the ensemble dispersion fig 15 moreover bma also prevents the reliability to fade with longer horizons fig 16 the narrow probabilistic forecast dispersions were adjusted through bma and the resulting curves lie along the bisector the narrow probabilistic forecast dispersions revealed by the predictive qq plots of system c fig 17 were adjusted through bma and the resulting curves lie along the bisector in addition the verifying indices of decreased α and increased ξ table 4 also confirm that bma i e bmac 1 can even improve the original target system c 1 to the same good level as system c 2 5 conclusion seeking more accurate and reliable hydrological forecasts as much as sources of uncertainties cascaded through the meteorological hydrological forecast chain has been the recent focus of many operational agencies among all the probabilistic tools i e multimodel enkf meteorological ensemble forcing the structural error inherent to any single hydrological model remains unavoidable this is because the respective contribution of different models also depends on the characteristics of each specific catchment this work illustrates how bma can be implemented to generate model weights based on the likelihood of probabilistic predictions being correct given the observed values bma successfully improves over raw multimode forecasts especially for horizons between 6 to 9 day ahead some researchers provided evidence that multimodel ensemble forecasts performance relies on the skills of individual members many authors preferred to select a sub collection of models with high performance to build multimodel ensembles e g wang and overland 2012 chen et al 2015 thiboult et al 2016 also found that a simply pooled multimodel ensemble could partially improve forecast performance by accounting for structural uncertainty however the simply pooled ensemble of thiboult et al 2016 failed in maintaining forecasts reliability with lead time in this study all 20 models are involved in the bma implementation based on their separate individual contribution the results show that bma can compensate for lack of reliability in raw multimodel hepss which are exposed to the decreasing effect of data assimilation and possibly biased meteorological forecasts results show that bma can compensate for a lack of reliability in raw multimodel hepss which are exposed to the decreasing effect of data assimilation and possibly biased meteorological forecasts this result is attributable to the fact that the accuracy of meteorological forecasts and the effect of data assimilation fades away as forecasting horizon extends verification indices α and ξ for predictive distributions of each system table 4 confirm this finding for instance the curves of bma post processed forecasts i e bmaa and bmab are superior to not only the original systems of a and b but also to reference system c with higher α and larger ξ as lead time goes on moreover decreased α and increased ξ also reveal that bma i e bmac 1 can even improve the original target system c 1 to the same good level as system c 2 systems a and b are closer to typical forecasting systems utilized in operational centers worldwide reference system c is deemed superior to system a and b by accounting on all three major uncertainty sources along the hydrometeorological modeling chain the convenience of applying the bma method which only requires low computing time provides users with more flexible forecasting tools i e multimodel enkf and meteorological ensemble forcing to choose from when building a multimodel heps results herein demonstrate the ability of bma to increase forecast performance and reliability even for hepss that only include partial sources of uncertainties after post processing using bma those multimodel systems become as good as a concurrent system here system c using all forecasting tools jointly 6 author contribution statement jing xu françois anctil and marie amélie boucher designed the theoretical formalism jing xu performed the analytic

6131,seasonal lakes that exist in floodplain settings have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes however they are rarely investigated mainly because of the large extent and remoteness of floodplains this study uses physically based hydrodynamic modeling in combination with a bathymetry adjustment approach to investigate the coupling effects of 77 seasonal lakes defined as the seasonal lake group on hydrological behaviors within the poyang lake floodplain system china from a systemic perspective elucidation of the role of seasonal lake groups could benefit from hydrodynamic modeling which enables complex lake floodplain simulations and comparison analyses of natural original bathymetry and hypothetical conditions adjusted bathymetry in the present study the simulation results showed that the temporal influences of the seasonal lake group on water levels lake outflows and inundation dynamics were greater during dry seasons than wet seasons for both the dry 2006 and wet years 2010 the spatial effects of the seasonal lake group on the hydrology of the lake s floodplains were stronger than those of the main lake for both hydrological years the findings demonstrate that the seasonal lakes are likely to have very limited effects on the main lake and the associated flood levels on average the role of the seasonal lake group during the dry seasons was around several times stronger than that during flood seasons in terms of the magnitudes of hydrological responses additionally it is expected that the seasonal lake group may exert an important role in influencing the surface hydrological connectivity and associated dry wet hydrological shift across lake floodplains indicating a dominant role of the floodplain bathymetry changes overall the results of this study will support management and planning of poyang lake and other similar floodplain regions with numerous small shallow and seasonal lakes by providing more reliable information regarding bathymetry changes water management and lake floodplain interactions to decision makers for improved floodplain protection strategy keywords seasonal lake groups hydrodynamic model hydrological behavior bathymetry changes floodplain management poyang lake 1 introduction floodplains are hydrologically dynamic systems characterized by highly complex surface hydrodynamics that are subjected to wide ranging wetting and drying over seasonal timeframes bonnet et al 2008 thomas et al 2015 li et al 2019a it is estimated that there are between 0 8 million and 2 2 million km2 of rivers and lake related floodplains worldwide entwistle et al 2019 floodplains are hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem services that are naturally productive and valuable dudgeon et al 2006 providing a range of hydrological and ecological functions including flood regulation water purification nutrient retention critical wildlife habitats and agriculture and livestock products robinson et al 2015 van der most and hudson 2018 funk et al 2019 however floodplain areas have long been recognized as globally threatened ecosystems that are presently highly sensitive to anthropogenic interventions and climate change karim et al 2015 van der most and hudson 2018 entwistle et al 2019 seasonal lakes are numerous and interconnected but may be typically small in depth and area hayashi and van der kamp 2000 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 they are hydrologically and geomorphologically similar to depressional wetlands maia et al 2018 the formation of these seasonal lakes is caused by variations within floodplain topography which influence hydrological and hydrodynamic processes across floodplains hu et al 2015 seasonal lakes are most likely to play key roles as natural retarding pools that attenuate flood waves and suppress flood peaks in the earth s land surface yamazaki et al 2011 these lakes serve to retain water during the period of flood recession and hold significantly lower water volumes than other large lakes and wetlands accordingly their hydrology and ecology are highly sensitive and respond more rapidly to variations in the surrounding floodplain setting evenson et al 2015 lee et al 2018 li et al 2019a seasonal lakes are considered vital contributors to the overall ecological health of their floodplains and they also have rich natural diversity hu et al 2015 given these backgrounds knowledge of seasonal lakes can substantially aid in the assessment of their hydrological and ecological importance for scientists and managers despite the multiple ecosystem services provided by seasonal lakes they have not been adequately characterized with respect to their hydrological behaviors in addition although many human efforts are made to preserve the conditions of seasonal lakes they still receive less attention than large surface water bodies yu et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge many previous investigations of river and lake floodplain systems focused on either rivers or lakes while the roles of small seasonal lakes within their floodplains on the hydrological behaviors have received little attention the large extent and remoteness of the majority of floodplains across the world have limited the establishment of a dense network of field based monitoring resulting in investigations of individual seasonal lakes being technically difficult and time consuming karim et al 2015 ovando et al 2018 khaki and awange 2019 in recent decades much of the knowledge regarding floodplain lakes and their associated hydrological behaviors has been acquired via application of remote sensing techniques along with in situ observational information trigg et al 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 ovando et al 2018 tan et al 2019 although remote sensing products can be used to completely and properly capture the dynamic evolution of large extent floodplains which can provide important insights into floodplain environments and their assessment alsdorf et al 2010 karim et al 2015 tan et al 2019 the use of static products for complex floodplains may not be adequate to test hypotheses and to analyze various scenarios that can affect floodplain settings li et al 2015b hydrodynamic modeling of floodplain systems is cumbersome but models have become a more widespread approach and are used as an alternative tool for assessing many critical aspects of floodplains such as bathymetry effects trigg et al 2012 yamazaki et al 2012 yao et al 2018 surface connectivity dynamics karim et al 2015 beck et al 2019 and water quality responses li et al 2019a therefore it is important to use hydrodynamic models to obtain an improved understanding of the complex functioning of seasonal lakes in floodplains and quantitative and qualitative information should be provided to support their conservation poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in china creates extensive floodplains that adjoin the main lake feng et al 2012 li et al 2019b the lake and its floodplains are influenced by seasonal dynamic interactions with the surrounding rivers including strong catchment inflows and the yangtze river s effects hu et al 2007 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the most notable feature of the lake floodplain system is that the floodplain behavior varies between that of a long river and a large lake on a seasonal scale zhang and werner 2015 in recent years there has been renewed interest in the floodplain hydrology and associated wetland ecosystem of poyang lake this is mostly because of disturbed fluctuations of the lake water levels zhang et al 2012 mei et al 2016 dynamic lake floodplain interactions li et al 2019a and increasing human activities yang et al 2016 which in combination have greater effects on the floodplain than the main lake in addition the extensive floodplains of poyang lake are more prone to changes in the external environment in a rapid manner due partly to their shallow and wide characteristics li et al 2018b yao et al 2019 the behavior of the poyang lake system is distinct from that of other floodplains in that it has a particularly complex topography and hydrological regime that creates 102 seasonal lakes of varying depth and area ji 2017 li et al 2019a the water quality of the seasonal lakes and their ecological functions for the wetlands are thought to be largely dependent on the hydrological dynamics and the associated lake floodplain exchanges xia et al 2016 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 for example the highly variable hydrological connectivity has recently been recognized as essential to protecting the ecology of the seasonal lakes and their floodplains using field observation data xia et al 2016 in addition field sampling data and hydrodynamic simulations have shown that lateral lake floodplain interactions may contribute to water quality trends of seasonal lakes li et al 2019a there are still however information gaps first although seasonal lake responses in floodplain regions have previously been examined the characteristics and possible influences of seasonal lakes remain unclear from a hydrological perspective second available data are not sufficient to evaluate the effects of seasonal lakes in the lake s floodplains lacking of the knowledge regarding the lake s floodplains response to the current and future floodplain settings in which climate and human interventions are likely to be more frequent and intensive li et al 2016a yao et al 2018 ye et al 2019 an improved understanding of the role of these seasonal lakes is essential for water resource management and lake floodplain planning as well as for understanding how seasonal lakes affect the hydrological processes and subsequent ecological conservation of the lake given the hydrological and ecological importance of small shallow seasonal lakes in the poyang lake floodplains and similar floodplain regions elsewhere the objectives of this study were to 1 use a two dimensional hydrodynamic model to examine hydrological responses of the poyang lake floodplain system for a historical dry and wet year and 2 use modeling in combination with a bathymetry adjustment approach to assess the coupling effects of a seasonal lake group on major hydrological behaviors in the floodplain system the key innovation of this study was the insight into a seasonal lake group on large scale floodplains and the integration of a modeling and hypothetical approach to overcome the limitations of current studies exploring floodplain hydrology in a data limited environment in the next section we provide a detailed description of the study area including climate hydrology and floodplain settings this is followed by details regarding the methods used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the lake floodplains under natural and hypothetical conditions sections 4 and 5 provide the results and discussion respectively major conclusions from this study are summarized in section 6 2 study area 2 1 poyang lake poyang lake is one of the few large lakes in middle reaches of the yangtze river that remains naturally connected to surrounding rivers fig 1 a the lake has high flow channels gently undulating floodplains and bays and islands characterized by irregular shorelines an incised lake morphology and contrasting bathymetric features li et al 2017a it is a topographically and geometrically complex lake that varies from the lake s floodplain regions at elevations of 28 2 m to the flow channels at elevations of about 8 m fig 1a generally 85 of the water depth within poyang lake is 6 m during flood seasons while the maximum depth can reach 30 m in the downstream portion of the lake s main flow channels li et al 2017a the flow velocities range from 0 1 m s in the floodplains to 1 0 m s in the lake s flow channels li et al 2016b in addition the residence times of the lake vary from 20 days in the flow channels to 300 days in some bays suggesting a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the hydrodynamic conditions li et al 2015b poyang lake experiences a subtropical monsoon climate the lake receives upstream surface runoffs from the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers in the catchment and subsequently interacts with the yangtze river through the narrow outlet of the lake fig 1a the hydrological variations in both the surface rivers and the yangtze river play a combined role in controlling lake water level changes of 8 to 22 m yr li et al 2014 the lake and surrounding rivers not only provide industrial and urban water but also serve agricultural and environmental functions for jiangxi province zhen et al 2011 poyang lake is a prominent system of a highly dynamic lake water that contracts and expands annually from 1000 to 3000 km2 feng et al 2012 creating extensive floodplain areas adjoining the main lake fig 1b the shallow floodplains play a critical role in flood regulation and protection of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation huang et al 2018 li et al 2019b vegetation in the floodplains mainly includes floating vegetation submerged vegetation emergent aquatic vegetation and mesophytic vegetation tan et al 2016 2 2 seasonal lakes a notable feature of poyang lake is that it experiences complex floodplain settings that consist of numerous and interconnected seasonal lakes hu et al 2015 with a total area of approximately 800 km2 ji 2017 the ecosystems of the seasonal lakes are thought to be largely dependent on the hydrological regime and associated lake floodplain exchanges xia et al 2016 in addition water quality dynamics in the seasonal lakes and responses to lake floodplain hydrology play critical roles in the ecological and environmental functions li et al 2019a generally the floodplains and their seasonal lakes are partly or fully coupled to the main lake during the wet summer months e g june october but become isolated during the dry winter months december february fig 2 a creating hydrological differences within poyang lake between wet and dry seasons fig 1b the main source for the seasonal lakes is floodwater of the main lake during the wet summer season hu et al 2015 wu and liu 2017 the seasonal lakes hold significantly lower volumes of water 8 0 108 m3 than the main lake 110 108 m3 therefore the hydrology and ecology are expected to be more sensitive to variations in the complex floodplain environment ji 2017 li et al 2019a geographically speaking the bottom elevations for most of the seasonal lakes vary between 12 m and 13 m fig 1a and these levels are almost higher than those of the main lake and its flow channels fig 2b these seasonal lakes are located at various distances to the main flow channels of the lake additionally the area of these seasonal lakes varies considerably from 1 to 80 km2 across the floodplains fig 2c fig 1a shows the distribution and boundary of the 77 seasonal lakes hereafter referred to as the seasonal lake group within the floodplains that were chosen for modeling and analysis 3 materials and methods a hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the hydrodynamics of the poyang lake floodplain system see section 3 2 the model was validated and used to reproduce the hydrodynamics of the dry and wet years see section 3 3 the delineation and conceptualization of the seasonal lake group were applied to the lake s hydrodynamic model using a bathymetry adjustment method see section 3 4 comparative analyses and corresponding statistical approaches see section 3 5 were subsequently used to explore the coupling effects of seasonal lake groups on the hydrological behavior of poyang lake the modeling methodology used in this study is presented in fig 3 3 1 data availability wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation were observed at gauging stations i e hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan stations fig 1a and used to represent the meteorological conditions of the dry 2006 and wet years 2010 which were applied to force the hydrodynamic model of poyang lake daily river discharges from the five major rivers in the catchment fig 1a were adopted when setting inflows within the model to represent the lake s hydrodynamic responses lake water levels and outflow discharges obtained from hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations fig 1a were used to build and validate the model additionally the bathymetry of poyang lake from a 1 10 000 map surveyed in 2010 30 m 30 m was used to describe the topographical features of both the main lake and floodplain areas all of the hydrological and meteorological data for the hydrodynamic model were derived from the routine observations of the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province for poyang lake a total of 17 cloud free landsat8 images 30 m 30 m were extracted and used to represent the lake water surface areas for the hydrological years 2006 and 2010 in brief the radiometric calibration coefficients from the metadata file https glovis usgs gov app were employed to convert the landsat8 images to top of atmosphere toa radiance surface reflectance sr was produced using atmospherically corrected radiance in this study the modified normalised difference water index mndwi was adopted to delineate the lake water surface area li et al 2019a all processing and analysis of the lake water surface area were implemented in arcgis software 3 2 hydrodynamic model construction mike 21 solves two dimensional free surface equations using the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations invoking the assumptions of hydrostatic pressure and the boussinesq dhi 2014 the mike 21 model has the ability to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of estuaries coastal areas bays and floodplain lakes in response to a variety of forcing functions the mike 21 model has proven to be useful in reproducing the flow features of the poyang lake floodplain system and has been widely applied in various studies including hydrodynamic analysis li et al 2014 2017a zhang et al 2014 thermal regime investigation li et al 2017b 2018b hysteretic simulation zhang and werner 2015 and hydrological connectivity estimation li et al 2019a therefore a previously developed mike 21 model by li et al 2014 was revised and expected to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviors of the poyang lake floodplains in this study the hydrodynamic simulations in 2006 and 2010 were selected to reproduce the representative conditions in poyang lake where the hydrometeorological forcings followed a typical dry and wet behavior yao et al 2018 the upstream boundaries of the lake model were specified as time varying river discharges from the five rivers and the lower boundary condition of the model was specified as the water levels at the hukou gauging station spatially uniform time varying meteorological parameters including precipitation evaporation wind speed and wind direction were used as atmospheric conditions of the hydrodynamic model to capture the topographical features of the lake floodplain system the simulated domain of the model covers the maximum flood inundation area of 3124 km2 li et al 2014 the trial and error method was used to adjust and determine the element sizes leading to variable sizes of 70 to 1500 m across the computational domain with a total of 20 450 triangular elements li et al 2014 the numerical option of wetting and drying h dry 0 005 m h flood 0 05 m h wet 0 1 m was employed in the model to better represent the floodplain dynamics the minimum time step was restricted to 0 1 s to maintain the target courant friedrich levy number at 1 0 the manning number of the lake bed i e 30 50 m1 3 s and the smagorinsky factor of eddy viscosity i e 0 28 obtained by li et al 2014 were used to perform the hydrodynamic simulations the observations from the five lake gauging stations fig 1a were used as the initial water surface elevation while the initial water velocities were set to zero throughout the model domain a spin up time of 14 days was used to achieve representative initial conditions of the lake 3 3 model validation and assessment the revised hydrodynamic model was validated and expected to reproduce the hydrodynamic conditions of the dry and wet years model validation was performed using routine observations from 2006 and 2010 of lake water levels i e at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations and outflow discharge i e at hukou gauging station lake water area obtained from remote sensing images was also used to validate the model to evaluate the model s performance quantification of goodness of fit was assessed using the root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ens li et al 2015a 3 4 conceptualization and bathymetry adjustment the seasonal lakes within the poyang lake s floodplains are highly susceptible to modification due to increasing human activities and they have suffered obvious bottom deposition and differed between lakes yao et al 2018 hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in the floodplain system are strongly dependent on the bathymetry changes although the seasonal lakes are somewhat interconnected their spatial distribution is still decentralized near the lake s shoreline see fig 1a since the water area and water volume of these seasonal lakes are smaller than those of the main lake research regarding the coupled effects of the seasonal lakes is more important than that of the individual seasonal lakes given these considerations this study conceptualized the functioning of the seasonal lake group based on the lake bathymetry i e elevation and gis supported geospatial data model arc hydro arc hydro is a hydrologic data modeling tool for the application of water resources that was developed to build hydrologic information systems to synthesize geospatial and temporal data supporting modeling and analysis maidment 2002 merwade 2012 in this study the seasonal lake groups across the poyang lake floodplain are regarded as depressional elements below the surrounding terrain fig 1a that is the water is considered to be trapped in the seasonal lakes and cannot flow during the low lake level period the fill sinks function in arc hydro is commonly used to modify the elevation data to eliminate these problems maidment 2002 therefore the bathymetry adjustment method is expected to represent changes in the floodplain settings without the seasonal lake group based on the fill sinks function in brief the elevation map of the lake s floodplains were used and converted to a grid based format 250 m 250 m fill sinks process fills the sink in the grid if cell is in the lower than elevation of neighbor cell this tool used the grid input to modify the elevation values of the 77 seasonal lakes fully or partially by keeping a small slope gradient 0 001 between the depressions and their adjacent elevations that is all the seasonal lakes or sinks were filled to the spill elevation which created almost flat areas at local floodplains details regarding the basic algorithm of the bathymetry adjustment are described in above references maidment 2002 merwade 2012 pre processing and adjustment of the bathymetry data were conducted using the arcgis software it is beyond the scope of this study to assess the accuracy of bathymetry adjustment for the seasonal lakes but we aimed to explore a simple and effective method for representing floodplain bathymetry changes in relation to the seasonal lake group the original and adjusted bathymetry of the poyang lake floodplain are intended to represent conditions with i e natural conditions and without i e hypothetical conditions the seasonal lake groups respectively fig 4 a b to examine the role of bathymetry on the hydrodynamic results for our example seasonal lakes the adjusted bathymetry and the associated mesh information were subsequently used as input for the lake s hydrodynamic simulations fig 4c the general idea was to show the differences between the lake hydrodynamics under the two bathymetry scenarios to provide insight into the influences of bathymetry changes on lake hydrological behaviors based on a dry year 2006 and a wet year 2010 3 5 statistical and geostatistical methods the richards baker flashiness index i e r b index was developed to assess the degree of streamflow and water level variations baker et al 2004 ovando et al 2018 in this study the r b index was used to explore the influence of seasonal lakes on the hydrological variability of the lake the index was calculated using the following equation 1 r b i n d e x i 1 n h i h i 1 i 1 n h i where r b index represents the r b index for the flood signature in the floodplain system and hi represents the water level at time step i r b index is a dimensionless measure in range of 0 2 holko et al 2011 zero denotes an absolutely constant hydrological regime and increased index values represent increased flashiness and fluctuations of hydrological regime ulén et al 2016 to describe the dry wet hydrological shift in the floodplain system the shift frequency between dry and wet conditions dwf was defined as follows 2 d w f ndw t 100 where ndw represents the number of dry to wet i e hi hdry and hi 1 h wet and wet to dry i e hi h wet and hi 1 hdry shifts within a time series and t is the total number of records a geostatistical connectivity function cf was used to analyze the surface hydrological connectivity of floodplain areas pardo iguzquiza and dowd 2003 the geostatistical method uses the binary state data to calculate and estimate surface water pathways and linkages on the basis of a multi point statistic trigg et al 2013 li et al 2019a a probability distance function i e cf was produced to express the probability pr that n points along a specified direction are all valued above the threshold value journel et al 2000 3 cf n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 where π is the product operator i uj zc represents an indicator of the variable z uj at location uj that exceeds the threshold value zc which is defined as i uj zc 1 if z uj zc and i uj zc 0 otherwise the underlying principles of the geostatistical method are described in detail in trigg et al 2013 in this study the cf of surface hydrological connectivity in north south n s and west east w e directions was investigated across the poyang lake floodplain system which represents an average condition of the whole lake floodplain system li et al 2019a the n s and w e are approximately parallel and perpendicular to the lake s main flow direction i e from south to north respectively all of the above statistical analyses were conducted using the matlab software 4 results 4 1 hydrodynamic model validation the modelled and observed water levels and outflow discharges at the five lake gauging stations matched well during the validation years of 2006 and 2010 based on a time series visual inspection and statistical evaluation i e ens r 2 and rmse fig 5 the goodness of fit statistics showed that the rmse values of the water levels were 0 43 m the ens varied from 0 94 to 0 97 and r 2 ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 for the dry and wet years the lake outflow discharges at the hukou gauging station also showed satisfactory agreement between the simulated and observed series the associated values of ens and r 2 varied from 0 90 to 0 91 and 0 92 to 0 94 respectively suggesting a reasonable simulation for the lake hydrodynamic field however the model results were somewhat overestimated during the lake dry seasons i e december february as illustrated in fig 5a e the impact of the complex topography on model generated patterns of hydrodynamic behaviors can almost be ignored during the flood periods i e june august and amplified during the low level dry periods fig 6 shows that the hydrodynamic model is generally capable of simulating daily water surface areas for the lake floodplain system producing r 2 in range of 0 93 0 95 for both the hydrological years it is noteworthy that the slight discrepancies between the simulation and the remote sensing can be partly attributable to the difference between the model s mesh sizes i e 70 1500 m and the remote sensing resolution 30 m 30 m overall the results presented in figs 5 and 6 suggest both the phase and magnitude of temporal dynamics have similar precisions during dry and wet years which demonstrates that the current mike 21 model has the capability to reproduce major hydrological behaviors in the floodplain system of poyang lake 4 2 effects of seasonal lake group 4 2 1 lake water level changes the effects of the seasonal lake group within the poyang lake s floodplains in terms of the water level difference between the natural condition and hypothetical condition are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 for both the main lake and the floodplain regions the simulation results show that the coupling effects of the seasonal lake group on the water levels during the flood months e g june august were distinctly weaker than during the dry winter months e g december february of 2006 and 2010 that is the hypothetical condition results in a more likely high water level than the natural condition during the dry seasons as reflected in an increased water level of the main lake by up to 0 6 m and 0 4 m for the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 respectively figs 7 and 8 in addition the corresponding water level increases of the floodplain regions reached 0 9 m for both the dry year and the wet year the seasonal lake group tended to have a limited effect on water level changes for both the main lake and the floodplains 0 2 m during the flood seasons especially for the typical wet year 2010 0 m in general the influences of the seasonal lake groups on water levels were stronger during the dry year 2006 than the wet year 2010 and more significant during the drier dry seasons than the wetter wet seasons it is likely that the impact of bathymetry adjustment on water level behaviors is more significant during the dry seasons than the flood seasons fig 9 shows the changes in the spatial pattern of the water level during the flood and dry period of 2006 and 2010 respectively the results revealed that in general the lake wide pattern during the flood periods fig 9a and fig 9b exhibited a similar spatial distribution to that during the dry periods fig 9c and d however the spatial water levels in the dry periods presented more significant changes i e up to 1 6 m than in the flood periods i e up to 0 6 m as expected although water level reductions were observed in some floodplain regions the water level increases were found across the majority of the lake floodplains fig 9 additionally the water level variations in the floodplains 0 6 m were distinctly higher than those of the main lake 0 2 m for both hydrological years this is an expected outcome given that the local bathymetry changes and the associated flow structure may substantially influence water level behaviors throughout the lake floodplains the results presented here indicate that the contribution of the seasonal lake group to the lake floodplain behaviors has experienced a significantly spatial change 4 2 2 lake flood flashiness changes in the water level behavior of the main poyang lake are inextricably linked to the flood signature fig 10 shows the calculated r b flashiness index for the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 between the natural and hypothetical conditions the results show that the r b index in the lake s downstream area was significantly higher than that of the upstream area under both conditions indicating different responses of the flood flashiness across the lake s length i e from xingzi gauging station to kangshan gauging station in addition the values of the r b flashiness index under hypothetical condition were obviously higher than those of the natural condition for both the dry year and the wet year although small r b index values were observed at the four gauging stations i e 7 7 9 0 10 3 fig 10 these results indicate that the hypothetical conditions are more likely to result in a flashier flood regime in dry years than wet years suggesting a possible impact of the seasonal lake group this is a logical outcome of the bathymetry changes for the floodplains to increase water level dynamics and hydrological variability particularly in the lake dry conditions 4 2 3 lake discharge changes the outflow of poyang lake i e at hukou gauging station is an important indicator of the lake yangtze river interactions the effects of the seasonal lake group on the outflow discharge are shown in fig 11 taking 2006 and 2010 as examples the simulations revealed that the outflow discharge may exhibit a complex response i e positive and negative differences to the condition of without the seasonal lake group furthermore more pronounced outflow changes were visible during the dry year 2006 and the dry seasons in 2010 fig 11 it follows that the blocking role of the yangtze river may be a key process affecting the lake outflow condition as discussed by li et al 2017a generally the seasonal lake group is likely to play a minor role in affecting the lake discharge regime mainly because the accumulated lake discharges appear to be unchanged between the hypothetical and the natural conditions fig 12 4 2 4 lake water area changes fig 13 shows the lake water area changes between the hypothetical and natural conditions similar to the water level variations the effects of the seasonal lake group on water area changes tended to be more significant during dry months than flood months based on a comparison of 2006 and 2010 although the seasonal lake group may lead to a small effect on changes in water area 50 km2 during the flood months a significant increase in water area 120 km2 was observed during the other months of the year averaged over 2006 and 2010 overall it seems that the seasonal lake group is most likely to exert a significant impact on the entire lake water area during the relatively dry seasons i e approximately 10 18 see fig 13 indicating a possible effect of the floodplain bathymetry changes on inundation dynamics 4 2 5 dry wet hydrological shift and dynamics it is essential to assess dry wet hydrological shifts in floodplains that characterize transitional processes induced by hydrological behavior fig 14 shows the effects of seasonal lake groups on dry wet hydrological shifts in the floodplain system of poyang lake as determined from hydrodynamic simulation of the hypothetical and natural conditions the simulations revealed that slight changes in hydrological shift dwf i e 2 8 were found in the main lake regions while obvious changes in dwf i e by up to 30 were observed in the floodplain regions for both the dry and wet years however the decreased dwf could also be found in the southern floodplains of the lake fig 14 these previous results indicate that the hypothetical condition is more likely to promote a dry wet hydrological shift across the floodplain system relative to variations in the natural condition additionally the changes in the dry wet shift in the dry year 2006 were slightly stronger than in the wet year 2010 furthermore the hypothetical condition in combination with the bathymetry changes is expected to enhance the floodplain connectivity see the next section potentially contributing to the dry wet shift 4 2 6 hydrological connectivity and changes changes in the hydrological behavior of the lake floodplain system are inextricably linked to the dynamic surface hydrological connectivity which largely depends on changes in bathymetry changes fig 15 shows the spatial patterns of surface hydrological connectivity in the poyang lake floodplain under hypothetical and natural conditions as determined from the hydrodynamic field and the associated streamline trajectory for clarity this is illustrated for four major periods during the water level hydrograph dry rising flood and recession for both years the n s connectivity exhibited a more continuous pathway than the w e connectivity during all four periods because of the north south orientation of the water flow of the main lake fig 15 in addition the w e connectivity increases rapidly from the dry to flood period then decreases during the recession period as expected in general visual comparison revealed that the hypothetical condition tends to enhance the hydrological connectivity in the center regions of the lake s floodplains this is a logical outcome of the bathymetry adjustment for the seasonal lake group relative to the natural condition to ensure flow connectivity geostatistical analysis of the hydrodynamic results of the lake floodplain produced a series of connectivity function curves cf for the two typical years as shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively the cf plots showed that the hydrological connectivity in both n s and w e was much stronger during the spring and summer seasons i e cf values were close to 1 0 than during the autumn and winter seasons i e cf values could decrease to 0 figs 16 and 17 as expected the cf results also revealed that the linkage of the surface water pathway in the n s direction is greater 130 km see the x axis in figs 16 and 17 than that of the w e direction 80 km because of the n s orientation of the main flow across the lake s length in addition daily plots of cf figs 16 and 17 indicate that the connectivity behaviors in the w e direction tend to be more dynamic than those in the n s suggesting a dominant role of w e connectivity is influencing the lake floodplain interactions these findings coincide with the fact that the topographical slope of the lake floodplain interactions is greater in the w e direction than the n s direction although it was beyond the scope of this study to quantify the degree of hydrological connectivity in an accurate manner the results suggested that high hydrological connectivity i e cf values close to 1 0 occurs during summer season june august while low connectivity i e cf values can drop to 0 occurs during winter season december february whereas intermediate connectivity arises during other months of the year figs 16 and 17 for both the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 the hypothetical condition may play an important role in enhancing the n s connectivity throughout the year relative to the natural condition especially for the winter months along with low connectivity notably the results presented in figs 16 and 17 indicate that w e connectivity may have exerted positive and or negative responses to the hypothetical condition along the water pathway except during the summer flood period in the wet year 2010 fig 17b the results presented herein further indicate that the seasonal lake group may have significant effects on hydrological connectivity in the lake s floodplains during the drier dry seasons overall the results indicate that hydrological connectivity is at least partially responsible for the inundation dynamics e g fig 13 and the associated dry wet hydrological shift fig 14 within the floodplain of poyang lake 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other relevant work river and lake floodplains are most often geomorphologically dynamic systems characterized by highly complex surface processes and exchanges thomas et al 2015 however few studies of the hydrological behaviors of floodplain systems have been conducted to date due at least in part to difficulty collecting the fundamental data karim et al 2015 khaki and awange 2019 among these floodplains the poyang lake system is unique in that it has a large number of seasonal lakes within its floodplains hydrological and hydrodynamic processes within shallow floodplains are strongly dependent on the bathymetry changes and many previous studies have attempted to investigate the influences of bathymetry changes in rivers or lakes on the surrounding floodplain hydrology using remote sensing techniques and physically based models trigg et al 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 yao et al 2018 reisenbüchler et al 2019 for floodplains of poyang lake lai et al 2014 used remote sensing and field survey data to investigate the influence of sand mining on the water level variations during the dry season of poyang lake they found that the decline in lake levels is closely related to extensive sand mining and the associated bathymetry changes in the outflow channels similarly jiang et al 2015 used hydrological remote sensing and bathymetry data to analyze the sand mining and associated hydrological responses during 2001 2010 they found that a wider and deeper outflow channel in the northern lake resulted in rapid lake discharge and subsequently lower water levels during the dry seasons more recently yao et al 2018 quantified the contribution of changes in bathymetry to the low water levels in different hydrological years based on a combination of bathymetry data and hydrodynamic models they concluded that the bottom erosion of the northern outflow channel exerts a more significant role in decreasing the low water levels and enhancing the drought during the dry seasons these previous studies of floodplain hydrology have mainly focused on bathymetry changes in the related river or lake flow channels and the associated effects potentially leading to insufficient references for the assessment of bathymetry changes in the complex floodplain areas of poyang lake the results of the present study further extend the findings of previous work lai et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 by providing new insight into the possible contribution of changes in bathymetry in floodplains to hydrological behaviors using a two dimensional hydrodynamic model comparison with previous studies of poyang lake indicates that bathymetry changes in both the main channels and the floodplains of the lake may have significant effects on the hydrological behaviors during the dry seasons while making limited contributions during flood seasons however the effects of bathymetry changes in the main flow channel are likely to be more pronounced i e several meters yao et al 2018 than those of the lake s floodplains i e 1 m this study because of the different magnitudes of water level variations overall the results of this study improve our understanding of the bathymetry effects of the floodplain poyang lake and other similar floodplain regions worldwide 5 2 floodplain bathymetry and management implications the combination of natural and anthropogenic processes results in spatiotemporal variations in floodplain bathymetry van der most and hudson 2018 yao et al 2018 the location of suitable ecological indicators e g aquatic habitat and vegetation type across the floodplains is dependent on floodplain geomorphology and hydrology e g junk et al 1989 van der most and hudson 2018 changes in bathymetry in floodplains may lead to changes in hydrological and hydrodynamic processes affecting inundation extent and timing which play significant roles in dominating biogeochemical cycles occurring in floodplains marks et al 2000 malhadas et al 2009 for poyang lake the erosion of the lake s main flow channels and the deposition of the floodplains occurred from the 1990s to 2010s this could be attributed to the afforestation and reservoir construction program in the lake s catchment and the natural state of slight deposition and sand mining within the lake wu et al 2015 notably sand mining has extended from the northern lake to the southern lake and the bathymetry has been experienced a dynamic changing environment jiang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 the results of this study have important implications regarding the management and planning of floodplains in poyang lake the erosion and deposition of the floodplain lake may directly influence the hydrological regime and the associated floodplain connectivity more importantly dynamic connectivity between seasonal lakes and surrounding floodplain regions potentially play important roles in downstream channels of the lake through temporary inputs of materials and energy li et al 2019a several studies have concluded that the seasonal hydrological connectivity in poyang lake plays an important role in the water quality and ecosystem of the floodplain system xia et al 2016 li et al 2019a considering the outcomes of this study the seasonal lake group may play a limited role in regulating the lake s flood event during summer which is different from previous conclusions e g hu et al 2015 however stored water during the recession period is highly valued for its ecosystem protection services and biodiversity conservation hu et al 2015 ji 2017 although the floodplains are usually large and remote increasing human interventions are directly influencing the seasonal lakes and the associated floodplain settings wu and liu 2017 notably a large number of seasonal lakes high on the floodplains will also infrequently obtain flood water from the main lake from a hydrodynamic perspective the whole lake floodplain system is inundated during the flood months leading to a high connectivity between the main lake and the seasonal lakes however the water flow velocities throughout the system are small and the associated hydrodynamic field is stable during this high lake level period li et al 2014 accordingly the lake floodplain system is mainly controlled by the flow regime of the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 rather than changes in bathymetry in both the floodplains e g the seasonal lake group and the main lake e g sand mining during the other seasons e g rising falling and dry the floodplain inundation of poyang lake is more sensitive to the water level changes than that of the flood season in other words changes in floodplain bathymetry may alter the water flow pathway and the associated surface hydrological connectivity and hence lead to a highly dynamic and complex hydrodynamic field li et al 2014 lake and wetland managers should pay more attention to the local bathymetry changes and associated flow connectivity during the dry seasons which can be simple and in many cases practical from a conservation perspective floodplain engineering e g levee construction and sluice gates should be avoided in the natural floodplains of poyang lake because the floodplain hydrology and ecological processes are sensitive to any changes in the region 5 3 limitations and uncertainties it should be noted that there are limitations and uncertainties associated with applying hypothetical conditions in a hydrodynamic model to bathymetry adjustment floodplain structure and model mesh size exact quantification of these uncertainties would significantly increase the scope of our study although the arc hydro tool was adopted to set up the hypothetical scenario modification of the elevations for the seasonal lake group using the bathymetry adjustment method is only close to the surrounding terrains although influences of the seasonal lake group on hydrological behaviors in the poyang lake floodplain were investigated in this study the outcomes from the hypothetical conditions may have had somewhat different outcomes if other bathymetry adjustment techniques had been used however the hydrodynamic model along with a bathymetry adjustment approach may be the best manner to distinguish the effects of numerous seasonal lakes which can be applicable to other similar floodplain systems our future work will certainly consider new and novelty methods of investigation that build on our current research the current hydrodynamic model exhibits its ability to provide continuous and dynamic datasets but the cell resolution remains a significant issue when capturing complex floodplain structure and environment li et al 2019a b tan et al 2019 within the floodplains of poyang lake there are numerous long narrow shallow channel networks with complex interactions considering the extensive data and computational requirements of the hydrodynamic model it is important to note that the model necessitated some simplifications to the channel networks which may lead to errors in the hydrodynamic simulations and the associated floodplain assessments for example simplification of the channel networks in the hydrodynamic modeling may strongly influence flow connectivity and inundation dynamics of floodplains tan et al 2019 despite these limitations the present model is considered to be adequate as an important attempt at physical simulation of the complex poyang lake floodplain system this is because a comparative analysis between hypothetical and natural conditions allows us to eliminate the effects of uncertainty factors on the current results the model also has high potential to be applied to various floodplain settings in which hydrological observations are sparse missing or inconsistent 5 4 future research further studies are required to obtain remote sensing data that have been widely used to describe complex floodplain environments and validate hydrodynamic models the combination of hydrodynamic models and remote sensing data will provide valuable new insights into the dynamic natural system and evolution of floodplains notably the chinese government has launched a key research program beautiful china zhao 2019 to perform a joint assessment of the hydrodynamics water quality and ecology of the floodplain poyang lake for the purpose of management and protection additionally floodplain groundwater is an important topic in the study of floodplain lakes because of the close relationships between the floodplains and the lake li et al 2018a 2019b therefore future studies of floodplain systems should be paid more attention to the water quality wetland ecosystem and lake health using dynamic surface groundwater modeling coupled with relevant ecological processes future study into the effects of bathymetry changes in the floodplain of poyang lake should develop sediment transport models for a comprehensive investigation of the effects of bathymetric variability on floodplain behaviors 6 conclusions seasonal shallow small lakes are distinctive hydrological units in floodplains that have significant implications for various functions of many floodplain systems despite the hydrological and ecological importance of seasonal lakes in the extensive floodplains of poyang lake the present study is the first to investigate the coupled effects of seasonal lakes on hydrological behaviors within a large floodplain lake system using a physically based hydrodynamic model along with a bathymetry adjustment method we expect to overcome the limitations of current studies exploring seasonal lakes in the data limited environment of the poyang lake floodplain the hydrodynamic model reproduced the lake floodplain hydrodynamics reasonably well during the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 the simulated results reveal that in general the temporal influences of the seasonal lake group on water levels lake outflow discharges and associated inundation dynamics were stronger during the dry year than the wet year and this difference was greater during the drier dry seasons 2006 than the wetter wet seasons 2010 the results show that on average the role of the seasonal lake group during the dry seasons is around several times stronger than during the flood seasons in terms of the magnitudes of different hydrological responses e g water level outflow and inundation area the spatial effects of the seasonal lake group on the hydrological behaviors of the lake s floodplains were more significant than those of the main lake for both hydrological years indicating a sensitive response of the floodplain settings in addition the seasonal lake group is more likely to play an important role in the surface hydrological connectivity across the lake floodplains potentially influencing the dry wet hydrological shift indicating an important role of the floodplain bathymetry changes the outcomes from this study can be extended to other similar floodplain regions by providing improved understanding of the bathymetry changes and the associated lake floodplain management declaration of

6131,seasonal lakes that exist in floodplain settings have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes however they are rarely investigated mainly because of the large extent and remoteness of floodplains this study uses physically based hydrodynamic modeling in combination with a bathymetry adjustment approach to investigate the coupling effects of 77 seasonal lakes defined as the seasonal lake group on hydrological behaviors within the poyang lake floodplain system china from a systemic perspective elucidation of the role of seasonal lake groups could benefit from hydrodynamic modeling which enables complex lake floodplain simulations and comparison analyses of natural original bathymetry and hypothetical conditions adjusted bathymetry in the present study the simulation results showed that the temporal influences of the seasonal lake group on water levels lake outflows and inundation dynamics were greater during dry seasons than wet seasons for both the dry 2006 and wet years 2010 the spatial effects of the seasonal lake group on the hydrology of the lake s floodplains were stronger than those of the main lake for both hydrological years the findings demonstrate that the seasonal lakes are likely to have very limited effects on the main lake and the associated flood levels on average the role of the seasonal lake group during the dry seasons was around several times stronger than that during flood seasons in terms of the magnitudes of hydrological responses additionally it is expected that the seasonal lake group may exert an important role in influencing the surface hydrological connectivity and associated dry wet hydrological shift across lake floodplains indicating a dominant role of the floodplain bathymetry changes overall the results of this study will support management and planning of poyang lake and other similar floodplain regions with numerous small shallow and seasonal lakes by providing more reliable information regarding bathymetry changes water management and lake floodplain interactions to decision makers for improved floodplain protection strategy keywords seasonal lake groups hydrodynamic model hydrological behavior bathymetry changes floodplain management poyang lake 1 introduction floodplains are hydrologically dynamic systems characterized by highly complex surface hydrodynamics that are subjected to wide ranging wetting and drying over seasonal timeframes bonnet et al 2008 thomas et al 2015 li et al 2019a it is estimated that there are between 0 8 million and 2 2 million km2 of rivers and lake related floodplains worldwide entwistle et al 2019 floodplains are hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem services that are naturally productive and valuable dudgeon et al 2006 providing a range of hydrological and ecological functions including flood regulation water purification nutrient retention critical wildlife habitats and agriculture and livestock products robinson et al 2015 van der most and hudson 2018 funk et al 2019 however floodplain areas have long been recognized as globally threatened ecosystems that are presently highly sensitive to anthropogenic interventions and climate change karim et al 2015 van der most and hudson 2018 entwistle et al 2019 seasonal lakes are numerous and interconnected but may be typically small in depth and area hayashi and van der kamp 2000 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 they are hydrologically and geomorphologically similar to depressional wetlands maia et al 2018 the formation of these seasonal lakes is caused by variations within floodplain topography which influence hydrological and hydrodynamic processes across floodplains hu et al 2015 seasonal lakes are most likely to play key roles as natural retarding pools that attenuate flood waves and suppress flood peaks in the earth s land surface yamazaki et al 2011 these lakes serve to retain water during the period of flood recession and hold significantly lower water volumes than other large lakes and wetlands accordingly their hydrology and ecology are highly sensitive and respond more rapidly to variations in the surrounding floodplain setting evenson et al 2015 lee et al 2018 li et al 2019a seasonal lakes are considered vital contributors to the overall ecological health of their floodplains and they also have rich natural diversity hu et al 2015 given these backgrounds knowledge of seasonal lakes can substantially aid in the assessment of their hydrological and ecological importance for scientists and managers despite the multiple ecosystem services provided by seasonal lakes they have not been adequately characterized with respect to their hydrological behaviors in addition although many human efforts are made to preserve the conditions of seasonal lakes they still receive less attention than large surface water bodies yu et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge many previous investigations of river and lake floodplain systems focused on either rivers or lakes while the roles of small seasonal lakes within their floodplains on the hydrological behaviors have received little attention the large extent and remoteness of the majority of floodplains across the world have limited the establishment of a dense network of field based monitoring resulting in investigations of individual seasonal lakes being technically difficult and time consuming karim et al 2015 ovando et al 2018 khaki and awange 2019 in recent decades much of the knowledge regarding floodplain lakes and their associated hydrological behaviors has been acquired via application of remote sensing techniques along with in situ observational information trigg et al 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 ovando et al 2018 tan et al 2019 although remote sensing products can be used to completely and properly capture the dynamic evolution of large extent floodplains which can provide important insights into floodplain environments and their assessment alsdorf et al 2010 karim et al 2015 tan et al 2019 the use of static products for complex floodplains may not be adequate to test hypotheses and to analyze various scenarios that can affect floodplain settings li et al 2015b hydrodynamic modeling of floodplain systems is cumbersome but models have become a more widespread approach and are used as an alternative tool for assessing many critical aspects of floodplains such as bathymetry effects trigg et al 2012 yamazaki et al 2012 yao et al 2018 surface connectivity dynamics karim et al 2015 beck et al 2019 and water quality responses li et al 2019a therefore it is important to use hydrodynamic models to obtain an improved understanding of the complex functioning of seasonal lakes in floodplains and quantitative and qualitative information should be provided to support their conservation poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in china creates extensive floodplains that adjoin the main lake feng et al 2012 li et al 2019b the lake and its floodplains are influenced by seasonal dynamic interactions with the surrounding rivers including strong catchment inflows and the yangtze river s effects hu et al 2007 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the most notable feature of the lake floodplain system is that the floodplain behavior varies between that of a long river and a large lake on a seasonal scale zhang and werner 2015 in recent years there has been renewed interest in the floodplain hydrology and associated wetland ecosystem of poyang lake this is mostly because of disturbed fluctuations of the lake water levels zhang et al 2012 mei et al 2016 dynamic lake floodplain interactions li et al 2019a and increasing human activities yang et al 2016 which in combination have greater effects on the floodplain than the main lake in addition the extensive floodplains of poyang lake are more prone to changes in the external environment in a rapid manner due partly to their shallow and wide characteristics li et al 2018b yao et al 2019 the behavior of the poyang lake system is distinct from that of other floodplains in that it has a particularly complex topography and hydrological regime that creates 102 seasonal lakes of varying depth and area ji 2017 li et al 2019a the water quality of the seasonal lakes and their ecological functions for the wetlands are thought to be largely dependent on the hydrological dynamics and the associated lake floodplain exchanges xia et al 2016 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 for example the highly variable hydrological connectivity has recently been recognized as essential to protecting the ecology of the seasonal lakes and their floodplains using field observation data xia et al 2016 in addition field sampling data and hydrodynamic simulations have shown that lateral lake floodplain interactions may contribute to water quality trends of seasonal lakes li et al 2019a there are still however information gaps first although seasonal lake responses in floodplain regions have previously been examined the characteristics and possible influences of seasonal lakes remain unclear from a hydrological perspective second available data are not sufficient to evaluate the effects of seasonal lakes in the lake s floodplains lacking of the knowledge regarding the lake s floodplains response to the current and future floodplain settings in which climate and human interventions are likely to be more frequent and intensive li et al 2016a yao et al 2018 ye et al 2019 an improved understanding of the role of these seasonal lakes is essential for water resource management and lake floodplain planning as well as for understanding how seasonal lakes affect the hydrological processes and subsequent ecological conservation of the lake given the hydrological and ecological importance of small shallow seasonal lakes in the poyang lake floodplains and similar floodplain regions elsewhere the objectives of this study were to 1 use a two dimensional hydrodynamic model to examine hydrological responses of the poyang lake floodplain system for a historical dry and wet year and 2 use modeling in combination with a bathymetry adjustment approach to assess the coupling effects of a seasonal lake group on major hydrological behaviors in the floodplain system the key innovation of this study was the insight into a seasonal lake group on large scale floodplains and the integration of a modeling and hypothetical approach to overcome the limitations of current studies exploring floodplain hydrology in a data limited environment in the next section we provide a detailed description of the study area including climate hydrology and floodplain settings this is followed by details regarding the methods used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the lake floodplains under natural and hypothetical conditions sections 4 and 5 provide the results and discussion respectively major conclusions from this study are summarized in section 6 2 study area 2 1 poyang lake poyang lake is one of the few large lakes in middle reaches of the yangtze river that remains naturally connected to surrounding rivers fig 1 a the lake has high flow channels gently undulating floodplains and bays and islands characterized by irregular shorelines an incised lake morphology and contrasting bathymetric features li et al 2017a it is a topographically and geometrically complex lake that varies from the lake s floodplain regions at elevations of 28 2 m to the flow channels at elevations of about 8 m fig 1a generally 85 of the water depth within poyang lake is 6 m during flood seasons while the maximum depth can reach 30 m in the downstream portion of the lake s main flow channels li et al 2017a the flow velocities range from 0 1 m s in the floodplains to 1 0 m s in the lake s flow channels li et al 2016b in addition the residence times of the lake vary from 20 days in the flow channels to 300 days in some bays suggesting a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the hydrodynamic conditions li et al 2015b poyang lake experiences a subtropical monsoon climate the lake receives upstream surface runoffs from the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers in the catchment and subsequently interacts with the yangtze river through the narrow outlet of the lake fig 1a the hydrological variations in both the surface rivers and the yangtze river play a combined role in controlling lake water level changes of 8 to 22 m yr li et al 2014 the lake and surrounding rivers not only provide industrial and urban water but also serve agricultural and environmental functions for jiangxi province zhen et al 2011 poyang lake is a prominent system of a highly dynamic lake water that contracts and expands annually from 1000 to 3000 km2 feng et al 2012 creating extensive floodplain areas adjoining the main lake fig 1b the shallow floodplains play a critical role in flood regulation and protection of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation huang et al 2018 li et al 2019b vegetation in the floodplains mainly includes floating vegetation submerged vegetation emergent aquatic vegetation and mesophytic vegetation tan et al 2016 2 2 seasonal lakes a notable feature of poyang lake is that it experiences complex floodplain settings that consist of numerous and interconnected seasonal lakes hu et al 2015 with a total area of approximately 800 km2 ji 2017 the ecosystems of the seasonal lakes are thought to be largely dependent on the hydrological regime and associated lake floodplain exchanges xia et al 2016 in addition water quality dynamics in the seasonal lakes and responses to lake floodplain hydrology play critical roles in the ecological and environmental functions li et al 2019a generally the floodplains and their seasonal lakes are partly or fully coupled to the main lake during the wet summer months e g june october but become isolated during the dry winter months december february fig 2 a creating hydrological differences within poyang lake between wet and dry seasons fig 1b the main source for the seasonal lakes is floodwater of the main lake during the wet summer season hu et al 2015 wu and liu 2017 the seasonal lakes hold significantly lower volumes of water 8 0 108 m3 than the main lake 110 108 m3 therefore the hydrology and ecology are expected to be more sensitive to variations in the complex floodplain environment ji 2017 li et al 2019a geographically speaking the bottom elevations for most of the seasonal lakes vary between 12 m and 13 m fig 1a and these levels are almost higher than those of the main lake and its flow channels fig 2b these seasonal lakes are located at various distances to the main flow channels of the lake additionally the area of these seasonal lakes varies considerably from 1 to 80 km2 across the floodplains fig 2c fig 1a shows the distribution and boundary of the 77 seasonal lakes hereafter referred to as the seasonal lake group within the floodplains that were chosen for modeling and analysis 3 materials and methods a hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the hydrodynamics of the poyang lake floodplain system see section 3 2 the model was validated and used to reproduce the hydrodynamics of the dry and wet years see section 3 3 the delineation and conceptualization of the seasonal lake group were applied to the lake s hydrodynamic model using a bathymetry adjustment method see section 3 4 comparative analyses and corresponding statistical approaches see section 3 5 were subsequently used to explore the coupling effects of seasonal lake groups on the hydrological behavior of poyang lake the modeling methodology used in this study is presented in fig 3 3 1 data availability wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation were observed at gauging stations i e hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan stations fig 1a and used to represent the meteorological conditions of the dry 2006 and wet years 2010 which were applied to force the hydrodynamic model of poyang lake daily river discharges from the five major rivers in the catchment fig 1a were adopted when setting inflows within the model to represent the lake s hydrodynamic responses lake water levels and outflow discharges obtained from hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations fig 1a were used to build and validate the model additionally the bathymetry of poyang lake from a 1 10 000 map surveyed in 2010 30 m 30 m was used to describe the topographical features of both the main lake and floodplain areas all of the hydrological and meteorological data for the hydrodynamic model were derived from the routine observations of the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province for poyang lake a total of 17 cloud free landsat8 images 30 m 30 m were extracted and used to represent the lake water surface areas for the hydrological years 2006 and 2010 in brief the radiometric calibration coefficients from the metadata file https glovis usgs gov app were employed to convert the landsat8 images to top of atmosphere toa radiance surface reflectance sr was produced using atmospherically corrected radiance in this study the modified normalised difference water index mndwi was adopted to delineate the lake water surface area li et al 2019a all processing and analysis of the lake water surface area were implemented in arcgis software 3 2 hydrodynamic model construction mike 21 solves two dimensional free surface equations using the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations invoking the assumptions of hydrostatic pressure and the boussinesq dhi 2014 the mike 21 model has the ability to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of estuaries coastal areas bays and floodplain lakes in response to a variety of forcing functions the mike 21 model has proven to be useful in reproducing the flow features of the poyang lake floodplain system and has been widely applied in various studies including hydrodynamic analysis li et al 2014 2017a zhang et al 2014 thermal regime investigation li et al 2017b 2018b hysteretic simulation zhang and werner 2015 and hydrological connectivity estimation li et al 2019a therefore a previously developed mike 21 model by li et al 2014 was revised and expected to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviors of the poyang lake floodplains in this study the hydrodynamic simulations in 2006 and 2010 were selected to reproduce the representative conditions in poyang lake where the hydrometeorological forcings followed a typical dry and wet behavior yao et al 2018 the upstream boundaries of the lake model were specified as time varying river discharges from the five rivers and the lower boundary condition of the model was specified as the water levels at the hukou gauging station spatially uniform time varying meteorological parameters including precipitation evaporation wind speed and wind direction were used as atmospheric conditions of the hydrodynamic model to capture the topographical features of the lake floodplain system the simulated domain of the model covers the maximum flood inundation area of 3124 km2 li et al 2014 the trial and error method was used to adjust and determine the element sizes leading to variable sizes of 70 to 1500 m across the computational domain with a total of 20 450 triangular elements li et al 2014 the numerical option of wetting and drying h dry 0 005 m h flood 0 05 m h wet 0 1 m was employed in the model to better represent the floodplain dynamics the minimum time step was restricted to 0 1 s to maintain the target courant friedrich levy number at 1 0 the manning number of the lake bed i e 30 50 m1 3 s and the smagorinsky factor of eddy viscosity i e 0 28 obtained by li et al 2014 were used to perform the hydrodynamic simulations the observations from the five lake gauging stations fig 1a were used as the initial water surface elevation while the initial water velocities were set to zero throughout the model domain a spin up time of 14 days was used to achieve representative initial conditions of the lake 3 3 model validation and assessment the revised hydrodynamic model was validated and expected to reproduce the hydrodynamic conditions of the dry and wet years model validation was performed using routine observations from 2006 and 2010 of lake water levels i e at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations and outflow discharge i e at hukou gauging station lake water area obtained from remote sensing images was also used to validate the model to evaluate the model s performance quantification of goodness of fit was assessed using the root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ens li et al 2015a 3 4 conceptualization and bathymetry adjustment the seasonal lakes within the poyang lake s floodplains are highly susceptible to modification due to increasing human activities and they have suffered obvious bottom deposition and differed between lakes yao et al 2018 hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in the floodplain system are strongly dependent on the bathymetry changes although the seasonal lakes are somewhat interconnected their spatial distribution is still decentralized near the lake s shoreline see fig 1a since the water area and water volume of these seasonal lakes are smaller than those of the main lake research regarding the coupled effects of the seasonal lakes is more important than that of the individual seasonal lakes given these considerations this study conceptualized the functioning of the seasonal lake group based on the lake bathymetry i e elevation and gis supported geospatial data model arc hydro arc hydro is a hydrologic data modeling tool for the application of water resources that was developed to build hydrologic information systems to synthesize geospatial and temporal data supporting modeling and analysis maidment 2002 merwade 2012 in this study the seasonal lake groups across the poyang lake floodplain are regarded as depressional elements below the surrounding terrain fig 1a that is the water is considered to be trapped in the seasonal lakes and cannot flow during the low lake level period the fill sinks function in arc hydro is commonly used to modify the elevation data to eliminate these problems maidment 2002 therefore the bathymetry adjustment method is expected to represent changes in the floodplain settings without the seasonal lake group based on the fill sinks function in brief the elevation map of the lake s floodplains were used and converted to a grid based format 250 m 250 m fill sinks process fills the sink in the grid if cell is in the lower than elevation of neighbor cell this tool used the grid input to modify the elevation values of the 77 seasonal lakes fully or partially by keeping a small slope gradient 0 001 between the depressions and their adjacent elevations that is all the seasonal lakes or sinks were filled to the spill elevation which created almost flat areas at local floodplains details regarding the basic algorithm of the bathymetry adjustment are described in above references maidment 2002 merwade 2012 pre processing and adjustment of the bathymetry data were conducted using the arcgis software it is beyond the scope of this study to assess the accuracy of bathymetry adjustment for the seasonal lakes but we aimed to explore a simple and effective method for representing floodplain bathymetry changes in relation to the seasonal lake group the original and adjusted bathymetry of the poyang lake floodplain are intended to represent conditions with i e natural conditions and without i e hypothetical conditions the seasonal lake groups respectively fig 4 a b to examine the role of bathymetry on the hydrodynamic results for our example seasonal lakes the adjusted bathymetry and the associated mesh information were subsequently used as input for the lake s hydrodynamic simulations fig 4c the general idea was to show the differences between the lake hydrodynamics under the two bathymetry scenarios to provide insight into the influences of bathymetry changes on lake hydrological behaviors based on a dry year 2006 and a wet year 2010 3 5 statistical and geostatistical methods the richards baker flashiness index i e r b index was developed to assess the degree of streamflow and water level variations baker et al 2004 ovando et al 2018 in this study the r b index was used to explore the influence of seasonal lakes on the hydrological variability of the lake the index was calculated using the following equation 1 r b i n d e x i 1 n h i h i 1 i 1 n h i where r b index represents the r b index for the flood signature in the floodplain system and hi represents the water level at time step i r b index is a dimensionless measure in range of 0 2 holko et al 2011 zero denotes an absolutely constant hydrological regime and increased index values represent increased flashiness and fluctuations of hydrological regime ulén et al 2016 to describe the dry wet hydrological shift in the floodplain system the shift frequency between dry and wet conditions dwf was defined as follows 2 d w f ndw t 100 where ndw represents the number of dry to wet i e hi hdry and hi 1 h wet and wet to dry i e hi h wet and hi 1 hdry shifts within a time series and t is the total number of records a geostatistical connectivity function cf was used to analyze the surface hydrological connectivity of floodplain areas pardo iguzquiza and dowd 2003 the geostatistical method uses the binary state data to calculate and estimate surface water pathways and linkages on the basis of a multi point statistic trigg et al 2013 li et al 2019a a probability distance function i e cf was produced to express the probability pr that n points along a specified direction are all valued above the threshold value journel et al 2000 3 cf n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 where π is the product operator i uj zc represents an indicator of the variable z uj at location uj that exceeds the threshold value zc which is defined as i uj zc 1 if z uj zc and i uj zc 0 otherwise the underlying principles of the geostatistical method are described in detail in trigg et al 2013 in this study the cf of surface hydrological connectivity in north south n s and west east w e directions was investigated across the poyang lake floodplain system which represents an average condition of the whole lake floodplain system li et al 2019a the n s and w e are approximately parallel and perpendicular to the lake s main flow direction i e from south to north respectively all of the above statistical analyses were conducted using the matlab software 4 results 4 1 hydrodynamic model validation the modelled and observed water levels and outflow discharges at the five lake gauging stations matched well during the validation years of 2006 and 2010 based on a time series visual inspection and statistical evaluation i e ens r 2 and rmse fig 5 the goodness of fit statistics showed that the rmse values of the water levels were 0 43 m the ens varied from 0 94 to 0 97 and r 2 ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 for the dry and wet years the lake outflow discharges at the hukou gauging station also showed satisfactory agreement between the simulated and observed series the associated values of ens and r 2 varied from 0 90 to 0 91 and 0 92 to 0 94 respectively suggesting a reasonable simulation for the lake hydrodynamic field however the model results were somewhat overestimated during the lake dry seasons i e december february as illustrated in fig 5a e the impact of the complex topography on model generated patterns of hydrodynamic behaviors can almost be ignored during the flood periods i e june august and amplified during the low level dry periods fig 6 shows that the hydrodynamic model is generally capable of simulating daily water surface areas for the lake floodplain system producing r 2 in range of 0 93 0 95 for both the hydrological years it is noteworthy that the slight discrepancies between the simulation and the remote sensing can be partly attributable to the difference between the model s mesh sizes i e 70 1500 m and the remote sensing resolution 30 m 30 m overall the results presented in figs 5 and 6 suggest both the phase and magnitude of temporal dynamics have similar precisions during dry and wet years which demonstrates that the current mike 21 model has the capability to reproduce major hydrological behaviors in the floodplain system of poyang lake 4 2 effects of seasonal lake group 4 2 1 lake water level changes the effects of the seasonal lake group within the poyang lake s floodplains in terms of the water level difference between the natural condition and hypothetical condition are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 for both the main lake and the floodplain regions the simulation results show that the coupling effects of the seasonal lake group on the water levels during the flood months e g june august were distinctly weaker than during the dry winter months e g december february of 2006 and 2010 that is the hypothetical condition results in a more likely high water level than the natural condition during the dry seasons as reflected in an increased water level of the main lake by up to 0 6 m and 0 4 m for the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 respectively figs 7 and 8 in addition the corresponding water level increases of the floodplain regions reached 0 9 m for both the dry year and the wet year the seasonal lake group tended to have a limited effect on water level changes for both the main lake and the floodplains 0 2 m during the flood seasons especially for the typical wet year 2010 0 m in general the influences of the seasonal lake groups on water levels were stronger during the dry year 2006 than the wet year 2010 and more significant during the drier dry seasons than the wetter wet seasons it is likely that the impact of bathymetry adjustment on water level behaviors is more significant during the dry seasons than the flood seasons fig 9 shows the changes in the spatial pattern of the water level during the flood and dry period of 2006 and 2010 respectively the results revealed that in general the lake wide pattern during the flood periods fig 9a and fig 9b exhibited a similar spatial distribution to that during the dry periods fig 9c and d however the spatial water levels in the dry periods presented more significant changes i e up to 1 6 m than in the flood periods i e up to 0 6 m as expected although water level reductions were observed in some floodplain regions the water level increases were found across the majority of the lake floodplains fig 9 additionally the water level variations in the floodplains 0 6 m were distinctly higher than those of the main lake 0 2 m for both hydrological years this is an expected outcome given that the local bathymetry changes and the associated flow structure may substantially influence water level behaviors throughout the lake floodplains the results presented here indicate that the contribution of the seasonal lake group to the lake floodplain behaviors has experienced a significantly spatial change 4 2 2 lake flood flashiness changes in the water level behavior of the main poyang lake are inextricably linked to the flood signature fig 10 shows the calculated r b flashiness index for the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 between the natural and hypothetical conditions the results show that the r b index in the lake s downstream area was significantly higher than that of the upstream area under both conditions indicating different responses of the flood flashiness across the lake s length i e from xingzi gauging station to kangshan gauging station in addition the values of the r b flashiness index under hypothetical condition were obviously higher than those of the natural condition for both the dry year and the wet year although small r b index values were observed at the four gauging stations i e 7 7 9 0 10 3 fig 10 these results indicate that the hypothetical conditions are more likely to result in a flashier flood regime in dry years than wet years suggesting a possible impact of the seasonal lake group this is a logical outcome of the bathymetry changes for the floodplains to increase water level dynamics and hydrological variability particularly in the lake dry conditions 4 2 3 lake discharge changes the outflow of poyang lake i e at hukou gauging station is an important indicator of the lake yangtze river interactions the effects of the seasonal lake group on the outflow discharge are shown in fig 11 taking 2006 and 2010 as examples the simulations revealed that the outflow discharge may exhibit a complex response i e positive and negative differences to the condition of without the seasonal lake group furthermore more pronounced outflow changes were visible during the dry year 2006 and the dry seasons in 2010 fig 11 it follows that the blocking role of the yangtze river may be a key process affecting the lake outflow condition as discussed by li et al 2017a generally the seasonal lake group is likely to play a minor role in affecting the lake discharge regime mainly because the accumulated lake discharges appear to be unchanged between the hypothetical and the natural conditions fig 12 4 2 4 lake water area changes fig 13 shows the lake water area changes between the hypothetical and natural conditions similar to the water level variations the effects of the seasonal lake group on water area changes tended to be more significant during dry months than flood months based on a comparison of 2006 and 2010 although the seasonal lake group may lead to a small effect on changes in water area 50 km2 during the flood months a significant increase in water area 120 km2 was observed during the other months of the year averaged over 2006 and 2010 overall it seems that the seasonal lake group is most likely to exert a significant impact on the entire lake water area during the relatively dry seasons i e approximately 10 18 see fig 13 indicating a possible effect of the floodplain bathymetry changes on inundation dynamics 4 2 5 dry wet hydrological shift and dynamics it is essential to assess dry wet hydrological shifts in floodplains that characterize transitional processes induced by hydrological behavior fig 14 shows the effects of seasonal lake groups on dry wet hydrological shifts in the floodplain system of poyang lake as determined from hydrodynamic simulation of the hypothetical and natural conditions the simulations revealed that slight changes in hydrological shift dwf i e 2 8 were found in the main lake regions while obvious changes in dwf i e by up to 30 were observed in the floodplain regions for both the dry and wet years however the decreased dwf could also be found in the southern floodplains of the lake fig 14 these previous results indicate that the hypothetical condition is more likely to promote a dry wet hydrological shift across the floodplain system relative to variations in the natural condition additionally the changes in the dry wet shift in the dry year 2006 were slightly stronger than in the wet year 2010 furthermore the hypothetical condition in combination with the bathymetry changes is expected to enhance the floodplain connectivity see the next section potentially contributing to the dry wet shift 4 2 6 hydrological connectivity and changes changes in the hydrological behavior of the lake floodplain system are inextricably linked to the dynamic surface hydrological connectivity which largely depends on changes in bathymetry changes fig 15 shows the spatial patterns of surface hydrological connectivity in the poyang lake floodplain under hypothetical and natural conditions as determined from the hydrodynamic field and the associated streamline trajectory for clarity this is illustrated for four major periods during the water level hydrograph dry rising flood and recession for both years the n s connectivity exhibited a more continuous pathway than the w e connectivity during all four periods because of the north south orientation of the water flow of the main lake fig 15 in addition the w e connectivity increases rapidly from the dry to flood period then decreases during the recession period as expected in general visual comparison revealed that the hypothetical condition tends to enhance the hydrological connectivity in the center regions of the lake s floodplains this is a logical outcome of the bathymetry adjustment for the seasonal lake group relative to the natural condition to ensure flow connectivity geostatistical analysis of the hydrodynamic results of the lake floodplain produced a series of connectivity function curves cf for the two typical years as shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively the cf plots showed that the hydrological connectivity in both n s and w e was much stronger during the spring and summer seasons i e cf values were close to 1 0 than during the autumn and winter seasons i e cf values could decrease to 0 figs 16 and 17 as expected the cf results also revealed that the linkage of the surface water pathway in the n s direction is greater 130 km see the x axis in figs 16 and 17 than that of the w e direction 80 km because of the n s orientation of the main flow across the lake s length in addition daily plots of cf figs 16 and 17 indicate that the connectivity behaviors in the w e direction tend to be more dynamic than those in the n s suggesting a dominant role of w e connectivity is influencing the lake floodplain interactions these findings coincide with the fact that the topographical slope of the lake floodplain interactions is greater in the w e direction than the n s direction although it was beyond the scope of this study to quantify the degree of hydrological connectivity in an accurate manner the results suggested that high hydrological connectivity i e cf values close to 1 0 occurs during summer season june august while low connectivity i e cf values can drop to 0 occurs during winter season december february whereas intermediate connectivity arises during other months of the year figs 16 and 17 for both the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 the hypothetical condition may play an important role in enhancing the n s connectivity throughout the year relative to the natural condition especially for the winter months along with low connectivity notably the results presented in figs 16 and 17 indicate that w e connectivity may have exerted positive and or negative responses to the hypothetical condition along the water pathway except during the summer flood period in the wet year 2010 fig 17b the results presented herein further indicate that the seasonal lake group may have significant effects on hydrological connectivity in the lake s floodplains during the drier dry seasons overall the results indicate that hydrological connectivity is at least partially responsible for the inundation dynamics e g fig 13 and the associated dry wet hydrological shift fig 14 within the floodplain of poyang lake 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other relevant work river and lake floodplains are most often geomorphologically dynamic systems characterized by highly complex surface processes and exchanges thomas et al 2015 however few studies of the hydrological behaviors of floodplain systems have been conducted to date due at least in part to difficulty collecting the fundamental data karim et al 2015 khaki and awange 2019 among these floodplains the poyang lake system is unique in that it has a large number of seasonal lakes within its floodplains hydrological and hydrodynamic processes within shallow floodplains are strongly dependent on the bathymetry changes and many previous studies have attempted to investigate the influences of bathymetry changes in rivers or lakes on the surrounding floodplain hydrology using remote sensing techniques and physically based models trigg et al 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 yao et al 2018 reisenbüchler et al 2019 for floodplains of poyang lake lai et al 2014 used remote sensing and field survey data to investigate the influence of sand mining on the water level variations during the dry season of poyang lake they found that the decline in lake levels is closely related to extensive sand mining and the associated bathymetry changes in the outflow channels similarly jiang et al 2015 used hydrological remote sensing and bathymetry data to analyze the sand mining and associated hydrological responses during 2001 2010 they found that a wider and deeper outflow channel in the northern lake resulted in rapid lake discharge and subsequently lower water levels during the dry seasons more recently yao et al 2018 quantified the contribution of changes in bathymetry to the low water levels in different hydrological years based on a combination of bathymetry data and hydrodynamic models they concluded that the bottom erosion of the northern outflow channel exerts a more significant role in decreasing the low water levels and enhancing the drought during the dry seasons these previous studies of floodplain hydrology have mainly focused on bathymetry changes in the related river or lake flow channels and the associated effects potentially leading to insufficient references for the assessment of bathymetry changes in the complex floodplain areas of poyang lake the results of the present study further extend the findings of previous work lai et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 by providing new insight into the possible contribution of changes in bathymetry in floodplains to hydrological behaviors using a two dimensional hydrodynamic model comparison with previous studies of poyang lake indicates that bathymetry changes in both the main channels and the floodplains of the lake may have significant effects on the hydrological behaviors during the dry seasons while making limited contributions during flood seasons however the effects of bathymetry changes in the main flow channel are likely to be more pronounced i e several meters yao et al 2018 than those of the lake s floodplains i e 1 m this study because of the different magnitudes of water level variations overall the results of this study improve our understanding of the bathymetry effects of the floodplain poyang lake and other similar floodplain regions worldwide 5 2 floodplain bathymetry and management implications the combination of natural and anthropogenic processes results in spatiotemporal variations in floodplain bathymetry van der most and hudson 2018 yao et al 2018 the location of suitable ecological indicators e g aquatic habitat and vegetation type across the floodplains is dependent on floodplain geomorphology and hydrology e g junk et al 1989 van der most and hudson 2018 changes in bathymetry in floodplains may lead to changes in hydrological and hydrodynamic processes affecting inundation extent and timing which play significant roles in dominating biogeochemical cycles occurring in floodplains marks et al 2000 malhadas et al 2009 for poyang lake the erosion of the lake s main flow channels and the deposition of the floodplains occurred from the 1990s to 2010s this could be attributed to the afforestation and reservoir construction program in the lake s catchment and the natural state of slight deposition and sand mining within the lake wu et al 2015 notably sand mining has extended from the northern lake to the southern lake and the bathymetry has been experienced a dynamic changing environment jiang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 the results of this study have important implications regarding the management and planning of floodplains in poyang lake the erosion and deposition of the floodplain lake may directly influence the hydrological regime and the associated floodplain connectivity more importantly dynamic connectivity between seasonal lakes and surrounding floodplain regions potentially play important roles in downstream channels of the lake through temporary inputs of materials and energy li et al 2019a several studies have concluded that the seasonal hydrological connectivity in poyang lake plays an important role in the water quality and ecosystem of the floodplain system xia et al 2016 li et al 2019a considering the outcomes of this study the seasonal lake group may play a limited role in regulating the lake s flood event during summer which is different from previous conclusions e g hu et al 2015 however stored water during the recession period is highly valued for its ecosystem protection services and biodiversity conservation hu et al 2015 ji 2017 although the floodplains are usually large and remote increasing human interventions are directly influencing the seasonal lakes and the associated floodplain settings wu and liu 2017 notably a large number of seasonal lakes high on the floodplains will also infrequently obtain flood water from the main lake from a hydrodynamic perspective the whole lake floodplain system is inundated during the flood months leading to a high connectivity between the main lake and the seasonal lakes however the water flow velocities throughout the system are small and the associated hydrodynamic field is stable during this high lake level period li et al 2014 accordingly the lake floodplain system is mainly controlled by the flow regime of the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 rather than changes in bathymetry in both the floodplains e g the seasonal lake group and the main lake e g sand mining during the other seasons e g rising falling and dry the floodplain inundation of poyang lake is more sensitive to the water level changes than that of the flood season in other words changes in floodplain bathymetry may alter the water flow pathway and the associated surface hydrological connectivity and hence lead to a highly dynamic and complex hydrodynamic field li et al 2014 lake and wetland managers should pay more attention to the local bathymetry changes and associated flow connectivity during the dry seasons which can be simple and in many cases practical from a conservation perspective floodplain engineering e g levee construction and sluice gates should be avoided in the natural floodplains of poyang lake because the floodplain hydrology and ecological processes are sensitive to any changes in the region 5 3 limitations and uncertainties it should be noted that there are limitations and uncertainties associated with applying hypothetical conditions in a hydrodynamic model to bathymetry adjustment floodplain structure and model mesh size exact quantification of these uncertainties would significantly increase the scope of our study although the arc hydro tool was adopted to set up the hypothetical scenario modification of the elevations for the seasonal lake group using the bathymetry adjustment method is only close to the surrounding terrains although influences of the seasonal lake group on hydrological behaviors in the poyang lake floodplain were investigated in this study the outcomes from the hypothetical conditions may have had somewhat different outcomes if other bathymetry adjustment techniques had been used however the hydrodynamic model along with a bathymetry adjustment approach may be the best manner to distinguish the effects of numerous seasonal lakes which can be applicable to other similar floodplain systems our future work will certainly consider new and novelty methods of investigation that build on our current research the current hydrodynamic model exhibits its ability to provide continuous and dynamic datasets but the cell resolution remains a significant issue when capturing complex floodplain structure and environment li et al 2019a b tan et al 2019 within the floodplains of poyang lake there are numerous long narrow shallow channel networks with complex interactions considering the extensive data and computational requirements of the hydrodynamic model it is important to note that the model necessitated some simplifications to the channel networks which may lead to errors in the hydrodynamic simulations and the associated floodplain assessments for example simplification of the channel networks in the hydrodynamic modeling may strongly influence flow connectivity and inundation dynamics of floodplains tan et al 2019 despite these limitations the present model is considered to be adequate as an important attempt at physical simulation of the complex poyang lake floodplain system this is because a comparative analysis between hypothetical and natural conditions allows us to eliminate the effects of uncertainty factors on the current results the model also has high potential to be applied to various floodplain settings in which hydrological observations are sparse missing or inconsistent 5 4 future research further studies are required to obtain remote sensing data that have been widely used to describe complex floodplain environments and validate hydrodynamic models the combination of hydrodynamic models and remote sensing data will provide valuable new insights into the dynamic natural system and evolution of floodplains notably the chinese government has launched a key research program beautiful china zhao 2019 to perform a joint assessment of the hydrodynamics water quality and ecology of the floodplain poyang lake for the purpose of management and protection additionally floodplain groundwater is an important topic in the study of floodplain lakes because of the close relationships between the floodplains and the lake li et al 2018a 2019b therefore future studies of floodplain systems should be paid more attention to the water quality wetland ecosystem and lake health using dynamic surface groundwater modeling coupled with relevant ecological processes future study into the effects of bathymetry changes in the floodplain of poyang lake should develop sediment transport models for a comprehensive investigation of the effects of bathymetric variability on floodplain behaviors 6 conclusions seasonal shallow small lakes are distinctive hydrological units in floodplains that have significant implications for various functions of many floodplain systems despite the hydrological and ecological importance of seasonal lakes in the extensive floodplains of poyang lake the present study is the first to investigate the coupled effects of seasonal lakes on hydrological behaviors within a large floodplain lake system using a physically based hydrodynamic model along with a bathymetry adjustment method we expect to overcome the limitations of current studies exploring seasonal lakes in the data limited environment of the poyang lake floodplain the hydrodynamic model reproduced the lake floodplain hydrodynamics reasonably well during the dry year 2006 and the wet year 2010 the simulated results reveal that in general the temporal influences of the seasonal lake group on water levels lake outflow discharges and associated inundation dynamics were stronger during the dry year than the wet year and this difference was greater during the drier dry seasons 2006 than the wetter wet seasons 2010 the results show that on average the role of the seasonal lake group during the dry seasons is around several times stronger than during the flood seasons in terms of the magnitudes of different hydrological responses e g water level outflow and inundation area the spatial effects of the seasonal lake group on the hydrological behaviors of the lake s floodplains were more significant than those of the main lake for both hydrological years indicating a sensitive response of the floodplain settings in addition the seasonal lake group is more likely to play an important role in the surface hydrological connectivity across the lake floodplains potentially influencing the dry wet hydrological shift indicating an important role of the floodplain bathymetry changes the outcomes from this study can be extended to other similar floodplain regions by providing improved understanding of the bathymetry changes and the associated lake floodplain management declaration of

6132,the classical aquitard drainage model compac was used to simulate the deformation of a one dimensional vertically heterogeneous aquitard i e heter compac by coupling heter compac with the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach the vertical heterogeneities of hydraulic conductivity k v elastic specific storage s ske and inelastic specific storage s skp fields could be characterized with the availability of long term multi extensometer data the methodology was first tested through a group of ten synthetic cases with randomly generated k v s ske and s skp fields results of the synthetic cases revealed that a geostatistical model could characterize the variability of aquitard hydraulic parameter fields and yields improved fits of simulated versus observed zone deformation than a geological model that treats each zone to be homogeneous subsequently the methodology was applied to a research site situated in changzhou city jiangsu province china where long term deformation behaviors of the strata within the aquifer aquitard system have been monitored vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp fields of the investigated aquitard at the site were characterized using the quasi linear geostatistical approach the correlation length of the three fields that yielded the best quality fit was assessed to be approximately 50 m and the fitting quality was slightly improved in comparison with that produced from calibrating a geological or zonation model through monte carlo analysis of aquitard deformation utilizing the inversed parameters and corresponding uncertainties the investigated aquitard is estimated to have compacted 914 8 42 6 mm before the rise in groundwater levels in adjoining aquifers keywords aquitard heterogeneity geostatistical inverse modeling multi extensometer data groundwater level variations 1 introduction aquitards or confining layers are strata with distinctly lower permeability that allow for minor groundwater seepage rates in a porous groundwater system in some areas aquitards may be horizontally extensive and they may account for more than half of the system thickness zhou et al 2013 and may exchange large volumes of groundwater with adjacent aquifers through the large contact surface they share margat and gun 2013 aquitards usually consist of fine grained sediments such as silts and clays while aquifers typically consist of coarse grained sediments such as sands and gravels clayey grains have electric charges on their surfaces and are aggregated when deposited forming an aggregate with the pore size being frequently larger than the grain diameter thus aquitards tend to have larger porosities freeze and cherry 1979 and higher storativity leake 1990 under the condition of long term pumping groundwater from a semi confined aquifer system aquitards may dominate the depletion of groundwater storage konikow and neuzil 2007 and play a vital role in the investigation of land subsidence rudolph and frind 1991 the most distinct feature of aquitards is its hydraulic conductivity k which is usually less than 10 8 m s neuzil 1986 the widespread presence of aquitards associated with low k makes aquitards play a pivotal role in protecting aquifers supplying potable water from contamination bonte et al 2015 harrison et al 1992 however the aquitard can be a sink if aquifer contaminants diffuse into aquitards and it turns to be a source of contaminants when back diffusion occurs due to the decline of aquifer concentration yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b a typical challenge in front of groundwater remediation strategies is the presence of subsurface heterogeneities adamson et al 2014 sedimentary deposits are inherently heterogeneous the aquitard heterogeneity is frequently encountered in nature and is one of the main challenges associated with aquitard characterization maliva 2016 accurate characterization of aquitard heterogeneity is critical for evaluating leakage rates predicting land subsidence and improving the efficiency of groundwater remediation undoubtedly aquitard characterization is extremely significant at hazardous waste sites geophysical methods have been widely used to map subsurface heterogeneity but they do not provide direct information on hydraulic parameters illman 2014 traditionally the heterogeneity in aquitard hydraulic parameters is obtained from laboratory tests on small samples with permeameters and odeometers larroque et al 2013 smith et al 2016 however parameter estimates obtained from laboratory tests of small scale samples may not be representative of in situ conditions smith et al 2013 van der kamp 2001 due to unavoidable stress perturbation during the processes of drilling sealing transportation and laboratory testing clark 1998 quantifying aquitard heterogeneity faces more challenges than characterizing aquifer heterogeneities because observational data regarding aquitards are typically rare however if different types of monitoring data such as pore pressure acworth et al 2017 larroque et al 2013 smith et al 2016 solute transport hendry and wassenaar 2009 and stratification deformation data zhuang et al 2017b are available hydrogeological researchers would like to focus on the quantitative characterization of aquitard heterogeneity the vertical heterogeneity of an aquitard can be dealt with a geological or zonation model which is usually constructed based on the analysis of borehole logs or geophysical logging in geological models an aquitard is vertically divided into multiple zones where the hydraulic parameters e g k v s ske and s skp are assumed to be homogeneous everywhere within a distinct zone and to be typically different from other zones based on the good hydrogeological information at the long term aquitard research site king site in southern saskatchewan canada hendry and wassenaar 2009 examined the influence of geological heterogeneities on the transport of δ18o and δd within a clay till aquitard at a high resolution 30 cm and found that the heterogeneity causes both major and minor deviations from one dimensional diffusion profiles through both synthetic and field application cases zhuang et al 2017b conducted a study of characterizing the vertical heterogeneity of k v s ske and s skp in which the aquitard of interest was vertically divided into multiple geologically distinct homogeneous zones in their study multi compac which was developed from compac helm 1975 to simulate the drainage of an aquitard consisting of multiple zones was coupled with pest welter et al 2015 a parameter estimation code to calibrate long term multi extensometer data their research showed that consideration of distinct geological zones yielded dramatically improved calibration results in comparison to the homogeneous case for a highly heterogeneous thick aquitard an increasing number of zones will be needed if one hopes to characterize the heterogeneity at high resolution because a coarse delineation of geologically distinct zones will lose intralayer heterogeneity however specific delineation of geological zones may be laborious and it is hard to determine which kind of delineation is accurate or more realistic an alternative method to deal with heterogeneity is the geostatistical approach de marsily et al 2005 geostatistical or stochastic inverse modeling could provide details to heterogeneity but the key is to obtain relevant data within aquifer and aquitard units at the resolution of site characterization needed yeh and liu 2000 geostatistical inverse models have also been widely used to deal with spatial heterogeneity of aquifers e g carrera and glorioso 1991 kitanidis 1995 kitanidis 1996 yeh et al 1995 yeh et al 1996 recently both laboratory sandbox berg and illman 2011 illman 2015 zhao et al 2016 and field investigations zhao and illman 2017 zhao and illman 2018 revealed that the geostatistical models produced smaller discrepancy between observed and simulated aquifer drawdowns than a geological model in particular zhao and illman 2018 were able to map both the three dimensional interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of a multi aquifer aquitard system through hydraulic tomography despite the promising performance of geostatistical inverse models for aquifer characterization to the best of our knowledge geostatistical inverse models have not been used to map the vertical heterogeneity of a highly compressible aquitard highly compressible aquitards will undergo both elastic and inelastic deformation in response to groundwater level changes within adjacent aquifers elastic deformation means that the sediment can return to its original state after the stress has been released while inelastic deformation means that the compaction of sediments is irreversible when the stress recovers long term aquitard deformation data provide valuable information about aquitard hydraulic parameters such as the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v elastic skeletal specific storage s ske and inelastic skeletal specific storage s skp cleveland et al 1992 helm 1975 riley 1969 assuming that hydraulic parameters are constant the aquitard deformation process can be simulated using the classical one dimensional finite difference model compac of helm 1975 which is applicable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquitards except in the study by zhuang et al 2017b compac has been used frequently to simulate the deformation of a homogeneous aquitard e g hoffmann et al 2003 liu and helm 2008a liu and helm 2008b luo et al 2016 pope and burbey 2004 zhuang et al 2017a specially if multiple vertical extensometers are installed at different depths within a relatively thick aquitard long term multi extensometer data may be calibrated to reveal the vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp the objective of this study is to explore the robustness of using a geostatistical model to characterize the vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp of a relatively thick highly compressible aquitard long term deformation data provided by multiple extensometers placed within the investigated aquitard is used for model calibration the calibration performance will be first evaluated through synthetic cases then the long term deformation data collected from the multi extensometer research site f00 situated in changzhou city jiangsu province china will be interpreted for aquitard characterization 2 methodology 2 1 forward modeling we consider a vertically heterogeneous highly compressible aquitard that is interbedded between two aquifers the hydraulic parameters k v s ske and s skp are assumed to be stochastic in space and constant in time we are aware that such three hydraulic parameters are not constant in real situations particularly for a thick highly compressible aquitard rudolph and frind 1991 under normal circumstances the porosities of fine grained deposits will decrease with time during the compaction process and the storativity and hydraulic conductivity decrease with time as a consequence actually we are aware of the limitation in the assumption of time constant parameters for aquitard layers instead in this study we focus our efforts on the vertical heterogeneity of a relatively thick aquitard and ignore the process of hydraulic parameter values varying with time assuming the aquitard remains saturated in the transient response to groundwater level variations within adjacent aquifers the governing equation for transient one dimensional vertical flow within the aquitard can be expressed as 1 z k v z h z s sk z h t where h h z t is the hydraulic head at time t and location z k v and s sk are the vertically variable hydraulic conductivity and skeletal specific storage respectively during the deformation process s sk s skp when h h and s sk s ske when h h where h is the preconsolidation head and s skp and s ske are inelastic and elastic skeletal specific storages respectively eq 1 represents the constant coefficient aquitard drainage model compac of helm 1975 for a heterogeneous aquitard in this study we refer it to heter compac from now on to simulate the drainage process of a single heterogeneous aquitard with stochastic hydraulic parameter fields when solving equation 1 numerically it should be noted that the vertical distributions of s skp s ske and h are updated at every time step initial hydraulic head distribution throughout the space domain is assumed to be static boundary hydraulic heads are prescribed with hydraulic heads within overlying and underlying aquifers from monitoring data a one dimensional finite difference method is developed to solve equation 1 numerically by discretizing the aquitard thickness into m elements and discretizing the time domain into n t steps the temporal and spatial distribution of h can be easily obtained via the heter compac model if the aquitard can be divided into several zones according to the locations of multiple extensometers and the interfaces between the aquitard and adjacent aquifers the cumulative deformation f of a zone at the nth n n t time step can be computed as 2 f n 1 n j 1 j 1 χ δ h n j s ske j χ δ h n j s skp j δ z δ h n j where j is the number of elements within the zone of interest δ h n j h n j h n j where h n j and h n j are the average hydraulic heads at and before the nth time step respectively over the j th element within the zone of interest δ h n j h n j h n 1 j and χ δ h n j is an indicator function which is expressed as 3 χ δ h n j 1 for δ h n j 0 0 for δ h n j 0 2 2 geostatistical inversion approach here we introduce the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 to characterize the heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp within the aquitard this inversion approach is based on the bayes theorem and has been frequently applied in the research area of characterization of subsurface heterogeneity e g ahmed et al 2016 bakhos et al 2014 pollock and cirpka 2010 the objective function l can be expressed as 4 l f obs f s t r 1 f obs f s s x β t q 1 s x β where f obs n 1 is an observation vector of cumulative zone deformation n is the number of observation data f denotes the forward problem operator for computing the cumulative zone deformation with input parameter s s ln k v ln s ske ln s skp t is a 3m 1 vector of discrete values of the natural logarithm of m 1 vectors k v s ske and s skp the logarithmic function is used to enforce the positiveness of these parameters during the estimation process r is the n n covariance matrix of measurement errors x is a 3m 3 matrix that can be expressed as 5 x x 1 0 0 0 x 2 0 0 0 x 3 where x 1 x 2 x 3 are m 1 vectors of ones β is the 3 1 vector consisting of prior mean values of ln k v ln s ske and ln s sk p and q is the 3m 3m spatial covariance matrix of the natural logarithmic parameter fields a commonly used variogram function to represent the spatial covariance of a random parameter field in groundwater hydrology is the exponential model e g fienen et al 2008 fischer et al 2017 liu and kitanidis 2011 yeh and liu 2000 zhao and illman 2018 zhao et al 2016 therefore we also adopt the exponential variogram in this study thus q can be represented as 6 q q lnk v 0 0 0 q lns ske 0 0 0 q lns skp the structural parameters i e variances σ lnk v 2 σ lns ske 2 and σ lns skp 2 and correlation lengths λ lnk v λ lns ske and λ lns skp of the exponential variogram are considered as prior information the iterative scheme of quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 can be expressed as 7 s k 1 x η k 1 qh k t ξ k 1 where s k 1 is the currently estimated best parameter set and the two terms on the right side of equation 7 represents the calculated mean and fluctuations of s k 1 respectively h k f s k s k is the n 3m sensitivity matrix of the simulated cumulative zone deformation f s k with respect to the last parameter estimate s k η k 1 3 1 and ξ k 1 n 1 can be computed through solving the following cokriging equation 8 h k qh k t r λ i h k x h k x t 0 ξ k 1 η k 1 f obs f s k h k s k 0 where λ is a dynamic stability multiplier that is introduced by following the inverse procedure of zha et al 2014 to stabilize the solution of equation 8 since the forward problem i e equation 1 is non linear and non stationary a simple way to calculate the sensitivity matrix h k at each iteration is via the numerical finite difference approximations in this study the central difference method is used to calculate h k 9 h k i f s k s k i f s k δ s k i f s k δ s k i 2 δ s k i i 1 2 3 m where δ s k i is a small amount of variation in the i th parameter within the parameter vector s k to accelerate the parameter estimation process the line search algorithm soueid ahmed et al 2015 is applied 10 s k 1 s k 1 s k x s k where s k 1 is the final estimate of current iteration and x is a variable to be optimized after the iteration process is completed the posterior covariance of estimated s is computed as 11 cov pos q h k q x t t h k qh k t r h k x h k x t 0 1 h k q x t the diagonal elements of cov pos represent the posterior variance of individual elements of the estimated s then the confidence intervals of individual estimates are calculated to be s 1 96 s t d s s 1 96 std s where std denotes the standard deviation 3 synthetic cases a synthetic one dimensional aquifer aquitard system is first considered where a vertically heterogeneous aquitard is 60 m thick and underlain by a confined aquifer and overlain by an unconfined aquifer there are four vertical extensometers i e e1 e2 e3 and e4 fig 1 placed within the system e1 and e4 are placed at the aquifer aquitard interfaces and e2 and e3 are placed inside of the aquitard fig 1 the four extensometers uniformly divide the aquitard into three zones according to their locations so each zone is 20 m thick extensometers record the long term movement of interfaces thus the transient deformation of each zone can be easily derived under natural conditions hydraulic properties are dependent on the shape packing and degree of sorting of sediment grains and orders of magnitudes of changes in aquitard hydraulic conductivity and specific storage may be observed in a multi aquifer aquitard sequence situated in an alluvial plain to explore the performance of using a geostatistical model to characterize the vertical heterogeneities of non elastic aquitard drainage model parameters k v s ske and s skp several synthetic cases which are independent from each other are considered the findings from only one synthetic case may not be sufficient to conclude about the robustness of geostatistical inverse modeling therefore we randomly generated 10 synthetic cases with varying parameter fields to investigate the inverse modeling performance in all 10 synthetic cases ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields are assumed to be normally distributed and are randomly and independently generated by the random field generator of davis 1987 with no truncation for the karhunen loeve kl expansion a larger truncation value leads to a smoother gaussian field no truncation means that the generated parameter fields are much less smooth which is more likely to occur within fine grained low k aquitard units in comparison to coarse grained aquifers for all the 10 synthetic cases input mean values of ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields for the generator are set to be 4 15 11 51 and 7 60 while the corresponding geometric means of k v s ske and s skp fields are 1 58 10 2 m year or 5 0 10 10 m s 1 0 10 5 m 1 and 5 0 10 4 m 1 respectively input spatial variances of ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields are 1 0 0 5 and 0 5 respectively input correlation lengths for the three log transformed parameter fields in the vertical direction are all set be 40 m it is noteworthy that the means variances and experimental correlation lengths of the generated fields are often not identical to but are usually around the corresponding input values randomly generated ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields for the 10 synthetic cases fig s1 are provided in the supporting information section elastic aquitard deformation is usually caused by rising hydraulic heads within adjacent aquifers while the continuous decline in hydraulic heads caused by long term and high intensity groundwater extraction often triggers inelastic aquitard deformation to simulate aquitard deformation the initial hydraulic head distribution within the aquitard i e initial condition together with hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers i e dirichlet boundary condition should be provided a uniform hydraulic head of 70 m is assumed for all nodes at the initial state it is also assumed that there is no initial preconsolidation head within the aquitard hydraulic head in the underlying confined aquifer is specified to experience three uniform stages of linear variations with time associated with a seasonal fluctuation with an amplitude of 2 m each stage lasts 20 years the overall declining rates for the three stages are 2 m year 0 5 m year and 1 5 m year respectively hydraulic head within the overlying aquifer is assumed to remain constant during the 60 year study period specific variation patterns of aquifer hydraulic head are shown in fig 2 the synthetic aquitard is uniformly discretized into 120 elements with a uniform element size of 0 5 m the study period is uniformly discretized into 240 steps with a uniform step size of 0 25 year thus there are 720 240 time steps 3 zones observational deformation data utilized for geostatistical inversion observational data are produced by running the heter compac model with the parameters in real space i e not using the log transformed parameters and the same initial and boundary conditions one popular assumption is that the measurement errors are independent from each other and are zero mean white noise sequences with a normal probability distribution hence after the forward run a random measurement error with a variance of 1 0 mm2 is added to each observational data taking the 7th synthetic case as an example the observed zone deformation data are shown in fig 2 the accuracy of the simulation is verified by conducting additional runs using a refined mesh which yielded similar results before conducting the geostatistical inversion for each synthetic case a geological model constructed based on extensometer locations which is similar to the work of zhuang et al 2017b is used to conduct parameter estimation we use pest doherty 2008 to complete the estimation the input mean values for the random fields for all synthetic cases are utilized as the initial guess for each synthetic case the geological model yields 9 3 zones 3 fields parameter estimates as pointed out by zhuang et al 2017b a geological model will lead to parameter estimates with extremely narrow 95 confidence intervals if each zone is independently homogeneous however this may not be true for an aquitard with randomly distributed parameter fields geostatistical inversion requires the input of structural parameters i e variances and correlation lengths of involved parameter fields structural parameters are commonly determined by fitting the point scale estimates which could be obtained from slug tests or laboratory experimental tests using a variogram function kitanidis 1991 kitanidis 2007 for real applications multiple slug tests conducted within a single aquitard are generally unavailable in addition laboratory experimental results of aquitard hydraulic parameters are always not representative in situ conditions as reported in the literature furthermore while above structural parameters could also be estimated during inverse modeling as pointed out by vesselinov et al 2001 this could lead to numerical difficulties thus it appears that estimating structural parameters for a highly compressive aquitard is impracticable in this study we assume that structural parameters are known focus on testing the reliability of the inversion procedure and compare the inversed parameter fields with those obtained from a geologic model for the synthetic simulation the input values of means variances and correlation lengths that are used to generate the random parameter fields are assigned as prior information for each synthetic case the geostatistical inversion yields 360 120 elements 3 fields parameter estimates in eq 8 the initial value of the dynamic stability multiplier λ is set to be 10 0 with an increasing factor of 5 0 if the objective function l as shown in eq 4 increases and a decreasing factor of 2 0 if l decreases during each iteration the initial value of the variable x to be optimized as shown in eq 10 is set to be 1 0 suggesting that the line search algorithm starts to optimize the current estimate s k 1 the sensitivity matrix h during iterations is calculated in parallel to save on computational time inversed parameter fields for each synthetic case are all listed in fig s1 upon the completion of the parameter estimation either based on a geological or geostatistical model two mean square errors mse are calculated to assess the fitting performance which are expressed as 12 ms e 1 1 n i n f i obs f i s fit 2 13 ms e 2 1 m i m p i true p i esti 2 where f i obs is the i th value in the vector of observed deformation f obs f i is the i th value in the vector of simulated deformation with respect to the vector of final parameter estimates s fit 9 1 for the geological model and 360 1 for the geostatistical model p i true is the i th value in the vector of true parameters i e ln k v ln s ske or ln s skp and p i esti is the i th value in the vector of estimated parameters eq 12 is used to assess the fit between observed and simulated zone deformation and eq 13 is used to assess the fit between true and estimated parameter fields note that the geological model based parameter estimates are assigned to corresponding elements when using eq 13 for all synthetic cases ms e 1 values are listed in table 1 and ms e 2 values are listed in table 2 it can be seen from table 1 that the geostatistical inverse procedure yields excellent ms e 1 values which in all cases are as expected close to the assigned variance of measurement errors i e σ obs 2 1 0 mm2 in addition we find that the geostatistical inverse procedure characterizes the overall varying patterns of the three parameter fields especially the k v and s skp fields fig s1 suggesting the robustness of the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach table 1 and table 2 reveal that the geological model in most cases yields relatively poor calibration performance suggesting that the geological model may be less suitable to characterize the highly heterogeneous fields of aquitard hydraulic parameters in comparison the geostatistical model generally fits the observational data much better table 1 furthermore the parameter fields estimated from the geostatistical model are much closer to the true ones table 2 although the geological model yields fairly good performance in fitting observational data for cases 3 7 and 8 the geostatistical model performs uniformly better for all cases table 1 the advantage in the calibration performance of the geostatistical inverse model over the geological model is mainly due to the fact that the geostatistical inverse model is able to capture the local heterogeneities of the parameter fields between and within each zone for example taking case 7 which yields the best fit of observational deformation data among all synthetic cases the geostatistical model images the overall varying patterns of the k v s ske and s skp fields fig 3 this is also true for case 10 fig s1 which yields a relatively lower fitting quality of the geological model and the worst fitting quality of the geostatistical model table 1 obviously the geological model yields lower resolution of the parameter fields in comparison to the geostatistical model this is mainly due to the fact that the geological model treats each zone to be homogeneous and it is not expected to map the interlayer heterogeneity fig 3 inversed parameter fields as shown in fig s1 show that a geostatistical inverse model results in relatively wide confidence intervals of parameters near the top boundary fig 3 this is inferred due to the fact that the hydraulic response near the top boundary of the aquitard always lags behind that near the bottom boundary and the deformation near the top boundary is less sensitive to hydraulic head variations in the lower aquifer than the location near the bottom boundary in other words in order to narrow the confidence intervals of parameter estimates near the top boundary the overlying aquifer should also stress the investigated aquitard fig s1 also shows that both geostatistical and geological models lead to lower resolution and wider confidence intervals of the s ske field than the other two fig s1 and fig 3 this is inferred due to the fact that the elastic effects are masked by delayed drainage yan and burbey 2008 zhuang et al 2017b in other words the observational data are not sensitive to apparent recoverable deformation fig 2 as a result in order to reduce the uncertainty of sske estimates monitoring should last for a longer period for the delayed drainage effect to dissipate so that elastic effects become more apparent to test above two inferences we conduct two additional synthetic cases fig s2 the first additional case case 11 is identical to the above ten cases the second additional case case 12 is based on the first one but it has a longer history of monitoring 80 years and the hydraulic head in the overlying aquifer is set to vary in the same pattern as that of the underlying aquifer in particular the fourth stage of the variation history of hydraulic head in both aquifers now lasts 40 years and is still associated with an overall declining rate of 1 5 m year inversed parameter fields fig s2 show that the uncertainty of parameter estimates for case 12 near the top boundary has been reduced furthermore by extending the monitoring duration the accuracy of sske estimates has been substantially improved especially for the geological model fig s2 overall the synthetic cases reveal that the geostatistical inverse model improves the characterization of vertical heterogeneities of aquitard hydraulic parameters when compared to the geological model 4 field application 4 1 background the study area is located in the southwestern portion of the su xi chang area i e suzhou wuxi and changzhou cities in jiangsu province of china situated in the southern part of the yangtze river delta fig 4 we focused our study on the multi extensometer research site located in the central area of changzhou city where to the north is yangtze river and to the southeast is tai lake changzhou city has experienced intensive land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction within the multi layered aquifer aquitard system consisting of quaternary sediments the extensometer group f00 fig 4 at the qingliang primary school of changzhou city is the only one extensometer group in su xi chang area that has documented long term deformation data for individual units zhang et al 2010 the ground elevation of f00 is about 4 4 m above mean sea level f00 was placed at one of the regional centres of groundwater level drawdown cones and was constructed in 1983 long term monitoring of deformation and hydraulic head at f00 commenced in 1984 there are four main aquifers in the changzhou city area including an unconfined aquifer and three confined aquifers fig 5 is a schematic diagram of the cross section at the f00 site showing the various major aquifer aquitard units the unconfined aquifer is not included because of its very small thickness the first confined aquifer mainly consists of silty sand and is generally buried at shallow depths 5 48 18 55 m the second confined aquifer is buried at intermediate depths 92 80 107 80 m and regionally distributed and it mainly consists of silty and fine sand the third confined aquifer is deeply buried 117 70 143 60 m and distributed mostly in the northern changzhou city and it mainly consists of silty to fine sand with interbedded clay zhuang et al 2015 the aquitard we are concerned in this study is the second aquitard which is 74 25 m thick and buried from 18 55 to 92 8 m beneath the land surface the second aquitard and bounding aquifers i e the first and second confined aquifers are regionally distributed in the su xi chang area as the main layer contributing to land subsidence in changzhou city area the long term deformation of the second aquitard has been monitored with four borehole extensometers i e e2 e3 e4 and e5 fig 5 of the extensometer group f00 which was constructed at the center of regional groundwater depression cone in 1983 and started its service from 1984 the layout and installation details of borehole extensometers at the f00 site can be referred to wang et al 2009 the four extensometers were installed at boundaries of three distinct zones which are with different lithology from one to the next the burial depths of the three zones are 18 55 35 70 m 35 70 71 32 m and 71 32 92 80 m respectively the zones consist of different types of soil particles suggesting vertical heterogeneity in hydraulic parameters table 3 overall the three zones consist of silty clay and clay 4 2 groundwater level variations groundwater extraction activities at changzhou city can be traced back to 1919 when the first deep well was completed the first confined aquifer is greatly affected by precipitation and can be directly recharged by the yangtze river due to poor water quality the first confined aquifer has not been exploited and its groundwater level has remained nearly unchanged over the entire groundwater extraction history the second confined aquifer is the major groundwater supply layer in su xi chang area due to its moderate burial depth high water storage capacity good water quality and the relatively high hydraulic conductivity hu et al 2009 the hydraulic conductivity of the second confined aquifer is approximately 5 8 10 5 m s shi et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 the natural groundwater levels for all aquifers in the si xi chang aquifer system were about 0 6 m below ground surface the long term record shows that the groundwater level within the second confined aquifer in changzhou city was close to the groundwater surface in early 1950s and the groundwater extraction rate was about 104 m3 d zhuang et al 2015 from the year of 1957 the number of deep pumping wells increased remarkably to meet the water demand of rapid economic development the second confined aquifer was overly exploited since the late 1970s and the overexploitation continued into the late 1990s the average extraction rate was less than 105 m3 d before 1970 then it increased to 2 105 m3 d in 1976 and 2 2 36 105 m3 d from 1982 to 1989 since groundwater extraction in su xi chang area caused dramatic groundwater level declines and resulted in severe land subsidence e g shi et al 2007 wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 the jiangsu province government strictly regulated groundwater exploitation from the year 1995 and prohibited the exploitation after the year 2000 observational data revealed that groundwater level variation in the second confined aquifer was not apparently affected by precipitation but it was closely related to regional groundwater extraction activities the average decline rate in groundwater level of the second confined aquifer at the f00 site was 0 7 m year 2 64 m year and 1 0 m year for the three time periods of 1950 1965 1965 1983 and 1983 1994 respectively zhuang et al 2015 although regional regulation of groundwater exploitation started at the year 1995 the groundwater level at the f00 site began to rise from 1994 fig 6 during the period of regulation 1995 2000 the groundwater level rebounded at an approximate rate of 0 9 m year while the average rebound rate increased to 3 0 m year from the year of prohibition to the end of concerned study period 2000 2004 fig 6 this demonstrated that the provincial policy regarding groundwater exploitation yielded remarkable control on groundwater level variations fig 6 shows the groundwater level variation pattern of the second confined aquifer which is recorded with much more detail from 1989 to 2004 than other time periods and one can refer to zhuang et al 2015 for the detailed information on groundwater level variations prior to 1989 4 3 deformation of the second aquitard groundwater level declines result in the dissipation of excess pore pressure and the release of water from storage and eventually cause land subsidence in the su xi chang area land subsidence is closely related to groundwater overexploitation in confined aquifers land subsidence in changzhou city was first observed in 1960s shi et al 2008 wang et al 2009 and accelerated during the 1970s at the f00 site groundwater level declined in the first and second confined aquifers causing the second aquitard to compact quickly prior to the regulation of groundwater exploitation fig 6 the second aquitard accounted for 54 3 of the total land subsidence during the period from 1984 to 2003 with the 3rd zone contributing to 64 6 of aquitard compaction zhang et al 2010 although the 3rd zone is thinner than the 2nd zone fig 5 it underwent a large degree of compaction fig 6 one of the main causes is that the 3rd zone directly overlies the second confined aquifer whose groundwater level intensively declined due to long term groundwater extraction while the groundwater level in the first confined aquifer was basically unchanged in other words groundwater level declined more in the 3rd zone than in the 2nd zone another cause is potentially rooted in the composition of soft clayey particle within the 3rd zone suggesting higher compressibility due to the low hydraulic conductivity of clayey sediments the equilibration and the drainage of the aquitard may proceed slowly and hydraulic heads within the aquitard lag far behind the groundwater level variations within adjacent aquifers resulting in the time delay of aquitard deformation fig 6 demonstrates that as the groundwater level in the second confined aquifer recovered since 1994 the 3rd and 2nd zones overall continued to compact until the end of data observation suggesting delayed drainage while the aquitard deformed the time delay in aquitard deformation is also to some extent attributed to the aquitard storativity or specific storage konikow and neuzil 2007 zhou et al 2013 zhuang et al 2017a which directly determines the volume of groundwater that can be extracted from pore spaces 4 4 characterization of parameter fields to characterize the vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp within the second aquitard we examined the groundwater variation data between 1950 and 2004 the deformation data we analyzed for parameter estimation are between 1989 and 2004 during which the groundwater level variation data in the second aquifer were both documented in detail as shown in fig 6 the groundwater level variations from 1950 to 1989 demonstrated in zhuang et al 2015 were fitted by a fourier series with two harmonic terms and r 2 being 99 81 zhuang et al 2017b for deriving the discretized groundwater level data with the same time step i e 0 25 year as shown in fig 6 since the initial groundwater level within the second confined aquifer was in a natural state we assume that there is no initial preconsolidation head within the second aquitard in the year of 1950 and the hydraulic head at the initial state is assumed to be linearly distributed within the second aquitard the aquitard thickness is discretized into 149 elements with the element size being approximately 0 5 m geological model based parameter estimates as shown in table 3 are used to derive the prior means and variances of the three parameter fields specifically the geological model parameter estimates are first assigned to the elements within corresponding zones then the geometric means of k v s ske and s skp fields are calculated to be 2 96 10 9 m s 1 19 10 5 m 1 and 4 11 10 4 m 1 respectively and the variances of log transformed parameter fields are calculated to be 3 91 1 17 and 0 10 respectively due to the lack of information on the monitoring work the variance of the measurement errors of the multi extensometer data is hard to determine for this field application we set the variance of the measurement error to be 1 0 mm2 assuming that the multi extensometer data are accurate enough the three parameter fields are assumed to have the same values of correlation length table 3 shows that the lithology of 1st zone is to some extent similar to that of the 3rd zone meanwhile the k v values of the 1st and 3rd zones are within the same order of magnitude and two orders of magnitude larger than the 2nd zone as a result the 1st and 3rd zones are thought to be vertically correlated and the correlation length should be larger than the thickness of the 2nd zone we suppose that the correlation length might be around 55 m which is approximately equal to the combination of the thickness of the 2nd zone 35 62 m and half the sum of the thicknesses of the 1st and 3rd zones 19 32 m as the correlation length value affects the estimation results we intend to verify our inference by testing various correlation lengths i e 30 40 50 60 and 70 m for this field case a large correlation length suggests large pockets of similar parameter values whereas a small correlation length indicates variability at a small scale fienen et al 2008 5 results and discussion inverse modeling runs of different prior correlation length values for the geostatistical model were performed on the same pc with a quad core cpu with 16 gb of random access memory each run was completed within 20 min after each estimation run the mse value was calculated to evaluate the quality of fit between simulated and observed deformation in addition the quality of fit was further evaluated through a scatterplot fit of a linear model as well as through the coefficient of determination r 2 ms e 1 values which are obtained from equation 12 corresponding to prescribed prior correlation lengths are 3 924 mm2 3 166 mm2 2 804 mm2 3 404 mm2 and 3 635 mm2 respectively the fitted linear models reveal that all r 2 and slopes are almost equal to 1 however various correlation length values can lead to various intercepts which are 0 483 0 291 0 095 0 104 and 0 291 respectively comparatively speaking a correlation length of 50 m yields the best result and minimal bias fig 7 in fitting the observed zone deformation data fig 6 furthermore the fitted slope and intercept together with the calculated ms e 1 are all better than those obtained from calibrating the geological model i e 0 991 0 550 and 3 22 mm2 respectively as reported in zhuang et al 2017b fig s3 shows that the actual correlation length of the three parameter fields could be around 50 m which is close to our previously inferred value of 55 m fig 8 demonstrates the inversed vertical distributions of k v s ske and s skp within the second aquitard fig 8a shows that k v varies between 10 10 m s and 10 8 m s we note that k v within the 2nd zone is overall one order of magnitude larger than the other two the variation pattern of the k v field is thought to be reasonable because clayey particles tend to be lower in hydraulic conductivity than siltstone particles for comparison it can be easily seen that the geological model yields higher k v within the 2nd zone than the geostatistical model by one order of magnitude potentially suggesting a scale effect due to the neglect of intralayer heterogeneity and it yields a slightly higher k v within the 1st zone apparently the geostatistical model captures the vertical variation pattern of the k v field furthermore the 3rd zone tends to have local heterogeneity in k v fig 8 which cannot be unmasked by a zonation model fig 8b shows that s ske varies between 10 6 m 1 and 10 5 m 1 and s ske within the 3rd zone is slightly smaller than those within the 1st and 2nd zones for comparison the geological model yields slightly higher s ske within the 1st and 2nd zones while slightly lower s ske within the 3rd zone the relatively wide confidence intervals of the s ske estimates are expected to be due to elastic effects masked by delayed drainage yan and burbey 2008 however we note that although the confidence intervals of s ske within the 3rd zone is relatively wide it is much narrower than those estimated from the geological model fig 8c shows that s skp varies between 10 4 and 10 3 m 1 and the third zone has the largest s skp estimates followed by the 1st and 2nd zones the variation pattern of the s skp field is analyzed to be in accordance with the lithology as shown in table 3 konikow and neuzil 2007 in comparison the geostatistical model yields similar s skp estimates as well as similar confidence intervals to the geological model the high confidence in the s skp estimates is mainly due to the fact that the cumulative deformation is much more sensitive to specific storage than hydraulic conductivity konikow and neuzil 2007 and the delayed drainage within the second aquitard before the rise of groundwater levels within adjacent aquifers has dissipated to a large extent zhuang et al 2017b a geostatistical inverse model adjusts much larger amounts of parameters from given monitoring data than a geological model in other words the parameter at a given location has more freedom to adjust hence the confidence intervals based on geostatistical inverse models as shown in fig 8a and c are expected to have wider confidence intervals than the geological model this is also evident in the 10 independent synthetic cases fig s1 note that the variance of measurement errors affects the inversion results generally smaller the error variance is the less smooth can be the estimation since we assume the multi extensometer data are accurate enough the relative smoothness of the inversed parameter fields fig 8 is mainly due to the availability of fewer observation locations inside the investigated aquitard in addition it should be pointed out that the spatial variances and correlation lengths of the parameter fields assigned for the inverse procedure could also affect the inversion results to some extent perhaps the simultaneous estimation of the spatial distributions of aquitard hydraulic parameters and the structural parameters could improve the fitting quality although this is beyond the scope of this study overall coupling heter compac with the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 yields reasonable estimates of hydraulic parameter fields of the second aquitard furthermore dealing with the vertical heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic parameters using a geostatistical model improves the quality of fitting the observed zone deformation compared with a geological model utilizing the means and associated posterior covariance matrix of parameter estimates computed by the quasi linear geostatistical approach we generated 200 realizations of parameter fields through monte carlo simulation and substituted them into the heter compac to simulate the deformation history of the second aquitard the model based simulation results fig 9 reveal that the cumulative deformation is highly correlated with groundwater level variation of the second confined aquifer and can be approximately divided into four periods i e the startup from 1950 to 1965 acceleration from 1965 to 1983 mitigation from 1983 to 1994 and recovery after 1994 the second aquitard has been compacted 576 2 42 6 mm before the installation of multiple extensometers in 1983 and before the rise in groundwater level from 1994 the cumulative compaction of the second aquitard is 914 8 42 6 mm fig 9 if we adopt the contribution ratio reported in zhang et al 2010 the cumulative surface subsidence at the qingliang primary school is about 1061 1 mm in 1983 and 1691 7 mm in 1994 in comparison to the land subsidence data reported in wang et al 2009 it appears that the magnitude of land subsidence in changzhou city is largely underestimated due to the lack of long term monitoring of surface deformation it should be noted that in both synthetic and field application cases it is assumed that there is no initial preconsolidation head within the aquitard this assumption may be reasonable if the history of groundwater level variations is completely recoded in most cases this assumption may not be true because deformation records frequently lag pumping in addition the methodology proposed in this study only considers multiple vertical subsidence measurements which are recorded within a single confining unit on the other hand if the hydraulic head or pore pressure data could be recorded at multiple locations within the aquitard the joint inversion of head and deformation data may reveal much more details regarding the spatial heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic parameters and even the preconsolidation head furthermore we notice that k v and s skp are actually stress dependent during the compaction process these complications require further research 6 summary and conclusions the compac model has been expanded to heter compac for simulating the deformation of a vertically heterogeneous aquitard the heterogeneities of the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v elastic specific storage s ske and inelastic specific storage s skp fields of a highly compressible aquitard can be characterized by coupling heter compac with the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 when long term multi extensometer and groundwater level variation data are available the methodology is first tested through twelve synthetic cases with randomly generated k v s ske and s skp fields and then applied to a multi extensometer research site located in changzhou city jiangsu province china synthetic cases reveal that the geostatistical inverse model consistently yields better calibration performance than the geological model in characterizing the heterogeneities of aquitard hydraulic parameters the geostatistical inverse model could characterize the general varying patterns and detect some local heterogeneities of hydraulic parameter fields the geological model tends to estimate the means of hydraulic parameters within zones delineated according to extensometer locations and it is not sophisticated sufficiently enough to reproduce the observed zone deformation data if the elastic effects in the observed deformation is masked by delayed drainage a relatively low resolution of s ske field in comparison to estimated k v and s skp fields will result to improve the characterization of the s ske field monitoring should take place for a sufficiently long enough period to capture the elastic effects of aquitard deformation relatively higher confidence of parameter estimates will appear near the aquifer stressing the aquitard of interest thus both aquifers should stress the aquitard of interest to improve the characterization resolution for the investigated aquitard at the multi extensometer site f00 a correlation length of approximately 50 m for the geostatistical inverse model yields an excellent quality of fit between simulated and observed zone deformation data and the fitting quality is better than the geological model in addition the corresponding estimated hydraulic parameter fields are in accordance with lithological data overall the geological model yields higher k v within the 2nd zone over one order of magnitude slightly lower k v within the 1st zone slightly higher s ske within the 1st and 2nd zones and slightly lower s ske within the 3rd zone utilizing the estimated parameters and their corresponding uncertainty estimates and through the monte carlo analysis the cumulative compaction of the second aquitard is calculated to be 914 8 42 6 mm before the rise in groundwater level within adjoining confined aquifers suggesting that the magnitude of land subsidence in changzhou city may be largely

6132,the classical aquitard drainage model compac was used to simulate the deformation of a one dimensional vertically heterogeneous aquitard i e heter compac by coupling heter compac with the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach the vertical heterogeneities of hydraulic conductivity k v elastic specific storage s ske and inelastic specific storage s skp fields could be characterized with the availability of long term multi extensometer data the methodology was first tested through a group of ten synthetic cases with randomly generated k v s ske and s skp fields results of the synthetic cases revealed that a geostatistical model could characterize the variability of aquitard hydraulic parameter fields and yields improved fits of simulated versus observed zone deformation than a geological model that treats each zone to be homogeneous subsequently the methodology was applied to a research site situated in changzhou city jiangsu province china where long term deformation behaviors of the strata within the aquifer aquitard system have been monitored vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp fields of the investigated aquitard at the site were characterized using the quasi linear geostatistical approach the correlation length of the three fields that yielded the best quality fit was assessed to be approximately 50 m and the fitting quality was slightly improved in comparison with that produced from calibrating a geological or zonation model through monte carlo analysis of aquitard deformation utilizing the inversed parameters and corresponding uncertainties the investigated aquitard is estimated to have compacted 914 8 42 6 mm before the rise in groundwater levels in adjoining aquifers keywords aquitard heterogeneity geostatistical inverse modeling multi extensometer data groundwater level variations 1 introduction aquitards or confining layers are strata with distinctly lower permeability that allow for minor groundwater seepage rates in a porous groundwater system in some areas aquitards may be horizontally extensive and they may account for more than half of the system thickness zhou et al 2013 and may exchange large volumes of groundwater with adjacent aquifers through the large contact surface they share margat and gun 2013 aquitards usually consist of fine grained sediments such as silts and clays while aquifers typically consist of coarse grained sediments such as sands and gravels clayey grains have electric charges on their surfaces and are aggregated when deposited forming an aggregate with the pore size being frequently larger than the grain diameter thus aquitards tend to have larger porosities freeze and cherry 1979 and higher storativity leake 1990 under the condition of long term pumping groundwater from a semi confined aquifer system aquitards may dominate the depletion of groundwater storage konikow and neuzil 2007 and play a vital role in the investigation of land subsidence rudolph and frind 1991 the most distinct feature of aquitards is its hydraulic conductivity k which is usually less than 10 8 m s neuzil 1986 the widespread presence of aquitards associated with low k makes aquitards play a pivotal role in protecting aquifers supplying potable water from contamination bonte et al 2015 harrison et al 1992 however the aquitard can be a sink if aquifer contaminants diffuse into aquitards and it turns to be a source of contaminants when back diffusion occurs due to the decline of aquifer concentration yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b a typical challenge in front of groundwater remediation strategies is the presence of subsurface heterogeneities adamson et al 2014 sedimentary deposits are inherently heterogeneous the aquitard heterogeneity is frequently encountered in nature and is one of the main challenges associated with aquitard characterization maliva 2016 accurate characterization of aquitard heterogeneity is critical for evaluating leakage rates predicting land subsidence and improving the efficiency of groundwater remediation undoubtedly aquitard characterization is extremely significant at hazardous waste sites geophysical methods have been widely used to map subsurface heterogeneity but they do not provide direct information on hydraulic parameters illman 2014 traditionally the heterogeneity in aquitard hydraulic parameters is obtained from laboratory tests on small samples with permeameters and odeometers larroque et al 2013 smith et al 2016 however parameter estimates obtained from laboratory tests of small scale samples may not be representative of in situ conditions smith et al 2013 van der kamp 2001 due to unavoidable stress perturbation during the processes of drilling sealing transportation and laboratory testing clark 1998 quantifying aquitard heterogeneity faces more challenges than characterizing aquifer heterogeneities because observational data regarding aquitards are typically rare however if different types of monitoring data such as pore pressure acworth et al 2017 larroque et al 2013 smith et al 2016 solute transport hendry and wassenaar 2009 and stratification deformation data zhuang et al 2017b are available hydrogeological researchers would like to focus on the quantitative characterization of aquitard heterogeneity the vertical heterogeneity of an aquitard can be dealt with a geological or zonation model which is usually constructed based on the analysis of borehole logs or geophysical logging in geological models an aquitard is vertically divided into multiple zones where the hydraulic parameters e g k v s ske and s skp are assumed to be homogeneous everywhere within a distinct zone and to be typically different from other zones based on the good hydrogeological information at the long term aquitard research site king site in southern saskatchewan canada hendry and wassenaar 2009 examined the influence of geological heterogeneities on the transport of δ18o and δd within a clay till aquitard at a high resolution 30 cm and found that the heterogeneity causes both major and minor deviations from one dimensional diffusion profiles through both synthetic and field application cases zhuang et al 2017b conducted a study of characterizing the vertical heterogeneity of k v s ske and s skp in which the aquitard of interest was vertically divided into multiple geologically distinct homogeneous zones in their study multi compac which was developed from compac helm 1975 to simulate the drainage of an aquitard consisting of multiple zones was coupled with pest welter et al 2015 a parameter estimation code to calibrate long term multi extensometer data their research showed that consideration of distinct geological zones yielded dramatically improved calibration results in comparison to the homogeneous case for a highly heterogeneous thick aquitard an increasing number of zones will be needed if one hopes to characterize the heterogeneity at high resolution because a coarse delineation of geologically distinct zones will lose intralayer heterogeneity however specific delineation of geological zones may be laborious and it is hard to determine which kind of delineation is accurate or more realistic an alternative method to deal with heterogeneity is the geostatistical approach de marsily et al 2005 geostatistical or stochastic inverse modeling could provide details to heterogeneity but the key is to obtain relevant data within aquifer and aquitard units at the resolution of site characterization needed yeh and liu 2000 geostatistical inverse models have also been widely used to deal with spatial heterogeneity of aquifers e g carrera and glorioso 1991 kitanidis 1995 kitanidis 1996 yeh et al 1995 yeh et al 1996 recently both laboratory sandbox berg and illman 2011 illman 2015 zhao et al 2016 and field investigations zhao and illman 2017 zhao and illman 2018 revealed that the geostatistical models produced smaller discrepancy between observed and simulated aquifer drawdowns than a geological model in particular zhao and illman 2018 were able to map both the three dimensional interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of a multi aquifer aquitard system through hydraulic tomography despite the promising performance of geostatistical inverse models for aquifer characterization to the best of our knowledge geostatistical inverse models have not been used to map the vertical heterogeneity of a highly compressible aquitard highly compressible aquitards will undergo both elastic and inelastic deformation in response to groundwater level changes within adjacent aquifers elastic deformation means that the sediment can return to its original state after the stress has been released while inelastic deformation means that the compaction of sediments is irreversible when the stress recovers long term aquitard deformation data provide valuable information about aquitard hydraulic parameters such as the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v elastic skeletal specific storage s ske and inelastic skeletal specific storage s skp cleveland et al 1992 helm 1975 riley 1969 assuming that hydraulic parameters are constant the aquitard deformation process can be simulated using the classical one dimensional finite difference model compac of helm 1975 which is applicable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquitards except in the study by zhuang et al 2017b compac has been used frequently to simulate the deformation of a homogeneous aquitard e g hoffmann et al 2003 liu and helm 2008a liu and helm 2008b luo et al 2016 pope and burbey 2004 zhuang et al 2017a specially if multiple vertical extensometers are installed at different depths within a relatively thick aquitard long term multi extensometer data may be calibrated to reveal the vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp the objective of this study is to explore the robustness of using a geostatistical model to characterize the vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp of a relatively thick highly compressible aquitard long term deformation data provided by multiple extensometers placed within the investigated aquitard is used for model calibration the calibration performance will be first evaluated through synthetic cases then the long term deformation data collected from the multi extensometer research site f00 situated in changzhou city jiangsu province china will be interpreted for aquitard characterization 2 methodology 2 1 forward modeling we consider a vertically heterogeneous highly compressible aquitard that is interbedded between two aquifers the hydraulic parameters k v s ske and s skp are assumed to be stochastic in space and constant in time we are aware that such three hydraulic parameters are not constant in real situations particularly for a thick highly compressible aquitard rudolph and frind 1991 under normal circumstances the porosities of fine grained deposits will decrease with time during the compaction process and the storativity and hydraulic conductivity decrease with time as a consequence actually we are aware of the limitation in the assumption of time constant parameters for aquitard layers instead in this study we focus our efforts on the vertical heterogeneity of a relatively thick aquitard and ignore the process of hydraulic parameter values varying with time assuming the aquitard remains saturated in the transient response to groundwater level variations within adjacent aquifers the governing equation for transient one dimensional vertical flow within the aquitard can be expressed as 1 z k v z h z s sk z h t where h h z t is the hydraulic head at time t and location z k v and s sk are the vertically variable hydraulic conductivity and skeletal specific storage respectively during the deformation process s sk s skp when h h and s sk s ske when h h where h is the preconsolidation head and s skp and s ske are inelastic and elastic skeletal specific storages respectively eq 1 represents the constant coefficient aquitard drainage model compac of helm 1975 for a heterogeneous aquitard in this study we refer it to heter compac from now on to simulate the drainage process of a single heterogeneous aquitard with stochastic hydraulic parameter fields when solving equation 1 numerically it should be noted that the vertical distributions of s skp s ske and h are updated at every time step initial hydraulic head distribution throughout the space domain is assumed to be static boundary hydraulic heads are prescribed with hydraulic heads within overlying and underlying aquifers from monitoring data a one dimensional finite difference method is developed to solve equation 1 numerically by discretizing the aquitard thickness into m elements and discretizing the time domain into n t steps the temporal and spatial distribution of h can be easily obtained via the heter compac model if the aquitard can be divided into several zones according to the locations of multiple extensometers and the interfaces between the aquitard and adjacent aquifers the cumulative deformation f of a zone at the nth n n t time step can be computed as 2 f n 1 n j 1 j 1 χ δ h n j s ske j χ δ h n j s skp j δ z δ h n j where j is the number of elements within the zone of interest δ h n j h n j h n j where h n j and h n j are the average hydraulic heads at and before the nth time step respectively over the j th element within the zone of interest δ h n j h n j h n 1 j and χ δ h n j is an indicator function which is expressed as 3 χ δ h n j 1 for δ h n j 0 0 for δ h n j 0 2 2 geostatistical inversion approach here we introduce the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 to characterize the heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp within the aquitard this inversion approach is based on the bayes theorem and has been frequently applied in the research area of characterization of subsurface heterogeneity e g ahmed et al 2016 bakhos et al 2014 pollock and cirpka 2010 the objective function l can be expressed as 4 l f obs f s t r 1 f obs f s s x β t q 1 s x β where f obs n 1 is an observation vector of cumulative zone deformation n is the number of observation data f denotes the forward problem operator for computing the cumulative zone deformation with input parameter s s ln k v ln s ske ln s skp t is a 3m 1 vector of discrete values of the natural logarithm of m 1 vectors k v s ske and s skp the logarithmic function is used to enforce the positiveness of these parameters during the estimation process r is the n n covariance matrix of measurement errors x is a 3m 3 matrix that can be expressed as 5 x x 1 0 0 0 x 2 0 0 0 x 3 where x 1 x 2 x 3 are m 1 vectors of ones β is the 3 1 vector consisting of prior mean values of ln k v ln s ske and ln s sk p and q is the 3m 3m spatial covariance matrix of the natural logarithmic parameter fields a commonly used variogram function to represent the spatial covariance of a random parameter field in groundwater hydrology is the exponential model e g fienen et al 2008 fischer et al 2017 liu and kitanidis 2011 yeh and liu 2000 zhao and illman 2018 zhao et al 2016 therefore we also adopt the exponential variogram in this study thus q can be represented as 6 q q lnk v 0 0 0 q lns ske 0 0 0 q lns skp the structural parameters i e variances σ lnk v 2 σ lns ske 2 and σ lns skp 2 and correlation lengths λ lnk v λ lns ske and λ lns skp of the exponential variogram are considered as prior information the iterative scheme of quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 can be expressed as 7 s k 1 x η k 1 qh k t ξ k 1 where s k 1 is the currently estimated best parameter set and the two terms on the right side of equation 7 represents the calculated mean and fluctuations of s k 1 respectively h k f s k s k is the n 3m sensitivity matrix of the simulated cumulative zone deformation f s k with respect to the last parameter estimate s k η k 1 3 1 and ξ k 1 n 1 can be computed through solving the following cokriging equation 8 h k qh k t r λ i h k x h k x t 0 ξ k 1 η k 1 f obs f s k h k s k 0 where λ is a dynamic stability multiplier that is introduced by following the inverse procedure of zha et al 2014 to stabilize the solution of equation 8 since the forward problem i e equation 1 is non linear and non stationary a simple way to calculate the sensitivity matrix h k at each iteration is via the numerical finite difference approximations in this study the central difference method is used to calculate h k 9 h k i f s k s k i f s k δ s k i f s k δ s k i 2 δ s k i i 1 2 3 m where δ s k i is a small amount of variation in the i th parameter within the parameter vector s k to accelerate the parameter estimation process the line search algorithm soueid ahmed et al 2015 is applied 10 s k 1 s k 1 s k x s k where s k 1 is the final estimate of current iteration and x is a variable to be optimized after the iteration process is completed the posterior covariance of estimated s is computed as 11 cov pos q h k q x t t h k qh k t r h k x h k x t 0 1 h k q x t the diagonal elements of cov pos represent the posterior variance of individual elements of the estimated s then the confidence intervals of individual estimates are calculated to be s 1 96 s t d s s 1 96 std s where std denotes the standard deviation 3 synthetic cases a synthetic one dimensional aquifer aquitard system is first considered where a vertically heterogeneous aquitard is 60 m thick and underlain by a confined aquifer and overlain by an unconfined aquifer there are four vertical extensometers i e e1 e2 e3 and e4 fig 1 placed within the system e1 and e4 are placed at the aquifer aquitard interfaces and e2 and e3 are placed inside of the aquitard fig 1 the four extensometers uniformly divide the aquitard into three zones according to their locations so each zone is 20 m thick extensometers record the long term movement of interfaces thus the transient deformation of each zone can be easily derived under natural conditions hydraulic properties are dependent on the shape packing and degree of sorting of sediment grains and orders of magnitudes of changes in aquitard hydraulic conductivity and specific storage may be observed in a multi aquifer aquitard sequence situated in an alluvial plain to explore the performance of using a geostatistical model to characterize the vertical heterogeneities of non elastic aquitard drainage model parameters k v s ske and s skp several synthetic cases which are independent from each other are considered the findings from only one synthetic case may not be sufficient to conclude about the robustness of geostatistical inverse modeling therefore we randomly generated 10 synthetic cases with varying parameter fields to investigate the inverse modeling performance in all 10 synthetic cases ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields are assumed to be normally distributed and are randomly and independently generated by the random field generator of davis 1987 with no truncation for the karhunen loeve kl expansion a larger truncation value leads to a smoother gaussian field no truncation means that the generated parameter fields are much less smooth which is more likely to occur within fine grained low k aquitard units in comparison to coarse grained aquifers for all the 10 synthetic cases input mean values of ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields for the generator are set to be 4 15 11 51 and 7 60 while the corresponding geometric means of k v s ske and s skp fields are 1 58 10 2 m year or 5 0 10 10 m s 1 0 10 5 m 1 and 5 0 10 4 m 1 respectively input spatial variances of ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields are 1 0 0 5 and 0 5 respectively input correlation lengths for the three log transformed parameter fields in the vertical direction are all set be 40 m it is noteworthy that the means variances and experimental correlation lengths of the generated fields are often not identical to but are usually around the corresponding input values randomly generated ln k v ln s ske and ln s skp fields for the 10 synthetic cases fig s1 are provided in the supporting information section elastic aquitard deformation is usually caused by rising hydraulic heads within adjacent aquifers while the continuous decline in hydraulic heads caused by long term and high intensity groundwater extraction often triggers inelastic aquitard deformation to simulate aquitard deformation the initial hydraulic head distribution within the aquitard i e initial condition together with hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers i e dirichlet boundary condition should be provided a uniform hydraulic head of 70 m is assumed for all nodes at the initial state it is also assumed that there is no initial preconsolidation head within the aquitard hydraulic head in the underlying confined aquifer is specified to experience three uniform stages of linear variations with time associated with a seasonal fluctuation with an amplitude of 2 m each stage lasts 20 years the overall declining rates for the three stages are 2 m year 0 5 m year and 1 5 m year respectively hydraulic head within the overlying aquifer is assumed to remain constant during the 60 year study period specific variation patterns of aquifer hydraulic head are shown in fig 2 the synthetic aquitard is uniformly discretized into 120 elements with a uniform element size of 0 5 m the study period is uniformly discretized into 240 steps with a uniform step size of 0 25 year thus there are 720 240 time steps 3 zones observational deformation data utilized for geostatistical inversion observational data are produced by running the heter compac model with the parameters in real space i e not using the log transformed parameters and the same initial and boundary conditions one popular assumption is that the measurement errors are independent from each other and are zero mean white noise sequences with a normal probability distribution hence after the forward run a random measurement error with a variance of 1 0 mm2 is added to each observational data taking the 7th synthetic case as an example the observed zone deformation data are shown in fig 2 the accuracy of the simulation is verified by conducting additional runs using a refined mesh which yielded similar results before conducting the geostatistical inversion for each synthetic case a geological model constructed based on extensometer locations which is similar to the work of zhuang et al 2017b is used to conduct parameter estimation we use pest doherty 2008 to complete the estimation the input mean values for the random fields for all synthetic cases are utilized as the initial guess for each synthetic case the geological model yields 9 3 zones 3 fields parameter estimates as pointed out by zhuang et al 2017b a geological model will lead to parameter estimates with extremely narrow 95 confidence intervals if each zone is independently homogeneous however this may not be true for an aquitard with randomly distributed parameter fields geostatistical inversion requires the input of structural parameters i e variances and correlation lengths of involved parameter fields structural parameters are commonly determined by fitting the point scale estimates which could be obtained from slug tests or laboratory experimental tests using a variogram function kitanidis 1991 kitanidis 2007 for real applications multiple slug tests conducted within a single aquitard are generally unavailable in addition laboratory experimental results of aquitard hydraulic parameters are always not representative in situ conditions as reported in the literature furthermore while above structural parameters could also be estimated during inverse modeling as pointed out by vesselinov et al 2001 this could lead to numerical difficulties thus it appears that estimating structural parameters for a highly compressive aquitard is impracticable in this study we assume that structural parameters are known focus on testing the reliability of the inversion procedure and compare the inversed parameter fields with those obtained from a geologic model for the synthetic simulation the input values of means variances and correlation lengths that are used to generate the random parameter fields are assigned as prior information for each synthetic case the geostatistical inversion yields 360 120 elements 3 fields parameter estimates in eq 8 the initial value of the dynamic stability multiplier λ is set to be 10 0 with an increasing factor of 5 0 if the objective function l as shown in eq 4 increases and a decreasing factor of 2 0 if l decreases during each iteration the initial value of the variable x to be optimized as shown in eq 10 is set to be 1 0 suggesting that the line search algorithm starts to optimize the current estimate s k 1 the sensitivity matrix h during iterations is calculated in parallel to save on computational time inversed parameter fields for each synthetic case are all listed in fig s1 upon the completion of the parameter estimation either based on a geological or geostatistical model two mean square errors mse are calculated to assess the fitting performance which are expressed as 12 ms e 1 1 n i n f i obs f i s fit 2 13 ms e 2 1 m i m p i true p i esti 2 where f i obs is the i th value in the vector of observed deformation f obs f i is the i th value in the vector of simulated deformation with respect to the vector of final parameter estimates s fit 9 1 for the geological model and 360 1 for the geostatistical model p i true is the i th value in the vector of true parameters i e ln k v ln s ske or ln s skp and p i esti is the i th value in the vector of estimated parameters eq 12 is used to assess the fit between observed and simulated zone deformation and eq 13 is used to assess the fit between true and estimated parameter fields note that the geological model based parameter estimates are assigned to corresponding elements when using eq 13 for all synthetic cases ms e 1 values are listed in table 1 and ms e 2 values are listed in table 2 it can be seen from table 1 that the geostatistical inverse procedure yields excellent ms e 1 values which in all cases are as expected close to the assigned variance of measurement errors i e σ obs 2 1 0 mm2 in addition we find that the geostatistical inverse procedure characterizes the overall varying patterns of the three parameter fields especially the k v and s skp fields fig s1 suggesting the robustness of the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach table 1 and table 2 reveal that the geological model in most cases yields relatively poor calibration performance suggesting that the geological model may be less suitable to characterize the highly heterogeneous fields of aquitard hydraulic parameters in comparison the geostatistical model generally fits the observational data much better table 1 furthermore the parameter fields estimated from the geostatistical model are much closer to the true ones table 2 although the geological model yields fairly good performance in fitting observational data for cases 3 7 and 8 the geostatistical model performs uniformly better for all cases table 1 the advantage in the calibration performance of the geostatistical inverse model over the geological model is mainly due to the fact that the geostatistical inverse model is able to capture the local heterogeneities of the parameter fields between and within each zone for example taking case 7 which yields the best fit of observational deformation data among all synthetic cases the geostatistical model images the overall varying patterns of the k v s ske and s skp fields fig 3 this is also true for case 10 fig s1 which yields a relatively lower fitting quality of the geological model and the worst fitting quality of the geostatistical model table 1 obviously the geological model yields lower resolution of the parameter fields in comparison to the geostatistical model this is mainly due to the fact that the geological model treats each zone to be homogeneous and it is not expected to map the interlayer heterogeneity fig 3 inversed parameter fields as shown in fig s1 show that a geostatistical inverse model results in relatively wide confidence intervals of parameters near the top boundary fig 3 this is inferred due to the fact that the hydraulic response near the top boundary of the aquitard always lags behind that near the bottom boundary and the deformation near the top boundary is less sensitive to hydraulic head variations in the lower aquifer than the location near the bottom boundary in other words in order to narrow the confidence intervals of parameter estimates near the top boundary the overlying aquifer should also stress the investigated aquitard fig s1 also shows that both geostatistical and geological models lead to lower resolution and wider confidence intervals of the s ske field than the other two fig s1 and fig 3 this is inferred due to the fact that the elastic effects are masked by delayed drainage yan and burbey 2008 zhuang et al 2017b in other words the observational data are not sensitive to apparent recoverable deformation fig 2 as a result in order to reduce the uncertainty of sske estimates monitoring should last for a longer period for the delayed drainage effect to dissipate so that elastic effects become more apparent to test above two inferences we conduct two additional synthetic cases fig s2 the first additional case case 11 is identical to the above ten cases the second additional case case 12 is based on the first one but it has a longer history of monitoring 80 years and the hydraulic head in the overlying aquifer is set to vary in the same pattern as that of the underlying aquifer in particular the fourth stage of the variation history of hydraulic head in both aquifers now lasts 40 years and is still associated with an overall declining rate of 1 5 m year inversed parameter fields fig s2 show that the uncertainty of parameter estimates for case 12 near the top boundary has been reduced furthermore by extending the monitoring duration the accuracy of sske estimates has been substantially improved especially for the geological model fig s2 overall the synthetic cases reveal that the geostatistical inverse model improves the characterization of vertical heterogeneities of aquitard hydraulic parameters when compared to the geological model 4 field application 4 1 background the study area is located in the southwestern portion of the su xi chang area i e suzhou wuxi and changzhou cities in jiangsu province of china situated in the southern part of the yangtze river delta fig 4 we focused our study on the multi extensometer research site located in the central area of changzhou city where to the north is yangtze river and to the southeast is tai lake changzhou city has experienced intensive land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction within the multi layered aquifer aquitard system consisting of quaternary sediments the extensometer group f00 fig 4 at the qingliang primary school of changzhou city is the only one extensometer group in su xi chang area that has documented long term deformation data for individual units zhang et al 2010 the ground elevation of f00 is about 4 4 m above mean sea level f00 was placed at one of the regional centres of groundwater level drawdown cones and was constructed in 1983 long term monitoring of deformation and hydraulic head at f00 commenced in 1984 there are four main aquifers in the changzhou city area including an unconfined aquifer and three confined aquifers fig 5 is a schematic diagram of the cross section at the f00 site showing the various major aquifer aquitard units the unconfined aquifer is not included because of its very small thickness the first confined aquifer mainly consists of silty sand and is generally buried at shallow depths 5 48 18 55 m the second confined aquifer is buried at intermediate depths 92 80 107 80 m and regionally distributed and it mainly consists of silty and fine sand the third confined aquifer is deeply buried 117 70 143 60 m and distributed mostly in the northern changzhou city and it mainly consists of silty to fine sand with interbedded clay zhuang et al 2015 the aquitard we are concerned in this study is the second aquitard which is 74 25 m thick and buried from 18 55 to 92 8 m beneath the land surface the second aquitard and bounding aquifers i e the first and second confined aquifers are regionally distributed in the su xi chang area as the main layer contributing to land subsidence in changzhou city area the long term deformation of the second aquitard has been monitored with four borehole extensometers i e e2 e3 e4 and e5 fig 5 of the extensometer group f00 which was constructed at the center of regional groundwater depression cone in 1983 and started its service from 1984 the layout and installation details of borehole extensometers at the f00 site can be referred to wang et al 2009 the four extensometers were installed at boundaries of three distinct zones which are with different lithology from one to the next the burial depths of the three zones are 18 55 35 70 m 35 70 71 32 m and 71 32 92 80 m respectively the zones consist of different types of soil particles suggesting vertical heterogeneity in hydraulic parameters table 3 overall the three zones consist of silty clay and clay 4 2 groundwater level variations groundwater extraction activities at changzhou city can be traced back to 1919 when the first deep well was completed the first confined aquifer is greatly affected by precipitation and can be directly recharged by the yangtze river due to poor water quality the first confined aquifer has not been exploited and its groundwater level has remained nearly unchanged over the entire groundwater extraction history the second confined aquifer is the major groundwater supply layer in su xi chang area due to its moderate burial depth high water storage capacity good water quality and the relatively high hydraulic conductivity hu et al 2009 the hydraulic conductivity of the second confined aquifer is approximately 5 8 10 5 m s shi et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 the natural groundwater levels for all aquifers in the si xi chang aquifer system were about 0 6 m below ground surface the long term record shows that the groundwater level within the second confined aquifer in changzhou city was close to the groundwater surface in early 1950s and the groundwater extraction rate was about 104 m3 d zhuang et al 2015 from the year of 1957 the number of deep pumping wells increased remarkably to meet the water demand of rapid economic development the second confined aquifer was overly exploited since the late 1970s and the overexploitation continued into the late 1990s the average extraction rate was less than 105 m3 d before 1970 then it increased to 2 105 m3 d in 1976 and 2 2 36 105 m3 d from 1982 to 1989 since groundwater extraction in su xi chang area caused dramatic groundwater level declines and resulted in severe land subsidence e g shi et al 2007 wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 the jiangsu province government strictly regulated groundwater exploitation from the year 1995 and prohibited the exploitation after the year 2000 observational data revealed that groundwater level variation in the second confined aquifer was not apparently affected by precipitation but it was closely related to regional groundwater extraction activities the average decline rate in groundwater level of the second confined aquifer at the f00 site was 0 7 m year 2 64 m year and 1 0 m year for the three time periods of 1950 1965 1965 1983 and 1983 1994 respectively zhuang et al 2015 although regional regulation of groundwater exploitation started at the year 1995 the groundwater level at the f00 site began to rise from 1994 fig 6 during the period of regulation 1995 2000 the groundwater level rebounded at an approximate rate of 0 9 m year while the average rebound rate increased to 3 0 m year from the year of prohibition to the end of concerned study period 2000 2004 fig 6 this demonstrated that the provincial policy regarding groundwater exploitation yielded remarkable control on groundwater level variations fig 6 shows the groundwater level variation pattern of the second confined aquifer which is recorded with much more detail from 1989 to 2004 than other time periods and one can refer to zhuang et al 2015 for the detailed information on groundwater level variations prior to 1989 4 3 deformation of the second aquitard groundwater level declines result in the dissipation of excess pore pressure and the release of water from storage and eventually cause land subsidence in the su xi chang area land subsidence is closely related to groundwater overexploitation in confined aquifers land subsidence in changzhou city was first observed in 1960s shi et al 2008 wang et al 2009 and accelerated during the 1970s at the f00 site groundwater level declined in the first and second confined aquifers causing the second aquitard to compact quickly prior to the regulation of groundwater exploitation fig 6 the second aquitard accounted for 54 3 of the total land subsidence during the period from 1984 to 2003 with the 3rd zone contributing to 64 6 of aquitard compaction zhang et al 2010 although the 3rd zone is thinner than the 2nd zone fig 5 it underwent a large degree of compaction fig 6 one of the main causes is that the 3rd zone directly overlies the second confined aquifer whose groundwater level intensively declined due to long term groundwater extraction while the groundwater level in the first confined aquifer was basically unchanged in other words groundwater level declined more in the 3rd zone than in the 2nd zone another cause is potentially rooted in the composition of soft clayey particle within the 3rd zone suggesting higher compressibility due to the low hydraulic conductivity of clayey sediments the equilibration and the drainage of the aquitard may proceed slowly and hydraulic heads within the aquitard lag far behind the groundwater level variations within adjacent aquifers resulting in the time delay of aquitard deformation fig 6 demonstrates that as the groundwater level in the second confined aquifer recovered since 1994 the 3rd and 2nd zones overall continued to compact until the end of data observation suggesting delayed drainage while the aquitard deformed the time delay in aquitard deformation is also to some extent attributed to the aquitard storativity or specific storage konikow and neuzil 2007 zhou et al 2013 zhuang et al 2017a which directly determines the volume of groundwater that can be extracted from pore spaces 4 4 characterization of parameter fields to characterize the vertical heterogeneities of k v s ske and s skp within the second aquitard we examined the groundwater variation data between 1950 and 2004 the deformation data we analyzed for parameter estimation are between 1989 and 2004 during which the groundwater level variation data in the second aquifer were both documented in detail as shown in fig 6 the groundwater level variations from 1950 to 1989 demonstrated in zhuang et al 2015 were fitted by a fourier series with two harmonic terms and r 2 being 99 81 zhuang et al 2017b for deriving the discretized groundwater level data with the same time step i e 0 25 year as shown in fig 6 since the initial groundwater level within the second confined aquifer was in a natural state we assume that there is no initial preconsolidation head within the second aquitard in the year of 1950 and the hydraulic head at the initial state is assumed to be linearly distributed within the second aquitard the aquitard thickness is discretized into 149 elements with the element size being approximately 0 5 m geological model based parameter estimates as shown in table 3 are used to derive the prior means and variances of the three parameter fields specifically the geological model parameter estimates are first assigned to the elements within corresponding zones then the geometric means of k v s ske and s skp fields are calculated to be 2 96 10 9 m s 1 19 10 5 m 1 and 4 11 10 4 m 1 respectively and the variances of log transformed parameter fields are calculated to be 3 91 1 17 and 0 10 respectively due to the lack of information on the monitoring work the variance of the measurement errors of the multi extensometer data is hard to determine for this field application we set the variance of the measurement error to be 1 0 mm2 assuming that the multi extensometer data are accurate enough the three parameter fields are assumed to have the same values of correlation length table 3 shows that the lithology of 1st zone is to some extent similar to that of the 3rd zone meanwhile the k v values of the 1st and 3rd zones are within the same order of magnitude and two orders of magnitude larger than the 2nd zone as a result the 1st and 3rd zones are thought to be vertically correlated and the correlation length should be larger than the thickness of the 2nd zone we suppose that the correlation length might be around 55 m which is approximately equal to the combination of the thickness of the 2nd zone 35 62 m and half the sum of the thicknesses of the 1st and 3rd zones 19 32 m as the correlation length value affects the estimation results we intend to verify our inference by testing various correlation lengths i e 30 40 50 60 and 70 m for this field case a large correlation length suggests large pockets of similar parameter values whereas a small correlation length indicates variability at a small scale fienen et al 2008 5 results and discussion inverse modeling runs of different prior correlation length values for the geostatistical model were performed on the same pc with a quad core cpu with 16 gb of random access memory each run was completed within 20 min after each estimation run the mse value was calculated to evaluate the quality of fit between simulated and observed deformation in addition the quality of fit was further evaluated through a scatterplot fit of a linear model as well as through the coefficient of determination r 2 ms e 1 values which are obtained from equation 12 corresponding to prescribed prior correlation lengths are 3 924 mm2 3 166 mm2 2 804 mm2 3 404 mm2 and 3 635 mm2 respectively the fitted linear models reveal that all r 2 and slopes are almost equal to 1 however various correlation length values can lead to various intercepts which are 0 483 0 291 0 095 0 104 and 0 291 respectively comparatively speaking a correlation length of 50 m yields the best result and minimal bias fig 7 in fitting the observed zone deformation data fig 6 furthermore the fitted slope and intercept together with the calculated ms e 1 are all better than those obtained from calibrating the geological model i e 0 991 0 550 and 3 22 mm2 respectively as reported in zhuang et al 2017b fig s3 shows that the actual correlation length of the three parameter fields could be around 50 m which is close to our previously inferred value of 55 m fig 8 demonstrates the inversed vertical distributions of k v s ske and s skp within the second aquitard fig 8a shows that k v varies between 10 10 m s and 10 8 m s we note that k v within the 2nd zone is overall one order of magnitude larger than the other two the variation pattern of the k v field is thought to be reasonable because clayey particles tend to be lower in hydraulic conductivity than siltstone particles for comparison it can be easily seen that the geological model yields higher k v within the 2nd zone than the geostatistical model by one order of magnitude potentially suggesting a scale effect due to the neglect of intralayer heterogeneity and it yields a slightly higher k v within the 1st zone apparently the geostatistical model captures the vertical variation pattern of the k v field furthermore the 3rd zone tends to have local heterogeneity in k v fig 8 which cannot be unmasked by a zonation model fig 8b shows that s ske varies between 10 6 m 1 and 10 5 m 1 and s ske within the 3rd zone is slightly smaller than those within the 1st and 2nd zones for comparison the geological model yields slightly higher s ske within the 1st and 2nd zones while slightly lower s ske within the 3rd zone the relatively wide confidence intervals of the s ske estimates are expected to be due to elastic effects masked by delayed drainage yan and burbey 2008 however we note that although the confidence intervals of s ske within the 3rd zone is relatively wide it is much narrower than those estimated from the geological model fig 8c shows that s skp varies between 10 4 and 10 3 m 1 and the third zone has the largest s skp estimates followed by the 1st and 2nd zones the variation pattern of the s skp field is analyzed to be in accordance with the lithology as shown in table 3 konikow and neuzil 2007 in comparison the geostatistical model yields similar s skp estimates as well as similar confidence intervals to the geological model the high confidence in the s skp estimates is mainly due to the fact that the cumulative deformation is much more sensitive to specific storage than hydraulic conductivity konikow and neuzil 2007 and the delayed drainage within the second aquitard before the rise of groundwater levels within adjacent aquifers has dissipated to a large extent zhuang et al 2017b a geostatistical inverse model adjusts much larger amounts of parameters from given monitoring data than a geological model in other words the parameter at a given location has more freedom to adjust hence the confidence intervals based on geostatistical inverse models as shown in fig 8a and c are expected to have wider confidence intervals than the geological model this is also evident in the 10 independent synthetic cases fig s1 note that the variance of measurement errors affects the inversion results generally smaller the error variance is the less smooth can be the estimation since we assume the multi extensometer data are accurate enough the relative smoothness of the inversed parameter fields fig 8 is mainly due to the availability of fewer observation locations inside the investigated aquitard in addition it should be pointed out that the spatial variances and correlation lengths of the parameter fields assigned for the inverse procedure could also affect the inversion results to some extent perhaps the simultaneous estimation of the spatial distributions of aquitard hydraulic parameters and the structural parameters could improve the fitting quality although this is beyond the scope of this study overall coupling heter compac with the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 yields reasonable estimates of hydraulic parameter fields of the second aquitard furthermore dealing with the vertical heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic parameters using a geostatistical model improves the quality of fitting the observed zone deformation compared with a geological model utilizing the means and associated posterior covariance matrix of parameter estimates computed by the quasi linear geostatistical approach we generated 200 realizations of parameter fields through monte carlo simulation and substituted them into the heter compac to simulate the deformation history of the second aquitard the model based simulation results fig 9 reveal that the cumulative deformation is highly correlated with groundwater level variation of the second confined aquifer and can be approximately divided into four periods i e the startup from 1950 to 1965 acceleration from 1965 to 1983 mitigation from 1983 to 1994 and recovery after 1994 the second aquitard has been compacted 576 2 42 6 mm before the installation of multiple extensometers in 1983 and before the rise in groundwater level from 1994 the cumulative compaction of the second aquitard is 914 8 42 6 mm fig 9 if we adopt the contribution ratio reported in zhang et al 2010 the cumulative surface subsidence at the qingliang primary school is about 1061 1 mm in 1983 and 1691 7 mm in 1994 in comparison to the land subsidence data reported in wang et al 2009 it appears that the magnitude of land subsidence in changzhou city is largely underestimated due to the lack of long term monitoring of surface deformation it should be noted that in both synthetic and field application cases it is assumed that there is no initial preconsolidation head within the aquitard this assumption may be reasonable if the history of groundwater level variations is completely recoded in most cases this assumption may not be true because deformation records frequently lag pumping in addition the methodology proposed in this study only considers multiple vertical subsidence measurements which are recorded within a single confining unit on the other hand if the hydraulic head or pore pressure data could be recorded at multiple locations within the aquitard the joint inversion of head and deformation data may reveal much more details regarding the spatial heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic parameters and even the preconsolidation head furthermore we notice that k v and s skp are actually stress dependent during the compaction process these complications require further research 6 summary and conclusions the compac model has been expanded to heter compac for simulating the deformation of a vertically heterogeneous aquitard the heterogeneities of the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v elastic specific storage s ske and inelastic specific storage s skp fields of a highly compressible aquitard can be characterized by coupling heter compac with the quasi linear geostatistical inversion approach of kitanidis 1995 when long term multi extensometer and groundwater level variation data are available the methodology is first tested through twelve synthetic cases with randomly generated k v s ske and s skp fields and then applied to a multi extensometer research site located in changzhou city jiangsu province china synthetic cases reveal that the geostatistical inverse model consistently yields better calibration performance than the geological model in characterizing the heterogeneities of aquitard hydraulic parameters the geostatistical inverse model could characterize the general varying patterns and detect some local heterogeneities of hydraulic parameter fields the geological model tends to estimate the means of hydraulic parameters within zones delineated according to extensometer locations and it is not sophisticated sufficiently enough to reproduce the observed zone deformation data if the elastic effects in the observed deformation is masked by delayed drainage a relatively low resolution of s ske field in comparison to estimated k v and s skp fields will result to improve the characterization of the s ske field monitoring should take place for a sufficiently long enough period to capture the elastic effects of aquitard deformation relatively higher confidence of parameter estimates will appear near the aquifer stressing the aquitard of interest thus both aquifers should stress the aquitard of interest to improve the characterization resolution for the investigated aquitard at the multi extensometer site f00 a correlation length of approximately 50 m for the geostatistical inverse model yields an excellent quality of fit between simulated and observed zone deformation data and the fitting quality is better than the geological model in addition the corresponding estimated hydraulic parameter fields are in accordance with lithological data overall the geological model yields higher k v within the 2nd zone over one order of magnitude slightly lower k v within the 1st zone slightly higher s ske within the 1st and 2nd zones and slightly lower s ske within the 3rd zone utilizing the estimated parameters and their corresponding uncertainty estimates and through the monte carlo analysis the cumulative compaction of the second aquitard is calculated to be 914 8 42 6 mm before the rise in groundwater level within adjoining confined aquifers suggesting that the magnitude of land subsidence in changzhou city may be largely

6133,evapotranspiration et is an important hydrological flux with a strong influence on greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost this study examines the suitability of the closed chamber method in characterising the spatial heterogeneity of et fluxes in a typical polygonal tundra landscape in the lena river delta northern siberia actual evapotranspiration is compared across scales using 1 ground based chamber measurements to observe et at the microsite scale and 2 tower based eddy covariance ec measurements which provide spatially averaged et observations at the ecosystem level adopting an upscaling approach using ec estimates as a benchmark the authors assess the suitability of the closed chamber method in an arctic wetland environment a short closure time 40 s and a linear model to describe the change in chamber headspace water vapour concentration were employed to estimate et rates from the chamber measurements using a correction factor chamber fluxes were successfully scaled to the ec data yet findings suggest that the performance of the closed chamber method is highly sensitive to the prevailing hydrometeorological conditions and it is likely that the sorption and desorption of water molecules to the inside of the chamber and tubing has a strong impact on results a number of methodological issues are presented in this paper which question the use of closed chamber measurements as a stand alone tool for measuring et in arctic wetland environments however when paired alongside a trusted benchmark chambers can provide valuable information on et at the

longer time scales kane et al 1990 wessel and rouse 1994 and a major part of the summertime landscape water balance helbig et al 2013 due to the tight coupling between energy water and biogeochemical systems in arctic wetlands et is an important control on greenhouse gas emissions in permafrost areas as the water table determines the relative proportion of soil carbon released to the atmosphere as co2 or ch4 christensen et al 2004 schädel et al 2016 strack et al 2004 despite the importance of et there is poor understanding of this flux and its response to climate change in arctic areas bring et al 2016 hinzman et al 2013 vihma et al 2016 in arctic wetlands et is particularly complex due to the influence of patterned ground such as the polygonal tundra which covers much of the alaskan and siberian lowlands e g black 1982 romanovskii 1985 ice wedges under the soil surface create a pronounced micro relief with variations in vegetation hydrology soils and biogeochemical processes on the scale of a few meters brown et al 1980 helbig et al 2013 kutzbach et al 2004 sachs et al 2010 steedman et al 2017 vourlitis et al 1999 to date few studies have examined how micro topography affects et in heterogeneous tundra landscapes muster et al 2012 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 this gap in the literature limits our ability to understand the fine scale controls on this spatially variable flux and to predict how et in arctic ecosystems will change in the future both directly as a result of climate change mcvicar et al 2012 overland et al 2017 willett et al 2008 and indirectly via permafrost degradation or geomorphological change liljedahl et al 2016 in regions with extensive polygonal tundra such as the lena river delta in north eastern siberia it has been suggested that regional and global scale models which neglect small scale polygonal features could produce strongly biased estimates of et muster et al 2012 virtanen and ek 2014 in terms of monitoring eddy covariance ec is a commonly adopted technique for measuring et in permafrost environments e g langer et al 2011 lund et al 2017 vourlitis et al 1999 with regional networks facilitating comparisons of water vapour fluxes across sites baldocchi et al 2001 however this method provides only spatially averaged flux estimates at the whole ecosystem scale the impact of a heterogeneous land cover on fluxes can only be quantified with observations at the microsite scale e g using weighing lysimeters muster et al 2012 water balance calculations helbig et al 2013 and the closed chamber method cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 the latter is particularly appropriate for measuring exchange between low standing vegetation and the atmosphere vourlitis oechel hastings jenkins 1993 furthermore when instrumented with infrared greenhouse gas analysers irgas chamber systems are suited to conduct rapid spatial survey measurements 5 min not possible with other field techniques although chamber based et estimates are vulnerable to a range of errors see livingston and hutchinson 1995 studies conducted in warm temperate climates find that this technique can produce accurate measurements of water vapour exchange mcleod et al 2004 pérez priego et al 2010 reicosky et al 1983 in cold arctic environments however and despite the popularity of chambers for studying small scale variability in co2 and ch4 fluxes e g pirk et al 2016 sachs et al 2010 vourlitis et al 1993 little attention has been given to evaluating their suitability for measuring et to our knowledge the only studies where chamber measurements of this flux have been validated in an arctic tundra ecosystem were conducted on a coastal plane at barrow alaska cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 these studies are based on a one week field pilot study in 2013 cohen et al 2015 followed by three months of automated chamber data june september 2013 and two one week portable chamber campaigns july 2013 2014 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 at barrow chamber measurements of et have been used to capture diurnal cycles and different et rates across plant functional types and geomorphological units recently the potential of chambers to aid partitioning of et into its evaporation and transpiration fluxes has highlighted temporal and spatial variability in these components young robertson et al 2018 although the chamber setups used in barrow were calibrated against a laboratory based balance approach a large gap of over 40 has been identified between chamber and ec flux rates raz yaseef et al 2017 this disparity has been attributed to their different footprint in the landscape although a more robust analysis is pending we build on the work of the above authors to further test the chamber method at a different site the polygonal tundra in the lena river delta employing a nested approach we assess the performance of the chamber method in measuring actual et by comparing 1 ground based chamber measurements providing et estimates at the microsite scale 0 1 10 m2 with 2 tower based ec measurements which produce spatially averaged et estimates at the ecosystem scale 100 10 000 m2 to our knowledge this is the first study to adopt an upscaling approach to robustly test chamber et estimates using ec as a benchmark using two years of full growing season data from a new site we aim to 1 characterise the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in small scale et captured by the closed chamber method and 2 assess the performance of the closed chamber method for measuring et rates in the siberian arctic 2 study site this work was conducted on samoylov island 72 22 n 126 30 e one of the 1500 islands in the extensive lena river delta in north eastern siberia see fig 1 the island lies within the zone of continuous permafrost which extends to depths of 500 600 m in the study area zhang et al 1999 and has been the location of much research including studies of the carbon cycle and water balance see boike et al 2019 2013 climate at the site is arctic continental with a low annual rainfall of 125 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 12 5 c 1998 2011 boike et al 2013 temperature follows a strong seasonal cycle with a range in monthly average temperatures of over 40 c boike et al 2013 snowmelt commences around the middle of may and the growing season extends from mid june to mid september with the highest temperatures in july and august a more detailed description of baseline characteristics for samoylov island is provided by boike et al 2013 the island covers an area of about 5 km2 and is comprised of two geomorphological units the western part consists of an active floodplain 2 km2 and the eastern part 3 km2 where this study was conducted is formed of sediments from a holocene river terrace the terrace landscape is a wetland complex characterised by ponds thermokarst lakes and polygonal lowland tundra boike et al 2013 polygons are around 5 20 m wide and typically low centred with an elevation difference of 0 2 1 0 m between the wet centres and raised rims muster et al 2012 ground based chamber measurements were conducted across a low centred reference polygon in the centre of the river terrace see fig 2 this polygon was selected due to i features representative of low centred polygons in the region and ii close proximity to the ec tower 30 m fig 2b fig 2c shows the two microsites examined the wet polygon centre and the drier polygon rim the maximum active layer thickness alt at the polygon centre was around 40 cm and was deeper than measured at the polygon rim 30 cm the reference polygon centre was depressed and poorly drained with soils classified as reductaquic cryosols hyperhumic according to the wrb system iuss working group wrb 2015 cryoturbation was evident at the polygon rim with its turbic glacic cryosols and a water table positioned only a few centimetres above the permafrost table a vegetation survey conducted prior to sampling found that the wet polygon centre was predominantly covered by mosses e g drepanocladus revolvens and meesia triqueta hydrophilic sedges e g carex aquatilis carex chordorrhiza and marsh cinquefoil comarum palustre in contrast the polygon rim was dominated by mosses e g hylocomium

and the extended period july september 2015 we employed data from numerous sources including our ground and tower based measurements of et meteorological data from the ec tower and manually collected environmental variables from the reference polygon a schematic overview of our methodology to upscale the ground based chamber measurements is provided in fig 3 3 1 spatial and temporal variability of et 3 1 1 closed chamber et fluxes 3 1 1 1 experimental setup et was measured almost daily at the reference polygon using the closed chamber method from 22 july 20 august 2014 during the first campaign and from 11 july 22 september in 2015 details of the chamber setting and operation are provided by eckhardt et al 2019 and are therefore described only briefly here eight permanent measurement plots were established four per microsite and a pvc collar was inserted into the active layer at each plot several days before sampling commenced an airtight seal between the collar and the chamber was achieved using a silicone rubber u shaped frame filled with water chamber experiments were performed manually using a 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m clear chamber and lid both transparent to 90 par to minimise the effect of pressure shocks upon chamber setting hutchinson and livingston 2001 livingston et al 2006 two vents in the upper chamber surface were closed shortly after deployment a small fan inside the chamber ensured that headspace air was well mixed with average fan induced wind speed estimated as 0 37 0 12 m s 1 using a sonic anemometer solent r3 gill instruments uk chamber headspace trace gas concentrations h2o co2 and ch4 were measured for 2 min using an irga at 1 second intervals ugga los gatos research inc canada this analyser was connected to the chamber via plastic tubing length 10 m which was opaque black during the first campaign and replaced with clear polyurethane tubing for the second campaign to allow visible detection of condensation environmental conditions inside the chamber were recorded using a par sensor skp 215 skye instruments ltd uk and temperature probe 107 thermistor probe campbell scientific ltd usa by a cr800 data logger campbell scientific germany in addition daily measurements of thaw depth soil temperature and moisture at 5 cm depth gs3 decagon devices inc usa were made next to each plot water table depth was monitored manually at both microsites in 2014 and by use of a water level logger diver schlumberger usa installed at the polygon centre in 2015 meteorological data from the nearby ec tower were employed to provide additional variables for analysis 3 1 1 2 flux calculation water vapour fluxes inside the chamber were calculated as per kutzbach et al 2007 using a matlab routine eckhardt and kutzbach 2016 we estimated the transit period of gas from the chamber to the irga using the pump speed and visual inspection to be around 20 s the point after which we refer to as t 0 the increase in water vapour concentration inside the headspace dch2o dt was plotted over the duration of each measurement we examined the residuals of both linear and non linear regression models to describe dch2o dt see table s1 supplementary material in general over a short period of 40 s we found no clear visual difference in residuals from the two regression models the extent to which a linear or non linear fit was favoured statistically depended strongly on the time period examined with notable differences between the 2014 and 2015 campaigns overall however the differences between the non linear and linear model were relatively small see supplementary material the linear model was favoured by the akaike information criterion for small sample sizes aicc burnham and anderson 2004 and the two regression models had similar adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj values furthermore a visual analysis of the dch2o dt curves found that the non linear fit sometimes gave false high flux rates at times of very low water vapour flux due to it being more robust we decided that a linear model over a short period of 40 s was the most suitable for describing the change of water vapour concentrations in the chamber headspace especially under the low flux conditions experienced in 2015 this choice of a linear model and the spurious high flux rates associated with a non linear fit are in agreement with the barrow chamber et studies cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 finally a variable amount of noise in the signal from the ugga was visible in our results and we used a two tailed student s t test to identify and remove flux estimates where the linear regression slope dch2o dt was not significantly different from zero p 0 1 n 2 degrees of freedom this significance filtering successfully removed the majority of remaining spurious high flux rates from our analysis resulting from poor fitting of our linear model to the chamber data it is well known that sorption of water vapour from the chamber to the connecting tube walls can cause a systematic underestimation of fluxes philip 1963 we therefore performed an additional experiment in the field to compare calculated et fluxes from a 1 m vs a 10 m tube arrangement enabling us to reduce the impact of sorption on our results flux measurements were conducted in july 2018 between 09 00 and 12 00 local time at one of our permanent measurement collars on the polygon rim we utilised the same setup and measurement procedure as in the 2014 and 2015 measurement campaigns with 2 min chamber closure periods after each measurement the chamber was flushed with ambient air and the measurement was then repeated with a different length of tubing successive measurements were conducted using the 10 m and 1 m tubes totalling six repetitions for each tube length the cool and wet climatic conditions of these experiments were similar to those which prevailed during the 2015 campaign average air temperature recorded during our 2018 measurements was around 4 c net radiation was 139 wm 2 rh was around 84 and wind speeds were low at 4 ms 1 boike et al 2019 chamber et fluxes calculated using a linear regression over a 40 second interval with a 1 m tube were consistently twice those using a 10 m tube n 12 mean scaling factor sd 2 06 0 29 the impact of tube length on chamber et fluxes therefore appears to be strong consistent in magnitude and should not be ignored we decided to simulate the 1 m tube experiment on our data minimising the impact of sorption on our results by correcting each original 10 m tube flux estimate by a factor of 2 this tube length correction has been applied to all chamber flux estimates reported from hereon and hence forms the basis of all subsequent modelling analyses p m modelling and upscaling while the 2018 measurements did not span the full range of climatic conditions experienced over the 2014 and 2015 campaigns we believe our scaling factor of 2 is likely to be the minimum scaling factor required to simulate a 1 m tube during conditions conducive to high et rates such as those observed in 2014 we expect this scaling factor would increase due to a greater amount of water vapour sorption to the chamber walls and tubing in turn causing a larger underestimation of the true flux individual chamber et etchamber estimates during each measurement round consecutive measurement of collars 1 8 were averaged separately for polygon rim and centre microsites the time required to complete one measurement round was approximately 40 min and so is comparable to the 30 minute ec flux intervals measurements with non significant linear regression slopes were removed and a total of 108 measurement rounds for 2014 52 centre 56 rim and 114 measurement rounds for 2015 64 centre 50 rim were used for analysis 3 1 2 eddy covariance et fluxes 3 1 2 1 setup and data processing data from an ec system stationed in the central part of the river terrace close to the reference polygon see fig 2b were used to provide a benchmark for our etchamber estimates the set up involved a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc

conducted using the eddypro software v6 0 0 li cor biosciences inc usa pre conditioning of the data involved coordinate rotation and time lag removal aubinet et al 1999 mcmillen 1988 after which le fluxes were calculated across 30 minute averaging intervals baldocchi et al 2001 the wpl term was applied to correct for the effects of fluctuations in air density webb et al 1980 and we adopted the meteorological convention whereby positive values indicate a net upwards flux of energy or matter to the atmosphere micro meteorological quality control analysis was conducted to determine periods when the conditions necessary for ec were invalid typically during times of very stable atmospheric conditions and low turbulence foken and wichura 1996 subsequent gaps in the data were filled using the online eddy covariance gap filling and flux partitioning tool reichstein et al 2005 this study examines only gap filled le data with a quality flag of 1 which is the most reliable after the original data as part of a 0 3 scale for the 2014 campaign gap filling was performed for 17 of half hourly flux estimates all of which had a quality flag of 1 in contrast for 2015 gap filling was necessary for 30 8 of le fluxes largely due to a power failure event during which no data were collected 20 25 august 2015 this period of missing data was removed from our analysis and all remaining le fluxes were converted to et rates in mm d 1 3 1 2 2 footprint analysis and mapping we determined the source area of each 30 minute ec flux interval using the analytical footprint model of kormann meixner 2001 for non neutral stratification employing a constant roughness length z 0 0 13 m analysis revealed that the majority 90 of the measured flux was sourced within a 1000 m distance of the ec tower with the peak flux contribution located 60 m of the tower the most common wind directions spanned the sector 90 180 with south easterly winds observed 44 of the time over both campaigns during periods with stronger winds from the west and south west however the footprint area extended to cover a larger area of overgrown and open water including a number of lakes although the surface could not be considered fully homogeneous during these times the relative error induced by including these areas is minimal during summer holl et al 2019 to estimate the relative areal coverage of each land cover class inside the footprint per 30 minute source area data from the footprint model were overlain with a high resolution land cover map boike et al 2012 see fig 2a weighted by the footprint probability density function forbrich et al 2011 land cover in the map is heterogeneous and separated into four classes i dry tundra ii wet tundra iii overgrown water and iv open water as described in table 1 unclassified parts 2 1 of the map were assigned as a proportionate mix of the other four classes to enable full classification within the mapped extent we termed the percentage of the footprint covered by the map image sum image see fig 4 and to limit uncertainty we removed instances where the sum image was 80 from our analysis this practice increased the mean sum image of our footprint for the two measurement campaigns to 93 3 3 6 meaning that on average over 90 of the footprint was underlain by the map the remaining unclassified area when the footprint exceeded the mapped area was filled proportionately by each mapped land cover type for each footprint interval wind direction had a clear impact on the areal coverage of land cover types inside the footprint fig 4 overall dry tundra areas were the most prevalent whereas the other land cover types occupied a much smaller proportion of the mapped area table 1 a visual comparison of fig 4a and 4b shows that ec footprint periods with coinciding chamber measurements covered a similar distribution of winds and land cover types to the full campaign period 3 2 performance of the chamber method using ec as a benchmark 3 2 1 the penman monteith model calculated chamber fluxes were modelled using the penman monteith p m model monteith 1965 penman 1948 et in this physically based model is determined mainly

were upscaled to make them comparable with the ecosystem scale ec measurements combining the above footprint analysis with flux rate estimates for each land cover type we used polygon centre and rim adjusted versions of the p m equation to approximate et rates for wet and dry tundra areas for areas of open and overgrown water as no direct et measurements were available these were combined into a

water 4 results 4 1 spatial and temporal variability of et 4 1 1 hydrometeorological conditions the two measurement campaigns varied considerably in their hydrometeorological conditions as shown in fig 5 the first campaign 2014 was during a relatively dry year with near average air temperatures summer precipitation may september fell 19 below the baseline average whereas the 2015 campaign was characterised by wetter conditions with precipitation totals that were 18 above average per boike et al 2013 this rain fell across a number of events including one heavy precipitation event where 17 9 mm rain fell over a 12 h period on 23 24 august 2015 these events caused considerable fluctuations in water table depth with the reference polygon often remaining water saturated up to the soil surface for a number of days this situation is in strong contrast to 2014 where water table depth at the reference polygon was continuously below the surface and decreased steadily over the course of the summer in addition to being wetter the second campaign saw the growing season commence later than usual air temperatures in early summer may and june 2015 were around 1 c cooler than during the previous year resulting in the delayed thawing of snow and ice and subsequent later onset of vegetation growth despite this early disparity monthly mean temperatures for august and september over the two years were similar and both close to the 1998 2011 average reported by boike et al 2013 net radiation rn was highly variable over the measurement campaigns due to changing synoptic weather conditions as well as the strong seasonal cycle on average daily rn in 2014 was around 35 higher than in the 2015 campaign with the largest difference between the two campaigns seen in july finally the air was drier in summer 2014 where daily mean vpd was considerably higher 40 than observed in 2015 4 1 2 chamber et fluxes our calculated chamber fluxes display considerable variability both spatially between the two microsites as well as temporally over the two campaigns see fig 6 average etchamber from the 2014 campaign calculated from all individual measurements at the reference polygon was 12 4 8 4 mg m 2 s 1 mean sd this rate exceeds estimates for 2015 where average etchamber was around 80 lower 2 5 2 0 mg m 2 s 1 and there were few instances where et rates were as large as the 2014 average no strong seasonal cycle was visible in the chamber et fluxes from the reference polygon see fig 6 during the first campaign near daily flux measurements showed an increase in et rates until the second week of august where a maximum daily et rate of 34 mg m 2 s 1 was measured it follows that mean daily et in august was over twice that recorded in july in contrast during the 2015 campaign flux rates were generally low throughout july and august increasing to a maximum in late august start of september for 2015 mean monthly daytime et was highest during september and considerably lower during august and july examination of the two microsites also revealed some degree of spatial heterogeneity on average et fluxes measured at the polygon centre exceeded those from the polygon rim see fig 6 during the 2014 campaign for example average et at the polygon centre was over 30 larger than measured at the rim microsite however there were also cases where the opposite was true and we observed considerable overlap in the range of flux estimates from the two microsites the contrasting hydrometeorological conditions of the two campaign periods appear to have influenced the performance of the chamber technique for the majority of cases in the 2014 campaign we observed an initial increase in water vapour concentration ch2o upon chamber setting as is characteristic of a closed system in contrast despite employing the same measurement procedure data from the 2015 campaign reveal much shallower dch2o dt initial slopes during this campaign a constant or decreasing ch2o was the most common trend over the period of chamber deployment and a high proportion of dch2o dt regression slopes were not statistically significant 45 in 2015 vs 8 in 2014 both p 0 1 4 1 3 eddy covariance et fluxes as seen in the hydrometeorological and chamber data contrasting flux rates were also measured by the ec system fig 5a in 2014 average daily eteddy was 1 39 0 65 mm d 1 for the period may september whereas in 2015 average daily eteddy for the same period was 0 98 0 63 mm d 1 equating to a reduction of around 20 on the previous year furthermore a visual examination of fig 5 shows that the peaks of up to 3 mm d 1 observed in eteddy often coinciding with peaks in tair and rn were less frequent and less pronounced over the 2015 campaign than in 2014 4 2 performance of the chamber method using ec as a benchmark 4 2 1 the penman monteith model our fitted p m model for the 2014 campaign displayed good skill in predicting etchamber r2 0 67 rmse 4 86 mg m 2 s 1 for the polygon centre and r2 0 67 rmse 5 28 mg m 2 s 1 for the polygon rim both p 0 01 although employing surface resistance rs as a fit parameter resulted in unrealistic rs values median rs 331 s m 1 the model was able to maintain the characteristics of the chamber measured fluxes with average predicted et rates at the polygon centre for the 2014 campaign 13 9 8 4 mg m 2 s 1 exceeding those at the polygon rim 10 1 9 1 mg m 2 s 1 in contrast when the two campaign periods were considered jointly we found it was not possible to fit the p m model to the chamber fluxes at an acceptable significance level furthermore solving eqn 2 for the surface resistance produced implausibly high values for this parameter median rs 763 s m 1 for 2014 2037 s m 1 for 2015 both in the joint model over twice those seen when employing only the 2014 data in this joint model calculated rs values based on the chamber data were over a factor of ten greater than those calculated using the ec data median 63 s m 1 for 2014 58 s m 1 for 2015 and displayed much more variability over the two campaigns the following analysis therefore focusses on data from the 2014 campaign only for which we were able to model rs based on net radiation and relative humidity using a stepwise multilinear regression at an acceptable significance level see eq 5 rs rim r2 0 12 rmse 199 s m 1 p 0 05 rs centre r2 0

alongside ec based estimates in fig 7 the et flux is clearly underestimated by our preliminary upscaling model fig 7a with average modelled et rates for the campaign period around a factor of two smaller than ec derived estimates et upscaled 0 74 0 74 mm d 1 et ec 1 32 1 27 mm d 1 model r2 0 79 p 0 01 although the daily cycle was often captured by this model approximately 20 of the observed variability remained unexplained daily peaks in et measured by the ec technique were considerably larger than those predicted by the upscaling model when eteddy was high our preliminary upscaling model therefore had a strong tendency to under predict et producing what we term a positive etresidual et residual et eddy et upscaled we used linear regression to investigate which factors affected the performance of our preliminary upscaling model finding that meteorological conditions were able to explain a significant amount of the gap between upscaled and ec estimates p 0 01 rn exhibited the strongest influence on etresidual r2 0 58 p 0 01 with a strong positive correlation between the two variables during periods with high levels of net radiation our upscaling model under predicted et rates by over 3 mm d 1 in addition to rn analysis found that humidity and temperature could each explain around 20 of the residual with tair and vpd positively influencing the size of the residual fig 7b shows the relative et rates for each of the footprint land cover components estimated by our upscaling model due to the large areal coverage of dry tundra inside the ec footprint et flux rates from this land cover type were weighted more heavily and therefore had a strong influence on the estimated flux rate by comparing fig 7a and 7b it is clear that chamber based rates for both etwet and etdry were much lower than eteddy whereas estimates of etwater were of similar magnitude to eteddy using a linear regression with intercept forced through the origin we therefore calculated a correction factor cf of 1 92 which was applied to the wet and dry tundra et components of our upscaling model this cf is in addition to our tube length correction see section 3 1 1 2 and reduced the gap between average eteddy and average etupscaled estimates by over 50 etresidual 0 69 0 70 mm d 1 etresidual after cf applied 0 29 0 57 mm d 1 5 discussion 5 1 spatial and temporal variability of et 5 1 1 sensitivity to hydrometeorological conditions our analysis has highlighted the sensitivity of chamber based et fluxes to the predominant hydrometeorological conditions we identified large differences in the magnitude of chamber et fluxes between the two campaign years with etchamber in the relatively dry year of 2014 being around five times higher than observed during the wetter campaign of 2015 a strong interannual variability in et has been previously reported across arctic sites liljedahl et al 2011 lund et al 2014 rouse et al 1992 wu et al 2010 young robertson et al 2018 however in the present study it appears remarkable that estimates from the ec tower are much less sensitive to the changing conditions than the chamber measurements with a considerably smaller difference in average flux rate 30 seen between the two years the observed contrast in hydrometeorological conditions could also in part explain the high number of non significant dch2o dt slopes recorded by the chamber irga in 2015 45 for the 2014 campaign non significant dch2o dt slopes were only recorded during the two 24 hour measurement campaigns covering only 8 of measurements where negligible et rates are expected due to low levels of net radiation at night time despite employing the same methodology at the same measurement plots the 2015 data displayed no such diurnal dependence of significant dch2o dt slopes the high number of non significant slopes here highlight the poor performance of the chamber method in the cool moist conditions which were dominant during the second field campaign leading us to question its robustness for measuring et in such a low flux environment this contrasting performance of the chamber method under different hydrometeorological conditions has not been identified in the experiments at barrow raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 most likely due to limited temporal coverage long term chamber et measurements are required across a range of sites to further assess this issue 5 1 2 chamber et fluxes a systematic underestimation of fluxes is a key problem affecting chamber estimates this methodological bias results from a number of factors including 1 alteration of the water vapour concentration gradient upon chamber setting davidson et al 2002 raz yaseef et al 2010 and 2 modification of the microclimate by the chamber davidson et al 2002 livingston and hutchinson 1995 in terms of the second point during chamber deployment the studied surface and atmosphere are effectively decoupled especially in terms of wind speed which is known to be a strong control on et e g lafleur 2008 interestingly however we found the residual between our upscaling model and the ec data displayed only a weak relationship with wind speed r2 0 05 p 0 01 despite the fact that fan induced wind speeds inside the chamber were over a factor of ten lower than those measured in the ambient environment influencing ec flux estimates finally it is important to note that water vapour transport as et is different from the diffusive flux of co2 or ch4 measured in other chamber experiments due to the phase change of liquid water to water vapour the sorption and desorption of water molecules between the chamber and tubing is important to consider for chamber flux estimates especially when the irga follows sample transport through a tube and given the stickiness of water vapour compared with co2 or ch4 in our study during times which were especially conducive to et e g high levels of incoming solar radiation large vpd moist surface we observed condensation on the inside of the chamber over longer periods of chamber deployment in contrast no visible condensation was mentioned for either the portable or automatic chamber setups at barrow cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 although sorption is still likely to have had an impact on et estimates we hypothesise that sorption could also have caused our chamber based approach to underestimate et from wet sites relatively more than from dry sites the higher et rates from wet tundra areas create moister air which could have led to more condensation at the tube and chamber walls than at dry sites and in turn could have caused a higher relative flux underestimation at this microsite the lower average summer temperatures during the barrow measurement campaigns and the relatively dry location of their automated chamber may explain some of the difference seen in the present study although the problem of sorption and desorption has been considered for closed path ec systems to our knowledge little attention has been paid to this issue in chamber setups recent ec studies examining the extent of tube attenuation of water vapour fluctuations find this is influenced by meteorological conditions especially rh and temperature e g haslwanter et al 2009 ibrom et al 2007 nordbo et al 2013 runkle et al 2012 which is consistent with our contrasting dch2o dt slope characteristics between measurement campaigns the impact and extent of attenuation could be lessened by warming the sampling tube and significantly reducing its length the former may have been observed indirectly during the 2014 campaign when black tubing was used and a much higher proportion of significant dch2o dt fluxes was observed than during the 2015 campaign where transparent tubing was used these are aspects of research design which should be examined closely in future studies using the chamber method to measure et fluxes 5 1 3 eddy covariance et fluxes at the ecosystem level we employed ec estimates as a benchmark against which to evaluate the performance of the chamber method hence our analysis assumes that these tower based estimates are correct in reality ec measurements are associated with error arising for example from data processing steps and gap filling falge et al 2001 papale et al 2006 inhomogeneity of the footprint area and micrometeorological problems such as an incomplete energy balance closure foken 2008 as such the ec method is known to under capture fluxes and true ecosystem level flux rates are likely to be greater than reported here our analysis also relied heavily on the accuracy of our chosen footprint model kormann and meixner 2001 and the land cover classification map boike et al 2012 a shift in the size and shape of the flux source area would impact our results especially during periods when larger water covered areas are involved 5 2 performance of the chamber method using ec as a benchmark 5 2 1 the penman monteith model adjusting the p m model to the chamber data produced implausibly high values for rs 200 s m 1 whereas tuning the model to the ec data produced estimates for rs 62 s m 1 which were in much closer agreement with that previously reported for the footprint 44 s m 1 kutzbach 2006 and for other permafrost areas including sites in alaska 175 s m 1 beringer et al 2005 and sweden 160 70 s m 1 kellner 2001 although there appears to be considerable spread among estimates to examine the contribution of the chamber data to the success of the p m model in predicting et we tested its performance using fixed rs values from the above literature our comparison found that running the p m model independently of the chamber results produced et estimates which were in much better agreement with those from the literature and our tower based ec estimates in terms of magnitude for example for the 2014 campaign running the p m model with kellner s rs value kellner 2001 produces et estimates of 1 8 1 3 mm d 1 for the polygon centre and 1 6 1 5 mm d 1 for polygon rim which would reduce the need for any correction factor this finding suggests that the p m model alone is able to provide et estimates which are much closer to our ec benchmark than the chamber method as such despite having demonstrated that the chamber method can tease apart differences in microsite conditions we argue that the chamber method alone is not appropriate for measuring fluxes in wet cool tundra climates such as our study site 5 2 2 upscaling et for the 2014 campaign our ground based et estimates corrected for tube length were successfully upscaled after application of a cf for the polygonal tundra our etupscaled is in good agreement with flux rates from the tower based ec system and those in the literature for samoylov island table 2 examining the individual land cover components our et estimates for water covered areas 2 4 1 8 mm d 1 fall within the upper range reported in the available literature abnizova et al 2012 muster et al 2012 our modelled et rates for wet and dry tundra are lower than reported previously for samoylov island most notably our summer et rates for wet tundra are around 50 60 lower than that reported at the site using lysimetry muster et al 2012 and mobile ec towers langer et al 2011 our upscaling model also predicts similar et rates for wet and dry tundra areas 0 9 mm d 1 and 0 7 mm d 1 respectively which is in stark contrast to both langer et al 2011 and muster et al 2012 who report et fluxes from wet tundra to be around a factor of two higher than those from dry tundra see table 2 these differences are likely a result of interannual variability and spatial differences within wet and dry tundra areas as our chamber data also show considerable overlap in et rates between rim and centre microsites at our low centred polygon et rates in the literature for arctic tundra sites vary considerably but are in broad agreement with our findings blok et al 2011 for example report summer et rates of 0 7 2 4 mm d 1 over a two week period at a more easterly siberian tundra site using ec and lysimetry considering studies with longer timeseries for a site in northeast greenland lund et al 2014 calculate 10 year mean midday et rate of 1 8 0 2 mm d 1 and liljedahl et al 2011 calculate a 5 year mean of 1 5 mm d 1 at barrow alaska for our upscaling analysis we assumed that our local estimates of etwater etwet and etdry were fully representative of all such areas inside the ec footprint whereas in reality they are likely to vary furthermore it is important to highlight that no direct measurements of etwater were made during this study and that this category grouped overgrown and open water areas which will differ in their respective et rates over the 2014 campaign period we found a strong agreement between ec and modelled et estimates from our upscaling analysis r2 0 82 rmse 0 54 mm d 1 although both chamber and upscaled estimates were consistently smaller than their ec counterparts raz yaseef et al 2017 are the only authors we know of to have compared et rates across scales between chamber and ec measurements et rates measured by their automatic chamber were on average 44 of those measured by an ec system as no upscaling analysis was performed the authors assumed this disparity was linked to the contrasting plant types and geomorphological units covered by the two systems in our study after accounting for differing spatial coverage in our upscaling analysis and applying corrections for tube length and chamber flux underestimation we see the size of this discrepancy reduced by more than half to around 18 to put this into perspective studies scaling co2 fluxes from the chamber to ecosystem scale in cold environments find a much larger discrepancy ranging from 25 to 60 fox et al 2008 stoy et al 2013 our etresidual likely results from underestimation by the chamber method and challenges upscaling over areas of heterogeneous land cover furthermore we compared chamber estimates i e point flux measurements collected over a period of seconds across a single low centred polygon length 10 m with ec measurements taken over a 30 minute averaging period representative of a much larger area 1 000 m2 this mismatch is a source of systematic uncertainty in our chamber based estimates for wet and dry tundra that were used to drive the upscaling model for our 2014 data applying a correction factor to our wet and dry tundra et rates substantially improved agreement between ec and upscaled estimates by 50 although this approach is common practise in the literature mcleod et al 2004 raz yaseef et al 2010 for our study the sensitivity of the chamber flux errors to changing light and moisture conditions means that we would require a different cf for each campaign in contrast cohen et al 2015 reported that only one calibration is needed after which the chamber can be deployed in a range of ecosystems with their cf holding in both semi arid and continuous permafrost environments possible reasons for the contrasting results found in our study are the shorter sampling tube employed by cohen et al 2015 which would have reduced attenuation effects differences in irga performance and their measurement of et at only a high centred polygon as this microsite is comparatively drier than our wet tundra we hypothesise that lower et rates and air moisture from this microsite would again have reduced the effect of sorption on the authors flux estimates in our study the need to calculate a site specific and temporally varying correction factor means that the chamber method cannot be used as a stand alone tool for measuring et 6 conclusion by comparing ground based chamber and tower based ec estimates of et our study has built on the work conducted at barrow alaska examining the suitability of chambers for measuring et in a low water flux permafrost environment cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 performing chamber measurements over two complete summer seasons with contrasting hydrometeorological conditions and conducting an upscaling analysis to directly compare against ec measurements allowed us to carry out a more thorough temporal evaluation of chamber et estimates than has been done previously with our chamber setup we had two main findings 1 a clear heterogeneity in et exists at the small scale both spatially in terms of our rim and centre microsites and temporally with a strong contrast in chamber measured et over our two measurement campaigns and 2 good agreement between upscaled and ec rates r2 0 82 can be achieved after applying a cf to our modelled et rates for wet and dry tundra however our study has highlighted a number of issues surrounding the use of the chamber technique as a stand alone tool to measure et in arctic wetland environments namely a sizeable underestimation of et fluxes by the chamber method compared to ec estimates without a cf average et estimates produced by our upscaling model for wet and dry tundra areas were considerably smaller 50 than reported in the literature for the same site as with chamber measured et our upscaling estimates were also consistently lower than ec estimates we suggest this is predominantly due to attenuation affects in the sampling tube connecting the chamber to the irga the magnitude of underestimation appears to be greater under more moist conditions for example in areas of wet tundra where higher et rates can be expected than at the drier polygon rims a changing sensitivity of chamber flux estimates to the predominant hydrometeorological conditions we observed that differences in the magnitude of et fluxes between a wet and dry year campaign periods were much greater in the chamber data 80 difference than in the ec data 20 difference despite the success of chambers for measuring et at barrow alaska our study highlights large differences in the performance of the chamber method depending on experimental setup site characteristics and hydrometeorological conditions we suggest that in cool wet climatic conditions such as those in the arctic tundra significant methodological improvement and careful evaluation is required before this technique can be reliably used as a stand alone tool to estimate et in the meantime we have shown that when conducted alongside a trusted benchmark such as ec the chamber method can be used to capture valuable information on small scale heterogeneity in et in such a setup the benchmark allows for the appropriate cf to be calculated depending on the dominant hydrometeorological conditions furthermore as water vapour data is routinely collected during co2 and ch4 chamber flux experiments generating a parallel series of et measurements this would be a feasible approach to greatly improve monitoring efforts of et across the arctic and would be of substantial benefit to the

6133,evapotranspiration et is an important hydrological flux with a strong influence on greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost this study examines the suitability of the closed chamber method in characterising the spatial heterogeneity of et fluxes in a typical polygonal tundra landscape in the lena river delta northern siberia actual evapotranspiration is compared across scales using 1 ground based chamber measurements to observe et at the microsite scale and 2 tower based eddy covariance ec measurements which provide spatially averaged et observations at the ecosystem level adopting an upscaling approach using ec estimates as a benchmark the authors assess the suitability of the closed chamber method in an arctic wetland environment a short closure time 40 s and a linear model to describe the change in chamber headspace water vapour concentration were employed to estimate et rates from the chamber measurements using a correction factor chamber fluxes were successfully scaled to the ec data yet findings suggest that the performance of the closed chamber method is highly sensitive to the prevailing hydrometeorological conditions and it is likely that the sorption and desorption of water molecules to the inside of the chamber and tubing has a strong impact on results a number of methodological issues are presented in this paper which question the use of closed

evapotranspiration et is a key water flux in arctic wetland environments it inherently links the energy balance and water cycle with latent heat flux constituting the main energy sink on seasonal and longer time scales kane et al 1990 wessel and rouse 1994 and a major part of the summertime landscape water balance helbig et al 2013 due to the tight coupling between energy water and biogeochemical systems in arctic wetlands et is an important control on greenhouse gas emissions in permafrost areas as the water table determines the relative proportion of soil carbon released to the atmosphere as co2 or ch4 christensen et al 2004 schädel et al 2016 strack et al 2004 despite the importance of et there is poor understanding of this flux and its response to climate change in arctic areas bring et al 2016 hinzman et al 2013 vihma et al 2016 in arctic wetlands et is particularly complex due to the influence of patterned ground such as the polygonal tundra which covers much of the alaskan and siberian lowlands e g black 1982 romanovskii 1985 ice wedges under the soil surface create a pronounced micro relief with variations in vegetation hydrology soils and biogeochemical processes on the scale of a few meters brown et al 1980 helbig et al 2013 kutzbach et al 2004 sachs et al 2010 steedman et al 2017 vourlitis et al 1999 to date few studies have examined how micro topography affects et in heterogeneous tundra landscapes muster et al 2012 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 this gap in the literature limits our ability to understand the fine scale controls on this spatially variable flux and to predict how et in arctic ecosystems will change in the future both directly as a result of climate change mcvicar et al 2012 overland et al 2017 willett et al 2008 and indirectly via permafrost degradation or geomorphological change liljedahl et al 2016 in regions with extensive polygonal tundra such as the lena river delta in north eastern siberia it has been suggested that regional and global scale models which neglect small scale polygonal features could produce strongly biased estimates of et muster et al 2012 virtanen and ek 2014 in terms of monitoring

oechel hastings jenkins 1993 furthermore when instrumented with infrared greenhouse gas analysers irgas chamber systems are suited to conduct rapid spatial survey measurements 5 min not possible with other field techniques although chamber based et estimates are vulnerable to a range of errors see livingston and hutchinson 1995 studies conducted in warm temperate climates find that this technique can produce accurate measurements of water vapour exchange mcleod et al 2004 pérez priego et al 2010 reicosky et al 1983 in cold arctic environments however and despite the popularity of chambers for studying small scale variability in co2 and ch4 fluxes e g pirk et al 2016 sachs et al 2010 vourlitis et al 1993 little attention has been given to evaluating their suitability for measuring et to our knowledge the only studies where chamber measurements of this flux have been validated in an arctic tundra ecosystem were conducted on a coastal plane at barrow alaska cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 these studies are based on a one week field pilot study in 2013 cohen et al 2015 followed by three months of automated chamber data june september 2013 and two one week portable chamber campaigns july 2013 2014 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 at barrow chamber measurements of et have been used to capture diurnal cycles and different et rates across plant functional types and geomorphological units recently the potential of chambers to aid partitioning of et into its evaporation and transpiration fluxes has highlighted temporal and spatial variability in these components young robertson et al 2018 although the chamber setups used in barrow were calibrated against a laboratory based balance approach a large gap of over 40 has been identified between chamber and ec flux rates raz yaseef et al 2017 this disparity has been attributed to their different footprint in the landscape although a more robust analysis is pending we build on the work of the above authors to further test the chamber method at a different site the polygonal tundra in the lena river delta employing a nested approach we assess the performance of the chamber method in measuring actual et by comparing 1 ground based chamber measurements providing et estimates at the microsite scale 0 1 10 m2 with 2 tower based ec measurements which produce spatially averaged et estimates at the ecosystem scale 100 10 000 m2 to our knowledge this is the first study to adopt an upscaling approach to robustly test chamber et estimates using ec as a benchmark using two years of full growing season data from a new site we aim to 1 characterise the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in small scale et captured by the closed chamber method and 2 assess the performance of the closed chamber method for measuring et rates in the siberian arctic 2 study site this work was conducted on samoylov island 72 22 n 126 30 e one of the 1500 islands in the extensive lena river delta in north eastern siberia see fig 1 the island lies within the zone of continuous permafrost which extends to depths of 500 600 m in the study area zhang et al 1999 and has been the location of much research including studies of the carbon cycle and water balance see boike et al 2019 2013 climate at the site is arctic continental with a low annual rainfall of 125 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 12 5 c 1998 2011 boike et al 2013 temperature follows a strong seasonal cycle with a range in monthly average temperatures of over 40 c boike et al 2013 snowmelt commences around the middle of may and the growing season extends from mid june to mid september with the highest temperatures in july and august a more detailed description of baseline characteristics for samoylov island is provided by boike et al 2013 the island covers an area of about 5 km2 and is comprised of two geomorphological units the western part consists of an active floodplain 2 km2 and the eastern part 3 km2 where this study was conducted is formed of sediments from a holocene river terrace the terrace landscape is a wetland complex characterised by ponds thermokarst lakes and polygonal lowland tundra boike et al 2013 polygons are around 5 20 m wide and typically low centred with an elevation difference of 0 2 1 0 m between the wet centres and raised rims muster et al 2012 ground based chamber measurements were conducted across a low centred reference polygon in the centre of the river terrace see fig 2 this polygon was selected due to i features representative of low centred polygons in the region and ii close proximity to the ec tower 30 m fig 2b fig 2c shows the two microsites examined the wet polygon centre and the drier polygon rim the maximum active layer thickness alt at the polygon centre was around 40 cm and was deeper than measured at the polygon rim 30 cm the reference polygon centre was depressed and poorly drained with soils classified as reductaquic cryosols hyperhumic according to the wrb system iuss working group wrb 2015 cryoturbation was evident at the polygon rim with its turbic glacic cryosols and a water table

and the extended period july september 2015 we employed data from numerous sources including our ground and tower based measurements of et meteorological data from the ec tower and manually collected environmental variables from the reference polygon a schematic overview of our methodology to upscale the ground based chamber measurements is provided in fig 3 3 1 spatial and temporal variability of et 3 1 1 closed chamber et fluxes 3 1 1 1 experimental setup et was measured almost daily at the reference polygon using the closed chamber method from 22 july 20 august 2014 during the first campaign and from 11 july 22 september in 2015 details of the chamber setting and operation are provided by eckhardt et al 2019 and are therefore described only briefly here eight permanent measurement plots were established four per microsite and a pvc collar was inserted into the active layer at each plot several days before sampling commenced an airtight seal between the collar and the chamber was achieved using a silicone rubber u shaped frame filled with water chamber experiments were performed manually using a 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m clear chamber and lid both transparent to 90 par to minimise the effect of pressure shocks upon chamber setting hutchinson and livingston 2001 livingston et al 2006 two vents in the upper chamber surface were closed shortly after deployment a small fan inside the chamber ensured that headspace air was well mixed with average fan induced wind speed estimated as 0 37 0 12 m s 1 using a sonic anemometer solent r3 gill instruments uk chamber headspace trace gas concentrations h2o co2 and ch4 were measured for 2 min using an irga at 1 second intervals ugga los gatos research inc canada this analyser was connected to the chamber via plastic tubing length 10 m which was opaque black during the first campaign and replaced with clear polyurethane tubing for the second campaign to allow visible detection of condensation environmental conditions inside the chamber were recorded using a par sensor skp 215 skye instruments ltd uk and temperature probe 107 thermistor probe campbell scientific ltd usa by a cr800 data logger campbell scientific germany in addition daily measurements of thaw depth soil temperature and moisture at 5 cm depth gs3 decagon devices inc usa were made next to each plot water table depth was monitored manually at both microsites in 2014 and by use of a water level logger diver schlumberger usa installed at the polygon centre in 2015 meteorological data from the nearby ec tower were employed to provide additional variables for analysis 3 1 1 2 flux calculation water vapour fluxes inside the chamber were calculated as per kutzbach et al 2007 using a matlab routine eckhardt and kutzbach 2016 we estimated the transit period of gas from the chamber to the irga using the pump speed and visual inspection to be around 20 s the point after which we refer to as t 0 the increase in water vapour concentration inside the headspace dch2o dt was plotted over the duration of each measurement we examined the residuals of both linear and non linear regression models to describe dch2o dt see table s1 supplementary material in general over a short period of 40 s we found no clear visual difference in residuals from the two regression models the extent to which a linear or non linear fit was favoured statistically depended strongly on the time period examined with notable differences between the 2014 and 2015 campaigns overall however the differences between the non linear and linear model were relatively small see supplementary material the linear model was favoured by the akaike information criterion for small sample sizes aicc burnham and anderson 2004 and the two regression models had similar adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj values furthermore a visual analysis of the dch2o dt curves found that the non linear fit sometimes gave false high flux rates at times of very low water vapour flux due to it being more robust we decided that a linear model over a short period of 40 s was the most suitable for describing the change of water vapour concentrations in the chamber headspace especially under the low flux conditions experienced in 2015 this choice of a linear model and the spurious high flux rates associated with a non linear fit are in agreement with the barrow chamber et studies cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 finally a variable amount of noise in the signal from the ugga was visible in our results and we used a two tailed student s t test to identify and remove flux estimates where the linear regression slope dch2o dt was not significantly different from zero p 0 1 n 2 degrees of freedom this significance filtering successfully removed the majority of remaining spurious high flux rates from our analysis resulting from poor fitting of our linear model to the chamber data it is well known that sorption of water vapour from the chamber to the connecting tube walls can cause a systematic underestimation of fluxes philip 1963 we therefore performed an additional experiment in the field to compare calculated et fluxes from a 1 m vs a 10 m tube arrangement enabling us to reduce the impact of sorption on our results flux measurements were conducted in july 2018 between 09 00 and 12 00 local time at one of our permanent measurement collars on the polygon rim we utilised the same setup and measurement procedure as in the 2014 and 2015 measurement campaigns with 2 min chamber closure periods after each measurement the chamber was flushed with ambient air and the measurement was then repeated with a different length of tubing successive measurements were conducted using the 10 m and 1 m tubes totalling six repetitions for each tube length the cool and wet climatic conditions of these experiments were similar to those which prevailed during the 2015 campaign average air temperature recorded during our 2018 measurements was around 4 c net radiation was 139 wm 2 rh was around 84 and wind speeds were low at 4 ms 1 boike et al 2019 chamber et fluxes calculated using a linear regression over a 40 second interval with a 1 m tube were consistently twice those using a 10 m tube n 12 mean scaling factor sd 2 06 0 29 the impact of tube length on chamber et fluxes therefore appears to be strong consistent in magnitude and should not be ignored we decided to simulate the 1 m tube experiment on our data minimising the impact of sorption on our results by correcting each original 10 m tube flux estimate by a factor of 2 this tube length correction has been applied to all chamber flux estimates reported from hereon and hence forms the basis of all subsequent modelling analyses p m modelling and upscaling while the 2018 measurements did not span the full range of climatic conditions experienced over the 2014 and 2015 campaigns we believe our scaling factor of 2 is likely to be the minimum scaling factor required to simulate a 1 m tube during conditions conducive to high et rates such as those observed in 2014 we expect this scaling factor would increase due to a greater amount of water vapour sorption to the chamber walls and tubing in turn causing a larger underestimation of the true flux individual chamber et etchamber estimates during each measurement round consecutive measurement of collars 1 8 were averaged separately for polygon rim and centre microsites the time required to complete one measurement round was approximately 40 min and so is comparable to the 30 minute ec flux intervals measurements with non significant linear regression slopes were removed and a total of 108 measurement rounds for 2014 52 centre 56 rim and 114 measurement rounds for 2015 64 centre 50 rim were used for analysis 3 1 2 eddy covariance et fluxes 3 1 2 1 setup and data processing data from an ec system stationed in the central part of the river

fluxes were calculated across 30 minute averaging intervals baldocchi et al 2001 the wpl term was applied to correct for the effects of fluctuations in air density webb et al 1980 and we adopted the meteorological convention whereby positive values indicate a net upwards flux of energy or matter to the atmosphere micro meteorological quality control analysis was conducted to determine periods when the conditions necessary for ec were invalid typically during times of very stable atmospheric conditions and low turbulence foken and wichura 1996 subsequent gaps in the data were filled using the online eddy covariance gap filling and flux partitioning tool reichstein et al 2005 this study examines only gap filled le data with a quality flag of 1 which is the most reliable after the original data as part of a 0 3 scale for the 2014 campaign gap filling was performed for 17 of half hourly flux estimates all of which had a quality flag of 1 in contrast for 2015 gap filling was necessary for 30 8 of le fluxes largely due to a power failure event during which no data were collected 20 25 august 2015 this period of missing data was removed from our analysis and all remaining le fluxes were converted to et rates in mm d 1 3 1 2 2 footprint analysis and mapping we determined the source area of each 30 minute ec flux interval using the analytical footprint model of kormann meixner 2001 for non neutral stratification employing a constant roughness length z 0 0 13 m analysis revealed that the majority 90 of the measured flux was sourced within a 1000 m distance of the ec tower with the peak flux contribution located 60 m of the tower the most common wind directions spanned the sector 90 180 with south easterly winds observed 44 of the time over both campaigns during periods with stronger winds from the west and south west however the footprint area extended to cover a larger area of overgrown and open water including a number of lakes although the surface could not be considered fully homogeneous during these times the relative error induced by including these areas is minimal during summer holl et al 2019 to estimate the relative areal coverage of each land cover class inside the footprint per 30 minute source area data from the footprint model were overlain with a high resolution land cover map boike et al 2012 see fig 2a weighted by the footprint probability density function forbrich et al 2011 land cover in the map is heterogeneous and separated into four classes i dry tundra ii wet tundra iii overgrown water and iv open water as described in table 1 unclassified parts 2 1 of the map were assigned as a proportionate mix of the other four classes to enable full classification within the mapped extent we termed the percentage of the footprint covered by the map image sum image see fig 4 and to limit uncertainty we removed instances where the sum image was 80 from our analysis this practice increased the mean sum image of our footprint for the two measurement campaigns to 93 3 3 6 meaning that on average over 90 of the footprint was underlain by the map the remaining unclassified area when the footprint exceeded the mapped area was filled proportionately by each mapped land cover type for each footprint interval wind direction had a clear impact on the areal coverage of land cover types inside the footprint fig 4 overall dry tundra areas were the most prevalent whereas the other land cover types occupied a much smaller proportion of the mapped area table 1 a visual comparison of fig 4a and 4b shows that ec footprint periods with coinciding chamber measurements covered a similar distribution of winds and land cover types to the full campaign period 3 2 performance of the chamber method using ec as a

water 4 results 4 1 spatial and temporal variability of et 4 1 1 hydrometeorological conditions the two measurement campaigns varied considerably in their hydrometeorological conditions as shown in fig 5 the first campaign 2014 was during a relatively dry year with near average air temperatures summer precipitation may september fell 19 below the baseline average whereas the 2015 campaign was characterised by wetter conditions with precipitation totals that were 18 above average per boike et al 2013 this rain fell across a number of events including one heavy precipitation event where 17 9 mm rain fell over a 12 h period on 23 24 august 2015 these events caused considerable fluctuations in water table depth with the reference polygon often remaining water saturated up to the soil surface for a number of days this situation is in strong contrast to 2014 where water table depth at the reference polygon was continuously below the surface and decreased steadily over the course of the summer in addition to being wetter the second campaign saw the growing season commence later than usual air temperatures in early summer may and june 2015 were around 1 c cooler than during the previous year resulting in the delayed thawing of snow and ice and subsequent later onset of vegetation growth despite this early disparity monthly mean temperatures for august and september over the two years were similar and both close to the 1998 2011 average reported by boike et al 2013 net radiation rn was highly variable over the measurement campaigns due to changing synoptic weather conditions as well as the strong seasonal cycle on average daily rn in 2014 was around 35 higher than in the 2015 campaign with the largest difference between the two campaigns seen in july finally the air was drier in summer 2014 where daily mean vpd was considerably higher 40 than observed in 2015 4 1 2 chamber et fluxes our calculated chamber fluxes display considerable variability both spatially between the two microsites as well as temporally over the two campaigns see fig 6 average etchamber from the 2014 campaign calculated from all individual measurements at the reference polygon was 12 4 8 4 mg m 2 s 1 mean sd this rate exceeds estimates for 2015 where average etchamber was around 80 lower 2 5 2 0 mg m 2 s 1 and there were few instances where et rates were as large as the 2014 average no strong seasonal cycle was visible in the chamber et fluxes from the reference polygon see fig 6 during the first campaign near daily flux measurements showed an increase in et rates until the second week of august where a maximum daily et rate of 34 mg m 2 s 1 was measured it follows that mean daily et in august was over twice that recorded in july in contrast during the 2015 campaign flux rates were generally low throughout july and august increasing to a maximum in late august start of september for 2015 mean monthly daytime et was highest during september and considerably lower during august and july examination of the two microsites also revealed some degree of spatial heterogeneity on average et fluxes measured at the polygon centre exceeded those from the polygon rim see fig 6 during the 2014 campaign for example average et at the polygon centre was over 30 larger than measured at the rim microsite however there were also cases where the opposite was true and we observed considerable overlap in the range of flux estimates from the two microsites the contrasting hydrometeorological conditions of the two campaign periods appear to have influenced the performance of the chamber technique for the majority of cases in the 2014 campaign we observed an initial increase in water vapour concentration ch2o upon chamber setting as is characteristic of a closed system in contrast despite employing the same measurement procedure data from the 2015 campaign reveal much shallower dch2o dt initial slopes during this campaign a constant or decreasing ch2o was the most common trend over the period of chamber deployment and a high proportion of dch2o dt regression slopes were not statistically significant 45 in 2015 vs 8 in 2014 both p 0 1 4 1 3 eddy covariance et fluxes as seen in the hydrometeorological and chamber data contrasting flux rates were also measured by the ec system fig 5a in 2014 average daily eteddy was 1 39 0 65 mm d 1 for the period may september whereas in 2015 average daily eteddy for the same period was 0 98 0 63 mm d 1 equating to a reduction of around 20 on the previous year furthermore a visual examination of fig 5 shows that the peaks of up to 3 mm d 1 observed in eteddy often coinciding with peaks in tair and rn were less frequent and less pronounced over the 2015 campaign than in 2014 4 2 performance of the chamber method using ec as a benchmark 4 2 1 the penman monteith model our fitted p m model for the 2014 campaign displayed good skill in predicting etchamber r2 0 67 rmse 4 86 mg m 2 s 1 for the polygon centre and r2 0 67 rmse 5 28 mg m 2 s 1 for the polygon rim both p 0 01 although employing surface resistance rs as a fit parameter resulted in unrealistic rs values median rs 331 s m 1 the model was able to maintain the characteristics of the chamber measured fluxes with average predicted et rates at the polygon centre for the 2014 campaign 13 9 8 4 mg m 2 s 1 exceeding those at the polygon rim 10 1 9 1 mg m 2 s 1 in contrast when the two campaign periods were considered jointly we found it was not possible to fit the p m model to the chamber fluxes at an acceptable significance level furthermore solving eqn 2 for the surface resistance produced implausibly high values for this parameter median rs 763 s m 1 for 2014 2037 s m 1 for 2015 both in the joint model over twice those seen when employing only the 2014 data in this joint model calculated rs values based on the chamber data were over a factor of ten greater than those calculated using the ec data median 63 s m 1 for 2014 58 s m 1 for 2015 and displayed much more variability over the two campaigns the following analysis therefore focusses on data from the 2014 campaign only for which we were able to model rs based on net radiation and relative humidity using a stepwise multilinear regression at an acceptable significance level see eq 5 rs rim r2 0 12 rmse 199 s m 1 p 0 05 rs centre r2 0 17 rmse 152 s m 1 p 0 01 n 46 both 5 r s centre 169 9 0 67 rn r s rim 680 1 4 3 rh 4 2 2 upscaling et flux estimates for the 2014 campaign from our chamber based upscaling model eq 4 are presented alongside ec based estimates in fig 7 the et flux is clearly underestimated by our preliminary upscaling model fig 7a with average modelled et rates for the campaign period around a factor of two smaller than ec derived estimates et upscaled 0 74 0 74 mm d 1 et ec 1 32 1 27 mm d 1 model r2 0 79 p 0 01 although the daily cycle was often captured by this model approximately 20 of the observed variability remained unexplained daily peaks in et measured by the ec technique were considerably larger than those predicted by the upscaling model when eteddy was high our preliminary upscaling model therefore had a strong tendency to under predict et producing what we term a positive etresidual et residual et eddy et upscaled we used linear regression to investigate which factors affected the performance of our preliminary upscaling model finding that meteorological conditions were able to explain a significant amount of the gap between upscaled and ec estimates p 0 01 rn exhibited the strongest influence on etresidual r2 0 58 p 0 01 with a strong positive correlation between the two variables during periods with high levels of net radiation our upscaling model under predicted et rates by over 3 mm d 1 in addition to rn analysis found that humidity and temperature could each explain around 20 of the residual with tair and vpd positively influencing the size of the residual fig 7b shows the relative et rates for each of the footprint land cover components estimated by our upscaling model due to the large areal coverage of dry tundra inside the ec footprint et flux rates from this land cover type were weighted more heavily and therefore had a strong influence on the estimated flux rate by comparing fig 7a and 7b it is clear that chamber based rates for both etwet and etdry were much lower than eteddy whereas estimates of etwater were of similar magnitude to eteddy using a linear regression with intercept forced through the origin we therefore calculated a correction factor cf of 1 92 which was applied to the wet and dry tundra et components of our upscaling model this cf is in addition to our tube length correction see section 3 1 1 2 and reduced the gap between average eteddy and average etupscaled estimates by over 50 etresidual 0 69 0 70 mm d 1 etresidual after cf applied 0 29 0 57 mm d 1 5 discussion 5 1 spatial and temporal variability of et 5 1 1 sensitivity to hydrometeorological conditions our analysis has highlighted the sensitivity of chamber based et fluxes to the predominant hydrometeorological conditions we identified large differences in the magnitude of chamber et fluxes between the two campaign years with etchamber in the relatively dry year of 2014 being around five times higher than observed during the wetter campaign of 2015 a strong interannual variability in et has been previously reported across arctic sites liljedahl et al 2011 lund et al 2014 rouse et al 1992 wu et al 2010 young robertson et al 2018 however in the present study it appears remarkable that estimates from the ec tower are much less sensitive to the changing conditions than the chamber measurements with a considerably smaller difference in average flux rate 30 seen between the two years the observed contrast in hydrometeorological conditions could also in part explain the high number of non significant dch2o dt slopes recorded by the chamber irga in 2015 45 for the 2014 campaign non significant dch2o dt slopes were only recorded during the two 24 hour measurement campaigns covering only 8 of measurements where negligible et rates are expected due to low levels of net radiation at night time despite employing the same methodology at the same measurement plots the 2015 data displayed no such diurnal dependence of significant dch2o dt slopes the high number of non significant slopes here highlight the poor performance of the chamber method in the cool moist conditions which were dominant during the second field campaign leading us to question its robustness for measuring et in such a low flux environment this contrasting performance of the chamber method under different hydrometeorological conditions has not been identified in the experiments at barrow raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 most likely due to limited temporal coverage long term chamber et measurements are required across a range of sites to further assess this issue 5 1 2 chamber et fluxes a systematic underestimation of fluxes is a key problem affecting chamber estimates this methodological bias results from a number of factors including 1 alteration of the water vapour concentration gradient upon chamber setting davidson et al 2002 raz yaseef et al 2010 and 2 modification of the microclimate by the chamber davidson et al 2002 livingston and hutchinson 1995 in terms of the second point during chamber deployment the studied surface and atmosphere are effectively decoupled especially in terms of wind speed which is known to be a strong control on et e g lafleur 2008 interestingly however we found the residual between our upscaling model and the ec data displayed only a weak relationship with wind speed r2 0 05 p 0 01 despite the fact that fan induced wind speeds inside the chamber were over a factor of ten lower than those measured in the ambient environment influencing ec flux estimates finally it is important to note that water vapour transport as et is different from the diffusive flux of co2 or ch4 measured in other chamber experiments due to the phase change of liquid water to water vapour the sorption and desorption of water molecules between the chamber and tubing is important to consider for chamber flux estimates especially when the irga follows sample transport through a tube and given the stickiness of water vapour compared with co2 or ch4 in our study during times which were especially conducive to et e g high levels of incoming solar radiation large vpd moist surface we observed condensation on the inside of the chamber over longer periods of chamber deployment in contrast no visible condensation was mentioned for either the portable or automatic chamber setups at barrow cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 although sorption is still likely to have had an impact on et estimates we hypothesise that sorption could also have caused our chamber based approach to underestimate et from wet sites relatively more than from dry sites the higher et rates from wet tundra areas create moister air which could have led to more condensation at the tube and chamber walls than at dry sites and in turn could have caused a higher relative flux underestimation at this microsite the lower average summer temperatures during the barrow measurement campaigns and the relatively dry location of their automated chamber may explain some of the difference seen in the present study although the problem of sorption and desorption has been considered for closed path ec systems to our knowledge little attention has been paid to this issue in chamber setups recent ec studies examining the extent of tube attenuation of water vapour fluctuations find this is influenced by meteorological conditions especially rh and temperature e g haslwanter et al 2009 ibrom et al 2007 nordbo et al 2013 runkle et al 2012 which is consistent with our contrasting dch2o dt slope characteristics between measurement campaigns the impact and extent of attenuation could be lessened by warming the sampling tube and significantly reducing its length the former may have been observed indirectly during the 2014 campaign when black tubing was used and a much higher proportion of significant dch2o dt fluxes was observed than during the 2015 campaign where transparent tubing was used these are aspects of research design which should be examined closely in future studies using the chamber method to measure et fluxes 5 1 3 eddy covariance et fluxes at the ecosystem level we employed ec estimates as a benchmark against which to evaluate the performance of the chamber method hence our analysis assumes that these tower based estimates are correct in reality ec measurements are associated with error arising for example from data processing steps and gap filling falge et al 2001 papale et al 2006 inhomogeneity of the footprint area and micrometeorological problems such as an incomplete energy balance closure foken 2008 as such the ec method is known to under capture fluxes and true ecosystem level flux rates are likely to be greater than reported here our analysis also relied heavily on the accuracy of our chosen footprint model kormann and meixner 2001 and the land cover classification map boike et al 2012 a shift in the size and shape of the flux source area would impact our results especially during periods when larger water covered areas are involved 5 2 performance of the chamber method using ec as a benchmark 5 2 1 the penman monteith model adjusting the p m model to the chamber data produced implausibly high values for rs 200 s m 1 whereas tuning the model to the ec data produced estimates for rs 62 s m 1 which were in much closer agreement with that previously reported for the footprint 44 s m 1 kutzbach 2006 and for other permafrost areas including sites in alaska 175 s m 1 beringer et al 2005 and sweden 160 70 s m 1 kellner 2001 although there appears to be considerable spread among estimates to examine the contribution of the chamber data to the success of the p m model in predicting et we tested its performance using fixed rs values from the above literature our comparison found that running the p m model independently of the chamber results produced et estimates which were in much better agreement with those from the literature and our tower based ec estimates in terms of magnitude for example for the 2014 campaign running the p m model with kellner s rs value kellner 2001 produces et estimates of 1 8 1 3 mm d 1 for the polygon centre and 1 6 1 5 mm d 1 for polygon rim which would reduce the need for any correction factor this finding suggests that the p m model alone is able to provide et estimates which are much closer to our ec benchmark than the chamber method as such despite having demonstrated that the chamber method can tease apart differences in microsite conditions we argue that the chamber method alone is not appropriate for measuring fluxes in wet cool tundra climates such as our study site 5 2 2 upscaling et for the 2014 campaign our ground based et estimates corrected for tube length were successfully upscaled after application of a cf for the polygonal tundra our etupscaled is in good agreement with flux rates from the tower based ec system and those in the literature for samoylov island table 2 examining the individual land cover components our et estimates for water covered areas 2 4 1 8 mm d 1 fall within the upper range reported in the available literature abnizova et al 2012 muster et al 2012 our modelled et rates for wet and dry tundra are lower than reported previously for samoylov island most notably our summer et rates for wet tundra are around 50 60 lower than that reported at the site using lysimetry muster et al 2012 and mobile ec towers langer et al 2011 our upscaling model also predicts similar et rates for wet and dry tundra areas 0 9 mm d 1 and 0 7 mm d 1 respectively which is in stark contrast to both langer et al 2011 and muster et al 2012 who report et fluxes from wet tundra to be around a factor of two higher than those from dry tundra see table 2 these differences are likely a result of interannual variability and spatial differences within wet and dry tundra areas as our chamber data also show considerable overlap in et rates between rim and centre microsites at our low centred polygon et rates in the literature for arctic tundra sites vary considerably but are in broad agreement with our findings blok et al 2011 for example report summer et rates of 0 7 2 4 mm d 1 over a two week period at a more easterly siberian tundra site using ec and lysimetry considering studies with longer timeseries for a site in northeast greenland lund et al 2014 calculate 10 year mean midday et rate of 1 8 0 2 mm d 1 and liljedahl et al 2011 calculate a 5 year mean of 1 5 mm d 1 at barrow alaska for our upscaling analysis we assumed that our local estimates of etwater etwet and etdry were fully representative of all such areas inside the ec footprint whereas in reality they are likely to vary furthermore it is important to highlight that no direct measurements of etwater were made during this study and that this category grouped overgrown and open water areas which will differ in their respective et rates over the 2014 campaign period we found a strong agreement between ec and modelled et estimates from our upscaling analysis r2 0 82 rmse 0 54 mm d 1 although both chamber and upscaled estimates were consistently smaller than their ec counterparts raz yaseef et al 2017 are the only authors we know of to have compared et rates across scales between chamber and ec measurements et rates measured by their automatic chamber were on average 44 of those measured by an ec system as no upscaling analysis was performed the authors assumed this disparity was linked to the contrasting plant types and geomorphological units covered by the two systems in our study after accounting for differing spatial coverage in our upscaling analysis and applying corrections for tube length and chamber flux underestimation we see the size of this discrepancy reduced by more than half to around 18 to put this into perspective studies scaling co2 fluxes from the chamber to ecosystem scale in cold environments find a much larger discrepancy ranging from 25 to 60 fox et al 2008 stoy et al 2013 our etresidual likely results from underestimation by the chamber method and challenges upscaling over areas of heterogeneous land cover furthermore we compared chamber estimates i e point flux measurements collected over a period of seconds across a single low centred polygon length 10 m with ec measurements taken over a 30 minute averaging period representative of a much larger area 1 000 m2 this mismatch is a source of systematic uncertainty in our chamber based estimates for wet and dry tundra that were used to drive the upscaling model for our 2014 data applying a correction factor to our wet and dry tundra et rates substantially improved agreement between ec and upscaled estimates by 50 although this approach is common practise in the literature mcleod et al 2004 raz yaseef et al 2010 for our study the sensitivity of the chamber flux errors to changing light and moisture conditions means that we would require a different cf for each campaign in contrast cohen et al 2015 reported that only one calibration is needed after which the chamber can be deployed in a range of ecosystems with their cf holding in both semi arid and continuous permafrost environments possible reasons for the contrasting results found in our study are the shorter sampling tube employed by cohen et al 2015 which would have reduced attenuation effects differences in irga performance and their measurement of et at only a high centred polygon as this microsite is comparatively drier than our wet tundra we hypothesise that lower et rates and air moisture from this microsite would again have reduced the effect of sorption on the authors flux estimates in our study the need to calculate a site specific and temporally varying correction factor means that the chamber method cannot be used as a stand alone tool for measuring et 6 conclusion by comparing ground based chamber and tower based ec estimates of et our study has built on the work conducted at barrow alaska examining the suitability of chambers for measuring et in a low water flux permafrost environment cohen et al 2015 raz yaseef et al 2017 young robertson et al 2018 performing chamber measurements over two complete summer seasons with contrasting hydrometeorological conditions and conducting an upscaling analysis to directly compare against ec measurements allowed us to carry out a more thorough temporal evaluation of chamber et estimates than has been done previously with our chamber setup we had two main findings 1 a clear heterogeneity in et exists at the small scale both spatially in terms of our rim and centre microsites and temporally with a strong contrast in chamber measured et over our two measurement campaigns and 2 good agreement between upscaled and ec rates r2 0 82 can be achieved after applying a cf to our modelled et rates for wet and dry tundra however our study has highlighted a number of issues surrounding the use of the chamber technique as a stand alone tool to measure et in arctic wetland environments namely a sizeable underestimation of et fluxes by the chamber method compared to ec estimates without a cf average et estimates produced by our upscaling model for wet and dry tundra areas were considerably smaller 50 than reported in the literature for the same site as with chamber measured et our upscaling estimates were also consistently lower than ec estimates we suggest this is predominantly due to attenuation affects in the sampling tube connecting the chamber to the irga the magnitude of underestimation appears to be greater under more moist conditions for example in areas of wet tundra where higher et rates can be expected than at the drier polygon rims a changing sensitivity of chamber flux estimates to the predominant hydrometeorological conditions we observed that differences in the magnitude of et fluxes between a wet and dry year campaign periods were much greater in the chamber data 80 difference than in the ec data 20 difference despite the success of chambers for measuring et at barrow alaska our study highlights large differences in the performance of the chamber method depending on experimental setup site characteristics and hydrometeorological conditions we suggest that in cool wet climatic conditions such as those in the arctic tundra significant methodological improvement and careful evaluation is required before this technique can be reliably used as a stand alone tool to estimate et in the meantime we have shown that when conducted alongside a trusted benchmark such as ec the chamber method can be used to capture valuable information on small scale heterogeneity in et in such a setup the benchmark allows for the appropriate cf to be calculated depending on the dominant hydrometeorological conditions furthermore as water vapour data is routinely collected during co2 and ch4 chamber flux experiments generating a parallel series of et measurements this would be a feasible approach to greatly improve monitoring efforts of et across the arctic and would be of substantial benefit to the

understanding of clogging mechanisms a comprehensive modeling framework with an agreeable accuracy would be helpful nowadays the computational fluid dynamics discrete element method cfd dem coupled model becomes more and more popular in the simulation of particulate flows wang et al 2019 where the particles are in solid phase and their trajectories are calculated with newton s law of motion while the flow field of fluids is usually solved by navier stokes n s equations on a set of mesh for the coupling between fluids and particles there exists two kinds of method unresolved cfd dem and resolved cfd dem in the unresolved cfd dem the coupling between cfd and dem is achieved using empirical models for the fluid particle interaction which is calculated by volume averaged variables transforming between larangian and eulerian fields it is required that the mesh size should be larger than the particle size to ensure the accurate calculation of the void fraction in a computational cell peng et al 2014 li et al 2017 in contrast the resolved cfd dem obtains the fluid particle interaction through integration along the particle boundary which is resolved by fine meshes allocated on it a fluid structure interaction model such as immersed boundary method ibm should be employed to characterize the particle from the cells overlapped by it it is suggested that the mesh size should be at most 1 10 of the particle diameter so that the representation of particle boundary and the simulation results can both be acceptable uhlmann 2005 hager et al 2014 cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 consequently the resolved cfd dem approach costs much heavier computational burden compared with the unsolved one recently to fill the gap between resolved and unresolved cfd dem approaches the semi resolved cfd dem approach is also proposed mahmoudi et al 2016 cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the main difference between the semi resolved cfd dem and the resolved one is the simplified treatment of the shape of particles and morphology of the void space in this way the particles larger than cells can be more or less resolved while the fine particles smaller than cells are solved as an unresolved approach to somehow resolve the particles larger than cells a numerical model such as fictitious domain method fdm would be helpful for example cheng et al 2018 used a semi resolved cfd dem model to simulate the seepage induced fine particle migration within the gap graded soils that include fine and coarse particles the fdm was used to resolve the interaction between the fluid and coarse particles meanwhile the unresolved approach was adopted for the fine particles in the recently published paper numerical study on pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements zhang et al 2018 a cfd dem coupled model was used to numerically reveal the pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements the work proposed a practicable and good way for the mechanism investigation of similar processes however some inappropriate expressions about the modeling framework which may lead to misreading and misunderstanding of the cfd dem approach are found in the paper thus a discussion may be helpful for a deeper understanding of the cfd dem approach and its application for modeling of processes similar to the pore clogging in pervious pavements 2 inappropriate expressions from the paper it is noticed that the descriptions in section 3 2 are inappropriate the authors said that the commercial cfd software of fluent coupled with commercial dem software of edem could realize the connection of cfd with dem luo et al 2015 blais et al 2016 li and li 2018 in the cited works luo et al 2015 investigated the gas solid hydrodynamics and mixing characteristics of a three dimensional rectangular bubbling fluidized bed by a cfd dem model the open source code mfix dem garg et al 2012 was used blais et al 2016 investigated the viscous solid liquid mixing in a stirred tank equipped with a pitched blade turbine by both experiment and numerical simulation the cfd dem coupling was achieved by combining openfoam for the cfd part and liggghts kloss and goniva 2011 for the dem part moreover li and li 2018 proposed a volume of fluid vof and dem combined solver for gas liquid solid three phase flows which contain both an interface and discrete particles and the work was done within the open source package openfoam all in all we can find that the tools used in the referred works luo et al 2015 blais et al 2016 li and li 2018 are open source codes thus the description in the paper indicating the commercial software of fluent coupled with commercial dem software of edem is inappropriate and would cause misreading of the cited papers moreover the volume of friction vof

last term of eq 6 which represents the buoyancy and eq 6 should be corrected as 1 f fluid i f drag i 4 3 π r 3 p moreover the authors employed the vof method to simulate the air water two phase flow

phases respectively thus the density of fluid for the cfd part is not a constant and should be included in the continuity equation kuang et al 2019 5 φ ρ t φ ρ u 0 where φ represents the porosity last but not least the porosity is one of the most important parameters for the coupling between cfd and dem it is noticed that the total volume of all particles in a cell is divided by the cell volume for calculation of the volume fraction of particles in the unresolved cfd dem method luo et al 2015 blais et al 2016 li and li 2018 kuang et al 2019 with considering that some particles may be located over the cell boundary and only partial volumes of particles are included in a computational cell the porosity can be expressed as 6 φ 1 i 1 n a i v p i v cell where a i represents the fractional volume of particle i residing in the computational cell as seen in the paper zhang et al 2018 the mesh size is found smaller than the particles in the pervious pavement model thus the problem is put forward that how do the authors treat with the porosity in this region if the unresolved cfd dem approach is applied with using an empirical drag force model such as that provided in the paper problems would occur in the calculation of porosity in cells occupied by particles φ 0 and moreover cause the calculation of fluid particle interaction and the simulation of fluid flow inaccurate as seen in the introduction the semi resolved cfd dem approach would be applicable and a method such as ibm or fdm would be useful to achieve the coupling between the pervious pavement model and the
