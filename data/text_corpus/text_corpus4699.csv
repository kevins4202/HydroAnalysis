the carcc was suggested to effectively inhibit reinforcement corrosion and extend the effective service life of the structure a comprehensive consideration on the effects of reinforcement corrosion and slip of the coated steel on n u of carcc was performed consequently a calculation model for the n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was proposed keywords coral aggregate reinforced concrete column compression behavior reinforcement type ultimate bearing capacity calculation model marine engineering 1 introduction south china sea reefs are far from the continent normal aggregates and fresh water resources are lacking and traffic is inconvenient if normal aggregates and fresh water are transported by ships from the mainland the engineering cost is bound to be higher and limited by conditions such as wind and waves the time limit is difficult to guarantee however coral and seawater resources are rich in the south china sea corals are porous and have strong water absorption its caco3 content up to more than 96 belongs to the natural light aggregate therefore provides a new building material for islands and reefs engineering construction coral aggregate for the purpose of reducing the cost limiting time increasing raw material source availability and decreasing carbon footprint coral aggregate reinforced concrete columns carcc made of corals coral sands seawater and cement can be widely applied to the construction of ports levees airports and roads to achieve practical engineering benefits dempsey 1951 arumugam and ramamurthy 1996 reinforced concrete columns are one of the most basic components in reinforced concrete structures zhang et al 2012 owing to the natural porous structure of corals and large amounts of cl in seawater and corals corrosion was easily happened to the steel in carcc da et al 2016a yu et al 2017 hence with the cross section of the reinforcement reduced and the yield strength decreased the concrete section is damaged resulting in a significant reduction in the ultimate bearing capacity n u of carcc under large eccentric compression zhao and jin 2002 xu 2003 therefore a study on the compression behavior of carcc under large eccentric compression can provide an important theoretical basis for the application of cac in marine engineering structures at present scholars at home and abroad generally focused on the study of ordinary portland reinforced concrete columns oprcc and lightweight aggregate reinforced concrete column larcc few studies could be found about cac especially about its compression performance zhou zhou et al 2008 and chen chen et al 2014 studied the larcc compression behavior and found that the failure process and mode of larcc under stress were similar to oprcc hui hui et al 2015 focused on the eccentric compression behavior of larcc with steel tubes the n u of larcc with steel tubes under eccentric compression was calculated by making use of related theoretical methods australian scholar vines 1982 investigated the cac structure on samoa islands in south pacific and found that cac structure had low strength and poor durability japanese scholar ootani et al 1985 also reported the cac performance of miyakojima islands after conducting a study on 3 cac buildings in pacific bikini atoll american scholar rick 1991 considered that the main factors affecting the durability of cac were salt the concrete cover thickness and the surface crack width of the structure japanese scholar tehada and funahashi 2005 malaysian scholar kakooei et al 2012a b and japanese scholar wattanachai 2013 studied the reinforcement corrosion behavior of cac by means of linear polarization resistance method lpr the results showed that reinforcement corrosion rate in cac was obviously higher than that of opc with the same mix proportion dong dong et al 2015 and kwan kwan et al 2015 studied the splitting crack development of confined concrete lateral steel zhang 1995 studied the compression behavior of carcc under different slenderness ratios whereas corrosive action on the common steel adopted had already occurred in actual mechanical performance tests without any analyses of introduced quantitative data wang wang and zha 2013 carried out a feasibility study on the application of cac in steel tube da da et al 2016a c d studied the whole cac stress strain curve and the chloride diffusion law the study showed that cac had stronger brittleness than opc and lpc with the same strength grade meanwhile the chloride diffusion of cac in marine environment had three high characteristic high c 0 high c s and d a wang wang et al 2016 studied the bond behavior between the carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp and cac it was found that the bond strength between cfrp and cac decreased significantly with the increase of the diameter of cfrp mi 2017 probed into the flexural behavior of coral aggregate reinforced concrete beams carcb with various reinforcement ratios and concrete strengths da and yu da et al 2016b e yu et al 2017 researched the durability of cac structure in south china sea islands they discovered that the complex and bad maritime environment destroyed the cac structure badly resulting in high reinforcement corrosion rates in consequence the research on the compression behavior of carcc under large eccentric compression was implemented based on the current researches on cac at home and abroad in this study the concrete type strength grade and reinforcement type were selected as parameters the compression behavior of 9 carcc and 2 oprcc was tested their crack development failure mode deformation and bearing capacity were investigated then the relationships of load displacement load axial compressive strain and load axial tensile strain were established according to the calculations for n u of carcc under large eccentric compression based on gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 the applicable model was suggested the basic data and theoretical bases were provided for the application of cac in marine engineering structures 2 experiment 2 1 raw materials coral da et al 2017 from the south china sea

the reinforcements adopted included common steel new organic coated steel developed by nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics coating thickness is 40 μm 316 stainless steel produced by jingda stainless company in taizhou city 2 2 component design based on the parameters of concrete type concrete strength and reinforcement type a total of 11 test columns with dimensions of 200 mm 240 mm 1500 mm were designed including 2 oprcc and 9 carcc the concrete strength grades were c25 c50 and c60 the reinforcement types were common steel organic new coated steel and 316 stainless steel the mix proportion of concrete is shown in table 1 please refer to table 2 for the numbers and basic parameters of each component where f cu f c and f cm is respectively the measured value of concrete cube compressive strength axial compressive strength and flexural tensile strength f y is the measured value of longitudinal reinforcements yield strength 250 mm high corbel was designed and placed in the upper and lower ends of the test columns to bear the eccentric compression in order to avoid the local compression failure in column ends and reduce n u of components densification treatment for stirrups within 250 mm of column ends was conducted the spacing between each stirrup was 100 mm within the densification area and was 200 mm outside the densification area 4 φ20 rebar steels were used for the longitudinal reinforcements of components φ8 common round steel was adopted for the stirrups the protective layer thickness was 30 mm the dimension and reinforcement of carcc is shown in fig 2 2 3 component fabrication and maintenance the carcc in tests were poured with the wood mold whose size was 200 mm 240 mm 1500 in many batches at the same time in order to ensure the thickness of the concrete cover a number of 30 mm thick mortar pads were fixed in the reinforcing cages bottom and side before the concretes were poured a layer of release agent should be coated on the surface of the mold the raw materials such as the cements corals coral sands sg fa and admixtures need to be placed in the mixer for 1 min and then for another 3 min after adding the seawater after discharging the slump was measured and the pouring and vibration should be done to shape them into concrete specimens after the specimens and component columns were completed they should be maintained properly with molds for 24 h they were covered with straws and sprinkled artificial seawater to maintain them for 240 d related mechanical properties would be tested afterwards 2 4 loading methods and test point arrangement the tests were carried out at the structural laboratory of nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics 200 t bidirectional loading test bed adopted is shown in fig 3 the test columns were placed on the test bed hinge supports were set on the upper and lower ends of the column and non deforming steel plates were placed on the bottom and top of the column to avoid local failure a ywc 50 type displacement sensor was fixed on the top of the 200 t hydraulic jack to measure the axial deformation of the column 5 ywc 50 type displacement sensors perpendicular to the column were fixed at the corresponding positions on the tensile side of the concrete for measuring the lateral deformation of the column for the purpose of measuring the reinforcement strain the midspan surface of each longitudinal reinforcement was attached with 2 steel strain gauges before the concrete was poured fig 2 in order to measure the concrete strain the middle part of the test column on its tensile side and compressive side was attached with one transverse and one longitudinal concrete strain gauge 5 concrete strain gauges were pasted on the component s midspan section along its height to measure the variation of the neutral axis along the section height please refer to fig 3 for details meanwhile the load changes were measured with a load sensor of 200 t the readings of steel strain gauges concrete strain gauges and the displacement sensor were collected by connecting the dh3818 2 static strain meter with the help of the sw lw 201 crack observer the occurrence and development of cracks could be observed and their width could be measured 3 test result and analysis 3 1 failure process when the load was small the lateral deflection of carcc did not change a lot and the strains of steel and concrete which were in the elastic working stage increased gradually with the increase in load transverse cracks appeared on the tensile side of carcc and extended to the compression zone with their widths increasing with the load in consequence the height of the compression zone decreased gradually and the total tensile stress was shared by the reinforcements with the increase in load the tensile reinforcements yielded and finally the concrete in the compression area was crushed there was a principal and wide crack in the tension zone concrete before the carcc failure occurred this was the typical failure feature of large eccentric compression component in addition similar features were found in both carcc and oprcc the failure mode is shown in fig 4 3 2 deformation analysis in fig 5 the load midspan lateral displacement curve of carcc and oprcc with different concrete types strength grades and reinforcement types are shown in fig 5 the midspan lateral displacements of carcc and oprcc shared the following common features at the initial stage of loading the midspan lateral displacement increased linearly with the load indicating the elastic deformation stage with the increase in load the midspan lateral deformation of the test columns entered the nonlinear stage the growth rates of the midspan lateral deformation were significantly greater than that of the load when failure was near the curve was basically horizontal the load was stable and the midspan lateral deformation increased rapidly resulting in the failure of columns in fig 5 a for carcc and oprcc with the same mix proportion the midspan lateral displacement of carcc are slightly larger than those of oprcc during the loading process indicating that under that mix proportion the lateral stiffness of oprcc is slightly larger than that of carcc mainly due to the larger opc elastic modulus than cac mi et al 2016 at the same time when approaching failure the midspan lateral displacement of carcc is slightly less than that of oprcc indicating worse ductility of carcc than oprcc coral aggregates have rough surfaces and played a self curing role hence the interfaces of coral aggregates and cement stones combined tightly leading to the increase in effective contact area of the interface and the bond strength between corals and cement pastes therefore under an external force the stress could be satisfactorily transferred and the distribution of strain can be adjusted in two phases by the interface of corals and cement pastes consequently the deformation of cac was basically the same as that of its components coral cement paste resulting in cac failures which usually occur in aggregates and cement pastes but rarely at the interface layer therefore cac has a higher brittleness but lower ductility than opc of the same strength grade furthermore it is shown in fig 5 a that under the same load the midspan lateral displacement of carcc decrease with the increase in concrete strength grade when approaching failure with the increase in concrete strength grade the midspan lateral displacement increases significantly this indicates that the lateral deformation capacity of carcc is gradually enhanced by the increase in concrete strength grade fig 5 b show that under the same load the midspan lateral displacement behavior of carcc with different reinforcements types are as follows cl6 cl5 cl4 that is organic new coated steel common steel 316 stainless steel the results show that the midspan lateral displacement of carcc decrease with the increase in reinforcement strength the reasons are as follows 1 the carcc n u shares the bearing capacities of the reinforcement and concrete for carcc with the same concrete strength grade with the increase in reinforcement strength n u increases gradually that is the capacity of resisting the deformation gradually increases thus the midspan lateral displacement of 316 stainless steel were the smallest in addition the concrete in the compression zone of cl4 2 was crushed prematurely in the test thus the measured n u tended to be low and the midspan lateral displacement tended to be large 2 a protective layer existed on the surface of the organic new coated steel in the loading process a greater slip was produced by the layer between the organic new coated steel and cac thus the bond force was destroyed and thereby the midspan lateral displacement of cl6 2 increased this behavior is consistent with carcc concrete and reinforcement axial compressive strain 3 the midspan lateral displacement of the common steel cl5 2 was slightly larger than that of the organic new coated steel cl6 1 mainly due to the large amount of cl in cac this resulted in serious corrosion of the common steel fig 10 and table 2 and reduction of the effective section of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement da et al 2016a d thereby reducing the n u of carcc 3 3 strain analysis 3 3 1 load axial compressive strain the load axial compressive strain curves of carcc and oprcc are shown in fig 6 it can be observed from fig 6 a that the reinforcement strain of carcc is larger than that of oprcc under the same load this trend becomes more evident as the load increased indicating that under the same load the load in the carcc reinforcements is larger than that in oprcc reinforcements this is because the cac elastic modulus is smaller than that of opc mi et al 2016 which is weaker than the reinforcement under the same load it is more probable for cac to deform because its material stiffness is smaller according to the distribution rule of the load on the structure based on the stiffness the load shared by cac in carcc is smaller than that by opc in oprcc that is the load shared by the reinforcements in carcc is more than that in oprcc in addition the ultimate compressive strain ε cu of cac is larger than that of opc because coral aggregates have a natural porous structure which has a water absorption and desorption function this acts as a micro pump that decreases the w b thereby improving the density and bonding strength of the cement paste in the interface as well as the interface mechanical bite force thus the anti cracking capacity of cac is improved furthermore in fig 6 a under the same load with the increase in concrete strength grade the concrete strain and reinforcement strain of carcc tend to decrease the reasons are as follows 1 the elastic modulus of cac increases with the increase in concrete strength da et al 2017 that is the ability to resist deformation gradually increased which is consistent with the related behavior of oprcc hu 2008 2 n u of carcc is borne by the concrete and the reinforcement when the load is constant with the increase in concrete strength grade the more load shared by the concrete the less load shared by the reinforcement thus the reinforcement strain decreases from fig 6 b we can observe the following under the same load level the behavior of concrete strain and reinforcement strain of carcc with different reinforcements types follows cl6 cl5 cl4 that is organic new coated steel common steel 316 stainless steel this is because the yield strength of 316 stainless steel f y 922 mpa is significantly higher than that of the common steel f y 530 mpa that is 316 stainless steel has the best flexural behavior hence its carcc deflection is the smallest under the same concrete strength grade together with its concrete and reinforcement strain 3 3 2 load axial tensile strain fig 7 is load axial tensile strain curve of carcc in fig 7 the following can be observed 1 with the increase in load the strain of the reinforcement increases gradually at the beginning of the loading the strain values are all small however with the occurrence of flexural cracks the strain values increase rapidly 2 the ultimate strains of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement ε su of cl2 1 cl2 2 cl3 1 cl3 2 cl5 1 cl5 2 cl6 1 and cl6 2 are respectively 2590 με 2673 με 2733 με 2809 με 3679 με 3230 με 3298 με and 2594 με according to the mechanical test results of reinforcements the strain during yielding of the longitudinal reinforcements common steel and organic new coated steel follows ε s f y e s 530 106 2 1 105 2524 με it is shown that when n u of carcc is reached the longitudinal tensile reinforcements of each test column have yielded which is the same as with the characteristics of the oprcc large eccentric compression failure 3 comparing the load axial tensile strain curves of cl2 1 cl3 1 and cl6 1 with different concrete strength grades it could be observed that when the corresponding loads of the 3 carcc longitudinal tensile reinforcements are respectively 60 kn 70 kn and 90 kn their strains begin to increase rapidly that is the higher the concrete strength grade the greater the load at which the strain of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement begins to mutate the concrete shares a part of the bearing capacity borne by the longitudinal tensile reinforcements thus the required external load increases when the longitudinal tensile reinforcements begin to work 3 4 bearing capacity analysis 3 4 1 effects of various parameters the n u of various carcc and oprcc are compared as shown in fig 8 with the same mix proportion the n u of cl2 1 and cl2 2 are close to those of cl1 1 and cl1 2 thus the carcc of c25 shares the same capacity of resisting the deformation with oprcc of c35 the main reasons n u of carcc and oprcc depend mainly on f c indicating that f c in cac of c25 is similar to that in opc of c35 which is consistent with the conclusions in mi mi et al 2016 at the same time in fig 8 it can be observed that the n u of cl2 1 cl2 2 cl3 1 cl3 2 cl6 1 and cl6 2 are 400 kn 430 kn 570 kn 580 kn 650 kn and 570 kn respectively that is when the concrete strength is increased from c25 to c50 the n u growth rate is approximately 27 8 when the concrete strength is increased from c50 to c60 the n u growth rate is approximately 12 3 thus it is demonstrated that the carcc n u and the concrete strength grade share the linear growth relationship in addition in fig 8 it can be observed that the n u values of cl4 2 cl5 1 cl5 2 cl6 1 and cl6 2 are 570 kn 720 kn 700 kn 650 kn and 570 kn respectively that is the rule of n u of carcc with various reinforcement types follows common steel organic new coated steel 316 stainless steel the main reasons are as follows 1 in the course of the tests the concrete in compression zone of cl4 2 was prematurely crushed resulting in significant reduction of n u hence n u of cl4 2 was not taken into consideration in the succeeding studies 2 the n u of common steel cl5 1 and cl5 2 were approximately 7 1 20 8 higher than those of organic new coated steel cl6 1 and cl6 2 the organic new coated steel surface was covered with an anticorrosion coating resulting in a large slip between the organic new coated steel and cac during the loading process hence the bond force was destroyed and n u decreased it was found that the protective layer of the organic new coated steel had a definite impact on n u 3 4 2 calculation and analysis of nu 3

based on gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 the n u of 9 carcc under large eccentric compression were calculated respectively the average values of n u c n u t were respectively 1 137 1 146 0 728 0 701 the standard deviations were 0 075 0 072 0 083 0 071 and the variation coefficients were 0 066 0 062 0 114 0 101 respectively among them the concrete of cl4 2 in the compression zone was prematurely crushed resulting in significant reduction of n u thus n u of cl4 2 was not taken into consideration in the succeeding studies the fitting results are shown in table 3 and fig 9 in fig 9 the n u c values based on gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 do not satisfactorily comply with n u t both n u c of carcc under large eccentric compression calculated based on gb 50010 2010 and jgj 12 2006 are larger than n u t hence the application of the methods for the design of carcc large eccentric compression component is not safe however both n u c calculated by en 1992 and aci 318 1999 are less than n u t hence those methods are conservative 3 4 2 2 model optimization in view of above results the formulas of n u under large eccentric compression in gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci318 1999 are not applicable to n u of carcc the main reasons are as follows 1 owing to the natural porous structure of corals and plenty of chloride ions in seawater and corals corrosion would easily attack the reinforcements fig 10 consequently the reinforcement sections and yield strength were reduced seriously affecting the n u of carcc under large eccentric compression however reinforcement corrosion had not been taken into account in the above formulas 2 it is observed in fig 10 that organic new coated steel could effectively inhibit the corrosion of reinforcements in cac electrochemical test result for different types reinforcement in coral aggregate concrete cac by linear polarization resistance method lpr and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method eis are shown in fig 11 among them r p is a polarization resistance kω cm2 as shown in fig 11 in the marine environment the corrosion resistance for different types reinforcement in cac followed the rule 316 stainless steel new organic coated steel common steel however the organic new coated steel was covered with a protective layer on the surface reducing the bond stress between the reinforcement and concrete during the loading process a large slip between the organic new coated steel and cac occurred please refer to fig 5 b 6 b and 7 for more information the borne force was destroyed and thus the n u was low considering structural design safety the slip should be taken into consideration during the calculation of n u of carcc with coated steels a comprehensive examination on the effects of reinforcement corrosion and slip of coated steel on n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was performed consequently a calculation model for the bearing capacity of carcc under large eccentric compression was proposed niu niu et al 2002 and yuan yuan et al 2001 found that the effects of reinforcement corrosion on n u of oprcc are as follows 1 the effective sectional area of the reinforcement is reduced owing to corrosion thus the tension borne by the reinforcement is reduced 2 the corrosion on the reinforcement surface is asymmetrical the stress would be concentrated therefore the tension borne by the reinforcement would decrease further therefore taking the reinforcement corrosion and slip of coated steel into account the calculation model of n u should be 5 n u

considering the reduction of reinforcement sections and reinforcement yield strength owing to longitudinal reinforcements corrosion ω is mass corrosion rate of longitudinal reinforcement the meanings of other parameters are the same as those in eq 2 using eq 5 the n u of 9 carcc under large eccentric compression were calculated and are shown in table 3 and fig 9 the average value of n u c n u t was 1 046 the standard deviation was 0 043 the variation coefficient was 0 041 compared to the calculation results obtained through gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 the average of n u c n u t is closer to 1 the standard deviation decreases by 42 2 39 4 47 7 and 38 9 respectively the variation coefficient decreases by 37 2 33 6 63 6 and 59 1 respectively based on the fitting accuracy rationality and practicability of each model eq 5 was found to be optimal 4 conclusions 1 the concrete strength grade c25 c60 and reinforcement type have a small effect on the failure mode of carcc and the mechanism and shape of the failure mechanism of carcc under stress are similar to those of oprcc 2 under the same mix proportion the lateral stiffness and ductility of c25 carcc are both worse than those of c35 oprcc with the increase in concrete strength grade c25 c60 and steel strength grade the midspan lateral displacement concrete strain and reinforcement strain of carcc gradually decrease indicating that its capacity of resisting deformation is gradually enhanced 3 under the same load the load shared by reinforcements in c25 carcc is much more than that shared by reinforcements in c35 oprcc with an increase in load the strain of the reinforcement increases gradually at the beginning of the loading the strain values are all small however with the occurrence of flexural cracks the strain values increase rapidly the higher the concrete strength grade c25 c60 the greater the load at which the strain of longitudinal tensile reinforcement begins to mutate 4 with the same mix proportion n u of c25 carcc is similar to that of c35 oprcc with the increase in concrete strength grade c25 c60 n u of carcc shows a linear growth trend during the loading process a large slip between cac and the organic new coated steel occurred thus n u of carcc with common steel was approximately 7 1 20 8 higher than that of carcc with organic new coated steels under the same concrete strength 5 the application of organic new coated steels 3 calcium nitrate inhibitor and concrete strength grade over c60 in the cac structure is suggested to effectively inhibit reinforcement corrosion and extend the effective service life of the structure 6 a comprehensive consideration on the effects of reinforcement corrosion and slip of the coated steel on n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was performed consequently a calculation model of n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was proposed acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial

reducing the cost limiting time increasing raw material source availability and decreasing carbon footprint coral aggregate reinforced concrete columns carcc made of corals coral sands seawater and cement can be widely applied to the construction of ports levees airports and roads to achieve practical engineering benefits dempsey 1951 arumugam and ramamurthy 1996 reinforced concrete columns are one of the most basic components in reinforced concrete structures zhang et al 2012 owing to the natural porous structure of corals and large amounts of cl in seawater and corals corrosion was easily happened to the steel in carcc da et al 2016a yu et al 2017 hence with the cross section of the reinforcement reduced and the yield strength decreased the concrete section is damaged resulting in a significant reduction in the ultimate bearing capacity n u of carcc under large eccentric compression zhao and jin 2002 xu 2003 therefore a study on the compression behavior of carcc under large eccentric compression can provide an important theoretical basis for the application of cac in marine engineering structures at present scholars at home and abroad generally focused on the study of ordinary portland reinforced concrete columns oprcc and lightweight aggregate reinforced concrete column larcc few studies could be found about cac especially about its compression performance zhou zhou et al 2008 and chen chen et al 2014 studied the larcc compression behavior and found that the failure process and mode of larcc under stress were similar to oprcc hui hui et al 2015 focused on the eccentric compression behavior of larcc with steel tubes the n u of larcc with steel tubes under eccentric compression was calculated by making use of related theoretical methods australian scholar vines 1982 investigated the cac structure on samoa islands in south pacific and found that cac structure had low strength and poor durability japanese scholar ootani et al 1985 also reported the cac performance of miyakojima islands after conducting a study on 3 cac buildings in pacific bikini atoll american scholar rick 1991 considered that the main factors affecting the durability of cac were salt the concrete cover thickness and the surface crack width of the structure japanese scholar tehada and funahashi 2005 malaysian scholar kakooei et al 2012a b and japanese scholar wattanachai 2013 studied the reinforcement corrosion behavior of cac by means of linear polarization resistance method lpr the results showed that reinforcement corrosion rate in cac was obviously higher than that of opc with the same mix proportion dong dong et al 2015 and kwan kwan et al 2015 studied the splitting crack development of confined concrete lateral steel zhang 1995 studied the compression behavior of carcc under different slenderness ratios whereas corrosive action on the common steel adopted had already occurred in actual mechanical performance tests without any analyses of introduced quantitative data wang wang and zha 2013 carried out a feasibility study on the application of cac in steel tube da da et al 2016a c d studied the whole cac stress strain curve and the chloride diffusion law the study showed that cac had stronger brittleness than opc and lpc with the same strength grade meanwhile the chloride diffusion of cac in marine environment had three high characteristic high c 0 high c s and d a wang wang et al 2016 studied the bond behavior between the carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp and cac it was found that the bond strength between cfrp and cac decreased significantly with the increase of the diameter of cfrp mi 2017 probed into the flexural behavior of coral aggregate reinforced concrete beams carcb with various reinforcement ratios and concrete strengths da and yu da et al 2016b e yu et al 2017 researched the durability of cac structure in south china sea islands they discovered that the complex and bad maritime environment destroyed the cac structure badly resulting in high reinforcement corrosion rates in consequence the research on the compression behavior of carcc under large eccentric compression was implemented based on the current researches on cac at home and abroad in this study the concrete type strength grade and reinforcement type were selected as parameters the compression behavior of 9 carcc and 2 oprcc was tested their crack development failure mode deformation and bearing capacity were investigated then the relationships of load displacement load axial compressive strain and load axial tensile strain were established according to the calculations for n u of carcc under large eccentric compression based on gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 the applicable model was suggested the basic data and theoretical bases were provided for the application of cac in marine engineering structures 2 experiment 2 1 raw materials coral da et al 2017 from the south china sea

the reinforcements adopted included common steel new organic coated steel developed by nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics coating thickness is 40 μm 316 stainless steel produced by jingda stainless company in taizhou city 2 2 component design based on the parameters of concrete type concrete strength and reinforcement type a total of 11 test columns with dimensions of 200 mm 240 mm 1500 mm were designed including 2 oprcc and 9 carcc the concrete strength grades were c25 c50 and c60 the reinforcement types were common steel organic new coated steel and 316 stainless steel the mix proportion of concrete is shown in table 1 please refer to table 2 for the numbers and basic parameters of each component where f cu f c and f cm is respectively the measured value of concrete cube compressive strength axial compressive strength and flexural tensile strength f y is the measured value of longitudinal reinforcements yield strength 250 mm high corbel was designed and placed in the upper and lower ends of the test columns to bear the eccentric compression in order to avoid the local compression failure in column ends and reduce n u of components densification treatment for stirrups within 250 mm of column ends was conducted the spacing between each stirrup was 100 mm within the densification area and was 200 mm outside the densification area 4 φ20 rebar steels were used for the longitudinal reinforcements of components φ8 common round steel was adopted for the stirrups the protective layer thickness was 30 mm the dimension and reinforcement of carcc is shown in fig 2 2 3 component fabrication and maintenance the carcc in tests were poured with the wood mold whose size was 200 mm 240 mm 1500 in many batches at the same time in order to ensure the thickness of the concrete cover a number of 30 mm thick mortar pads were fixed in the reinforcing cages bottom and side before the concretes were poured a layer of release agent should be coated on the surface of the mold the raw materials such as the cements corals coral sands sg fa and admixtures need to be placed in the mixer for 1 min and then for another 3 min after adding the seawater after discharging the slump was measured and the pouring and vibration should be done to shape them into concrete specimens after the specimens and component columns were completed they should be maintained properly with molds for 24 h they were covered with straws and sprinkled artificial seawater to maintain them for 240 d related mechanical properties would be tested afterwards 2 4 loading methods and test point arrangement the tests were carried out at the structural laboratory of nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics 200 t bidirectional loading test bed adopted is shown in fig 3 the test columns were placed on the test bed hinge supports were set on the upper and lower ends of the column and non deforming steel plates were placed on the bottom and top of the column to avoid local failure a ywc 50 type displacement sensor was fixed on the top of the 200 t hydraulic jack to measure the axial deformation of the column 5 ywc 50 type displacement sensors perpendicular to the column were fixed at the corresponding positions on the tensile side of the concrete for measuring the lateral deformation of the column for the purpose of measuring the reinforcement strain the midspan surface of each longitudinal reinforcement was attached with 2 steel strain gauges before the concrete was poured fig 2 in order to measure the concrete strain the middle part of the test column on its tensile side and compressive side was attached with one transverse and one longitudinal concrete strain gauge 5 concrete strain gauges were pasted on the component s midspan section along its height to measure the variation of the neutral axis along the section height please refer to fig 3 for details meanwhile the load changes were measured with a load sensor of 200 t the readings of steel strain gauges concrete strain gauges and the displacement sensor were collected by connecting the dh3818 2 static strain meter with the help of the sw lw 201 crack observer the occurrence and development of cracks could be observed and their width could be measured 3 test result and analysis 3 1 failure process when the load was small the lateral deflection of carcc did not change a lot and the strains of steel and concrete which were in the elastic working stage increased gradually with the increase in load transverse cracks appeared on the tensile side of carcc and extended to the compression zone with their widths increasing with the load in consequence the height of the compression zone decreased gradually and the total tensile stress was shared by the reinforcements with the increase in load the tensile reinforcements yielded and finally the concrete in the compression area was crushed there was a principal and wide crack in the tension zone concrete before the carcc failure occurred this was the typical failure feature of large eccentric compression component in addition similar features were found in both carcc and oprcc the failure mode is shown in fig 4 3 2 deformation analysis in fig 5 the load midspan lateral displacement curve of carcc and oprcc with different concrete types strength grades and reinforcement types are shown in fig 5 the midspan lateral displacements of carcc and oprcc shared the following common features at the initial stage of loading the midspan lateral displacement increased linearly with the load indicating the elastic deformation stage with the increase in load the midspan lateral deformation of the test columns entered the nonlinear stage the growth rates of the midspan lateral deformation were significantly greater than that of the load when failure was near the curve was basically horizontal the load was stable and the midspan lateral deformation increased rapidly resulting in the failure of columns in fig 5 a for carcc and oprcc with the same mix proportion the midspan lateral displacement of carcc are slightly larger than those of oprcc during the loading process indicating that under that mix proportion the lateral stiffness of oprcc is slightly larger than that of carcc mainly due to the larger opc elastic modulus than cac mi et al 2016 at the same time when approaching failure the midspan lateral displacement of carcc is slightly less than that of oprcc indicating worse ductility of carcc than oprcc coral aggregates have rough surfaces and played a self curing role hence the interfaces of coral aggregates and cement stones combined tightly leading to the increase in effective contact area of the interface and the bond strength between corals and cement pastes therefore under an external force the stress could be satisfactorily transferred and the distribution of strain can be adjusted in two phases by the interface of corals and cement pastes consequently the deformation of cac was basically the same as that of its components coral cement paste resulting in cac failures which usually occur in aggregates and cement pastes but rarely at the interface layer therefore cac has a higher brittleness but lower ductility than opc of the same strength grade furthermore it is shown in fig 5 a that under the same load the midspan lateral displacement of carcc decrease with the increase in concrete strength grade when approaching failure with the increase in concrete strength grade the midspan lateral displacement increases significantly this indicates that the lateral deformation capacity of carcc is gradually enhanced by the increase in concrete strength grade fig 5 b show that under the same load the midspan lateral displacement behavior of carcc with different reinforcements types are as follows cl6 cl5 cl4 that is organic new coated steel common steel 316 stainless steel the results show that the midspan lateral displacement of carcc decrease with the increase in reinforcement strength the reasons are as follows 1 the carcc n u shares the bearing capacities of the reinforcement and concrete for carcc with the same concrete strength grade with the increase in reinforcement strength n u increases gradually that is the capacity of resisting the deformation gradually increases thus the midspan lateral displacement of 316 stainless steel were the smallest in addition the concrete in the compression zone of cl4 2 was crushed prematurely in the test thus the measured n u tended to be low and the midspan lateral displacement tended to be large 2 a protective layer existed on the surface of the organic new coated steel in the loading process a greater slip was produced by the layer between the organic new coated steel and cac thus the bond force was destroyed and thereby the midspan lateral displacement of cl6 2 increased this behavior is consistent with carcc concrete and reinforcement axial compressive strain 3 the midspan lateral displacement of the common steel cl5 2 was slightly larger than that of the organic new coated steel cl6 1 mainly due to the large amount of cl in cac this resulted in serious corrosion of the common steel fig 10 and table 2 and reduction of the effective section of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement da et al 2016a d thereby reducing the n u of carcc 3 3 strain analysis 3 3 1 load axial compressive strain the load axial compressive strain curves of carcc and oprcc are shown in fig 6 it can be observed from fig 6 a that the reinforcement strain of carcc is larger than that of oprcc under the same load this trend becomes more evident as the load increased indicating that under the same load the load in the carcc reinforcements is larger than that in oprcc reinforcements this is because the cac elastic modulus is smaller than that of opc mi et al 2016 which is weaker than the reinforcement under the same load it is more probable for cac to deform because its material stiffness is smaller according to the distribution rule of the load on the structure based on the stiffness the load shared by cac in carcc is smaller than that by opc in oprcc that is the load shared by the reinforcements in carcc is more than that in oprcc in addition the ultimate compressive strain ε cu of cac is larger than that of opc because coral aggregates have a natural porous structure which has a water absorption and desorption function this acts as a micro pump that decreases the w b thereby improving the density and bonding strength of the cement paste in the interface as well as the interface mechanical bite force thus the anti cracking capacity of cac is improved furthermore in fig 6 a under the same load with the increase in concrete strength grade the concrete strain and reinforcement strain of carcc tend to decrease the reasons are as follows 1 the elastic modulus of cac increases with the increase in concrete strength da et al 2017 that is the ability to resist deformation gradually increased which is consistent with the related behavior of oprcc hu 2008 2 n u of carcc is borne by the concrete and the reinforcement when the load is constant with the increase in concrete strength grade the more load shared by the concrete the less load shared by the reinforcement thus the reinforcement strain decreases from fig 6 b we can observe the following under the same load level the behavior of concrete strain and reinforcement strain of carcc with different reinforcements types follows cl6 cl5 cl4 that is organic new coated steel common steel 316 stainless steel this is because the yield strength of 316 stainless steel f y 922 mpa is significantly higher than that of the common steel f y 530 mpa that is 316 stainless steel has the best flexural behavior hence its carcc deflection is the smallest under the same concrete strength grade together with its concrete and reinforcement strain 3 3 2 load axial tensile strain fig 7 is load axial tensile strain curve of carcc in fig 7 the following can be observed 1 with the increase in load the strain of the reinforcement increases gradually at the beginning of the loading the strain values are all small however with the occurrence of flexural cracks the strain values increase rapidly 2 the ultimate strains of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement ε su of cl2 1 cl2 2 cl3 1 cl3 2 cl5 1 cl5 2 cl6 1 and cl6 2 are respectively 2590 με 2673 με 2733 με 2809 με 3679 με 3230 με 3298 με and 2594 με according to the mechanical test results of reinforcements the strain during yielding of the longitudinal reinforcements common steel and organic new coated steel follows ε s f y e s 530 106 2 1 105 2524 με it is shown that when n u of carcc is reached the longitudinal tensile reinforcements of each test column have yielded which is the same as with the characteristics of the oprcc large eccentric compression failure 3 comparing the load axial tensile strain curves of cl2 1 cl3 1 and cl6 1 with different concrete strength grades it could be observed that when the corresponding loads of the 3 carcc longitudinal tensile reinforcements are respectively 60 kn 70 kn and 90 kn their strains begin to increase rapidly that is the higher the concrete strength grade the greater the load at which the strain of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement begins to mutate the concrete shares a part of the bearing capacity borne by the longitudinal tensile reinforcements thus the required external load increases when the longitudinal tensile reinforcements begin to work 3 4 bearing capacity analysis 3 4 1 effects of various parameters the n u of various carcc and oprcc are compared as shown in fig 8 with the same mix proportion the n u of cl2 1 and cl2 2 are close to those of cl1 1 and cl1 2 thus the carcc of c25 shares the same capacity of resisting the deformation with oprcc of c35 the main reasons n u of carcc and oprcc depend mainly on f c indicating that f c in cac of c25 is similar to that in opc of c35 which is consistent with the conclusions in mi mi et al 2016 at the same time in fig 8 it can be observed that the n u of cl2 1 cl2 2 cl3 1 cl3 2 cl6 1 and cl6 2 are 400 kn 430 kn 570 kn 580 kn 650 kn and 570 kn respectively that is when the concrete strength is increased from c25 to c50 the n u growth rate is approximately 27 8 when the concrete strength is increased from c50 to c60 the n u growth rate is approximately 12 3 thus it is demonstrated that the carcc n u and the concrete strength grade share the linear growth relationship in addition in fig 8 it can be observed that the n u values of cl4 2 cl5 1 cl5 2 cl6 1 and cl6 2 are 570 kn 720 kn 700 kn 650 kn and 570 kn respectively that is the rule of n u of carcc with various reinforcement types follows common steel organic new coated steel 316 stainless steel the main reasons are as follows 1 in the course of the tests the concrete in compression zone of cl4 2 was prematurely crushed resulting in significant reduction of n u hence n u of cl4 2 was not taken into consideration in the succeeding studies 2 the n u of common steel cl5 1 and cl5 2 were approximately 7 1 20 8 higher than those of organic new coated steel cl6 1 and cl6 2 the organic new coated steel surface was covered with an anticorrosion coating resulting in a large slip between the organic new coated steel and cac during the loading process hence the bond force was destroyed and n u decreased it was found that the protective layer of the organic new coated steel had a definite impact on n u 3 4 2 calculation and analysis of nu 3

based on gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 the n u of 9 carcc under large eccentric compression were calculated respectively the average values of n u c n u t were respectively 1 137 1 146 0 728 0 701 the standard deviations were 0 075 0 072 0 083 0 071 and the variation coefficients were 0 066 0 062 0 114 0 101 respectively among them the concrete of cl4 2 in the compression zone was prematurely crushed resulting in significant reduction of n u thus n u of cl4 2 was not taken into consideration in the succeeding studies the fitting results are shown in table 3 and fig 9 in fig 9 the n u c values based on gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 do not satisfactorily comply with n u t both n u c of carcc under large eccentric compression calculated based on gb 50010 2010 and jgj 12 2006 are larger than n u t hence the application of the methods for the design of carcc large eccentric compression component is not safe however both n u c calculated by en 1992 and aci 318 1999 are less than n u t hence those methods are conservative 3 4 2 2 model optimization in view of above results the formulas of n u under large eccentric compression in gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci318 1999 are not applicable to n u of carcc the main reasons are as follows 1 owing to the natural porous structure of corals and plenty of chloride ions in seawater and corals corrosion would easily attack the reinforcements fig 10 consequently the reinforcement sections and yield strength were reduced seriously affecting the n u of carcc under large eccentric compression however reinforcement corrosion had not been taken into account in the above formulas 2 it is observed in fig 10 that organic new coated steel could effectively inhibit the corrosion of reinforcements in cac electrochemical test result for different types reinforcement in coral aggregate concrete cac by linear polarization resistance method lpr and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method eis are shown in fig 11 among them r p is a polarization resistance kω cm2 as shown in fig 11 in the marine environment the corrosion resistance for different types reinforcement in cac followed the rule 316 stainless steel new organic coated steel common steel however the organic new coated steel was covered with a protective layer on the surface reducing the bond stress between the reinforcement and concrete during the loading process a large slip between the organic new coated steel and cac occurred please refer to fig 5 b 6 b and 7 for more information the borne force was destroyed and thus the n u was low considering structural design safety the slip should be taken into consideration during the calculation of n u of carcc with coated steels a comprehensive examination on the effects of reinforcement corrosion and slip of coated steel on n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was performed consequently a calculation model for the bearing capacity of carcc under large eccentric compression was proposed niu niu et al 2002 and yuan yuan et al 2001 found that the effects of reinforcement corrosion on n u of oprcc are as follows 1 the effective sectional area of the reinforcement is reduced owing to corrosion thus the tension borne by the reinforcement is reduced 2 the corrosion on the reinforcement surface is asymmetrical the stress would be concentrated therefore the tension borne by the reinforcement would decrease further therefore taking the reinforcement corrosion and slip of coated steel into account the calculation model of n u should be 5 n u

considering the reduction of reinforcement sections and reinforcement yield strength owing to longitudinal reinforcements corrosion ω is mass corrosion rate of longitudinal reinforcement the meanings of other parameters are the same as those in eq 2 using eq 5 the n u of 9 carcc under large eccentric compression were calculated and are shown in table 3 and fig 9 the average value of n u c n u t was 1 046 the standard deviation was 0 043 the variation coefficient was 0 041 compared to the calculation results obtained through gb 50010 2010 jgj 12 2006 en 1992 and aci 318 1999 the average of n u c n u t is closer to 1 the standard deviation decreases by 42 2 39 4 47 7 and 38 9 respectively the variation coefficient decreases by 37 2 33 6 63 6 and 59 1 respectively based on the fitting accuracy rationality and practicability of each model eq 5 was found to be optimal 4 conclusions 1 the concrete strength grade c25 c60 and reinforcement type have a small effect on the failure mode of carcc and the mechanism and shape of the failure mechanism of carcc under stress are similar to those of oprcc 2 under the same mix proportion the lateral stiffness and ductility of c25 carcc are both worse than those of c35 oprcc with the increase in concrete strength grade c25 c60 and steel strength grade the midspan lateral displacement concrete strain and reinforcement strain of carcc gradually decrease indicating that its capacity of resisting deformation is gradually enhanced 3 under the same load the load shared by reinforcements in c25 carcc is much more than that shared by reinforcements in c35 oprcc with an increase in load the strain of the reinforcement increases gradually at the beginning of the loading the strain values are all small however with the occurrence of flexural cracks the strain values increase rapidly the higher the concrete strength grade c25 c60 the greater the load at which the strain of longitudinal tensile reinforcement begins to mutate 4 with the same mix proportion n u of c25 carcc is similar to that of c35 oprcc with the increase in concrete strength grade c25 c60 n u of carcc shows a linear growth trend during the loading process a large slip between cac and the organic new coated steel occurred thus n u of carcc with common steel was approximately 7 1 20 8 higher than that of carcc with organic new coated steels under the same concrete strength 5 the application of organic new coated steels 3 calcium nitrate inhibitor and concrete strength grade over c60 in the cac structure is suggested to effectively inhibit reinforcement corrosion and extend the effective service life of the structure 6 a comprehensive consideration on the effects of reinforcement corrosion and slip of the coated steel on n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was performed consequently a calculation model of n u of carcc under large eccentric compression was proposed acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial

current turbines are basically underwater windmills the tidal currents are used to drive an underwater turbine developers have shifted toward technologies that capture the tidally driven coastal currents or tidal stream smaller units that can be deployed individually or in multiple units characterize tidal current stream technologies currently the dominance of offshore wind does not mean wave and tidal energy are not important with time and sufficient financial supports sizeable wave and tidal farms could be in place by the next decade taiwan is an island and 98 energy are imported overview of the flow field near taiwan is shown in fig 1 and a branch of north pacific gyre kuroshio passes through the east coast of taiwan the range of kuroshio is around 170 km wide and 700 m deep with an average speed up to 1 25 m s hsueh 2000 and it is equivalent to 120 gw h if 1 of the kuroshio power is taken that is 1 2 gw while chen 2010 suggested a 30 gw power plant and it can nearly replaces all the power plants needed in taiwan the kuroshio power is therefore a good opportunity to become a major resource of future power generation in taiwan part of the kuroshio travels along the west coast through a strip between penghu and taiwan in globe development many nearly matured and successfully deployments were reported in europe as early as 2003 the 300 kw prototype seaflow installed in the bristol channel to further study the tidal energy technology including related engineering management system and environmental impacts the seagen tidal turbine was installed in strangford narrow strangford lough northern ireland by marine current turbines ltd mct in 2008 that is a 1 2 mw production version with twin 16 m diameter axial flow rotors douglas et al 2008 seagen continued operating until the last quarter of 2015 however seagen is decommissioned and served its r d purpose especially for environment impact study marinespace ltd 2016 also in uk cardiff based tidal energy developer tidal energy ltd deployed its 400 kw deltastream into ramsey sound off wales in 2015 each unit can carry up to three turbines scotrenewables deployed the sr2000 floating tidal

second turbine of edf s paimpol brehat tidal array was deployed on may 29 2017 by openhydro a dcns company the 16 m turbine were operated at a depth of 40 m below sea surface in france sabella french tidal energy developer installed d10 tidal energy turbine with a rotor diameter of 16 m in the fromveur passage off the french island of ushant it has been working very well for years its rated capacity is up to 1 mw in summary in the past ten years over 1500 mw of projected capacity in europe was reported in a wide number of tidal energy projects sheng 2013 in america about the same order as kuroshio the estimated potential of the technically feasible power production was estimated at 19 gw in us waters the southeast national marine renewable energy center snmrec at florida atlantic university hosted a summer research program on harvesting power from ocean currents and the average energy density can reach 3 3 kw m2 off florida s east coast in asia on jan 18 2016 a 3 4 mw tidal power generator developed by china has been installed off zhoushan island eastern part of the country the modular generator is 70 m long and 30 m wide in japan kairyu the demonstration system is a 100 kw floating device that was deployed mid august 2017 for trials that aim to verify power generation and control system of the device it was installed at the water depth of 100 m at a site located 5 km off the coast of kuchinoshima island all the above reported can be found in https tidalenergytoday com more identified tidal energy developers can be found in ocean energy development in europe current status and future perspectives magagna and uihlein 2015 in taiwan as mentioned before the stability of kuroshio can be taken advantage of to generate power that s why more and more water turbine development is underway around the island trying to harness energy from the ocean albeit furnished with natural resources like this local turbine development didn t begin until recently in fact most of the turbines are small sized and are applied to dams or reservoirs by use of turgo or pelton type to cash in on the energy potentially stored in the water channel similar to these aforementioned cases in some countries which utilize the irrigation channels for farming taiwan also develops micro scale water turbines for agricultural irrigation several local research institutes has published related works on generating power through water turbine these years for example in 2008 an experiment was conducted in yunlin county wang et al 2013 and the result showed that a 0 3 m radius turbine can produce 570 w at the flow velocity of 2 m s in ocean field test tsai et al 2010 2012 kehr et al 2013 and chen et al 2015 also performed different scaled development and testing of the submerged tidal current power generators but those deployments or field tests were lasting only for one day however from what is delineated above the acquisition of ocean energy by water turbines have been laid emphasis more and more undertakings of water turbine development regarding similar power generating projects are proposed therefore as a footstep to follow our research is an integrated work encompassing fields ranging from current speed investigation mooring blade design duct and platform design blade manufacturing to power generating a study on harvesting ocean wave and marine current power was made in an integrated project with six subprojects that are headed by researchers from marine mechanical and electrical engineering the cross disciplinary project in the combination of cross field research of mechanical engineering electrical engineering ocean engineering and underwater technology is set up to design and establish a tidal current energy capture system nsysu i at penghu and the system can be viewed from google map see fig 2 viewed in 2016 the nsysu i system was deployed in august 2013 and the power take off pto was successfully monitored up to 5 kw h the nsysu i system is a partially submerged floating system with a horizontal axis turbine attached to a magnetic generator the deployment of nsysu i is the first onsite ocean deployment in taiwan our present study is a multi disciplinary integrated project that is during the development and implementation period different facets of technology have been involved but in present study we will attach the significance to oceanography mooring and anchoring turbine blade design manufacture semi submersible platform design magnetic generator and environment impact assessment etc section 2 gives a brief description of all the subprojects of the study includes subproject 1 site ocean environment investigation and primary jobs include survey of tidal elevation current speed ocean bathymetry the instruments used included adcp and multi beam side scanner etc subproject 2 mooring and anchoring system primary jobs are mooring lines and anchor system designed and the deployment implementation subproject 3 turbine blade design and manufacture the primary jobs included cfd simulation of turbine blade and the expected power take off pto the stress analysis design and manufacture of the blades and mechanical seal of the nacelle which encloses the gear box and magnetic generator subproject 4 the semi submersible nozzle diffusor duct platform the primary jobs include the cfd simulation of the platform under current and storm wave action the typhoon waves are also considered in the simulation a nozzle and diffusor duct were added to accelerate tidal flow passing through the turbine blades subproject 5 the design of permanent magnetic generator the primary jobs include simulation of a 3kw 5 kw high efficiency permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg which was then manufactured by a local industry subproject 6 the environment impact assessment and this subproject focuses on the social impacts when developing renewable energy to decrease the social cost of local protests raises the local awareness of the environment and renewable energy and further develops a long term cooperation strategy between local and sustainable energy the field deployment and monitoring results are discussed in section 3 and the final concluding remarks is given in section 4 2 subprojects in the following sections we will give a brief description of each subprojects 2 1 project one tidal current and bathymetry survey this project surveys the tidal current in the cross sea bridge at penghu the results are combined with geological and morphological surveys to offer the best reference for the site selection of the tidal energy capture system the data collection is based upon the in situ data measurement and numerical simulations the bottom mounted acdp rd instrument or acoustical tomography were deployed in the selected sites which incorporates with dgps differential global positioning system corrected to precision within 1 m fig 3 shows two selected locations adcp n1 and adcp n2 for in situ measurement and the measured data are used as a reference to conduct numerical simulations the detailed coordinates of the locations are twd97 coordinate is n23 38 54 66 e119 32 55 14 water depth is 13 2 m and 23 38 54 44 e119 32 56 58 water depth is 15 4 m since the center of turbine axis is at 4 m below the sea surface and the flow velocities at that depth are analyzed the measured data listed in figs 4 and 5 shows the flow direction is primarily in es wn direction and the velocity is 2 3 knots in es direction and 1 knot in wn direction the flow velocity measured at adcp n1 is more stable and is larger than that measured at adcp n2 besides the location of adcp n1 is more far away from the regular voyage route of the fish boats and was then selected as the final field deployed site the measured data illustrated in fig 6 also shows the tide is a semidiurnal tide and the tidal range is about 3 m and the flow direction was changed before the end of high water or low water because of the special local bathymetry conditions besides the flow velocities in winter are much larger than those in other seasons and the total time duration of velocity larger than 2 knots is about 111 5 h in the measured time periods totally 18 days 2 2 subproject two the mooring and anchoring system in the second sub project the mooring line and anchoring system were analyzed designed and manufactured the proposed floating capture system was designed by the fourth subproject and the drag forces were calculated the calculated drag force is 180 kn and the factor of safety 1 2 was used in order to maintain the stability of the platform during semi diurnal tidal current the mooring lines are arranged as shown in fig 7 and the north west and south east directions are respectively directed to cross sea bridge and margong harbor and they are also in the directions of tidal current 2 2 1 mooring lines analysis the definition sketch of the single point mooring spm system is shown as fig 8 in which point b is the floating duct and a is the anchor block h is the water depth and θa is the maximum allowable angle the catenary theory considers only the total weight of the chain in the water and neglect the possible horizontal forces acting on the cable the only horizontal force acting on the chain is due to drag force as the tidal current and waves acting on the duct considering an arbitrary section oc o is the lowest point of the cable whose tangent line is horizontal line and c is an arbitrary point of the cable t is tension t h and t v are respectively the horizontal and vertical components of the tension the length of oc section is s and the unit chain weight in water is p and we may get t o t h and t v p s adopting catenary theory of berteaux 1976 we have 1 y t o p cosh p x t o 1 2 x t o p sinh 1 p s t o 3 s t o p sinh p x t o 4 t o t h t v p s t t h 2 t v 2 the calculation starts from choosing a θ a and we may get t a and its vertical component t a v then for a given p the chain length oa s a can be determined by eqn 3 the coordinates x a and y a can be calculated by eqns 3 and 1 and finally get y b by h y b y a and get x b by eqn 1 the s a and s b can be determined and the chain length is the difference of lengths s a and s b the corresponding tensions at each point can be calculated by eqn 4 the maximum cable tension 180 kn is given by the subproject 4 and the chain material selection can be determined according to iacs 2007 and we select chain diameter 24 mm and grade gl k3 with proof load 332 kn and breaking load 476 kn 2 2 2 gravity concrete block anchor the gravity concrete block was used as the anchoring systems the possible forces acting on the gravity block are the buoyance force and the net weight of block sitting at the sea bottom is w and can be calculated as 5 w w s f f f v n where w s is the weight of block in air f f is the buoyance force and f v is vertical component force of mooring line n is the reaction force of sea bottom on the block the friction force and required weight of the concrete block therefore can be calculated by 6 f μ n μ w s f f f v f f h 216 k n w s f μ f f f v 216 k n 0 5 v γ c o n c 61 6 k n where μ v γ conc and f h are respectively the friction coefficient volume of concrete block specific weight of concrete block and net horizontal force acting on platform fig 9 shows the construction of the concrete gravity block including the reinforcement set up stainless steel hanger installation templates set up and concrete poring etc the field deployment of the concrete blocks is illustrated in fig 10 the sonar image was also made to confirm the concrete block being deployed to the expected locations 2 3 subproject three horizontal turbine design the ansys fluent was used to model the tidal current passing horizontal turbine and the mechanical stress calculation was made to determine the turbine blade geometry the power take off of turbine versus rotation speed of turbine is calculated and the optimal pto can be determined fig 11 shows the detailed measured tidal current speeds at a level 4 m below the sea surface the current speed can reach 1 5 m s during high tide and it becomes less than 0 5 m s during low tide the artificial simulated tidal velocity is listed in fig 12 and the simulated pto of the proposed turbine is shown in fig 13 and the maximum pto is over 1000 w and the pto of low tide is negligible small in addition to cfd simulation the experimental tests of the 1 m turbine blade attached with generator were made at tainan hydraulic laboratory thl of ncku fig 14 shows the setup of the turbine gearbox generator system tggs the lab model test wish to clarify following major goals 1 the minimum current speed to start up turbine rotation when the generator is with or without sur charge 2 measure the relationship among turbine rotation speed current speed and torque built by turbine blades 3 the final goal is measuring pto the turbine gearbox generator system is launched on a movable platform train as the control motor increases the moving speed of the train the turbine was experienced with increasing current speed the turbine starts to rotate when the current speed increases to 1 1 m s and the recorded maximum rotation speed is upto 200 rpm and the output torque is 40 n m when the current speed is 1 3 m s however the stress developed in turbine blade was beyond the strength of the material of the blade and they were failure before we started to measure the power output of the generator fig 15 shows the turbine started rotating when the current speed is larger than 1 1 m s and the turbine blades were failure at which the current speed was over 1 3 m s blade element momentum bem theory is usually adopted to design the ideal turbine blade where highest cl cd i e lift and drag ratio of a blade can be determined along the blade radial direction and thus the greatest efficiency can be obtained hartwanger and horvat 2008 the blade failure remind us the blade yield strength will be sacrificed unknowingly by such a design principle at the same time as a result we then modified the old blade shape naca6409 and increase blade thickness and also changed the material used to build the new blades naca63621 fig 16 depicts the principal stress built in the blades and the maximum principal stress developed in the new blade is one order smaller than that of the original blade the material made of the blade was changed from aluminum alloy 270 mpa to nickel aluminum bronze alloy 690 mpa since the start up current speed for turbine rotation is 1 1 m s when the generator is without surcharge and that might be larger when the generator is with surcharge the measured maximum tidal current speed at penghu is 1 5 m s and the average speed is 1 25 m s only to assure the rotation of turbine the data obtained in the lab test at ncku suggested us a duct platform with nozzle and diffusor is necessary and the subproject four is in charge of this mission 2 4 subproject four semi submerged floating platform the objective of this sub project is to develop a semi submerged and floating energy capture system which is suitable for medium to deep water depths this subproject study the floating platform which carry water turbine gear box magnetic generator and monitoring equipment according to the lab experiment the nozzle and diffusor duct is recommended to enhance the tidal current velocity passing through the turbine blades because of the budget limit and the manufacture of a rectangular diffusor shape is much cheaper than a circular diffusor and the rectangular shape is therefore chosen to enhance the flow speed passing through the water turbine the cfd simulation was made to determine the optimal geometry of the nozzle and diffusor the commercial cfd code ansys fluent was used to simulate the drag and lift forces developed as the tidal current passing through the platform 2 4 1 numerical method this research is conducted by the use of a commercial code fluent 6 3 which is a computational fluid dynamics code the flow is assumed to be incompressible with constant density and molecular viscosity the navier stokes equation along with the continuity equation were solved to acquire the velocity and pressure fields the continuity equation is u x u w z 0 and the navier stokes equations of a 3d incompressible flow can be written as 7 u t u u x v u y w u z 1 ρ p x υ 2 u 8 v t u v x v v y w v z g 1 ρ p y υ 2 v 9 w t u w x v w y w w z 1 ρ p z υ 2 w where t is the time and u v and w are respectively the velocity components in the x y and z directions p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and v is the kinematic viscous coefficient the stagger grid was also used the discretization techniques used were quadratic upwind interpolation of convective kinematics quick method and piso algorithm was used as iteration techniques to solve for flow velocity as well as pressure fields when it comes to the turbulent model some previous works use k ε and obtain reliable results hartwanger and horvat 2008 wu et al 2012 therefore we also follow suit to adopt turbulent model k ε to compute for better accuracy in terms of the preprocessor to construct modelling structure the autocad and solidwork codes were used to construct the geometry of the computational domain and to store the results in sat or iges files and then use the gambit code to establish computational meshes the post processing of the output was done by matlab to provide plots and figures of this paper the detailed numerical iteration procedures can be found in wu et al 2012 and they are omitted in the text to enhance the flow velocity in the duct the nozzle is set at the front part of the duct and we simulated the efficiency of pto of five different open angles of nozzle see fig 17 the simulated results suggest the opening angle between 25 and 30 will have the better pto however the enhanced velocity obtained by the aid of nozzle just increases the velocity passing the center of the duct to 1 4 m s only we therefore added a curved diffusor at the back edge of the duct to manipulate the flow and create a low pressure zone and flow speed might be further increased fig 18 compares the velocity increase with and without curved manipulated channel and the mainstream velocity can increase to 1 9 m s and curved diffusor channels does significantly increase the pto the final proposed platform is depicted in fig 19 2 5 subproject five design and implementation of a low speed permanent magnet synchronous generator for applying to a mct system in this subproject a 3kw 5 kw high efficiency pmsg machine with small cogging torque has been implemented rigorously as the generator of a marine current turbine mct system to harvest ocean current power furthermore the proposed pmsg based mct system has been developed to investigate its feasibility of ocean current generation system at ocean surrounding of taiwan in addition the mct system has been tested really in the ocean surrounding penghu county of taiwan during the 2013 07 09 11 the experimental results have shown that proposed pmsg machine not only can satisfy the performance requirements but also the pmsg based mct system can harvest effectively the ocean current energy due to the ocean current environment complexity and the walrus are difficult to forecast and grasp so that an effective mct generation system should be implemented based on efficiency toughness and durability and has easy maintenance features ng et al 2013 and peng et al 2013 fig 20 shows a complete mct generation system that contains two subsystems one the mct subsystem the other is the power energy conversion subsystem benelghali et al 2012 numerous types of generators have been implemented for applying to mct systems for harvesting effectively the ocean energy according to many research reports benelghali et al 2012 the permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg uses the permanent magnets pms to replace the electromagnetic field has the advantages of performances such as high efficiency high power density robustness reliability and it is able to adapt to harsh environments therefore this subproject intends to develop a high efficiency pmsg machine as the generator of a mct system in this subproject a 3kw 5 kw pmsg based mct system will be implemented to harvest the ocean current energy to verify its feasibility for applying to ocean surrounding taiwan the operation specifications of the proposed mct system will be described as follows one horizontal axis water turbine with 40 120 rpm will be speed up 480 1440 rpm by a growth machine up gearbox then the growth machine will be combined with proposed pmsg machine to become a pmsg based mct system as shown in fig 21 a at different speeds v the output power p e curves of a pmsg are showed in fig 21 b the performance parameters of proposed pmsg machine are as table 1 2 6 design and analysis of proposed pmsg machine 2 6 1 geometric structure of pmsg machine due to the limit of mct space in this subproject a 16 pole 24 slot radial flux pmsg machine has been designed and implemented as the generator of proposed mct system that showed in fig 22 the geometric parameters of proposed pmsg machine are listed in table 2 2 6 2 fem analysis the finite element method fem has been used to evaluate the performance parameters of proposed pmsg machine islam et al 2004 the results contain both magnetic flux distribution and flux density are showed in fig 23 through 3d fea analysis we can realize the distribution of the linkage flux and the leakage flux in rotor and stator respectively we can find that the maximum flux density bmax is 1 82 t that shows the saturation degree in iron core is low 2 6 3 d q axes inductances due to the d q axes inductances will be affected by generator structure hence the torque and output power of proposed pmsg will be also changed fig 24 shows the difference of d g axes inductances at different speed because the difference of ld and lq is not obvious hence the electromagnetic torque tm is greater than the reluctance torque tr 2 6 4 induced electromotive force fig 25 shows the induced electromotive force emf wave of stator winding and its fft analysis we can find out the one phase emf at 800 rpm is 320 v through the fft analysis we can find a small thd of 0 8 thus the proposed pmsg machine can generate voltage with nearing sinusoidal wave that is able to be verified 2 6 5 cogging torque estimation the proposed pmsg machine must have rated output power of 3 0 kw at 500 rpm to meet load demand moreover to reduce the cogging torque the ratio of poles slots of 16 24 is employed through fem analysis the cogging torque factor car is 10 9 that meets the performance requirements that showed in fig 26 2 6 6 implementation and testing fig 27 shows the prototype of the proposed pmsg machine hetronix technology corp taipei taiwan a simplified dynamometer that includes a prime mover as water turbine and a gear box has been established to test the performance characteristics of proposed pmsg whether no load or load is equal to 50ω by simulation and practical measurement we can find that both obtained voltages at different speeds are almost same that is showed in fig 28 a b the results show the proposed pmsg machine can be used furthermore fig 29 a shows the output power and efficiency of the proposed pmsg machine at different speed while the load is equal to 20ω we can find out that the output power almost is proportional to the rotational speed and the efficiency is greater than 92 at 500 rpm in addition fig 29 b shows the output power and efficiency at different load while the rational speed is 800 rpm through above analysis and explanations we can find out the proposed pmsg machine has excellent performances that can meet the load requirements 2 7 subproject six assessing the social impact of marine hydrokinetic energy development ignoring environmental impact when developing renewable energy usually causes local resident conflict the u s cape cod offshore wind farm led to local resident and environmentalist protests kempton et al 2005 the statement of environmental principles factors and objectives epa western australia 2016 lists a framework and provides an overarching approach for the consideration of environmental factors through eia and offers the consistency in the application of environmental factors within five themes land sea water air and people due to the budget limited this subproject focused on the social impacts when developing renewable energy to decrease the social cost of local protests raises the local awareness of the environment and renewable energy and further develops a long term cooperation strategy between local and sustainable energy this study investigates communities i e tongliang village dacang village watong village and chenchian village and the potential impact issues include affected industry lifestyle expectation and acceptance because the study area is a tourist attraction the study investigates tourists opinions on ocean current generation at the end of the investigation august 5 2012 there were 252 questionnaires from tourists and 100 questionnaires from local fishermen or related stakeholders the questionnaire included basic information about respondents and their 1 awareness of renewable energy 2 usage of the study area including the frequency type and related income 3 opinions on the environmental impact of developing ocean current generation including aspect and degree and 4 agreement or disagreement regarding ocean current generation the survey from local fishery questionnaires on the awareness of renewable energy indicates that half of respondents do not understand the related information about renewable energy the concept of renewable energy is not popular in the study area table 3 the respondents who understand renewable energy indicated that they are familiar with wind power followed by solar power and hydraulic power table 4 residents are more familiar with wind power because penghu s county government actively develops wind farms to establish low carbon islands excepting the impacts on economy fishery and ecology the respondents all agreed that developing ocean current generation will increase the number of tourists and raise the tourism income table 5 according to local investigation 75 of tourists do not think the generator will change the local landscape and if some interpretive signals could be set up around the generator it would be good for local tourism development and environmental education moreover 80 of tourists support developing ocean current generation in penghu see table 6 the report on the potential impact on the economy fisheries landscape and biology shows that local residents fear that ocean current energy generation could impact fish and reduce their source of income but apart from the economy fisheries and biology the respondents agree that ocean current energy construction will increase the number of tourists and further improve tourism revenue the positive support from local community assured the peaceful deployment of the nsysu i tidal energy capture system at penghu in 2013 in addition to questionnaire survey several conference meetings were also called before the field deployment of the system was performed and fig 30 left shows the research team visited penghu county government three years ahead of the field deployment and won the fully supports from the government and local group leaders fig 30 right shows the attendance and discussion during the introductory meeting held at the tung liang fish port office no strike and protest from local fishermen and residences happened during the field deployment of the nsysu i system and we believe the pre communication plays a crucial role 3 field deployment of nsysu i system the nsysu i platform was manufactured by jong shyn shipbuilding and the stability test fig 31 was made at kaohsiung harbor before shipping it to penghu fig 32 illustrates the field deployment of the nsysu i system which is stably floating at the sea surface fig 33 illustrates the assaulting of tein pin typhoon when the largest wind speed reached level 17 56 1 61 2 m s the mooring lines and the anchor systems were all safe and the safety of the platform under storm surge environment was successfully verified after the typhoon attack fig 34 depicts the measured flow velocities at the entrance of the duct and at the turbine the velocity at the entrance was measured from 0 6 to 1 5 m s and that at the turbine was from 0 9 m s to 1 8 m s and the rectangular nozzle and diffusor duct do enhance the flow velocity passing through the turbine the blade torque measured was from 1 5 to 19 5 n m and the rotation speed

2013 4 conclusion in this paper a study on harvesting tidal current energy was done in this integrated project with six subprojects the projects of cross disciplinary include mechanical electrical ocean environmental engineering underwater technology and marine science the deployment of the first nsysu energy capture system was made in 2013 at the sea near the cross sea bridge of penghu and the safety and stability of the system was assured after it passed teinping typhoon attacked the field deployment experience is successful and the following conclude remarks may be given 1 the tidal current magnetic generator is successfully installed in a taiwan first submerged and floating platform and it was working well in the sea 2 the efficiencies of the turbine and magnetic generator are verified by the field tests 3 the mechanical seal worked well during the field operation 4 the stability of the platform is very good and the platform can automatically tune its direction against the incoming tidal current the system can work well in a storm wave condition and its safety was approved by the tein ping typhoon attacked and it was a very unique experience in taiwan as well as in the world 5 the turbine can be rotated under a small current velocity even smaller than 0 5 m s the experimental results have shown that the proposed pmsg machine not only can satisfy the characteristics of low speed and high efficiency but also the pmsg based mct system can harvest evident power while the water turbine starting operation 6 the observed flow speeds at the entrance and the center of the duct verified the nozzle and diffusor duct does enhance the flow speed passing through the turbines 7 a 3kw 5 kw low speed high efficiency pmsg machine with small cogging torque has been implemented rigorously as the generator of mct system 8 in addition the statistical results show that the proposed mct system has the maximum power of 4892 w at turbine speed of 145 rpm and the average power of 762 w thus the proposed mct subsystem will have the ability to harvest more ocean energy while facing with strong ocean current therefore the proposed system can be tested in the ocean surrounding of green township for harvesting the energy of kuroshio in the future 9 the conference meetings were also called before the field deployment of the system was performed no strike and protest from local fishermen and residence occurred during the field deployment of the nsysu i system and the pre communication plays a crucial role 10 a cfd analysis made by the first author found that the power take off efficiency of a circular duct is 3 times larger than that of a square duct chen and huang 2016 the field deployment experience in penghu provides a solid confidence that the same turbines put in a circular nozzle diffusor duct may capture more than 15 kw tidal energy from the field acknowledgement this study is partially supported by a grant issued by national science

on expanding the use of renewable energy and accelerating the development of renewable energy industry according to word energy outlook 2008 presented by international energy agency iea development and promotion of new energy science and technology will play a key role to solve future global energy shortage and reduce the environmental pollution impact ocean energy is one of the best green energy in all generation technologies due to its clean and non polluting besides taiwan is surrounded by sea the power of the kuroshio in eastern taiwan and the tidal current of penghu channel offer the great opportunities to develop ocean current power generation green energy technology plan report green energy environment research laboratories industrial technology research institute of taiwan 2010 proposed that taiwan s ocean energy is expected to reach 200 mw in 2025 if we continue to develop marine energy technology marine energy will drive the additional industry efficiency including wave power 130 billion with co2 reduction of 112 000 tonne year thermoelectric power generation 108 billion with co2 reduction of 312 000 tonne year kuroshio generation 130 billion with co2 reduction of 187 000 tonne year as government policies shift towards inclusion of renewable sources the offshore ocean resources have great potential worldwide investments in renewable energy technologies reveal that offshore wind energy is increasing and strong growth in offshore wind farms is anticipated the true potential of wave energy will only be realized in the offshore environment where large developments are conceivable at present a large number of concepts for wave energy devices have been proposed but only a few are likely to have progressed to meet commercial demands commercial scale wave power stations exist and are delivering power to grids modular offshore wave energy devices that can be deployed quickly and cost effectively in a wide range of conditions will accelerate commercial wave energy and only through multiple unit projects wave energy could become commercially successful alternative renewable energy source also from ocean water might be tidal power which converts energy from the ocean into electricity tidal power might also be one of the most reliable and predictable energy sources and people have developed and used tidal energy for centuries tidal current turbines are basically underwater windmills the tidal currents are used to drive an underwater turbine developers have shifted toward technologies that capture the tidally driven coastal currents or tidal stream smaller units that can be deployed individually or in multiple units characterize tidal current stream technologies currently the dominance of offshore wind does not mean wave and tidal energy are not important with time and sufficient financial supports sizeable wave and tidal farms could be in place by the next decade taiwan is an island and 98 energy are imported overview of the flow field near taiwan is shown in fig 1 and a branch of north pacific gyre kuroshio passes through the east coast of taiwan the range of kuroshio is around 170 km wide and 700 m deep with an average speed up to 1 25 m s hsueh 2000 and it is equivalent to 120 gw h if 1 of the kuroshio power is taken that is 1 2 gw while chen 2010 suggested a 30 gw power plant and it can nearly replaces all the power plants needed in taiwan the kuroshio power is therefore a good opportunity to become a major resource of future power generation in taiwan part of the kuroshio travels along the west coast through a strip between penghu and taiwan in globe development many nearly matured and successfully deployments were reported in europe as early as 2003 the 300 kw prototype seaflow installed in the bristol channel to further study the tidal energy technology including related engineering management system and environmental impacts the seagen tidal turbine was installed in strangford narrow strangford lough northern ireland by marine current turbines ltd mct in 2008 that is a 1 2 mw production version with twin 16 m diameter axial flow rotors douglas et al 2008 seagen continued operating until the last quarter of 2015 however seagen is decommissioned and served its r d purpose especially for environment impact study marinespace ltd 2016 also in uk cardiff based tidal energy developer tidal energy ltd deployed its 400 kw deltastream into ramsey sound off wales in 2015 each unit can carry up to three turbines scotrenewables deployed the sr2000 floating tidal

second turbine of edf s paimpol brehat tidal array was deployed on may 29 2017 by openhydro a dcns company the 16 m turbine were operated at a depth of 40 m below sea surface in france sabella french tidal energy developer installed d10 tidal energy turbine with a rotor diameter of 16 m in the fromveur passage off the french island of ushant it has been working very well for years its rated capacity is up to 1 mw in summary in the past ten years over 1500 mw of projected capacity in europe was reported in a wide number of tidal energy projects sheng 2013 in america about the same order as kuroshio the estimated potential of the technically feasible power production was estimated at 19 gw in us waters the southeast national marine renewable energy center snmrec at florida atlantic university hosted a summer research program on harvesting power from ocean currents and the average energy density can reach 3 3 kw m2 off florida s east coast in asia on jan 18 2016 a 3 4 mw tidal power generator developed by china has been installed off zhoushan island eastern part of the country the modular generator is 70 m long and 30 m wide in japan kairyu the demonstration system is a 100 kw floating device that was deployed mid august 2017 for trials that aim to verify power generation and control system of the device it was installed at the water depth of 100 m at a site located 5 km off the coast of kuchinoshima island all the above reported can be found in https tidalenergytoday com more identified tidal energy developers can be found in ocean energy development in europe current status and future perspectives magagna and uihlein 2015 in taiwan as mentioned before the stability of kuroshio can be taken advantage of to generate power that s why more and more water turbine development is underway around the island trying to harness energy from the ocean albeit furnished with natural resources like this local turbine development didn t begin until recently in fact most of the turbines are small sized and are applied to dams or reservoirs by use of turgo or pelton type to cash in on the energy potentially stored in the water channel similar to these aforementioned cases in some countries which utilize the irrigation channels for farming taiwan also develops micro scale water turbines for agricultural irrigation several local research institutes has published related works on generating power through water turbine these years for example in 2008 an experiment was conducted in yunlin county wang et al 2013 and the result showed that a 0 3 m radius turbine can produce 570 w at the flow velocity of 2 m s in ocean field test tsai et al 2010 2012 kehr et al 2013 and chen et al 2015 also performed different scaled development and testing of the submerged tidal current power generators but those deployments or field tests were lasting only for one day however from what is delineated above the acquisition of ocean energy by water turbines have been laid emphasis more and more undertakings of water turbine development regarding similar power generating projects are proposed therefore as a footstep to follow our research is an integrated work encompassing fields ranging from current speed investigation mooring blade design duct and platform design blade manufacturing to power generating a study on harvesting ocean wave and marine current power was made in an integrated project with six subprojects that are headed by researchers from marine mechanical and electrical engineering the cross disciplinary project in the combination of cross field research of mechanical engineering electrical engineering ocean engineering and underwater technology is set up to design and establish a tidal current energy capture system nsysu i at penghu and the system can be viewed from google map see fig 2 viewed in 2016 the nsysu i system was deployed in august 2013 and the power take off pto was successfully monitored up to 5 kw h the nsysu i system is a partially submerged floating system with a horizontal axis turbine attached to a magnetic generator the deployment of nsysu i is the first onsite ocean deployment in taiwan our present study is a multi disciplinary integrated project that is during the development and implementation period different facets of technology have been involved but in present study we will attach the significance to oceanography mooring and anchoring turbine blade design manufacture semi submersible platform design magnetic generator and environment impact assessment etc section 2 gives a brief description of all the subprojects of the study includes subproject 1 site ocean environment investigation and primary jobs include survey of tidal elevation current speed ocean bathymetry the instruments used included adcp and multi beam side scanner etc subproject 2 mooring and anchoring system primary jobs are mooring lines and anchor system designed and the deployment implementation subproject 3 turbine blade design and manufacture the primary jobs included cfd simulation of turbine blade and the expected power take off pto the stress analysis design and manufacture of the blades and mechanical seal of the nacelle which encloses the gear box and magnetic generator subproject 4 the semi submersible nozzle diffusor duct platform the primary jobs include the cfd simulation of the platform under current and storm wave action the typhoon waves are also considered in the simulation a nozzle and diffusor duct were added to accelerate tidal flow passing through the turbine blades subproject 5 the design of permanent magnetic generator the primary jobs include simulation of a 3kw 5 kw high efficiency permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg which was then manufactured by a local industry subproject 6 the environment impact assessment and this subproject focuses on the social impacts when developing renewable energy to decrease the social cost of local protests raises the local awareness of the environment and renewable energy and further develops a long term cooperation strategy between local and sustainable energy the field deployment and monitoring results are discussed in section 3 and the final concluding remarks is given in section 4 2 subprojects in the following sections we will give a brief description of each subprojects 2 1 project one tidal current and bathymetry survey this project surveys the tidal current in the cross sea bridge at penghu the results are combined with geological and morphological surveys to offer the best reference for the site selection of the tidal energy capture system the data collection is based upon the in situ data measurement and numerical simulations the bottom mounted acdp rd instrument or acoustical tomography were deployed in the selected sites which incorporates with dgps differential global positioning system corrected to precision within 1 m fig 3 shows two selected locations adcp n1 and adcp n2 for in situ measurement and the measured data are used as a reference to conduct numerical simulations the detailed coordinates of the locations are twd97 coordinate is n23 38 54 66 e119 32 55 14 water depth is 13 2 m and 23 38 54 44 e119 32 56 58 water depth is 15 4 m since the center of turbine axis is at 4 m below the sea surface and the flow velocities at that depth are analyzed the measured data listed in figs 4 and 5 shows the flow direction is primarily in es wn direction and the velocity is 2 3 knots in es direction and 1 knot in wn direction the flow velocity measured at adcp n1 is more stable and is larger than that measured at adcp n2 besides the location of adcp n1 is more far away from the regular voyage route of the fish boats and was then selected as the final field deployed site the measured data illustrated in fig 6 also shows the tide is a semidiurnal tide and the tidal range is about 3 m and the flow direction was changed before the end of high water or low water because of the special local bathymetry conditions besides the flow velocities in winter are much larger than those in other seasons and the total time duration of velocity larger than 2 knots is about 111 5 h in the measured time periods totally 18 days 2 2 subproject two the mooring and anchoring system in the second sub project the mooring line and anchoring system were analyzed designed and manufactured the proposed floating capture system was designed by the fourth subproject and the drag forces were calculated the calculated drag force is 180 kn and the factor of safety 1 2 was used in order to maintain the stability of the platform during semi diurnal tidal current the mooring lines are arranged as shown in fig 7 and the north west and south east directions are respectively directed to cross sea bridge and margong harbor and they are also in the directions of tidal current 2 2 1 mooring lines analysis the definition sketch of the single point mooring spm system is shown as fig 8 in which point b is the floating duct and a is the anchor block h is the water depth and θa is the maximum allowable angle the catenary theory considers only the total weight of the chain in the water and neglect the possible horizontal forces acting on the cable the only horizontal force acting on the chain is due to drag force as the tidal current and waves acting on the duct considering an arbitrary section oc o is the lowest point of the cable whose tangent line is horizontal line and c is an arbitrary point of the cable t is tension t h and t v are respectively the horizontal and vertical components of the tension the length of oc section is s and the unit chain weight in water is p and we may get t o t h and t v p s adopting catenary theory of berteaux 1976 we have 1 y t o p cosh p x t o 1 2 x t o p sinh 1 p s t o 3 s t o p sinh p x t o 4 t o t h t v p s t t h 2 t v 2 the calculation starts from choosing a θ a and we may get t a and its vertical component t a v then for a given p the chain length oa s a can be determined by eqn 3 the coordinates x a and y a can be calculated by eqns 3 and 1 and finally get y b by h y b y a and get x b by eqn 1 the s a and s b can be determined and the chain length is the difference of lengths s a and s b the corresponding tensions at each point can be calculated by eqn 4 the maximum cable tension 180 kn is given by the subproject 4 and the chain material selection can be determined according to iacs 2007 and we select chain diameter 24 mm and grade gl k3 with proof load 332 kn and breaking load 476 kn 2 2 2 gravity concrete block anchor the gravity concrete block was used as the anchoring systems the possible forces acting on the gravity block are the buoyance force and the net weight of block sitting at the sea bottom is w and can be calculated as 5 w w s f f f v n where w s is the weight of block in air f f is the buoyance force and f v is vertical component force of mooring line n is the reaction force of sea bottom on the block the friction force and required weight of the concrete block therefore can be calculated by 6 f μ n μ w s f f f v f f h 216 k n w s f μ f f f v 216 k n 0 5 v γ c o n c 61 6 k n where μ v γ conc and f h are respectively the friction coefficient volume of concrete block specific weight of concrete block and net horizontal force acting on platform fig 9 shows the construction of the concrete gravity block including the reinforcement set up stainless steel hanger installation templates set up and concrete poring etc the field deployment of the concrete blocks is illustrated in fig 10 the sonar image was also made to confirm the concrete block being deployed to the expected locations 2 3 subproject three horizontal turbine design the ansys fluent was used to model the tidal current passing horizontal turbine and the mechanical stress calculation was made to determine the turbine blade geometry the power take off of turbine versus rotation speed of turbine is calculated and the optimal pto can be determined fig 11 shows the detailed measured tidal current speeds at a level 4 m below the sea surface the current speed can reach 1 5 m s during high tide and it becomes less than 0 5 m s during low tide the artificial simulated tidal velocity is listed in fig 12 and the simulated pto of the proposed turbine is shown in fig 13 and the maximum pto is over 1000 w and the pto of low tide is negligible small in addition to cfd simulation the experimental tests of the 1 m turbine blade attached with generator were made at tainan hydraulic laboratory thl of ncku fig 14 shows the setup of the turbine gearbox generator system tggs the lab model test wish to clarify following major goals 1 the minimum current speed to start up turbine rotation when the generator is with or without sur charge 2 measure the relationship among turbine rotation speed current speed and torque built by turbine blades 3 the final goal is measuring pto the turbine gearbox generator system is launched on a movable platform train as the control motor increases the moving speed of the train the turbine was experienced with increasing current speed the turbine starts to rotate when the current speed increases to 1 1 m s and the recorded maximum rotation speed is upto 200 rpm and the output torque is 40 n m when the current speed is 1 3 m s however the stress developed in turbine blade was beyond the strength of the material of the blade and they were failure before we started to measure the power output of the generator fig 15 shows the turbine started rotating when the current speed is larger than 1 1 m s and the turbine blades were failure at which the current speed was over 1 3 m s blade element momentum bem theory is usually adopted to design the ideal turbine blade where highest cl cd i e lift and drag ratio of a blade can be determined along the blade radial direction and thus the greatest efficiency can be obtained hartwanger and horvat 2008 the blade failure remind us the blade yield strength will be sacrificed unknowingly by such a design principle at the same time as a result we then modified the old blade shape naca6409 and increase blade thickness and also changed the material used to build the new blades naca63621 fig 16 depicts the principal stress built in the blades and the maximum principal stress developed in the new blade is one order smaller than that of the original blade the material made of the blade was changed from aluminum alloy 270 mpa to nickel aluminum bronze alloy 690 mpa since the start up current speed for turbine rotation is 1 1 m s when the generator is without surcharge and that might be larger when the generator is with surcharge the measured maximum tidal current speed at penghu is 1 5 m s and the average speed is 1 25 m s only to assure the rotation of turbine the data obtained in the lab test at ncku suggested us a duct platform with nozzle and diffusor is necessary and the subproject four is in charge of this mission 2 4 subproject four semi submerged floating platform the objective of this sub project is to develop a semi submerged and floating energy capture system which is suitable for medium to deep water depths this subproject study the floating platform which carry water turbine gear box magnetic generator and monitoring equipment according to the lab experiment the nozzle and diffusor duct is recommended to enhance the tidal current velocity passing through the turbine blades because of the budget limit and the manufacture of a rectangular diffusor shape is much cheaper than a circular diffusor and the rectangular shape is therefore chosen to enhance the flow speed passing through the water turbine the cfd simulation was made to determine the optimal geometry of the nozzle and diffusor the commercial cfd code ansys fluent was used to simulate the drag and lift forces developed as the tidal current passing through the platform 2 4 1 numerical method this research is conducted by the use of a commercial code fluent 6 3 which is a computational fluid dynamics code the flow is assumed to be incompressible with constant density and molecular viscosity the navier stokes equation along with the continuity equation were solved to acquire the velocity and pressure fields the continuity equation is u x u w z 0 and the navier stokes equations of a 3d incompressible flow can be written as 7 u t u u x v u y w u z 1 ρ p x υ 2 u 8 v t u v x v v y w v z g 1 ρ p y υ 2 v 9 w t u w x v w y w w z 1 ρ p z υ 2 w where t is the time and u v and w are respectively the velocity components in the x y and z directions p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and v is the kinematic viscous coefficient the stagger grid was also used the discretization techniques used were quadratic upwind interpolation of convective kinematics quick method and piso algorithm was used as iteration techniques to solve for flow velocity as well as pressure fields when it comes to the turbulent model some previous works use k ε and obtain reliable results hartwanger and horvat 2008 wu et al 2012 therefore we also follow suit to adopt turbulent model k ε to compute for better accuracy in terms of the preprocessor to construct modelling structure the autocad and solidwork codes were used to construct the geometry of the computational domain and to store the results in sat or iges files and then use the gambit code to establish computational meshes the post processing of the output was done by matlab to provide plots and figures of this paper the detailed numerical iteration procedures can be found in wu et al 2012 and they are omitted in the text to enhance the flow velocity in the duct the nozzle is set at the front part of the duct and we simulated the efficiency of pto of five different open angles of nozzle see fig 17 the simulated results suggest the opening angle between 25 and 30 will have the better pto however the enhanced velocity obtained by the aid of nozzle just increases the velocity passing the center of the duct to 1 4 m s only we therefore added a curved diffusor at the back edge of the duct to manipulate the flow and create a low pressure zone and flow speed might be further increased fig 18 compares the velocity increase with and without curved manipulated channel and the mainstream velocity can increase to 1 9 m s and curved diffusor channels does significantly increase the pto the final proposed platform is depicted in fig 19 2 5 subproject five design and implementation of a low speed permanent magnet synchronous generator for applying to a mct system in this subproject a 3kw 5 kw high efficiency pmsg machine with small cogging torque has been implemented rigorously as the generator of a marine current turbine mct system to harvest ocean current power furthermore the proposed pmsg based mct system has been developed to investigate its feasibility of ocean current generation system at ocean surrounding of taiwan in addition the mct system has been tested really in the ocean surrounding penghu county of taiwan during the 2013 07 09 11 the experimental results have shown that proposed pmsg machine not only can satisfy the performance requirements but also the pmsg based mct system can harvest effectively the ocean current energy due to the ocean current environment complexity and the walrus are difficult to forecast and grasp so that an effective mct generation system should be implemented based on efficiency toughness and durability and has easy maintenance features ng et al 2013 and peng et al 2013 fig 20 shows a complete mct generation system that contains two subsystems one the mct subsystem the other is the power energy conversion subsystem benelghali et al 2012 numerous types of generators have been implemented for applying to mct systems for harvesting effectively the ocean energy according to many research reports benelghali et al 2012 the permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg uses the permanent magnets pms to replace the electromagnetic field has the advantages of performances such as high efficiency high power density robustness reliability and it is able to adapt to harsh environments therefore this subproject intends to develop a high efficiency pmsg machine as the generator of a mct system in this subproject a 3kw 5 kw pmsg based mct system will be implemented to harvest the ocean current energy to verify its feasibility for applying to ocean surrounding taiwan the operation specifications of the proposed mct system will be described as follows one horizontal axis water turbine with 40 120 rpm will be speed up 480 1440 rpm by a growth machine up gearbox then the growth machine will be combined with proposed pmsg machine to become a pmsg based mct system as shown in fig 21 a at different speeds v the output power p e curves of a pmsg are showed in fig 21 b the performance parameters of proposed pmsg machine are as table 1 2 6 design and analysis of proposed pmsg machine 2 6 1 geometric structure of pmsg machine due to the limit of mct space in this subproject a 16 pole 24 slot radial flux pmsg machine has been designed and implemented as the generator of proposed mct system that showed in fig 22 the geometric parameters of proposed pmsg machine are listed in table 2 2 6 2 fem analysis the finite element method fem has been used to evaluate the performance parameters of proposed pmsg machine islam et al 2004 the results contain both magnetic flux distribution and flux density are showed in fig 23 through 3d fea analysis we can realize the distribution of the linkage flux and the leakage flux in rotor and stator respectively we can find that the maximum flux density bmax is 1 82 t that shows the saturation degree in iron core is low 2 6 3 d q axes inductances due to the d q axes inductances will be affected by generator structure hence the torque and output power of proposed pmsg will be also changed fig 24 shows the difference of d g axes inductances at different speed because the difference of ld and lq is not obvious hence the electromagnetic torque tm is greater than the reluctance torque tr 2 6 4 induced electromotive force fig 25 shows the induced electromotive force emf wave of stator winding and its fft analysis we can find out the one phase emf at 800 rpm is 320 v through the fft analysis we can find a small thd of 0 8 thus the proposed pmsg machine can generate voltage with nearing sinusoidal wave that is able to be verified 2 6 5 cogging torque estimation the proposed pmsg machine must have rated output power of 3 0 kw at 500 rpm to meet load demand moreover to reduce the cogging torque the ratio of poles slots of 16 24 is employed through fem analysis the cogging torque factor car is 10 9 that meets the performance requirements that showed in fig 26 2 6 6 implementation and testing fig 27 shows the prototype of the proposed pmsg machine hetronix technology corp taipei taiwan a simplified dynamometer that includes a prime mover as water turbine and a gear box has been established to test the performance characteristics of proposed pmsg whether no load or load is equal to 50ω by simulation and practical measurement we can find that both obtained voltages at different speeds are almost same that is showed in fig 28 a b the results show the proposed pmsg machine can be used furthermore fig 29 a shows the output power and efficiency of the proposed pmsg machine at different speed while the load is equal to 20ω we can find out that the output power almost is proportional to the rotational speed and the efficiency is greater than 92 at 500 rpm in addition fig 29 b shows the output power and efficiency at different load while the rational speed is 800 rpm through above analysis and explanations we can find out the proposed pmsg machine has excellent performances that can meet the load requirements 2 7 subproject six assessing the social impact of marine hydrokinetic energy development ignoring environmental impact when developing renewable energy usually causes local resident conflict the u s cape cod offshore wind farm led to local resident and environmentalist protests kempton et al 2005 the statement of environmental principles factors and objectives epa western australia 2016 lists a framework and provides an overarching approach for the consideration of environmental factors through eia and offers the consistency in the application of environmental factors within five themes land sea water air and people due to the budget limited this subproject focused on the social impacts when developing renewable energy to decrease the social cost of local protests raises the local awareness of the environment and renewable energy and further develops a long term cooperation strategy between local and sustainable energy this study investigates communities i e tongliang village dacang village watong village and chenchian village and the potential impact issues include affected industry lifestyle expectation and acceptance because the study area is a tourist attraction the study investigates tourists opinions on ocean current generation at the end of the investigation august 5 2012 there were 252 questionnaires from tourists and 100 questionnaires from local fishermen or related stakeholders the questionnaire included basic information about respondents and their 1 awareness of renewable energy 2 usage of the study area including the frequency type and related income 3 opinions on the environmental impact of developing ocean current generation including aspect and degree and 4 agreement or disagreement regarding ocean current generation the survey from local fishery questionnaires on the awareness of renewable energy indicates that half of respondents do not understand the related information about renewable energy the concept of renewable energy is not popular in the study area table 3 the respondents who understand renewable energy indicated that they are familiar with wind power followed by solar power and hydraulic power table 4 residents are more familiar with wind power because penghu s county government actively develops wind farms to establish low carbon islands excepting the impacts on economy fishery and ecology the respondents all agreed that developing ocean current generation will increase the number of tourists and raise the tourism income table 5 according to local investigation 75 of tourists do not think the generator will change the local landscape and if some interpretive signals could be set up around the generator it would be good for local tourism development and environmental education moreover 80 of tourists support developing ocean current generation in penghu see table 6 the report on the potential impact on the economy fisheries landscape and biology shows that local residents fear that ocean current energy generation could impact fish and reduce their source of income but apart from the economy fisheries and biology the respondents agree that ocean current energy construction will increase the number of tourists and further improve tourism revenue the positive support from local community assured the peaceful deployment of the nsysu i tidal energy capture system at penghu in 2013 in addition to questionnaire survey several conference meetings were also called before the field deployment of the system was performed and fig 30 left shows the research team visited penghu county

meeting held at the tung liang fish port office no strike and protest from local fishermen and residences happened during the field deployment of the nsysu i system and we believe the pre communication plays a crucial role 3 field deployment of nsysu i system the nsysu i platform was manufactured by jong shyn shipbuilding and the stability test fig 31 was made at kaohsiung harbor before shipping it to penghu fig 32 illustrates the field deployment of the nsysu i system which is stably floating at the sea surface fig 33 illustrates the assaulting of tein pin typhoon when the largest wind speed reached level 17 56 1 61 2 m s the mooring lines and the anchor systems were all safe and the safety of the platform under storm surge environment was successfully verified after the typhoon attack fig 34 depicts the measured flow velocities at the entrance of the duct and at the turbine the velocity at the entrance was measured from 0 6 to 1 5 m s and that at the turbine was from 0 9 m s to 1 8 m s and the rectangular nozzle and diffusor duct do enhance the flow velocity passing through the turbine the blade torque measured was from 1 5 to 19 5 n m and the rotation speed

2013 4 conclusion in this paper a study on harvesting tidal current energy was done in this integrated project with six subprojects the projects of cross disciplinary include mechanical electrical ocean environmental engineering underwater technology and marine science the deployment of the first nsysu energy capture system was made in 2013 at the sea near the cross sea bridge of penghu and the safety and stability of the system was assured after it passed teinping typhoon attacked the field deployment experience is successful and the following conclude remarks may be given 1 the tidal current magnetic generator is successfully installed in a taiwan first submerged and floating platform and it was working well in the sea 2 the efficiencies of the turbine and magnetic generator are verified by the field tests 3 the mechanical seal worked well during the field operation 4 the stability of the platform is very good and the platform can automatically tune its direction against the incoming tidal current the system can work well in a storm wave condition and its safety was approved by the tein ping typhoon attacked and it was a very unique experience in taiwan as well as in the world 5 the turbine can be rotated under a small current velocity even smaller than 0 5 m s the experimental results have shown that the proposed pmsg machine not only can satisfy the characteristics of low speed and high efficiency but also the pmsg based mct system can harvest evident power while the water turbine starting operation 6 the observed flow speeds at the entrance and the center of

zhang et al 2015 to evaluate the reliability of a system exact data associated with system components failure and repair is essential ebeling 2001 the extraction of exact data in crisp form is not a simple task for every engineering system and thus rough data is used in absence of crisp data for reliability analysis which could lead to uncertainty zio 2009 also different probability density functions representing system components failure and repair increase the difficulty in system reliability assessment mon and cheng 1994 aminifar et al 2010 liu et al 2014 mentes 2011 in addition the probability based conventional methods e g markov process could be computationally very slow and might be perform large number of computations for complex systems in such circumstances the fuzzy set theory based methodologies may be used which are very effective for quantifying uncertainty and accelerating computation process aminifar et al 2010 in most of the available fuzzy set theory based researches different types of data uncertainty is quantified by using triangular fuzzy numbers tfns only which may not be appropriate for every complex problem to quantify data uncertainty and

in table 1 according to listed approaches mishra 1992 introduced lambda tau lt method which do not quantify uncertainty and applies fta system components failure repair data as crisp values and ordinary arithmetic operations for evaluating system reliability the existing fuzzy reliability techniques which quantify data uncertainty can be classified into two categories in first category techniques data uncertainty is quantified using fuzzy sets vague sets or ifs and related arithmetic operations have been applied for evaluating system fuzzy reliability on the other hand second category techniques used fuzzy sets vague sets or ifs for quantifying data uncertainty and formulate fuzzy reliability problem as nonlinear programming problem which is then solved by variety of heuristic methods and algorithms as far as first category techniques are concern knezevic and odoom 2001 extended lt method by integrating it with fuzzy set theory and developed a novel approach named

theory this section provides some basic definitions including fuzzy set different types of fuzzy membership functions α cut set t norm and the weakest t norm t ω section also gives three different types of fuzzy arithmetic operations which are used in the present study 2 1 definitions 2 1 1 fuzzy sets a fuzzy set a represents a set with ill defined boundaries mathematically a fuzzy a in the universe of discourse x can be expressed as an ordered pair 1 a x μ a x x x where μ a x is the membership function which associates each element x in x a real number in the interval 0 1 zadeh 1965 2 1 2 different fuzzy membership functions there are different fuzzy membership functions which are used to quantify different type of uncertainties present in data mon and cheng 1994 chen 1996 zimmermann 2001 some commonly used fuzzy membership functions are triangular trapezoidal cauchy sharp gamma normal etc mon and cheng 1994 chen 1996 an imprecise real number around a 2 r can be expressed by a fuzzy set a using different fuzzy membership functions in the range support a 1 a 2 a 3 as followings mon and cheng 1994 triangular fuzzy membership function 2 μ a x x a 1 a 2 a 1 a 1 x a 2 1 x a 2 a 3 x a 3 a 2 a 2 x a 3 normal fuzzy membership function 3 μ a x exp k x a 2 2 k 0 a 2 r sharp gamma fuzzy membership function 4 μ a x exp k x a 2 x a 2 k 0 a 2 r exp k x a 2 x a 2 cauchy fuzzy membership function 5 μ a x 1 1 k x a 2 β k 0 β is positive even trapezoidal fuzzy membership function 6 μ a x 0 x a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 1 d a 1 x a 2 d 1 a 2 d x a 2 d a 3 x a 3 a 2 d a 2 d x a 3 0 a 3 x where 0 a 1 a 2 d a 2 a 2 d a 3 d r here in all above definitions symmetry has been maintained which may be disturbed as per the need by taking suitable values of parameters for different sub domains while r and r represent set of real and positive real numbers respectively 2 1 3 α cut set an α cut of a fuzzy set a is denoted by a α and defined as a crisp set consisting elements of a having at least degree of membership α cheng and mon 1993 the α cut of a fuzzy set a representing a real number around a 2 r in the range a 1 a 2 a 3 is given by 7 a α a 1 α a 3 α x x μ a x α where α is a parameter ranges from 0 α 1 and x is the universe of discourse this fuzzy number a is shown in fig 1 using different fuzzy membership functions as defined in section 2 1 2 along with an α cut for tfn only 2 1 4 triangular norm t norm and the weakest t norm t ω a binary function t 0 1 2 0 1 is called a t norm if t is associative commutative non decreasing and t x 1 x for each x 0 1 hong and do 1997 lin et al 2011a b there are various kinds of t norms including min x y x y max 0 x y 1 and t ω x y present study applies weakest t norm t ω due to its shape preserving and reducing growing phenomena of fuzziness characteristics within uncertain environment lin et al 2011a b komal et al 2015 and defined in eq 8 8 t ω x y x if y 1 y if x 1 0 otherwise 2 2 different fuzzy arithmetic operations this section is devoted to give brief idea about some existing fuzzy arithmetic operations 2 2 1 the α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations defined on any fuzzy numbers let a and b

2 2 t ω based fuzzy number arithmetic operations defined for tfns let a and b be two tfns representing two imprecise real numbers around a 2 and around b 2 with supports a 1 a 2 a 3 and b 1 b 2 b 3 respectively the five main fuzzy number arithmetic operations defined on these tfns a and b using t ω definition eq 8 are summarized in table 3 hong and do 1997 2 2 3 the α cut interval arithmetic and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations defined on any fuzzy numbers let a and b be any two fuzzy numbers as discussed in section 2 1 2 representing two imprecise real numbers around a 2 and around b 2 with supports a 1 a 2 a 3 and b 1 b 2 b 3 respectively based on their α cuts represented by a α a 1 α a 3 α and b α b 1 α b 3 α for α 0 1 and applying t ω definition eq 8 the five main fuzzy arithmetic operations defined on a and b are summarized in table 4 lin et al 2011a b 3 a brief overview of lt flt gflt and tbflt techniques the basic assumptions used in the study are as follows component failures and repair rates are statistically independent constant very small and obey exponential distribution function the product of the failure rate and repair time is small less than 0 1 there are no simultaneous failures among the subsystems separate maintenance facility is available for each component the repair process begins soon after a unit fails after repairs the repaired component is considered as good as new system structure is precisely known 3 1 lt method lambda tau lt method is a traditional method for analysing reliability of a repairable system constituted by n number of repairable components with failure rates λ 1 λ 2 λ n and repair times τ 1 τ 2 τ n mishra 1992 the lt method applies fault tree crisp values of λ i and τ i and expressions given by eqs10 13 associated with a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged in parallel series i e and or configuration expressions for and transitions based on classical arithmetic operations 10 λ j 1 m λ j i 1 m j 1 i j m τ j 11 τ i 1 m τ i j 1 m i 1 i j m τ i expressions for or transitions based on classical arithmetic operations 12 λ i 1 m λ i 13 τ i 1 m λ i τ i i 1 m λ i to find the expressions for system failure rate λ s and repair time τ s in the form of its constituting components λ i and τ i system fault tree its minimal cut sets and eqs10 13 are used using these λ s and τ s various reliability parameters as given in table 5 for a repairable system could be easily computed by applying classical arithmetic operations 3 2 flt technique in lt method crisp input data is used which may have some sort of uncertainty in fuzzy lambda tau flt technique the data uncertainty is quantified with the help of tfns with known spreads as shown in fig 2 a by taking an example of input data type for i t h component s fuzzy failure rate λ i and fuzzy repair time τ i as tfns knezevic and odoom 2001 flt applies fault tree lt method input as tfns α cut and fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 for computing various reliability parameters table 5 of a repairable system in the form of fuzzy membership functions using α cut definition and fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 the eqs 10 13 are fuzzified for finding fuzzy failure rate λ and fuzzy repair time τ of a subsystem constituted by m number of components arranged in parallel series i e and or configuration at cut level α the fuzzified equations are given below with the following definitions 14 λ i α λ i 1 α λ i 3 α x x μ λ i x α 15 τ i α τ i 1 α τ i 3 α x x μ τ i x α expressions for and transitions based on fuzzy arithmetic operations 16 λ α i 1 m λ i 1 α j 1 m i 1 i j m τ i 1 α i 1 m λ i 3 α j 1 m i 1 i j m τ i 3 α 17 τ α i 1 m λ i 1 α j 1 m i 1 i j m τ i 3 α i 1 m τ i 3 α j 1 m i 1 i j m τ i 1 α expressions for or transitions based on fuzzy arithmetic operations 18 λ α i 1 m λ i 1 α i 1 m λ i 3 α 19 τ α i 1 m λ i 1 α τ i 1 α i 1 m λ i 3 α i 1 m λ i 3 α τ i 3 α i 1 m λ i 1 α using system fault tree its minimal cut sets obtained by matrix method liu and chiou 1997 fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 and eqs 16 19 system fuzzy failure rate λ s and fuzzy repair time τ s can be computed using these λ s and τ s various reliability parameters as given in table 5 can be easily computed by applying fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 3 3 tbflt technique for reducing the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness and accelerating the computation process komal et al 2015 introduced t ω based fuzzy lambda tau tbflt technique tbflt applies fault tree lt method input as tfns and simplified t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 3 for evaluating various reliability parameters of the system let the system i t h component s fuzzy failure rate λ i and fuzzy repair time τ i be represented in tfns as 20 λ i λ i 1 λ i 2 λ i 3 21 τ i τ i 1 τ i 2 τ i 3 where λ i 1 λ i 2 and λ i 3 represent lower middle and upper limits of i t h component s failure rate while τ i 1 τ i 2 and τ i 3 represent lower middle and upper limits of its repair time fig 2 a the derived and or expressions for fuzzy failure rate λ and fuzzy repair time τ of a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged fully in parallel series i e in and or configuration are given below expressions for and transitions based on simplified t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations 22 λ λ 1 t ω λ 2 t ω t ω λ m t ω τ 2 t ω τ 3 t ω t ω τ m t ω τ 1 t ω τ 3 t ω t ω τ m t ω t ω τ 1 t ω τ 2 t ω t ω τ m 1 23 τ τ 1 t ω τ 2 t ω t ω τ m t ω τ 2 t ω τ 3 t ω t ω τ m t ω τ 1 t ω τ 3 t ω t ω τ m t ω t

m t ω τ m t ω λ 1 t ω λ 2 t ω t ω λ m now using system fault tree its minimal cut sets lt method input as tfns and eqs 3 3 and 3 3 system λ s and τ s can be computed by applying simplified t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 3 using these λ s and τ s various reliability parameters as given in table 5 can be easily computed by applying simplified t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations 3 4 gflt technique in flt and tbflt techniques the crisp data is fuzzified with the help of tfns as shown in fig 2 a knezevic and odoom 2001 however sometimes data has uncertainty due to various reasons and to quantify it different experts may suggest different membership functions mon and cheng 1994 as an example same input data as taken in fig 2 a is fuzzified by using different membership functions for i t h component s λ i and τ i and shown in fig 2 b in view of these facts and removing limitations in flt and tbflt techniques komal 2016a introduced gflt technique which applies different membership functions for computing various fuzzy reliability parameters of a pmu in wide area measurement and control systems aminifar et al 2010 the calculation process in gflt is same as that of in flt the equations for computing λ and τ of a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged fully in parallel series i e in and or configuration are same as used in flt technique i e eqs 16 19 4 tbgflt technique previous section concludes that the lt method use uncertain crisp data and gives imprecise idea about reliability parameters to move toward preciseness through data quantification flt use quantified data in the form of tfns but gives wide spreads for computed reliability parameters due to the use of α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 to reduce the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness and accelerating computation process tbflt technique replaced α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operation in flt with t ω based simplified fuzzy number arithmetic operations defined on tfns table 3 in flt and tbflt uncertain data is quantified through tfns only however system experts generally suggest the use of different membership functions this shortcoming is removed by adopting different membership functions in gflt technique along with α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations komal 2016a however gflt provides wide spreads for computed fuzzy reliability parameters at any cut level α due to the use of α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations cheng and mon 1993 so to reduce the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness and quantifying data uncertainty using different membership functions this study applies tbgflt technique komal 2016b in which α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations are used table 4 the procedural steps of tbgflt technique are as followings step 1 collection of system components failure and repair data in this step system components failure rate λ i and repair time τ i data in crisp form is extracted from various sources including historical records reliability databases etc and integrated with system experts step 2 fuzzification of crisp data in second step extracted data is fuzzified using different membership functions which are suggested by system experts and herein given in section 2 1 2 step 3 evaluation of system minimal cut sets the system minimal cut sets are obtained using its fault tree and matrix method liu and chiou 1997 step 4 evaluation of system fuzzy failure rate and repair time expressions using α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 eqs 10 13 are fuzzified for finding λ and τ at cut level α of a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged in parallel series i e and or configuration the fuzzified equations are given below with the following definitions 26 λ i α λ i 1 α λ i 3 α x x μ λ i x α 27 τ i α

minimal cut sets obtained by matrix method liu and chiou 1997 and eqs 28 31 system λ s and τ s are computed by applying α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 step 5 evaluation of various reliability parameters using computed system λ s and τ s various reliability parameters such as system mtbf enof availability and reliability table 5 are computed by applying α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 step 6 defuzzification at the end defuzzified values of all the fuzzy reliability parameters are computed using center of gravity cog

carrier a propulsion system is very cautiously selected there are several propulsion systems among them the dual fuel steam turbine mechanical propulsion conventional dfsmc is one of the widely used propulsion system due to its low fuel efficiency simple operability and intrinsic safety the schematic diagram of dfsmc system is shown in fig 3 a chang et al 2008 komal et al 2015 the dfsmc system burns the boil off gas bog in boilers to produce high pressure steam which drives the steam turbines connected to the propeller one of the advantage of this type is the ease of handling bog to be capable of burning bog with the liquid fuel simultaneously a reduction gear is placed in between the steam turbine and the propeller when excessive bog is generated the bog is extracted into the boiler and burned to surplus steam that can be condensed by seawater the complete working of dfsmc system can be found in chang et al 2008 and komal et al 2015 papers the dfsmc system of lng carriers

table 7 for α 0 0 1 0 2 1 5 2 5 tbgflt technique the drawback of gflt technique is that it gives vide range of prediction for each reliability parameter at any cut level α due to the use of α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations to reduce the range of prediction for each reliability parameter at any cut level α using different membership functions the system fuzzy reliability has been analysed using tbgflt technique komal 2016b to apply tbgflt technique eqs 32 and 33 are fuzzified using α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 the

have been plotted in fig 4 and also tabulated α cut wise in table 7 for α 0 0 1 0 2 1 computed results plotted in fig 4 and tabulated in table 7 clearly show that tbgflt gives reduced ranges of prediction for all the computed reliability parameters at any level α which is very beneficial for decision maker to make strong decisions for improving the system performance when different membership functions are used in the analysis the defuzzified values of all the fuzzy reliability parameters computed by flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt techniques have also been computed using cog method ross 2004 and tabulated in table 10 5 3 long run reliability and availability analyses for analysing the behavior of system fuzzy reliability and availability for long time period t 0 1000 h r s computation have been performed at different α cuts 0 0 5 1 using flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt techniques computed results for system fuzzy reliability and availability have been plotted in fig 5 along with their membership functions at t 400 h r s respectively results conclude that for long run period system reliability continuously decreases while its availability is almost linear after time t 50 h r s again tbgflt reliability and availability curves give consistently reduced ranges of prediction for long run period which is very beneficial for analysts to make more precise and stronger decisions for improving system performance for long run time period 5 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis has also been performed for analysing the effect on system mtbf when values of other reliability parameters are varied in the present study nine combinations of reliability availability and failure rates have been taken komal et al 2015 and their effects on system mtbf are computed for sensitivity analysis the ranges for system repair time and enof are taken from results shown in fig 4 b d computed by flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt techniques respectively at cut level α 0 the ranges of system mtbf for first combination of reliability availability and failure rates have been computed for all the four techniques flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt and shown graphically in fig 6 similar analysis has been done for remaining combinations and the computed ranges of mtbf for all the nine combinations and for all the four techniques are given in table 11 results show that tbflt and tbgflt gives reduced range of prediction of mtbf in comparison to other two techniques for these combinations the computed ranges of mtbf showing a decreasing trend when reliability and availability are fixed and failure rate increases thus it is inferred from the analysis that slight variation in system failure rate may give large variation in its mtbf and consequently in its performance considering above reliability analysis results in the form of plots and tables system maintenance personnel may develop an effective maintenance program for analyzing critical components of the system enhancing its performance by reducing its failure time and by improving its mtbf analysis suggests that for enhancing system performance present operating and environmental conditions of equipments and constituting components should be changed for developing an influential maintenance program as per the need 5 5 ranking of critical components for improving system performance through reduction in its frequency of failures development and execution of effective maintenance program is essential to develop an effective maintenance program it is must to identify the most critical components in the system which need more attention to rank system components as per their critically tanaka et al 1983 introduced a v index for non repairable systems when input data is taken as trapezoidal membership function in present study the existing tanaka et al 1983 approach has been extended for repairable systems when input data is taken as any fuzzy number let q t denote the system top event e g system failure probability in the form of normalized fuzzy number lee 2005 zimmermann 2001 which depends on its constituting components fuzzy failure rates and repair times if system is constituted by n number of repairable components with fuzzy failure rates λ i and fuzzy repair times τ i with different membership functions then the fuzzy probability of system top event system failure in a normalized fuzzy number and given by the following equation 76 q t q t λ 1 λ 2 λ i λ n τ 1 τ 2 τ i τ n q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 where q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 is a normalized fuzzy number with support pair q t 1 q t 4 for α 0 and height pair q t 2 q t 3 for α 1 lee 2005 zimmerman 2004 let q t i be the fuzzy probability of system top event system failure after preventing its i t h component failures by taking λ i 0 then the value of q t i is given by the following equation 77 q t i p t λ 1 λ 2 0 λ n τ 1 τ 2 τ i τ n q t i 1 q t i 2 q t i 3 q t i 4 where q t i q t i 1 q t i 2 q t i 3 q t i 4 is also a normalized fuzzy number the v index measures the difference between q t and q t i and defined as 78 v q t q t i q t 1 q t i 1 q t 2 q t i 2 q t 3 q t i 3 q t 4 q t i 4 0 which indicates the amount of improving in system top event by eliminating its i t h component failures if v q t q t i v q t q t j then elimination of system i t h component failure is more effective than its j t h component failure elimination the v index values for all the components of the system have been computed by considering q t 0 000259 0 000277 0 000277 0 000294 which is the failure probability of the system computed by tbgflt technique and shown in fig 4 a the computed values of v index for all the system components have been tabulated in table 12 and based on their values in decreasing order they are ranked from table 12 it can be observed that pump and process control valve i are the most and least critical components of the system respectively for improving dfsmc system performance expert may give their preference on the components as per their rank 6 conclusion in this paper fuzzy reliability of dfsmc system in lng carriers has been analysed using tbgflt along with four other techniques namely lt flt gflt and tbflt by considering data uncertainty tbgflt technique applies fta lt method different membership functions α cut set and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations for computation various reliability parameters of the system on comparing the computed results in fig 4 it is observed that tbgflt reduces range of prediction for each fuzzy reliability parameter at any confidence level degree of membership α which is helpful in developing effective maintenance plans for improving system performance defuzzified values of all the fuzzy reliability parameters are computed using cog method to understand the behavior of the system sensitivity long run fuzzy reliability and availability analyses are very helpful for designing and executing suitable maintenance plans to enhance the system performance ranking of system critical components has been done using extended tanaka el al s approach based on results it is concluded that to enhance the performance of the system pump and process control valve i are the most and least critical components in the system respectively for improving dfsmc system performance expert may give their preference on the components as per their rank using computed results presented in the form of figures and tables system maintenance personnel may design suitable action plan for enhancing system performance by improving its mtbf it is inferred from the whole analysis that the presented tbgflt approach is more realistic flexible incorporates various kinds of data uncertainty and gives fitter decision values with symmetric shape which is better for strong decision making to improve system performance acknowledgement this research work has been supported by university grants commission ugc new delhi india

fuzzy arithmetic operations defined on a and b are summarized in table 4 lin et al 2011a b 3 a brief overview of lt flt gflt and tbflt techniques the basic assumptions used in the study are as follows component failures and repair rates are statistically independent constant very small and obey exponential distribution function the product of the failure rate and repair time is small less than 0 1 there are no simultaneous failures among the subsystems separate maintenance facility is available for each component the repair process begins soon after a unit fails after repairs the repaired component is considered as good as new system structure is precisely known 3 1 lt method lambda tau lt method is a traditional method for analysing reliability of a repairable system constituted by n number of repairable components with failure rates λ 1 λ 2 λ n and repair times τ 1 τ 2 τ n mishra 1992 the lt method applies fault tree crisp values of λ i and τ i and expressions given by eqs10 13 associated with a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged in parallel series i e and or configuration expressions for and transitions based on classical arithmetic operations 10 λ j

various reliability parameters as given in table 5 for a repairable system could be easily computed by applying classical arithmetic operations 3 2 flt technique in lt method crisp input data is used which may have some sort of uncertainty in fuzzy lambda tau flt technique the data uncertainty is quantified with the help of tfns with known spreads as shown in fig 2 a by taking an example of input data type for i t h component s fuzzy failure rate λ i and fuzzy repair time τ i as tfns knezevic and odoom 2001 flt applies fault tree lt method input as tfns α cut and fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 for computing various reliability parameters table 5 of a repairable system in the form of fuzzy membership functions using α cut definition and fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 the eqs 10

minimal cut sets obtained by matrix method liu and chiou 1997 fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 and eqs 16 19 system fuzzy failure rate λ s and fuzzy repair time τ s can be computed using these λ s and τ s various reliability parameters as given in table 5 can be easily computed by applying fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 3 3 tbflt technique for reducing the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness and accelerating the computation process komal et al 2015 introduced t ω based fuzzy lambda tau tbflt technique tbflt applies fault tree lt method input as tfns and simplified t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 3 for evaluating various reliability parameters of the system let the system i t h component s fuzzy failure rate λ i and fuzzy repair time τ i be represented in tfns as 20 λ i λ i 1 λ i 2 λ i 3 21 τ i τ i 1 τ i 2 τ i 3 where λ i 1 λ i 2 and λ i 3 represent lower middle and upper limits of i t h component s failure rate while τ i 1 τ i 2 and τ i

approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 3 using these λ s and τ s various reliability parameters as given in table 5 can be easily computed by applying simplified t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations 3 4 gflt technique in flt and tbflt techniques the crisp data is fuzzified with the help of tfns as shown in fig 2 a knezevic and odoom 2001 however sometimes data has uncertainty due to various reasons and to quantify it different experts may suggest different membership functions mon and cheng 1994 as an example same input data as taken in fig 2 a is fuzzified by using different membership functions for i t h component s λ i and τ i and shown in fig 2 b in view of these facts and removing limitations in flt and tbflt techniques komal 2016a introduced gflt technique which applies different membership functions for computing various fuzzy reliability parameters of a pmu in wide area measurement and control systems aminifar et al 2010 the calculation process in gflt is same as that of in flt the equations for computing λ and τ of a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged fully in parallel series i e in and or configuration are same as used in flt technique i e eqs 16 19 4 tbgflt technique previous section concludes that the lt method use uncertain crisp data and gives imprecise idea about reliability parameters to move toward preciseness through data quantification flt use quantified data in the form of tfns but gives wide spreads for computed reliability parameters due to the use of α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations table 2 to reduce the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness and accelerating computation process tbflt technique replaced α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operation in flt with t ω based simplified fuzzy number arithmetic operations defined on tfns table 3 in flt and tbflt uncertain data is quantified through tfns only however system experts generally suggest the use of different membership functions this shortcoming is removed by adopting different membership functions in gflt technique along with α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations komal 2016a however gflt provides wide spreads for computed fuzzy reliability parameters at any cut level α due to the use of α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations cheng and mon 1993 so to reduce the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness and quantifying data uncertainty using different membership functions this study applies tbgflt technique komal 2016b in which α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations are used table 4 the procedural steps of tbgflt technique are as followings step 1 collection of system components failure and repair data in this step system components failure rate λ i and repair time τ i data in crisp form is extracted from various sources including historical records reliability databases etc and integrated with system experts step 2 fuzzification of crisp data in second step extracted data is fuzzified using different membership functions which are suggested by system experts and herein given in section 2 1 2 step 3 evaluation of system minimal cut sets the system minimal cut sets are obtained using its fault tree and matrix method liu and chiou 1997 step 4 evaluation of system fuzzy failure rate and repair time expressions using α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 eqs 10 13 are fuzzified for finding λ and τ at cut level α of a subsystem constituted by m n number of components arranged in parallel series i e and or configuration the fuzzified equations are given below with the following definitions 26 λ i α λ i 1 α λ i 3 α x x μ λ i x α 27 τ i α

minimal cut sets obtained by matrix method liu and chiou 1997 and eqs 28 31 system λ s and τ s are computed by applying α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 step 5 evaluation of various reliability parameters using computed system λ s and τ s various reliability parameters such as system mtbf enof availability and reliability table 5 are computed by applying α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 step 6 defuzzification at the end defuzzified values of all the fuzzy reliability parameters are computed using center of gravity cog method because this method consider complete membership function for this conversion and gives more accurate results than other existing methods ross 2004 5 a case study in this section several

system have also been performed 5 1 a brief description of dfsmc system and its fault tree an lng carrier is a tank ship specially designed to transport liquefied natural gas lng to design an lng carrier a propulsion system is very cautiously selected there are several propulsion systems among them the dual fuel steam turbine mechanical propulsion conventional dfsmc is one of the widely used propulsion system due to its low fuel efficiency simple operability and intrinsic safety the schematic diagram of dfsmc system is shown in fig 3 a chang et al 2008 komal et al 2015 the dfsmc system burns the boil off gas bog in boilers to produce high pressure steam which drives the steam turbines connected to the propeller one of the advantage of this type is the ease of handling bog to be capable of burning bog with the liquid fuel simultaneously a reduction gear is placed in between the steam turbine and the propeller when excessive bog is generated the bog is extracted into the boiler and burned to surplus steam that can be condensed by seawater the complete working of dfsmc system can be found in chang et al 2008 and komal et al 2015 papers the dfsmc system of lng carriers has mainly 18 components the interaction between different working components in the system are modeled using fault tree as shown in fig 3 b the failure rate λ i and repair time τ i data for its main

and also tabulated α cut wise in table 7 for α 0 0 1 0 2 1 5 2 4 gflt technique since extracted data has uncertainty due to various practical reasons as already discussed in section 1 so data is to be fuzzified in flt and tbflt techniques data uncertainty is fuzzyfied using tfns only which may not be suitable for some complicated problems also system experts may give suggestions to represent same uncertain data through different fuzzy membership functions so to quantify data uncertainty different fuzzy membership functions have been used in gflt and tbgflt techniques komal 2016a b for

table 7 for α 0 0 1 0 2 1 5 2 5 tbgflt technique the drawback of gflt technique is that it gives vide range of prediction for each reliability parameter at any cut level α due to the use of α cut and interval arithmetic based fuzzy arithmetic operations to reduce the range of prediction for each reliability parameter at any cut level α using different membership functions the system fuzzy reliability has been analysed using tbgflt technique komal 2016b to apply tbgflt technique eqs 32 and 33 are fuzzified using α cut and t ω based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations table 4 the

membership functions are used in the analysis the defuzzified values of all the fuzzy reliability parameters computed by flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt techniques have also been computed using cog method ross 2004 and tabulated in table 10 5 3 long run reliability and availability analyses for analysing the behavior of system fuzzy reliability and availability for long time period t 0 1000 h r s computation have been performed at different α cuts 0 0 5 1 using flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt techniques computed results for system fuzzy reliability and availability have been plotted in fig 5 along with their membership functions at t 400 h r s respectively results conclude that for long run period system reliability continuously decreases while its availability is almost linear after time t 50 h r s again tbgflt reliability and availability curves give consistently reduced ranges of prediction for long run period which is very beneficial for analysts to make more precise and stronger decisions for improving system performance for long run time period 5 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis has also been performed for analysing the effect on system mtbf when values of other reliability parameters are varied in the present study nine combinations of reliability availability and failure rates have been taken komal et al 2015 and their effects on system mtbf are computed for sensitivity analysis the ranges for system repair time and enof are taken from results shown in fig 4 b d computed by flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt techniques respectively at cut level α 0 the ranges of system mtbf for first combination of reliability availability and failure rates have been computed for all the four techniques flt gflt tbflt and tbgflt and shown graphically in fig 6 similar analysis has been done for remaining combinations and the computed ranges of mtbf for all the nine combinations and for all the four techniques are given in table 11 results show that tbflt and tbgflt gives reduced range of prediction of mtbf in comparison to other two techniques for these combinations the computed ranges of mtbf showing a decreasing trend when reliability and availability are fixed and failure rate increases thus it is inferred from the analysis that slight variation in system failure rate may give large variation in its mtbf and consequently in its performance considering above reliability analysis results in the form of plots and tables system maintenance personnel may develop an effective maintenance program for analyzing critical components of the system enhancing its performance by reducing its failure time and by improving its mtbf analysis suggests that for enhancing system performance present operating and environmental conditions of equipments and constituting components should be changed for developing an influential maintenance program as per the need 5 5 ranking of critical components for improving system performance through reduction in its frequency of failures development and execution of effective maintenance program is essential to develop an effective maintenance program it is must to identify the most critical components in the system which need more attention to rank system components as per their critically tanaka et al 1983 introduced a v index for non repairable systems when input data is taken as trapezoidal membership function in present study the existing tanaka et al 1983 approach has been extended for repairable systems when input data is taken as any fuzzy number let q t denote the system top event e g system failure probability in the form of normalized fuzzy number lee 2005 zimmermann 2001 which depends on its constituting components fuzzy failure rates and repair times if system is constituted by n number of repairable components with fuzzy failure rates λ i and fuzzy repair times τ i with different membership functions then the fuzzy probability of system top event system failure in a normalized fuzzy number and given by the following equation 76 q t q t λ 1 λ 2 λ i λ n τ 1 τ 2 τ i τ n q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 where q t q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 q t 4 is a normalized fuzzy number with support pair q t 1 q t 4 for α 0 and height pair q t 2 q t 3 for α 1 lee 2005 zimmerman 2004 let q t i be the fuzzy probability of system top event system failure after preventing its i t h component failures by taking λ i 0 then the value of q t i is given by the following equation 77 q t i p t λ 1 λ 2 0 λ n τ 1 τ 2 τ i τ n q t i 1 q t i 2 q t i 3 q t i 4 where q t i q t i 1 q t i 2 q t i 3 q t i

the amount of improving in system top event by eliminating its i t h component failures if v q t q t i v q t q t j then elimination of system i t h component failure is more effective than its j t h component failure elimination the v index values for all the components of the system have been computed by considering q t 0 000259 0 000277 0 000277 0 000294 which is the failure probability of the system computed by tbgflt technique and shown in fig 4 a the computed values of v index for all the system components have been tabulated in table 12 and based on their values in decreasing order they are ranked from table 12 it can be observed that pump and process control valve i are the most and least critical components of the system respectively for improving dfsmc system performance expert

operations for computation various reliability parameters of the system on comparing the computed results in fig 4 it is observed that tbgflt reduces range of prediction for each fuzzy reliability parameter at any confidence level degree of membership α which is helpful in developing effective maintenance plans for improving system performance defuzzified values of all the fuzzy reliability parameters are computed using cog method to understand the behavior of the system sensitivity long run fuzzy reliability and availability analyses are very helpful for designing and executing suitable maintenance plans to enhance the system performance ranking of system critical components has been done using extended tanaka el al s approach based on results it is concluded that to enhance the performance of the system pump and process control valve i are the most and least critical components in the system respectively for improving dfsmc system performance expert may give their preference on the components as per their rank using computed results presented in the form of figures and tables system maintenance personnel may design suitable action plan for enhancing system performance by improving its mtbf it is inferred from the whole analysis that the presented tbgflt approach is more realistic flexible incorporates various kinds of data uncertainty and gives fitter decision values

23498,the cost of offshore wind turbine substructures has a significant impact on competitiveness of the wind energy market and is affected by conservative safety margins adopted in the design phase this implies that an accurate design load prediction especially of those resulting in fatigue damage accumulation may help achieve more cost effective solutions in this article the impact of turbulence and wave loads on fatigue reliability of pile foundations is investigated for a 5 mw offshore wind turbine loads obtained by varying turbulence percentiles are compared with those obtained from the full joint probability distribution of wind speed and turbulence through monte carlo mc simulations and from the equivalent turbulence level currently adopted by iec standards the analyses demonstrate that a lower equivalent turbulence percentile leads to a more realistic and less conservative estimation of fatigue loads subsequently the research focuses on studying the effects of uncertain marine environments on the fatigue load distribution showing that the latter is insensitive to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to the wave kinematic model a comparison between nonlinear and linear waves clearly suggests that hydrodynamic forces depend significantly on the kinematic model adopted and the operational conditions of the turbine furthermore a term is derived to correct the error introduced by wheeler stretching at finite water depths the respective model uncertainties that originate from the nonlinear irregular wave model and wheeler correction are quantified and employed in a reliability analysis in a case study the results are finally compared in terms of estimated probability of failure with the aim to quantify the influence of environmental models on monopile reliability keywords offshore wind turbine monopile foundation turbulence nonlinear waves model uncertainty fatigue reliability 1 introduction wind is an affordable and sustainable source energy which represents a strong alternative to traditional methods of energy production over the recent years the offshore wind industry has seen considerable growth thanks to a greater exploitation of wind resources located far from the shore in addition to other important advantages compared to onshore sites l petersen et al however offshore wind turbines are constantly exposed to significant loads due to highly fluctuating environment the profitability of a wind farm depends substantially on the cost associated with material construction and installation of the substructures and these costs may rise significantly as the industry moves towards larger turbines bhattacharya thus the probability of failure typically expressed over a period of one year provides an indication of the investment needed to perform the mentioned activities successfully this quantity measures the structural safety level ensured by applying design factors to compensate for uncertainties hence it is evident that more accurate predictions of operational loads and improved knowledge of the physical parameters governing the structural reliability are of paramount importance in balancing the economic aspects against safety standards hahn 1999 the wind turbine international design standards iec 61400 1 describe how to use a simplified equivalent wind conditions for the assessment of the design loads for each wind turbine components for turbulence intensity a characteristic value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the lognormal distribution is required this definition is based on experimental work by frandsen 2007 on blade loads which describes the effective turbulence as a design quantity resulting in the same fatigue damage as the random variable sørensen et al 2008 quantified the model uncertainty that originates by applying this formulation and compared the results in terms of reliability in the presence of wind farm wakes the study concluded that the model describes satisfactorily the random wind speed fluctuations in more recent work carried out by toft et al 2016 it was found that for pile foundations in free ambient turbulent flow a lower characteristic value may lead to more realistic and less conservative lifetime fatigue loads in the same work it was found that for blade root flapwise bending moments results varied significantly from site to site thus turbulence being the main fatigue driver its equivalent values need careful evaluation based on site specific load assessment in order to avoid overly conservative estimations besides loads from the rotor wave loads are significant contributors to the design of offshore substructures the current practice recommend the assessment of wave loads to be performed based on simulated linear irregular waves generated from conventional spectra typically pierson moskovitz pm or jonswap the linear wave theory is built on the hypothesis of small perturbation of the mean sea level msl from which the potential flow is derived satisfying the normal boundary conditions journée and massie 2000 along with linear waves stretching methods are usually employed among which the most popular is wheeler wheeleret al 1969 which is used to extend the validity of the linear theory to water particles above the msl for several decades the linear theory has been successfully applied for predicting wave forces acting on offshore platforms the latter are often located at very deep waters where the wave kinematic are well approximated by the linear theory moan et al 2007 however most onshore wind turbines supported by pile foundations are sited in medium shallow waters 1 1 the majority of european offshore sites located between 5 and 30 m 74 of the total number installed on monopiles with an average water depth of 22 m arapogianni et al 2013 where nonlinear effects are commonly encountered due to high steepness cf veldkamp veldkamp and van der tempel 2005 ocean waves are by nature non gaussian stochastic processes natarajan 2014 dnv gl design guidelines for offshore wind turbines dnv suggest a fifth order stokes wave theory as an alternative to the linear model which is only suitable for deep waters fully nonlinear models cf schløer et al 2016 although accurate are computationally very expensive and therefore not desirable for offshore industrial applications for this reason the model that has received the most attention so far is the one developed by sharma and dean sharma 1980 based on a second order expansion of the potential flow at finite water depths using this model several studies have provided evidence that nonlinearities have an influence on loads of the substructure in a study conducted by agarwal and manuel 2011 it was argued that the load difference is primarily due to the higher energy content present in the spectrum of nonlinear waves compared to that of conventional waves which may affect the overall dynamic response consequently long term fatigue damage is also influenced as demonstrated by michael et al van der meulen et al 2012 and veldkamp et al veldkamp and van der tempel 2005 in more practical terms marino et al 2013 argued that nonlinearities may alter the load significantly when the contribution from aerodynamic damping is absent this occurs during standstill and in the side to side ss dynamic response of the turbine during normal power production in these cases the main source of excitation for the substructure is from direct longitudinal waves wave directional spreading and wind wave misalignment which is also discussed in for instance in kim and natarajan 2013 standstill or idling occur because of unplanned downtime normal shut down due to maintenance wind speed outside the operational range e g storm or no power requirement some statistics from uk offshore sites feng et al 2010 reported that the typical availability of an offshore turbine may range between 60 and 95 since the assessment of lifetime fatigue damage is strongly dependent on the turbine availability as discussed by ziegler et al ziegler and muskulus 2016 loads during standstill and idling need careful evaluation especially in cases where significant resonance phenomena may occur however from an operational perspective it is of interest to quantify what is the impact of different environmental models on reliability and fatigue lifetime of monopiles with respect to idling and operational conditions of the wind turbine therefore the purpose of this research is to analyse the variation of structural loads by considering modified equivalent turbulence levels in free ambient flow wind farm wakes and the effect of different wave kinematic models the influence of the latter is quantified based on a lower order wind turbine structure with coupled interaction of morison forces rotor forces and structural response subsequently first and second order statistics of the wave model uncertainties are used in the fatigue reliability analysis the damage model used is based on palmgren miner s cumulative law and bilinear sn curve as recommended in relevant standard practice dnv for the reliability analysis as well as load estimation time domain aeroelastic simulations are employed this work has the aim to evaluate and reduce the uncertainty in wind turbine damage equivalent loads and enhance lifespan assessment of offshore pile foundations the remainder for this article is as follows the first section analyses the influence of varying turbulence levels in terms of fatigue loads under free ambient and wake conditions subsequently wheeler correction and the sensitivity of fatigue loads to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients are studied in the next section a second order wave model is benchmarked against the linear wave theory combined with wheeler stretching to evaluate their model uncertainty finally a reliability analysis is performed combining different turbulence levels and wave models 2 site and model description 2 1 wind and wave statistics the 10 min hub height mean wind speed distribution used corresponds to a

al 2009 is considered as installed on a monopile located at 20 m water depth in an elastic stiff sand soil the monopile was configured so that the natural frequencies would correspond to the ones obtained in the reference project oc3 phase ii jonkman and musial 2010 in order to avoid structural resonances the first natural frequency corresponding to the fore aft fa mode is f 0 0 237 hz the soil is modelled by nonlinear springs distributed along the soil portion of the pile the soil stiffness is based on p y curve as recommended by the american petroleum institute rp2a lrfd numerical simulations are performed using the commercially available fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic code hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 see table 2 the load cases considered in this work are summarized in table 3 dlc 1 2 b and 6 4 are used for the reliability analysis while dlc 1 2 a is used for mc simulations according to the dlc definition in the iec 61400 3 loads from ocean currents are not considered unless clearly specified the simulation time assumed is t s 600 s initial simulation transients were removed from the analysis by computing time series over 720 s and discarding the initial 120 s since the study aims at fatigue loads and fatigue damage assessments normal sea state nss and normal turbulence model ntm are used these conditions prevail throughout the turbine lifetime the estimated 1 hz damage equivalent load del is used as measure quantity throughout the analyses defined as 5 l u 1 n e q i 1 n δ l i m n i 1 m where l is the del defined over 600 s n e q the equivalent number of cycles δ l i and n i are respectively load range and associated number of cycles n is the total number of rainflow counted load ranges linear sn curve is adopted for structural steel with a wöhler exponent m 4 the results from the aeroelastic simulations are expressed in terms of accumulated equivalent load l l computed by eq 6 6 l l i f e j 1 n u μ l u j m p u j 1 m where n u the number of discrete wind speeds μ l u j is the del averaged over a certain number of seeds per mean wind speed u j and p u j its probability of occurrence 3 turbulence induced fatigue loads this section shows a comparative study in terms of fatigue equivalence between different characteristic values of the turbulence intensity the scope ot the analysis is to define a turbulence level which results in the same fatigue load as that obtained from the random turbulence this is achieved by first deriving an equivalent turbulence intensity by pure analytical considerations based on simplified assumptions see a the analytical approach consists of an extension to the monopile of the idea presented in frandsen 2007 where the wind turbine structure is reduced to an upright cantilever beam with a lumped mass at the tower top to model the rotor nacelle assembly mass and loaded by a dynamic thrust load the simplified formulation shows that the monopile fatigue del is proportional to the standard deviation of the wind velocity at a given mean wind speed and wöhler exponent subsequently the effective turbulence level predicted by the simplified approach is compared with the results obtained by numerical simulations using the aeroelastic wind turbine model the probabilistic approach considers the full joint probability distribution of mean wind speed and turbulence f u σ u as alternative to an equivalent turbulence furthermore in order to focus on turbulence loads the effect of wave loads is neglected for this analysis 3 1 free ambient turbulence under the approximated hypothesis of linearity between turbulence intensity and monopile fatigue loads troldborg et al 2014 the analytical formulation of the equivalent turbulence intensity i e can be adopted as 7 i e m i m f i u d i where i indicates the random variable the integral in eq 7 is solved numerically assuming a log normal distribution for f σ u u as per eq 2 for the turbulence class here adopted fig 2 a displays a comparison between effective turbulence intensity eq 7 and different turbulence percentiles using the formulation defined by iec eq 2 it is shown that for steel m 4 the effective turbulence is closer to the 60th percentile defined by iec to demonstrate the validity of the values predicted by eq 7 a numerical case is set up where 5 sets of aeroelastic simulations are performed adopting a constant turbulence level for each case varying between the 90th and the 50th percentile with a step of ten the turbulence percentiles are defined based on the distribution in eq 2 the dels obtained are averaged over 6 turbulence seeds for each mean wind speed in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty following the recommendations given by iec iec 61400 1 from the definition of the effective turbulence these results are compared against 2000 mc simulations where random samples are drawn from the joint probability distribution f u σ u the design load case dlc 1 2 a is considered table 3 in fig 1 only loads corresponding to the 60th and 90th percentiles are displayed the 60th percentile is the closest to the results provided by the crude mc approach in terms of fatigue equivalence as seen from table 4 the 90th percentile defined by iec shows conservative results for the pile foundation where the accumulated del is increased by 13 in the fa direction and 11 in the ss direction a lower turbulence level is also observed for the blade root bending moment which is an agreement with some of the findings in toft et al 2016 where a significant variability for this response is encountered at different site conditions for the blade root the fatigue load coming from the 90th percentile is slightly more conservative by 6 in this study for the monopile the lower fatigue equivalent percentile found here is directly used as characteristic value of the free ambient turbulence σ ˆ c where an additional contribution from wind farm wakes has to be considered 3 2 contribution from farm wakes in order to quantify the effect of wakes a case study is performed based on the formulation described in the amendment of iec standards iec 2005 wake generated turbulence increases the overall turbulence level these are taken into account for fatigue calculations as combination of free ambient and farm wake turbulence in operational conditions eq 8 8 σ e 1 n t p w σ ˆ

standard deviation at the hub height sørensen et al 2008 expressed as 9 σ ˆ w u 2 1 5 0 8 d c t u 2 σ ˆ c 2 where c t u is the thrust coefficient known as function of the mean wind speed in case of a pitch regulated variable speed turbine table 5 shows the normalized accumulated del computed using the 60th percentile characteristic turbulence with respect to 90th percentile currently used the results are averaged over 6 turbulence seeds for each wind speed bin in the operational range with step of 2 m s two cases with n t 2 and case n t 6 are analysed using the 60th turbulence percentile leads lower accumulated dels by approximately 10 in the fa direction and 5 in the ss direction as expected the fa bending moment is more affected by the reduction being mainly governed by longitudinal turbulence fig 2b shows that the difference between the 90th and 60th percentiles decreases as the number of neighbouring turbines increases this confirms that in the presence of strong wakes the ambient turbulence effect vanishes fig 3 displays examples of monopile fa bending moment from aeroelastic simulations adopting different turbulence levels below and above rated wind speed the ss bending moment is only slightly affected by the number of neighbouring turbines 4 wheeler correction at finite water depths according to the linear superposition principle ocean waves can be approximated as a sum of regular sinusoidal harmonics and random phase to form an irregular wave journée and massie 2000 the empirical relation introduced by wheeler to extend the kinematic above the mean sea level introduces a mathematical error at finite water depth which is herein derived in the equations below a regular unimodal wave is considered under the hypothesis of small wave amplitudes η x t the field equation in the two dimensional case is described by eq 10 reported here for the sake of clarity 10 2 ϕ 0 i n ω ϕ z 0 o n γ 1 ϕ t 1 2 u 2 w 2 p g g z c o n γ 2 where ω is the field domain γ 1 is the sea bottom at a water depth z h γ 2 is the wave surface and u and w the horizontal and vertical particle velocity respectively the quantity p is the atmospheric pressure and c is a constant from eq 10 the solution of the laplace equation is the potential flow for the velocity field for finite water depths which satisfies the free kinematic boundary conditions cauchy poisson journée and massie 2000 11 ϕ x z t η a k ω cosh k h z sinh k h sin k x ω t where η a h 2 is the wave amplitude with h being the linear wave height the stretching consists in replacing the physical vertical coordinate z in z as 12 z h h z h η h h z 0 h z η introducing eq 12 into eq 11 the residual term of the laplace equation can be computed as 13 2 ϕ w k α 2 1 ϕ w where it has been indicated with 14 α h h η the residual term in eq 13 vanishes as the water depth increases meaning that no error is present at infinite water depths thus at finite water depths a correction can be introduced on

verified that the new potential function satisfies the two dimensional field equation as 16 2 ϕ ˆ w 0 it is worth noting that for h the following relations are valid 17 k h h z h η k h α 1 to quantify the deviation in particle velocity from wheeler stretching the new kinematics are derived from the corrected potential flow expressed by eq 15 leading to the linear velocity and acceleration in the

numerical example displayed in fig 4 a shows a velocity profile of a unimodal wave assuming a period t w 8 s a water depth h 20 m and a wave height η a varying in the interval 0 3 m as displayed in fig 4a the correction in the potential function leads to lower velocities for positive wave heights fig 4 furthermore the deviation increases with the wave height in the following discussions and figures this model will be referred to as wheeler correction it is important to remark that this derivation has the aim to only quantify the effects of satisfying the laplace equation at finite water depths since it is not based on any experimental work the approach has not been validated and it is not certain that it will necessarily lead to more accurate load predictions 5 uncertainty of drag and inertia coefficients the sensitivity of del due to wave forces during normal operation is analysed in this section in order to quantify the effect of random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients employed to compute wave forces the empirical formulation introduced by morison morison et al 1950 is by far the most common way of predicting unidirectional wave load acting on an immerse slender body in an unsteady flow in this case the monopile being a hollow cylinder as described in dnv above the range defined as the limit d m λ 0 2 where d m is the pile diameter and λ the wave length the pile affects the wave flow leading to wave diffraction phenomena this can be taken into account by the maccamyfuchs correction on the inertia coefficient c m other environmental factors are responsible for a variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients marine growth for instance which is a biological accumulation of microorganisms and algea on wetted surfaces results in increased of inertia and drag forces as a consequence of increased surface roughness and cross section area shi et al 2012 in fact roughness due to marine growth modifies the transition laminar to turbulent flow at lower reynold s numbers resulting in increased drag in consequence of the natural variability of the oceanic environment the validity of the morison equation may not always be respected in structural reliability the uncertainty on the hydrodynamic forces exerted on a pile foundation turns into a load variation due to wave structure interaction for computing loads on the substructure inertia and drag coefficients can be treated as normally distributed random variables chosen here as c m n μ m σ m 1 9 0 1 and c d n μ d σ d 0 9 0 1 with μ and σ being respectively their mean and standard deviation although higher values of the uncertainty in the hydrodynamic coefficients can be found in practice values provided in literature for fatigue analyses were used veldkamp burrows et al 1997 thus two parallel studies are performed respectively considering the hydrodynamic coefficients as random and deterministic variables the latter corresponding to their mean values under normal operating conditions the load case dlc 1 2 b is used a set of 2000 randomly sampled environmental conditions from eq 3 are used as input parameters to aeroelastic simulations waves are modelled as irregular linear random waves and wheeler stretching a side analysis is performed to quantify the statistical impact of wave forces on the del by only including wind forces thus in order to show the influence of the wave load on the ss direction wave directional spreading is included in this analysis along with a wave misalignment of 10 deg results are displayed in fig 5 in terms of probability distributions of the mudline bending moments as shown in fig 5 the wave force increases the mode of the del distribution by nearly 20 of the total fatigue loads in the fa direction and 28 in the ss direction as summarized in table 6 the values are normalized with respect to the bending moments in the corresponding direction of the deterministic case in fig 5 the smoothing was obtained by kernel density estimator sheather and jones 1991 as it can be inferred the distribution of the del in both ss and fa directions is insensitive to the uncertainty introduced on the hydrodynamic coefficients a slight increase of 2 and 4 respectively are encountered as seen from table 6 although this small variation their deterministic expected values can be conveniently adopted without significant impact however larger uncertainties if present in the hydrodynamic coefficients than the ones considered in this study may have larger impact on fatigue loads the analysis also shows the statistical contribution of wave loads the latter increase the mean del compared to the case where only wind excitation is present the difference displayed in fig 5 between wind only and combined wind wave excitation has to be interpreted qualitatively since wind and wave forces are coupled with the dynamic response of the structure and their effect cannot in principle be studied separately 6 damage model 6 1 cumulative damage for the assessment of fatigue damage a linear cumulative law based sn curve and palmgren miner s method is used the sn curve is a relationship between number of stress cycles to failure and the associated stress amplitude the expected short term cumulative damage d s u can be expressed in the integral and discrete forms as 21 d s n a 0 δ σ u m f δ σ d σ i n δ σ n i a i δ σ u i m where n δ σ is the total number of cycles experienced during the simulation time t s l o g a the intercept of the sn curve and f δ σ u the stress ranges distribution conditional on the mean wind speed obtained from rainflow counting in literature as for instance in sørensen et al 2008 and nejad et al 2014 there are several formulations assuming a closed form of the integral in eq 21 this is in practice accomplished by assuming a model for the stress range distribution f δ σ typically two parameters weibull distribution here the long term expected damage d is obtained by palmgren miner s rule by integrating the short term damage conditional to the mean wind speed over the long term mean wind speed distribution f u for offshore substructures the full sea and wind state has to be considered through the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables f u h s t p σ u however in this work only discrete states are considered for fatigue damage which means that the environmental variables are all conditional to the mean wind speed u 6 2 fatigue reliability fatigue life of a structural component is the time spent under ordinary loading conditions necessary to initiate a physical crack which would result in a loss of ultimate fatigue strength of the member the fatigue damage limit state function g x can be formulated according to the sn approach where x x 1 x 2 x n is a collection of random variables in the load and resistance model the condition g x 0 indicates a failure occurrence in this work the cumulative damage during operation and standstill is considered indicated respectively as d o p and d s s 22 g x δ d o p x o p d s t x s t the turbine lifetime is taken as reference period for computing the cumulative damage by means of eq 33 in case of offshore turbines the service life is set to t l i f e 25 years which comprises a contribution to damage from operational conditions computed through dlc 1 2 b and from idling computed through dlc 6 4 see table 3 in eq 22 the term δ represents the failure limit modelled as a stochastic variable associated with miner s rule i e the degree of uncertainty in predicting variable amplitude fatigue loads usually conducted from constant amplitude tests the vector x denotes the set of uncertainties considered once the limit state function is known explicitly through eq 22 the probability of failure p f is defined as 23 p ˆ f p g x 0 g x 0 f x x d x where f x x is the joint probability density function of the random variables x from reliability theory the estimated generalised reliability index β ˆ simply indicated as β is linked to the estimated probability of failure p ˆ f as 24 β φ 1 p ˆ f where φ is the standard normal probability distribution function given the complexity of the limit state function g x the integral in eq 24 is calculated through first order reliability method form followed by re evaluation with importance sampling is based on a gaussian sampling distribution dimitrov et al 2013 the form method assumes a linear safety margin which in some cases may lead to inaccurate estimation of the reliability index on the other hand form is an efficient way to find the most likely failure point importance sampling centered at the design point x d determined by a form analysis can serve as verification and improvement of the form results since is as most simulation methods is not strongly affected by nonlinearity in the safety margin this technique was more computationally efficient than crude mc simulations as confirmed by preliminary attempts 6 3 uncertainties a review of the major uncertainties typically considered in reliability of offshore structures can be found in hahn 1999 sørensen et al 2008 dnv tarp johansen 2003 rangel ramírez and sørensen 2012 the uncertainties considered contain a statistical uncertainty related to wind and wave climate assessment x s t model uncertainty in the simulation of the dynamic response x d y n blade aerodynamic model x a e r o wake turbulence model x w k and stress calculation from finite elements models or others x s t r an uncertainty is also considered to account for the limited simulation time x s i m representative for the entire lifetime numerical values of the aforementioned quantities are retrieved from available literature and listed in table 8 an additional contribution is introduced to model the uncertainty associated with the wave kinematic model adopted these are specified for standstill and operational condition separately respectively indicated as x h s s x h o p the cumulative damage is a nonlinear function of these quantities because the uncertainties are applied to the respective parameters on which they produce effect 7 wave induced fatigue loads 7 1 wave kinematic models the surface elevation process η t of a long crested unidirectional sea wave can be expressed as linear superposition 25 η x z t i 1 n a i ω i cos k i x ω i t ε i where the input parameters are the wave amplitude a i ω i the spectral frequency ω i the wave number k i and the random phase ε i three different wave kinematic models are compared eq 26 expresses the horizontal particle velocity field derived from eq 25 where wheeler stretching is applied the second order non linear wave kinematic model applied here is described natarajan 2014 the nonlinear horizontal velocity field u n l is expressed by eq 27 furthermore a third kinematic model uses velocity and acceleration obtained by the generation of linear random waves corrected by the factor derived in section 4 as u ˆ l t α u l t 26 u l x z t i 1 n a i ω i cosh k i h h z h η sinh k i h cos k i x ω i t ε i j 27 u n l x z t i 1 n a i ω i cosh k i z h sinh k i h cos k i x ω i t i 1 n j 1 n b i j z cos k i j x ω i j t ε i j b i j z cos k i j x ω i j t ε i j likewise the expressions for the horizontal acceleration and kinematics in the vertical direction can be written the second order transfer functions b i j z b i j z c i j z c i j z rearranged in eq 27 are function of wave amplitude frequency wave number water depth and vertical coordinate their explicit formulation is reported for instance in agarwal and manuel 2011 the second order expansion is evaluated at i j the superscripts and refer to a summation or difference between frequencies 7 2 assessment of the wave model uncertainty this analysis has the aim to quantify the model uncertainties in fatigue loads associated with the wave kinematic model adopted model uncertainties are epistemic and originate from imperfect knowledge or idealizations of the mathematical formulation used to predict a natural process in other words it is a measure of the ability of a mathematical model to reproduce a natural phenomena for example ambühl et al 2015 explicitly expressed this bias by evaluating the performance of different mathematical models against real wave measurements in this work due to absence of measurements the second order wave kinematic model and wheeler correction at finite water depth are compared against the linear wave model in eq 26 the load variation is then expressed as a relative ratio x h between the equivalent stress σ ψ e q computed from the different wave kinematic models and from the linear wave model σ ψ e q as in eq 28 the equivalent stress is defined similarly to eq 5 considering stress time series instead of loads 28 x h σ ψ e q σ ψ e q the nominal stress parametrised with respect to the radial position on a specific section of the monopile ψ is expressed by eq 29 given the monopile geometry and dimensions the stress can be well approximated by a longitudinal membrane stress as defined by dnv gl as the contribution from the vertical force is neglected due to of its small load range which does not contribute to fatigue it is assumed that shear stresses are also negligible 29 σ ψ t m x t i r sin ψ m y t i r cos ψ in eq 29 r 3 m is the medium radius of the monopile and i 4 12 m4 the area and the area moment of inertia of the circular hollow section in eq 29 the dependency from the environmental parameters is omitted the first two statistical moments of x h provide a measure of the relative model uncertainty table 7 shows the discrete set of environmental parameters to compare the wave kinematic models only the states s 3 to s 12 are used due to data availability the states s 1 and s 2 will be used in the next section and reported here for completeness the probability of occurrence is taken according to the wind speed weibull distribution in the range 7 25 m s with step of 2 m s resulting in 10 discrete states the turbulence level as expressed by eq 1 is used the hydrodynamic load acting on the substructure is computed by the morison formula with coupled wave structure interaction as 30 f t 1 2 ρ c d d m u t q t u t q t π d m 2 4 ρ c m u t π d 2 4 ρ c m 1 q t where f t is the wave force per unit length c m and c d are respectively inertia and drag coefficients d m the monopile diameter ρ the water mass density and q denotes the structural displacement in the fa direction due to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients not significantly affecting the load distribution in the long term c m and c d are considered constant the load case dlc 6 4 defined by iec design standards for offshore turbines iec 61400 3 concerns fatigue analysis during idling according to the description resonant loading of the substructure from wave excitation has to be taken into account assuming nss and wave misalignment in this analysis a wave misalignment of 10 deg is considered resonance effects are caused by the wave spectral energy typically concentrated in a frequency band close to the first natural frequencies of the turbine fa ss damping is an important player for fatigue several experimental studies on offshore turbines have shown the variation of the additional damping provided by the rotor in koukoura et al 2015 this value was found to be approximately 12 in idling in the fa direction while when the turbine is operating it may rise up to 60 logarithmic decrement although aerodynamic damping represents a large portion of the total damping in operation this latter is a sum of additional contributions given by soil hydrodynamic interaction structure and controller hereby two different states of the turbine are analysed namely idling or standstill and normal operation the flow chart in fig 7 explains the procedure to estimate the model uncertainty of the wave forces associated with the defined wind turbine states 7 3 lower order turbine model in order to specify x h a set of nonlinear waves based on the second order kinematic model is generated using the statistical parameters listed in table 7 since the aim of the analysis is to quantify the wave kinematic model uncertainty the effect of other uncertainties must be neglected these include aerodynamic interaction structural model rotor excitation controller unit and soil model for this reason a lower order three dimensional numerical model of a wind turbine structure is set up where the rotor nacelle assembly is replaced by a lumped mass at the tower top m t o p and a bottom fixed monopile the portion of soil pile is calibrated in length to match the first natural frequency of the areroelastic model the latter being f 0 0 237 hz in both fa and ss directions apparent fixity the system is modelled with timoshenko beam elements friswell 2010 this set up ensures coherence with the dynamic response of the full aeroelastic model 7 4 standstill loads first an analysis is performed on the full aeroelastic and equivalent model in idling conditions where only hydrodynamic forces are exerted on the structures given the negligible contribution of the wind force acting on the system these are applied in the two directions x and y according to the misalignment applied a logarithmic decrement damping δ s s 7 is considered representative for standstill because the turbine is not operating the damping can be assumed constant for all the environmental states defined in table 7 in both systems a stiffness proportional rayleigh damping matrix c α k is tuned by varying the structural damping of the support structure and then computing the analytical logarithmic decrement as ratio between real and imaginary part of the eigenvalue λ as 31 δ 2 π ℛ λ i λ this value includes contributions from soil and structure damping a comparison of the response in time domain of the two systems in standstill is displayed in fig 8 7 5 operational loads to quantify the hydrodynamic load variation during operation an estimate of the aerodynamic damping at different mean wind speeds is needed see fig 9 this is accomplished by computing the logarithmic decrement damping δ o p of the tower top acceleration to a small perturbation of a constant mean wind speed using the full aeroelastic model no turbulence and waves are applied the resulting free decay response is used to estimate the logarithmic decrement and damping ratio as indicated in eq 32 this procedure provides an engineering estimate of the damping available during normal power production see e g tempel 2006 fig 12 displays the damping ratio estimated by this procedure 32 δ 1 n log p 0 p n ζ 1 1 2 π δ 2 in eq 32 p 0 is the first peak response while p n is the peak response after n periods subsequently the estimated aerodynamic damping in the fa direction is used as input to the simplified system as additional contribution applied at the tower top mass as shown in fig 6 and modelled with an internal viscous damper the damping coefficient is found as c 2 ζ k m where m and k are respectively modal mass and modal stiffness of the considered modes in the fa and ss directions thus the aerodynamic forces applied on the simplified model are the tower top bending moments in the two directions x and y the thrust force and the horizontal force in the y direction the hydrodynamic forces are applied as in the standstill case all these components are extracted from aeroelastic simulations using the full model the thrust force was obtained from an aeroelastic model with stiff tower and rotor in order to eliminate the wind structure interaction fig 8 shows the good agreement between the structural response of the simplified and the full aeroelastic model a better match is seen for standstill conditions than in operation this is not surprising because the structural response in operation is influenced by the controller which is absent in the simplified model fig 10 shows an example of transient load in standstill and operation where the load difference can be visually perceived as it can be inferred nonlinear waves result in higher structural loads and become more important at low damping values their effect almost vanishes when the response is sufficiently damped by aerodynamic contributions fig 13 as also found for instance in marino et al 2013 this means that modelling nonlinear waves is important for standstill or idling conditions where resonances due to nonlinear interaction phenomena between waves and structure occur the high load difference captured in fig 10 between 420 and 440 s is due to different wave used seed between linear and nonlinear waves the wheeler correction at finite water depth slightly decreases the load as displayed in fig 13 note that at 20 m water depth this becomes visible but not significant fig 11 the mudline fa and ss bending moments obtained from the input parameters listed in table 7 have a duration of approximately 1 h due to this the load variation statistics were determined by windowing with a sliding period of 10 min starting from every third minute this resulted in 18 time series for each state the ratio x h defined in eq 28 is then computed in the two directions using a bilinear sn curve see table 8 coherently the same set of input data is used to calculate the load variation when finite water depth correction is applied statistics are reported in table 8 fig 13a and b displays the wave model uncertainty as function of the mean wind speed compute at an angular point ψ π 4 r a d when nonlinear waves are modelled the ratio x h shows a positive trend with the mean wind speed in operational conditions moreover the figures highlight the variation in fatigue loads in the two states considered in standstill the equivalent stress variation can reach 30 to 40 at high wind speeds while in operation this effect is clearly attenuated by high damping to 10 to 20 because the ratio x h shows a slightly decreasing trend when the correction at finite water depth is applied its dependence on the mean wind speed is considered constant in the reliability analysis table 9 shows the statistics determined based on the results discussed above where a linear fit is performed to obtain the trend only one single value of the standard deviation is adopted corresponding to the mean value of the standard deviations computed at each mean wind speed the wave model uncertainties are all assumed log normally distributed 8 stochastic model for fatigue reliability the load variation coefficients obtained from different wave kinematic models and the different equivalent turbulence level in wake conditions are employed in the lifetime reliability analysis the cumulative damage combines the contributions of the design load cases dlc 1 2 b and 6 4 with reference to table 3 respectively operation and standstill idling conditions table 8 describes the stochastic model the mechanical properties of the monopile steel are defined in veritas which provide a variety of cases corresponding to different marine exposures in this example a bilinear sn curve in seawater with cathodic protection for butt welded elements is selected in table 9 the coefficients a 0 01 b 0 02 and c 0 87 are obtained from fig 13 the expression of the cumulative damage as function of wave misalignment φ wind direction θ mean wind speed u the radial angle ψ random variables x and time t can be readily expressed as 33 d ψ t x t t s i 1 n u j 1 n θ k 1 n φ d s u i θ j φ k x o p p u i θ j p φ k t t s i 1 n u j 1 n θ k 1 n φ d s u i θ j φ k x s s p u i θ j p φ k where t is taken at one year steps the random variables are specified in operational and standstill conditions as 34 x o p x s t x d y n x a e r o x w k x s i m x s t r x h o p x s s x s t x d y n x s i m x s t r x h s s note that in standstill the uncertainty due to wakes and aerodynamic computations are not considered since wind loads do not significantly affect fatigue when the turbine is not operating to account for the difference between the wave model uncertainty it is assumed that x h o p and x h s s are average multiplicative factors reflecting the load variation when different kinematic models than the linear model are used with this in mind the damage is computed by eq 21 where the following transformation is applied 35 δ σ x h δ σ by noting that 36 d σ e q m where δ σ is the stress range when wave model uncertainties are applied and δ σ is the stress range resulting from linear waves the mechanical stress is computed at an angular point ψ π 4 rad of the most fatigue loaded section which turned out to be located 7 m below the mudline the model uncertainties derived at the mudline section are valid at every vertical station along the monopile height which is a deterministic geometrical dimension the reference period t is thus partitioned into the two periods t t s s t o p it is assumed that the annual turbine availability is 92 for simplicity the frequency of occurrence of the mean wind speed is assumed to be the same for both standstill and operation in this particular case although without compromising the validity of the results standstill conditions are simulated with rotor blades pitched at 82 deg and the rotor let free to rotate according to the local hot spot model a stress concentration factor s c f 1 is adopted as suggested by dnv in case of no change of thickness and no imperfections as a consequence an uncertainty due to scfs was not included in the stochastic model thickness correction for the stress distribution is applied as recommended in veritas in total 8 wind directions are considered and for each wind direction 3 cases of wave misalignment are modelled being respectively φ 10 0 10 deg with respective probability of occurrence p φ 0 25 0 5 0 25 a uniform wind direction probability p θ w is considered in order keep the numerical case more general although realistic indicating with m x and m y the bending moments at each wind direction the fa and ss bending moments can found as 37 m x t θ w m x t cos θ w m y t sin θ w m y t θ w m x t sin θ w m y t cos θ w 9 results a study case of a turbine in a wind farm is considered where the number of neighbouring turbines is n t 6 positioned radially with respect to the turbine analysed at a distance of 5 rotor diameters a set 12 discrete environmental states is employed for the estimation of the cumulative damage and their respective frequency of occurrence is shown in table 7 the fatigue damage is computed from numerical simulations using the full aeroelastic model the reliability analysis is performed on a reference period of one year throughout the entire lifetime the reliability index at time t is computed from the cumulative probability of failure p ˆ f t expressed by eq 24 where the number of trials simulated by is ensures convergence on the probability of failure until a c o v 0 02 is reached marelli et al 2017 in order to compare the annual reliability level at the end of life for all the cases studied eq 24 is computed where the annual probability of failure is given by 38 δ p ˆ f t p ˆ f t p ˆ f t δ t 1 p ˆ f t δ t where 1 p ˆ f t is the survival probability at time t rangel ramírez and sørensen 2012 and p ˆ f t is the cumulative probability of failure at time t displayed in fig 14 a today s standards recommend an annual reliability index β 3 3 for offshore substructures corresponding to minor or moderate consequences of failure a preliminary analysis showed that under the loading conditions assumed the structure reaches an annual reliability index at 25 years of β r e f 2 4 in the baseline case calculated by eq 38 which implies that the design requirements at the end of life are not met thus in order to have a safe baseline for comparison a design factor z 1 3 was introduced this parameter is a multiplicative factor of the monopile thickness τ of which the approximated area moment of inertia of a tubular section is a linear variable 39 i π r 3 τ by doing so the annual reliability index calculated by eq 38 in the reference case reaches β r e f 3 45 at 25 years which is considered satisfactory for this case in fig 14 the cumulative probability of failure and reliability index are visualised where the reference case corresponds to the 90 t h percentile of the turbulence and linear waves these results are obtained by running a reliability analysis using eq 33 where t 5 25 years with a step of one year the impact of the environmental models becomes more evident over time because fatigue damage is a cumulative process the results in table 11 show this variation in terms of percentage indicated as χ defined in eq 40 between the end of life annual reliability indices when different models are used against the baseline case in order to quantify the significance between the cases analysed a 5 variation threshold against the baseline case is set note that the reliability values shown in table 10 and fig 14 differ because in fig 14 the cumulative reliability index computed at time t takes into account the survival probability at time t 1 40 χ 100 1 β β r e f as inferred from table 11 not all cases are significantly affecting the reliability when compared to the baseline case nonlinear waves and lower percentile play an opposite effect and their combined case results in a slight variation below the threshold defined also the wheeler correction alone is not significant in this case of 20 m water depth in this latter case it is possible to notice the high impact of the turbulence percentile additionally the importance factors of the random variables are computed from the form analysis showing that the model uncertainties due to the wave kinematic models have less impact compared to the remaining model uncertainties as reported in table 12 this can be explained by the dependency of the wave model uncertainty on the mean wind speed and noting that the most frequent significant wave heights occur in the medium range table 7 according to the wind speed distribution at which the model uncertainties are moderate fig 13 the reported values in table 12 have been computed using 90th turbulence percentile the wave model uncertainties are given as a summation over all the mean wind speeds including standstill and operational conditions 10 discussion although the effect of the investigated environmental models is important on structural loads they are not the primary drivers for fatigue reliability as also confirmed by the analysis of the importance factors in fact the reliability index level seems to be mostly sensitive to the type of damage model used for instance by eliminating the thickness correction defined by dnv gl standard practice the annual reliability at 25 years in the baseline case increases noticeably from β r e f 3 45 to β r e f 3 90 however the meaning of this type of analysis is to provide evidence of the degree of variation of the reliability index under the different factors considered despite the effect not being drastic this is still easily observable for instance the wheeler correction at finite water depth combined with the 60th percentile results in an increased annual reliability index by 15 at 25 and 20 years which corresponds to circa 6 times lower probability of failure compared to the case where nonlinear waves and the 90th percentile are used therefore this confirms that the choice of the environmental models used has an impact on the design as well as the estimation of the remaining life after several years of operation in the industry this procedure still substantially relies on analytical models implemented in aero hydro servo elastic codes due to several impracticalities connected to a direct load measurement throughout the entire service life especially in the foundation as a consequence monitoring the availability and the climate during different operational states is very important for load assessment in cases of deep waters nonlinear effects vanish making it realistic to use linear models the correction to the wheeler stretching formulation is seen to reduce the particle velocities and acceleration in the horizontal direction leading to lower fatigue loads it should be noted that this formulation is not intended to replace the original model but rather only to quantify the effects of satisfying the laplace equation its validity in real applications has not been tested and additional future experimental investigations could be made to prove the validity of this approach the wave model uncertainties generally depend on the joint distribution of the main environmental parameters namely mean wind speed and significant wave height in this work due to lack of wave measurements only mean wind speed was considered as driving parameter instead a wider range of sea states should be considered with their respective probability of occurrence furthermore since most offshore site are located in highly irregular sea bottoms at shallow waters causing breaking phenomena further interesting research may be carried out to quantify their impact on long term loads in general it is important to remark that the reliability assessment is case specific and cannot be represented by one case study only as the one analysed in this paper therefore in order to decide on what type of environmental model to employ it is recommended to perform a careful evaluation of the expected turbine loads in connection to the specific site characteristics and preliminary structural analyses standstill loads and wind farm wakes considered in this analysis contribute considerably to fatigue damage and this could explain the lower reliability level obtained compared to the original design consequently in order to achieve the desired target reliability level in the reference case a design factor was introduced it is important to notice that the right calibration of the design parameter would require a reliability based design optimization which is outside the scope of this work in the reliability analysis the uncertainty in the wöhler exponent has not been considered in connection to this study since fatigue damage is a nonlinear function of the mechanical stress through the wöhler exponent it is expected that its uncertainty would amplify the effect of wave nonlinearities on the monopile loads especially in standstill 11 conclusions this research highlights the importance of modelling turbulence and waves for the assessment of fatigue loads on offshore wind turbine monopiles with respect to the environmental models nonlinear waves correction at finite water depth uncertainty in the hydrodynamic coefficients and turbulence level have been analysed the influence of nonlinear waves is more pronounced during standstill and its effect is conditional to the operational damping and the wind speed distribution the load calculated when correction at finite water depth is applied shows some degree of variation by decreasing the load estimation which is expected to increase at lower water depths uncertainty introduced in the hydrodynamic coefficients does not seem to affect significantly the probability distribution of the equivalent loads on the monopile this has been quantified by numerical mc simulations where uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients were used the importance of estimating a correct equivalent value of the turbulence intensity has been discussed the turbulence level defined by iec standards is in general conservative for the assessment of the monopile fatigue loads in this specific case a 60th percentile was found to be more realistic namely closer to the full mc approach however the influence of the free ambient turbulence decreases in the presence of strong farm wakes for the analysis a realistic case of 6 neighbouring turbines equidistant from the objective one was considered further investigation is needed to quantify how different wind and turbulence classes affect the choice of this parameter in general the fatigue load reduction resulting from the application of lower equivalent turbulence could potentially lead in lighter structures saving material and installation costs on large scales future research should quantify this reduction in practical and economical terms acknowledgements this project has received funding from the european unions horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the marie sklodowska curie grant agreement no 642108 advanced wind energy systems operation and maintenance expertise http awesome h2020 eu appendix a derivation of the linear relationship between turbulence and damage equivalent loads in the following steps previous studies were followed by arani et al troldborg et al 2014 the external force is represented by a thrust t t acting at the tower top denoting by a the rotor area and c t the thrust coefficient the thrust force can be approximated as a 1 t t 1 2 ρ a c t u t 2 where the wind speed u t can be expressed by the sum of a time invariant mean wind speed u and a turbulent term u t the thrust can then be linearised using quasi steady assumptions where the turbulent term u t is considered small a 2 t t 1 2 ρ a c t u u t 2 1 2 ρ a c t u 2 2 u u t according to eq a 2 the second order term of the turbulence u t has been omitted by linear approximation this implies a direct proportionality between the linearised standard deviation of the thrust force σ t and the standard deviation of the wind speed fluctuations given a constant mean wind speed u as a 3 σ t σ u furthermore to simplify the scheme only the first mode corresponding to the fa direction is considered in frequency domain the response spectrum of an output through a linear and time invariant system exited by a random load can be expressed as a 4 s y y ω h ω 2 s u u ω where s y y ω is the spectrum of the response y t h ω is the energy transfer function of the linear structural system and s u u ω spectrum of the excitation the wind field generated by the aeroelastic code used is based on the mann turbulence model larsen and hansen 2007 while dnv gl guidelines dnv suggest a kaimal spectrum the standard deviation of the response σ y is proportional to the standard deviation of the turbulence term σ u at a constant mean wind speed u under certain assumptions the approach can be demonstrated analytically as shown in reference troldborg et al 2014 for a kaimal spectrum a 5 σ y σ u which in turn using eq a 3 implies a direct proportionality between σ y σ t as shown in frandsen 2007 if the response y t can be considered narrow banded where the dominant natural frequency is ω 0 and linear sn curve are assumed the del is also proportional to σ y conditionally on the wöhler exponent and the mean wind speed a 6 l u σ u this relation can also be extended to the mann turbulence model by noting that the latter is built on the kaimal spectrum mann 1998 however since the proportionality is determined by the transfer function which is outside the spectrum the formulation should in principle be valid for any spectrum 
23498,the cost of offshore wind turbine substructures has a significant impact on competitiveness of the wind energy market and is affected by conservative safety margins adopted in the design phase this implies that an accurate design load prediction especially of those resulting in fatigue damage accumulation may help achieve more cost effective solutions in this article the impact of turbulence and wave loads on fatigue reliability of pile foundations is investigated for a 5 mw offshore wind turbine loads obtained by varying turbulence percentiles are compared with those obtained from the full joint probability distribution of wind speed and turbulence through monte carlo mc simulations and from the equivalent turbulence level currently adopted by iec standards the analyses demonstrate that a lower equivalent turbulence percentile leads to a more realistic and less conservative estimation of fatigue loads subsequently the research focuses on studying the effects of uncertain marine environments on the fatigue load distribution showing that the latter is insensitive to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to the wave kinematic model a comparison between nonlinear and linear waves clearly suggests that hydrodynamic forces depend significantly on the kinematic model adopted and the operational conditions of the turbine furthermore a term is derived to correct the error introduced by wheeler stretching at finite water depths the respective model uncertainties that originate from the nonlinear irregular wave model and wheeler correction are quantified and employed in a reliability analysis in a case study the results are finally compared in terms of estimated probability of failure with the aim to quantify the influence of environmental models on monopile reliability keywords offshore wind turbine monopile foundation turbulence nonlinear waves model uncertainty fatigue reliability 1 introduction wind is an affordable and sustainable source energy which represents a strong alternative to traditional methods of energy production over the recent years the offshore wind industry has seen considerable growth thanks to a greater exploitation of wind resources located far from the shore in addition to other important advantages compared to onshore sites l petersen et al however offshore wind turbines are constantly exposed to significant loads due to highly fluctuating environment the profitability of a wind farm depends substantially on the cost associated with material construction and installation of the substructures and these costs may rise significantly as the industry moves towards larger turbines bhattacharya thus the probability of failure typically expressed over a period of one year provides an indication of the investment needed to perform the mentioned activities successfully this quantity measures the structural safety level ensured by applying design factors to compensate for uncertainties hence it is evident that more accurate predictions of operational loads and improved knowledge of the physical parameters governing the structural reliability are of paramount importance in balancing the economic aspects against safety standards hahn 1999 the wind turbine international design standards iec 61400 1 describe how to use a simplified equivalent wind conditions for the assessment of the design loads for each wind turbine components for turbulence intensity a characteristic value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the lognormal distribution is required this definition is based on experimental work by frandsen 2007 on blade loads which describes the effective turbulence as a design quantity resulting in the same fatigue damage as the random variable sørensen et al 2008 quantified the model uncertainty that originates by applying this formulation and compared the results in terms of reliability in the presence of wind farm wakes the study concluded that the model describes satisfactorily the random wind speed fluctuations in more recent work carried out by toft et al 2016 it was found that for pile foundations in free ambient turbulent flow a lower characteristic value may lead to more realistic and less conservative lifetime fatigue loads in the same work it was found that for blade root flapwise bending moments results varied significantly from site to site thus turbulence being the main fatigue driver its equivalent values need careful evaluation based on site specific load assessment in order to avoid overly conservative estimations besides loads from the rotor wave loads are significant contributors to the design of offshore substructures the current practice recommend the assessment of wave loads to be performed based on simulated linear irregular waves generated from conventional spectra typically pierson moskovitz pm or jonswap the linear wave theory is built on the hypothesis of small perturbation of the mean sea level msl from which the potential flow is derived satisfying the normal boundary conditions journée and massie 2000 along with linear waves stretching methods are usually employed among which the most popular is wheeler wheeleret al 1969 which is used to extend the validity of the linear theory to water particles above the msl for several decades the linear theory has been successfully applied for predicting wave forces acting on offshore platforms the latter are often located at very deep waters where the wave kinematic are well approximated by the linear theory moan et al 2007 however most onshore wind turbines supported by pile foundations are sited in medium shallow waters 1 1 the majority of european offshore sites located between 5 and 30 m 74 of the total number installed on monopiles with an average water depth of 22 m arapogianni et al 2013 where nonlinear effects are commonly encountered due to high steepness cf veldkamp veldkamp and van der tempel 2005 ocean waves are by nature non gaussian stochastic processes natarajan 2014 dnv gl design guidelines for offshore wind turbines dnv suggest a fifth order stokes wave theory as an alternative to the linear model which is only suitable for deep waters fully nonlinear models cf schløer et al 2016 although accurate are computationally very expensive and therefore not desirable for offshore industrial applications for this reason the model that has received the most attention so far is the one developed by sharma and dean sharma 1980 based on a second order expansion of the potential flow at finite water depths using this model several studies have provided evidence that nonlinearities have an influence on loads of the substructure in a study conducted by agarwal and manuel 2011 it was argued that the load difference is primarily due to the higher energy content present in the spectrum of nonlinear waves compared to that of conventional waves which may affect the overall dynamic response consequently long term fatigue damage is also influenced as demonstrated by michael et al van der meulen et al 2012 and veldkamp et al veldkamp and van der tempel 2005 in more practical terms marino et al 2013 argued that nonlinearities may alter the load significantly when the contribution from aerodynamic damping is absent this occurs during standstill and in the side to side ss dynamic response of the turbine during normal power production in these cases the main source of excitation for the substructure is from direct longitudinal waves wave directional spreading and wind wave misalignment which is also discussed in for instance in kim and natarajan 2013 standstill or idling occur because of unplanned downtime normal shut down due to maintenance wind speed outside the operational range e g storm or no power requirement some statistics from uk offshore sites feng et al 2010 reported that the typical availability of an offshore turbine may range between 60 and 95 since the assessment of lifetime fatigue damage is strongly dependent on the turbine availability as discussed by ziegler et al ziegler and muskulus 2016 loads during standstill and idling need careful evaluation especially in cases where significant resonance phenomena may occur however from an operational perspective it is of interest to quantify what is the impact of different environmental models on reliability and fatigue lifetime of monopiles with respect to idling and operational conditions of the wind turbine therefore the purpose of this research is to analyse the variation of structural loads by considering modified equivalent turbulence levels in free ambient flow wind farm wakes and the effect of different wave kinematic models the influence of the latter is quantified based on a lower order wind turbine structure with coupled interaction of morison forces rotor forces and structural response subsequently first and second order statistics of the wave model uncertainties are used in the fatigue reliability analysis the damage model used is based on palmgren miner s cumulative law and bilinear sn curve as recommended in relevant standard practice dnv for the reliability analysis as well as load estimation time domain aeroelastic simulations are employed this work has the aim to evaluate and reduce the uncertainty in wind turbine damage equivalent loads and enhance lifespan assessment of offshore pile foundations the remainder for this article is as follows the first section analyses the influence of varying turbulence levels in terms of fatigue loads under free ambient and wake conditions subsequently wheeler correction and the sensitivity of fatigue loads to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients are studied in the next section a second order wave model is benchmarked against the linear wave theory combined with wheeler stretching to evaluate their model uncertainty finally a reliability analysis is performed combining different turbulence levels and wave models 2 site and model description 2 1 wind and wave statistics the 10 min hub height mean wind speed distribution used corresponds to a iec wind class 1b with scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution being respectively a 11 c 2 wave statistical data are based on site specific measurements from the research platform fino mittendorf 2009 located in the north sea the significant wave height h s and zero crossing wave period t z are given at their expected values conditional on the mean wind speed u the turbulence σ u is taken at its characteristic value defined as 1 σ u i r e f 0 75 u 5 6 where i r e f 0 14 for the wind class selected alternatively the iec standards provide a formulation which allows to consider the turbulence as a log normal distributed random variable conditional to mean wind speed f σ u u the mean and standard deviation of the turbulence are defined in eq 2 2 μ σ i r e f 0 75 u 3 8 σ σ 1 4 i r

probability density functions the derivation of the expected spectral peak period t p is found by eq 4 assuming a pm spectrum for the generation of random waves the zero crossing period is given as log normally distributed the range of variability of the environmental variables is listed in table 1 4 t p 4 5 π 4 t z 4 2 2 turbine the nrel 5mw reference turbine described in detail in jonkman et al 2009 is considered as installed on a monopile located at 20 m water depth in an elastic stiff sand soil the monopile was configured so that the natural frequencies would correspond to the ones obtained in the reference project oc3 phase ii jonkman and musial 2010 in order to avoid structural resonances the first natural frequency corresponding to the fore aft fa mode is f 0 0 237 hz the soil is modelled by nonlinear springs distributed along the soil portion of the pile the soil stiffness is based on p y curve as recommended by the american petroleum institute rp2a lrfd numerical simulations are performed using the commercially available fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic code hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 see table 2 the load cases considered in this work are summarized in table 3 dlc 1 2 b and 6 4 are used for the reliability analysis while dlc 1 2 a is used for mc simulations according to the dlc definition in the iec 61400 3 loads from ocean currents are not considered unless clearly specified the simulation time assumed is t s 600 s initial simulation transients were removed from the analysis by computing time series over 720 s and discarding the initial 120 s since the study aims at fatigue loads and fatigue damage assessments normal sea state nss and normal turbulence model ntm are used these conditions prevail throughout the turbine lifetime the estimated 1 hz damage equivalent load del is used as measure quantity throughout the analyses defined as 5 l u 1 n e q i 1 n δ l i m n i 1 m where l is the del defined over 600 s n e q the equivalent number of cycles δ l i and n i are respectively load range and associated number of cycles n is the total number of rainflow counted load ranges linear sn curve is adopted for structural steel with a wöhler exponent m 4 the results from the aeroelastic simulations are expressed in terms of accumulated equivalent load l l computed by eq 6 6 l l i f e j 1 n u μ l u j m p u j 1 m where n u the number of discrete wind speeds μ l u j is the del averaged over a certain number of seeds per mean wind speed u j and p u j its probability of occurrence 3 turbulence induced fatigue loads this section shows a comparative study in terms of fatigue equivalence between different characteristic values of the turbulence intensity the scope ot the analysis is to define a turbulence level which results in the same fatigue load as that obtained from the random turbulence this is achieved by first deriving an equivalent turbulence intensity by pure analytical considerations based on simplified assumptions see a the analytical approach consists of an extension to the monopile of the idea presented in frandsen 2007 where the wind turbine structure is reduced to an upright cantilever beam with a lumped mass at the tower top to model the rotor nacelle assembly mass and loaded by a dynamic thrust load the simplified formulation shows that the monopile fatigue del is proportional to the standard deviation of the wind velocity at a given mean wind speed and wöhler exponent subsequently the effective turbulence level predicted by the simplified approach is compared with the results obtained by numerical simulations using the aeroelastic wind turbine model the probabilistic approach considers the full joint probability distribution of mean wind speed and turbulence f u σ u as alternative to an equivalent turbulence furthermore in order to focus on turbulence loads the effect of wave loads is neglected for this analysis 3 1 free ambient turbulence under the approximated hypothesis of linearity between turbulence intensity and monopile fatigue loads troldborg et al 2014 the analytical formulation of the equivalent turbulence intensity i e can be adopted as 7 i e m i m f i u d i where i indicates the random variable the integral in eq 7 is solved numerically assuming a log normal distribution for f σ u u as per eq 2 for the turbulence class here adopted fig 2 a displays a comparison between effective turbulence intensity eq 7 and different turbulence percentiles using the formulation defined by iec eq 2 it is shown that for steel m 4 the effective turbulence is closer to the 60th percentile defined by iec to demonstrate the validity of the values predicted by eq 7 a numerical case is set up where 5 sets of aeroelastic simulations are performed adopting a constant turbulence level for each case varying between the 90th and the 50th percentile with a step of ten the turbulence percentiles are defined based on the distribution in eq 2 the dels obtained are averaged over 6 turbulence seeds for each mean wind speed in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty following the recommendations given by iec iec 61400 1 from the definition of the effective turbulence these results are compared against 2000 mc simulations where random samples are drawn from the joint probability distribution f u σ u the design load case dlc 1 2 a is considered table 3 in fig 1 only loads corresponding to the 60th and 90th percentiles are displayed the 60th percentile is the closest to the results provided by the crude mc approach in terms of fatigue equivalence as seen from table 4 the 90th percentile defined by iec shows conservative results for the pile foundation where the accumulated del is increased by 13 in the fa direction and 11 in the ss direction a lower turbulence level is also observed for the blade root bending moment which is an agreement with some of the findings in toft et al 2016 where a significant variability for this response is encountered at different site conditions for the blade root the fatigue load coming from the 90th percentile is slightly more conservative by 6 in this study for the monopile the lower fatigue equivalent percentile found here is directly used as characteristic value of the free ambient turbulence σ ˆ c where an additional contribution from wind farm wakes has to be considered 3 2 contribution from farm wakes in order to quantify the effect of wakes a case study is performed based on the formulation described in the amendment of iec standards iec 2005 wake generated turbulence increases the overall turbulence level these are taken into account for fatigue calculations as combination of free ambient and farm wake turbulence in operational conditions eq 8 8 σ e 1 n t p w σ ˆ c m p w i 1 n t σ ˆ i w m d i 1 m a distance between turbines equal to five times the rotor diameter d 5 d m and a uniform wind direction distribution f θ u are assumed in eq 8 p w 0 06 is the probability of wake condition n t is the number neighbouring turbines σ ˆ c is the free ambient characteristic turbulence and σ ˆ w the characteristic value of the maximum center wake turbulence standard deviation at the hub height sørensen et al 2008 expressed as 9 σ ˆ w u 2 1 5 0 8 d c t u 2 σ ˆ c 2 where c t u is the thrust coefficient known as function of the mean wind speed in case of a pitch regulated variable speed turbine table 5 shows the normalized accumulated del computed using the 60th percentile characteristic turbulence with respect to 90th percentile currently used the results are averaged over 6 turbulence seeds for each wind speed bin in the operational range with step of 2 m s two cases with n t 2 and case n t 6 are analysed using the 60th turbulence percentile leads lower accumulated dels by approximately 10 in the fa direction and 5 in the ss direction as expected the fa bending moment is more affected by the reduction being mainly governed by longitudinal turbulence fig 2b shows that the difference between the 90th and 60th percentiles decreases as the number of neighbouring turbines increases this confirms that in the presence of strong wakes the ambient turbulence effect vanishes fig 3 displays examples of monopile fa bending moment from aeroelastic simulations adopting different turbulence levels below and above rated wind speed the ss bending moment is only slightly affected by the number of neighbouring turbines 4 wheeler correction at finite water depths according to the linear superposition principle ocean waves can be approximated as a sum of regular sinusoidal harmonics and random phase to form an irregular wave journée and massie 2000 the empirical relation introduced by wheeler to extend the kinematic above the mean sea level introduces a mathematical error at finite water depth which is herein derived in the equations below a regular unimodal wave is considered under the hypothesis of small wave amplitudes η x t the field equation in the two dimensional case is described by eq 10 reported here for the sake of clarity 10 2 ϕ 0 i n ω ϕ z 0 o n γ 1 ϕ t 1 2 u 2 w 2 p g g z c o n γ 2 where ω is the field domain γ 1 is the sea bottom at a water depth z h γ 2 is the wave surface and u and w the horizontal and vertical particle velocity respectively the quantity p is the atmospheric pressure and c is a constant from eq 10 the solution of the laplace equation is the potential flow for the velocity field for finite water depths which satisfies the free kinematic boundary conditions cauchy poisson journée and massie 2000 11 ϕ x z t η a k ω cosh k h z sinh k h sin k x ω t where η a h 2 is the wave amplitude with h being the linear wave height the stretching consists in replacing the physical vertical coordinate z in z as 12 z h h z h η h h z 0 h z η introducing eq 12 into eq 11 the residual term of the laplace equation can be computed as 13 2 ϕ w k α 2 1 ϕ w where it has been indicated with 14 α h h η the residual term in eq 13 vanishes as the water depth increases meaning that no error is present at infinite water depths thus at finite water depths a correction can be introduced on the argument of the sinusoidal function 15 ϕ ˆ w x z t η a k ω cosh k h h z h η sinh k h sin α k x ω t where ϕ ˆ w x z t is the potential flow function with corrected wheeler stretching it can be verified that the new potential function satisfies the two dimensional field equation as 16 2 ϕ ˆ w 0 it is worth noting that for h the following relations are valid 17 k h h z h η k h α 1 to quantify the deviation in particle velocity from wheeler stretching the new kinematics are derived from the corrected potential flow expressed by eq 15 leading to the linear velocity and acceleration in the horizontal direction where the corrective term is applied 18 u ϕ x a u t 19 u ˆ x z t α η a ω cosh h h z h η sinh k h cos α k x ω t 20 a ˆ x z t α η a ω 2 cosh k h h z h η sinh k h sin α k x ω t the numerical example displayed in fig 4 a shows a velocity profile of a unimodal wave assuming a period t w 8 s a water depth h 20 m and a wave height η a varying in the interval 0 3 m as displayed in fig 4a the correction in the potential function leads to lower velocities for positive wave heights fig 4 furthermore the deviation increases with the wave height in the following discussions and figures this model will be referred to as wheeler correction it is important to remark that this derivation has the aim to only quantify the effects of satisfying the laplace equation at finite water depths since it is not based on any experimental work the approach has not been validated and it is not certain that it will necessarily lead to more accurate load predictions 5 uncertainty of drag and inertia coefficients the sensitivity of del due to wave forces during normal operation is analysed in this section in order to quantify the effect of random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients employed to compute wave forces the empirical formulation introduced by morison morison et al 1950 is by far the most common way of predicting unidirectional wave load acting on an immerse slender body in an unsteady flow in this case the monopile being a hollow cylinder as described in dnv above the range defined as the limit d m λ 0 2 where d m is the pile diameter and λ the wave length the pile affects the wave flow leading to wave diffraction phenomena this can be taken into account by the maccamyfuchs correction on the inertia coefficient c m other environmental factors are responsible for a variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients marine growth for instance which is a biological accumulation of microorganisms and algea on wetted surfaces results in increased of inertia and drag forces as a consequence of increased surface roughness and cross section area shi et al 2012 in fact roughness due to marine growth modifies the transition laminar to turbulent flow at lower reynold s numbers resulting in increased drag in consequence of the natural variability of the oceanic environment the validity of the morison equation may not always be respected in structural reliability the uncertainty on the hydrodynamic forces exerted on a pile foundation turns into a load variation due to wave structure interaction for computing loads on the substructure inertia and drag coefficients can be treated as normally distributed random variables chosen here as c m n μ m σ m 1 9 0 1 and c d n μ d σ d 0 9 0 1 with μ and σ being respectively their mean and standard deviation although higher values of the uncertainty in the hydrodynamic coefficients can be found in practice values provided in literature for fatigue analyses were used veldkamp burrows et al 1997 thus two parallel studies are performed respectively considering the hydrodynamic coefficients as random and deterministic variables the latter corresponding to their mean values under normal operating conditions the load case dlc 1 2 b is used a set of 2000 randomly sampled environmental conditions from eq 3 are used as input parameters to aeroelastic simulations waves are modelled as irregular linear random waves and wheeler stretching a side analysis is performed to quantify the statistical impact of wave forces on the del by only including wind forces thus in order to show the influence of the wave load on the ss direction wave directional spreading is included in this analysis along with a wave misalignment of 10 deg results are displayed in fig 5 in terms of probability distributions of the mudline bending moments as shown in fig 5 the wave force increases the mode of the del distribution by nearly 20 of the total fatigue loads in the fa direction and 28 in the ss direction as summarized in table 6 the values are normalized with respect to the bending moments in the corresponding direction of the deterministic case in fig 5 the smoothing was obtained by kernel density estimator sheather and jones 1991 as it can be inferred the distribution of the del in both ss and fa directions is insensitive to the uncertainty introduced on the hydrodynamic coefficients a slight increase of 2 and 4 respectively are encountered as seen from table 6 although this small variation their deterministic expected values can be conveniently adopted without significant impact however larger uncertainties if present in the hydrodynamic coefficients than the ones considered in this study may have larger impact on fatigue loads the analysis also shows the statistical contribution of wave loads the latter increase the mean del compared to the case where only wind excitation is present the difference displayed in fig 5 between wind only and combined wind wave excitation has to be interpreted qualitatively since wind and wave forces are coupled with the dynamic response of the structure and their effect cannot in principle be studied separately 6 damage model 6 1 cumulative damage for the assessment of fatigue damage a linear cumulative law based sn curve and palmgren miner s method is used the sn curve is a relationship between number of stress cycles to failure and the associated stress amplitude the expected short term cumulative damage d s u can be expressed in the integral and discrete forms as 21 d s n a 0 δ σ u m f δ σ d σ i n δ σ n i a i δ σ u i m where n δ σ is the total number of cycles experienced during the simulation time t s l o g a the intercept of the sn curve and f δ σ u the stress ranges distribution conditional on the mean wind speed obtained from rainflow counting in literature as for instance in sørensen et al 2008 and nejad et al 2014 there are several formulations assuming a closed form of the integral in eq 21 this is in practice accomplished by assuming a model for the stress range distribution f δ σ typically two parameters weibull distribution here the long term expected damage d is obtained by palmgren miner s rule by integrating the short term damage conditional to the mean wind speed over the long term mean wind speed distribution f u for offshore substructures the full sea and wind state has to be considered through the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables f u h s t p σ u however in this work only discrete states are considered for fatigue damage which means that the environmental variables are all conditional to the mean wind speed u 6 2 fatigue reliability fatigue life of a structural component is the time spent under ordinary loading conditions necessary to initiate a physical crack which would result in a loss of ultimate fatigue strength of the member the fatigue damage limit state function g x can be formulated according to the sn approach where x x 1 x 2 x n is a collection of random variables in the load and resistance model the condition g x 0 indicates a failure occurrence in this work the cumulative damage during operation and standstill is considered indicated respectively as d o p and d s s 22 g x δ d o p x o p d s t x s t the turbine lifetime is taken as reference period for computing the cumulative damage by means of eq 33 in case of offshore turbines the service life is set to t l i f e 25 years which comprises a contribution to damage from operational conditions computed through dlc 1 2 b and from idling computed through dlc 6 4 see table 3 in eq 22 the term δ represents the failure limit modelled as a stochastic variable associated with miner s rule i e the degree of uncertainty in predicting variable amplitude fatigue loads usually conducted from constant amplitude tests the vector x denotes the set of uncertainties considered once the limit state function is known explicitly through eq 22 the probability of failure p f is defined as 23 p ˆ f p g x 0 g x 0 f x x d x where f x x is the joint probability density function of the random variables x from reliability theory the estimated generalised reliability index β ˆ simply indicated as β is linked to the estimated probability of failure p ˆ f as 24 β φ 1 p ˆ f where φ is the standard normal probability distribution function given the complexity of the limit state function g x the integral in eq 24 is calculated through first order reliability method form followed by re evaluation with importance sampling is based on a gaussian sampling distribution dimitrov et al 2013 the form method assumes a linear safety margin which in some cases may lead to inaccurate estimation of the reliability index on the other hand form is an efficient way to find the most likely failure point importance sampling centered at the design point x d determined by a form analysis can serve as verification and improvement of the form results since is as most simulation methods is not strongly affected by nonlinearity in the safety margin this technique was more computationally efficient than crude mc simulations as confirmed by preliminary attempts 6 3 uncertainties a review of the major uncertainties typically considered in reliability of offshore structures can be found in hahn 1999 sørensen et al 2008 dnv tarp johansen 2003 rangel ramírez and sørensen 2012 the uncertainties considered contain a statistical uncertainty related to wind and wave climate assessment x s t model uncertainty in the simulation of the dynamic response x d y n blade aerodynamic model x a e r o wake turbulence model x w k and stress calculation from finite elements models or others x s t r an uncertainty is also considered to account for the limited simulation time x s i m representative for the entire lifetime numerical values of the aforementioned quantities are retrieved from available literature and listed in table 8 an additional contribution is introduced to model the uncertainty associated with the wave kinematic model adopted these are specified for standstill and operational condition separately respectively indicated as x h s s x h o p the cumulative damage is a nonlinear function of these quantities because the uncertainties are applied to the respective parameters on which they produce effect 7 wave induced fatigue loads 7 1 wave kinematic models the surface elevation process η t of a long crested unidirectional sea wave can be expressed as linear superposition 25 η x z t i 1 n a i ω i cos k i x ω i t ε i where the input parameters are the wave amplitude a i ω i the spectral frequency ω i the wave number k i and the random phase ε i three different wave kinematic models are compared eq 26 expresses the horizontal particle velocity field derived from eq 25 where wheeler stretching is applied the second order non linear wave kinematic model applied here is described natarajan 2014 the nonlinear horizontal velocity field u n l is expressed by eq 27 furthermore a third kinematic model uses velocity and acceleration obtained by the generation of linear random waves corrected by the factor derived in section 4 as u ˆ l t α u l t 26 u l x z t i 1 n a i ω i cosh k i h h z h η sinh k i h cos k i x ω i t ε i j 27 u n l x z t i 1 n a i ω i cosh k i z h sinh k i h cos k i x ω i t i 1 n

order transfer functions b i j z b i j z c i j z c i j z rearranged in eq 27 are function of wave amplitude frequency wave number water depth and vertical coordinate their explicit formulation is reported for instance in agarwal and manuel 2011 the second order expansion is evaluated at i j the superscripts and refer to a summation or difference between frequencies 7 2 assessment of the wave model uncertainty this analysis has the aim to quantify the model uncertainties in fatigue loads associated with the wave kinematic model adopted model uncertainties are epistemic and originate from imperfect knowledge or idealizations of the mathematical formulation used to predict a natural process in other words it is a measure of the ability of a mathematical model to reproduce a natural phenomena for example ambühl et al 2015 explicitly expressed this bias by evaluating the performance of different mathematical models against real wave measurements in this work due to absence of measurements the second order wave kinematic model and wheeler correction at finite water depth are compared against the linear wave model in eq 26 the load variation is then expressed as a relative ratio x h between the equivalent stress σ ψ e q computed from the different wave kinematic models and from the linear wave model σ ψ e q as in eq 28 the equivalent stress is defined similarly to eq 5 considering stress time series instead of loads 28 x h σ ψ e q σ ψ e q the nominal stress parametrised with respect to the radial position on a specific section of the monopile ψ is expressed by eq 29 given the monopile geometry and dimensions the stress can be well approximated by a longitudinal membrane stress as defined by dnv gl as the contribution from the vertical force is neglected due to of its small load range which does not contribute to fatigue it is assumed that shear stresses are also negligible 29 σ ψ t m x t i r sin ψ m y t i r cos ψ in eq 29 r 3 m is the medium radius of the monopile and i 4 12 m4 the area and the area moment of inertia of the circular hollow section in eq 29 the dependency from the environmental parameters is omitted the first two statistical moments of x h provide a measure of the relative model uncertainty table 7 shows the discrete set of environmental parameters to compare the wave kinematic models only the states s 3 to s 12 are used due to data availability the states s 1 and s 2 will be used in the next section and reported here for completeness the probability of occurrence is taken according to the wind speed weibull distribution in the range 7 25 m s with step of 2 m s resulting in 10 discrete states the turbulence level as expressed by eq 1 is used the hydrodynamic load acting on the substructure is computed by the morison formula with coupled wave structure interaction as 30 f t 1 2 ρ c d d m u t q t u t q t π d m 2 4 ρ c m u t π d 2 4 ρ c m 1 q t where f t is the wave force per unit length c m and c d are respectively inertia and drag coefficients d m the monopile diameter ρ the water mass density and q denotes the structural displacement in the fa direction due to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients not significantly affecting the load distribution in the long term c m and c d are considered constant the load case dlc 6 4 defined by iec design standards for offshore turbines iec 61400 3 concerns fatigue analysis during idling according to the description resonant loading of the substructure from wave excitation has to be taken into account assuming nss and wave misalignment in this analysis a wave misalignment of 10 deg is considered resonance effects are caused by the wave spectral energy typically concentrated in a frequency band close to the first natural frequencies of the turbine fa ss damping is an important player for fatigue several experimental studies on offshore turbines have shown the variation of the additional damping provided by the rotor in koukoura et al 2015 this value was found to be approximately 12 in idling in the fa direction while when the turbine is operating it may rise up to 60 logarithmic decrement although aerodynamic damping represents a large portion of the total damping in operation this latter is a sum of additional contributions given by soil hydrodynamic interaction structure and controller hereby two different states of the turbine are analysed namely idling or standstill and normal operation the flow chart in fig 7 explains the procedure to estimate the model uncertainty of the wave forces associated with the defined wind turbine states 7 3 lower order turbine model in order to specify x h a set of nonlinear waves based on the second order kinematic model is generated using the statistical parameters listed in table 7 since the aim of the analysis is to quantify the wave kinematic model uncertainty the effect of other uncertainties must be neglected these include aerodynamic interaction structural model rotor excitation controller unit and soil model for this reason a lower order three dimensional numerical model of a wind turbine structure is set up where the rotor nacelle assembly is replaced by a lumped mass at the tower top m t o p and a bottom fixed monopile the portion of soil pile is calibrated in length to match the first natural frequency of the areroelastic model the latter being f 0 0 237 hz in both fa and ss directions apparent fixity the system is modelled with timoshenko beam elements friswell 2010 this set up ensures coherence with the dynamic response of the full aeroelastic model 7 4 standstill loads first an analysis is performed on the full aeroelastic and equivalent model in idling conditions where only hydrodynamic forces are exerted on the structures given the negligible contribution of the wind force acting on the system these are applied in the two directions x and y according to the misalignment applied a logarithmic decrement damping δ s s 7 is considered representative for standstill because the turbine is not operating the damping can be assumed constant for all the environmental states defined in table 7 in both systems a stiffness proportional rayleigh damping matrix c α k is tuned by varying the structural damping of the support structure and then computing the analytical logarithmic decrement as ratio between real and imaginary part of the eigenvalue λ as 31 δ 2 π ℛ λ i λ this value includes contributions from soil and structure damping a comparison of the response in time domain of the two systems in standstill is displayed in fig 8 7 5 operational loads to quantify the hydrodynamic load variation during operation an estimate of the aerodynamic damping at different mean wind speeds is needed see fig 9 this is accomplished by computing the logarithmic decrement damping δ o p of the tower top acceleration to a small perturbation of a constant mean wind speed using the full aeroelastic model no turbulence and waves are applied the resulting free decay response is used to estimate the logarithmic decrement and damping ratio as indicated in eq 32 this procedure provides an engineering estimate of the damping available during normal power production see e g tempel 2006 fig 12 displays the damping ratio estimated by this procedure 32 δ 1 n log p 0 p n ζ 1 1 2 π δ 2 in eq 32 p 0 is the first peak response while p n is the peak response after n periods subsequently the estimated aerodynamic damping in the fa direction is used as input to the simplified system as additional contribution applied at the tower top mass as shown in fig 6 and modelled with an internal viscous damper the damping coefficient is found as c 2 ζ k m where m and k are respectively modal mass and modal stiffness of the considered modes in the fa and ss directions thus the aerodynamic forces applied on the simplified model are the tower top bending moments in the two directions x and y the thrust force and the horizontal force in the y direction the hydrodynamic forces are applied as in the standstill case all these components are extracted from aeroelastic simulations using the full model the thrust force was obtained from an aeroelastic model with stiff tower and rotor in order to eliminate the wind structure interaction fig 8 shows the good agreement between the structural response of the simplified and the full aeroelastic model a better match is seen for standstill conditions than in operation this is not surprising because the structural response in operation is influenced by the controller which is absent in the simplified model fig 10 shows an example of transient load in standstill and operation where the load difference can be visually perceived as it can be inferred nonlinear waves result in higher structural loads and become more important at low damping values their effect almost vanishes when the response is sufficiently damped by aerodynamic contributions fig 13 as also found for instance in marino et al 2013 this means that modelling nonlinear waves is important for standstill or idling conditions where resonances due to nonlinear interaction phenomena between waves and structure occur the high load difference captured in fig 10 between 420 and 440 s is due to different wave used seed between linear and nonlinear waves the wheeler correction at finite water depth slightly decreases the load as displayed in fig 13 note that at 20 m water depth this becomes visible but not significant fig 11 the mudline fa and ss bending moments obtained from the input parameters listed in table 7 have a duration of approximately 1 h due to this the load variation statistics were determined by windowing with a sliding period of 10 min starting from every third minute this resulted in 18 time series for each state the ratio x h defined in eq 28 is then computed in the two directions using a bilinear sn curve see table 8 coherently the same set of input data is used to calculate the load variation when finite water depth correction is applied statistics are reported in table 8 fig 13a and b displays the wave model uncertainty as function of the mean wind speed compute at an angular point ψ π 4 r a d when nonlinear waves are modelled the ratio x h shows a positive trend with the mean wind speed in operational conditions moreover the figures highlight the variation in fatigue loads in the two states considered in standstill the equivalent stress variation can reach 30 to 40 at high wind speeds while in operation this effect is clearly attenuated by high damping to 10 to 20 because the ratio x h shows a slightly decreasing trend when the correction at finite water depth is applied its dependence on the mean wind speed is considered constant in the reliability analysis table 9 shows the statistics determined based on the results discussed above where a linear fit is performed to obtain the trend only one single value of the standard deviation is adopted corresponding to the mean value of the standard deviations computed at each mean wind speed the wave model uncertainties are all assumed log normally distributed 8 stochastic model for fatigue reliability the load variation coefficients obtained from different wave kinematic models and the different equivalent turbulence level in wake conditions are employed in the lifetime reliability analysis the cumulative damage combines the contributions of the design load cases dlc 1 2 b and 6 4 with reference to table 3 respectively operation and standstill idling conditions table 8 describes the stochastic model the mechanical properties of the monopile steel are defined in veritas which provide a variety of cases corresponding to different marine exposures in this example a bilinear sn curve in seawater with cathodic protection for butt welded elements is selected in table 9 the coefficients a 0 01 b 0 02 and c 0 87 are obtained from fig 13 the expression of the cumulative damage as function of wave misalignment φ wind direction θ mean wind speed u the radial angle ψ random variables x and time t can be readily expressed as 33 d ψ t x t t s i 1 n u j 1 n θ k 1 n φ d s u i θ j φ k x o p p u i θ j p φ k t t s i 1 n u j 1 n θ k 1 n φ d s u i θ j φ k x s s p u i θ j p φ k where t is taken at one year steps the random variables are specified in operational and standstill conditions as 34 x o p x s t x d y n x a e r o x w k x s i m x s t r x h o p x s s x s t x d y n x s i m x s t r x h s s note that in standstill the uncertainty due to wakes and aerodynamic computations are not considered since wind loads do not significantly affect fatigue when the turbine is not operating to account for the difference between the wave model uncertainty it is assumed that x h o p and x h s s are average multiplicative factors reflecting the load variation when different kinematic models than the linear model are used with this in mind the damage is computed by eq 21 where the following transformation is applied 35 δ σ x h δ σ by noting that 36 d σ e q m where δ σ is the stress range when wave model uncertainties are applied and δ σ is the stress range resulting from linear waves the mechanical stress is computed at an angular point ψ π 4 rad of the most fatigue loaded section which turned out to be located 7 m below the mudline the model uncertainties derived at the mudline section are valid at every vertical station along the monopile height which is a deterministic geometrical dimension the reference period t is thus partitioned into the two periods t t s s t o p it is assumed that the annual turbine availability is 92 for simplicity the frequency of occurrence of the mean wind speed is assumed to be the same for both standstill and operation in this particular case although without compromising the validity of the results standstill conditions are simulated with rotor blades pitched at 82 deg and the rotor let free to rotate according to the local hot spot model a stress concentration factor s c f 1 is adopted as suggested by dnv in case of no change of thickness and no imperfections as a consequence an uncertainty due to scfs was not included in the stochastic model thickness correction for the stress distribution is applied as recommended in veritas in total 8 wind directions are considered and for each wind direction 3 cases of wave misalignment are modelled being respectively φ 10 0 10 deg with respective probability of occurrence p φ 0 25 0 5 0 25 a uniform wind direction probability p θ w is considered in order keep the numerical case more general although realistic indicating with m x and m y the bending moments at each wind direction the fa and ss bending moments can found as 37 m x t θ w m x t cos θ w m y t sin θ w m y t θ w m x t sin θ w m y t cos θ w 9 results a study case of a turbine in a wind farm is considered where the number of neighbouring turbines is n t 6 positioned radially with respect to the turbine analysed at a distance of 5 rotor diameters a set 12 discrete environmental states is employed for the estimation of the cumulative damage and their respective frequency of occurrence is shown in table 7 the fatigue damage is computed from numerical simulations using the full aeroelastic model the reliability analysis is performed on a reference period of one year throughout the entire lifetime the reliability index at time t is computed from the cumulative probability of failure p ˆ f t expressed by eq 24 where the number of trials simulated by is ensures convergence on the probability of failure until a c o v 0 02 is reached marelli et al 2017 in order to compare the annual reliability level at the end of life for all the cases studied eq 24 is computed where the annual probability of failure is given by 38 δ p ˆ f t p ˆ f t p ˆ f t δ t 1 p ˆ f t δ t where 1 p ˆ f t is the survival probability at time t rangel ramírez and sørensen 2012 and p ˆ f t is the cumulative probability of failure at time t displayed in fig 14 a today s standards recommend an annual reliability index β 3 3 for offshore substructures corresponding to minor or moderate consequences of failure a preliminary analysis showed that under the loading conditions assumed the structure reaches an annual reliability index at 25 years of β r e f 2 4 in the baseline case calculated by eq 38 which implies that the design requirements at the end of life are not met thus in order to have a safe baseline for comparison a design factor z 1 3 was introduced this parameter is a multiplicative factor of the monopile thickness τ of which the approximated area moment of inertia of a tubular section is a linear variable 39 i π r 3 τ by doing so the annual reliability index calculated by eq 38 in the reference case reaches β r e f 3 45 at 25 years which is considered satisfactory for this case in fig 14 the cumulative probability of failure and reliability index are visualised where the reference case corresponds to the 90 t h percentile of the turbulence and linear waves these results are obtained by running a reliability analysis using eq 33 where t 5 25 years with a step of one year the impact of the environmental models becomes more evident over time because fatigue damage is a cumulative process the results in table 11 show this variation in terms of percentage indicated as χ defined in eq 40 between the end of life annual reliability indices when different models are used against the baseline case in order to quantify the significance between the cases analysed a 5 variation threshold against the baseline case is set note that the reliability values shown in table 10 and fig 14 differ because in fig 14 the cumulative reliability index computed at time t takes into account the survival probability at time t 1 40 χ 100 1 β β r e f as inferred from table 11 not all cases are significantly affecting the reliability when compared to the baseline case nonlinear waves and lower percentile play an opposite effect and their combined case results in a slight variation below the threshold defined also the wheeler correction alone is not significant in this case of 20 m water depth in this latter case it is possible to notice the high impact of the turbulence percentile additionally the importance factors of the random variables are computed from the form analysis showing that the model uncertainties due to the wave kinematic models have less impact compared to the remaining model uncertainties as reported in table 12 this can be explained by the dependency of the wave model uncertainty on the mean wind speed and noting that the most frequent significant wave heights occur in the medium range table 7 according to the wind speed distribution at which the model uncertainties are moderate fig 13 the reported values in table 12 have been computed using 90th turbulence percentile the wave model uncertainties are given as a summation over all the mean wind speeds including standstill and operational conditions 10 discussion although the effect of the investigated environmental models is important on structural loads they are not the primary drivers for fatigue reliability as also confirmed by the analysis of the importance factors in fact the reliability index level seems to be mostly sensitive to the type of damage model used for instance by eliminating the thickness correction defined by dnv gl standard practice the annual reliability at 25 years in the baseline case increases noticeably from β r e f 3 45 to β r e f 3 90 however the meaning of this type of analysis is to provide evidence of the degree of variation of the reliability index under the different factors considered despite the effect not being drastic this is still easily observable for instance the wheeler correction at finite water depth combined with the 60th percentile results in an increased annual reliability index by 15 at 25 and 20 years which corresponds to circa 6 times lower probability of failure compared to the case where nonlinear waves and the 90th percentile are used therefore this confirms that the choice of the environmental models used has an impact on the design as well as the estimation of the remaining life after several years of operation in the industry this procedure still substantially relies on analytical models implemented in aero hydro servo elastic codes due to several impracticalities connected to a direct load measurement throughout the entire service life especially in the foundation as a consequence monitoring the availability and the climate during different operational states is very important for load assessment in cases of deep waters nonlinear effects vanish making it realistic to use linear models the correction to the wheeler stretching formulation is seen to reduce the particle velocities and acceleration in the horizontal direction leading to lower fatigue loads it should be noted that this formulation is not intended to replace the original model but rather only to quantify the effects of satisfying the laplace equation its validity in real applications has not been tested and additional future experimental investigations could be made to prove the validity of this approach the wave model uncertainties generally depend on the joint distribution of the main environmental parameters namely mean wind speed and significant wave height in this work due to lack of wave measurements only mean wind speed was considered as driving parameter instead a wider range of sea states should be considered with their respective probability of occurrence furthermore since most offshore site are located in highly irregular sea bottoms at shallow waters causing breaking phenomena further interesting research may be carried out to quantify their impact on long term loads in general it is important to remark that the reliability assessment is case specific and cannot be represented by one case study only as the one analysed in this paper therefore in order to decide on what type of environmental model to employ it is recommended to perform a careful evaluation of the expected turbine loads in connection to the specific site characteristics and preliminary structural analyses standstill loads and wind farm wakes considered in this analysis contribute considerably to fatigue damage and this could explain the lower reliability level obtained compared to the original design consequently in order to achieve the desired target reliability level in the reference case a design factor was introduced it is important to notice that the right calibration of the design parameter would require a reliability based design optimization which is outside the scope of this work in the reliability analysis the uncertainty in the wöhler exponent has not been considered in connection to this study since fatigue damage is a nonlinear function of the mechanical stress through the wöhler exponent it is expected that its uncertainty would amplify the effect of wave nonlinearities on the monopile loads especially in standstill 11 conclusions this research highlights the importance of modelling turbulence and waves for the assessment of fatigue loads on offshore wind turbine monopiles with respect to the environmental models nonlinear waves correction at finite water depth uncertainty in the hydrodynamic coefficients and turbulence level have been analysed the influence of nonlinear waves is more pronounced during standstill and its effect is conditional to the operational damping and the wind speed distribution the load calculated when correction at finite water depth is applied shows some degree of variation by decreasing the load estimation which is expected to increase at lower water depths uncertainty introduced in the hydrodynamic coefficients does not seem to affect significantly the probability distribution of the equivalent loads on the monopile this has been quantified by numerical mc simulations where uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients were used the importance of estimating a correct equivalent value of the turbulence intensity has been discussed the turbulence level defined by iec standards is in general conservative for the assessment of the monopile fatigue loads in this specific case a 60th percentile was found to be more realistic namely closer to the full mc approach however the influence of the free ambient turbulence decreases in the presence of strong farm wakes for the analysis a realistic case of 6 neighbouring turbines equidistant from the objective one was considered further investigation is needed to quantify how different wind and turbulence classes affect the choice of this parameter in general the fatigue load reduction resulting from the application of lower equivalent turbulence could potentially lead in lighter structures saving material and installation costs on large scales future research should quantify this reduction in practical and economical terms acknowledgements this project has received funding from the european unions horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the marie sklodowska curie grant agreement no 642108 advanced wind energy systems operation and maintenance expertise http awesome h2020 eu appendix a derivation of the linear relationship between turbulence and damage equivalent loads in the following steps previous studies were followed by arani et al troldborg et al 2014 the external force is represented by a thrust t t acting at the tower top denoting by a the rotor area and c t the thrust coefficient the thrust force can be approximated as a 1 t t 1 2 ρ a c t u t 2 where the wind speed u t can be expressed by the sum of a time invariant mean wind speed u and a turbulent term u t the thrust can then be linearised using quasi steady assumptions where the turbulent term u t is considered small a 2 t t 1 2 ρ a c t u u t 2 1 2 ρ a c t u 2 2 u u t according to eq a 2 the second order term of the turbulence u t has been omitted by linear approximation this implies a direct proportionality between the linearised standard deviation of the thrust force σ t and the standard deviation of the wind speed fluctuations given a constant mean wind speed u as a 3 σ t σ u furthermore to simplify the scheme only the first mode corresponding to the fa direction is considered in frequency domain the response spectrum of an output through a linear and time invariant system exited by a random load can be expressed as a 4 s y y ω h ω 2 s u u ω where s y y ω is the spectrum of the response y t h ω is the energy transfer function of the linear structural system and s u u ω spectrum of the excitation the wind field generated by the aeroelastic code used is based on the mann turbulence model larsen and hansen 2007 while dnv gl guidelines dnv suggest a kaimal spectrum the standard deviation of the response σ y is proportional to the standard deviation of the turbulence term σ u at a constant mean wind speed u under certain assumptions the approach can be demonstrated analytically as shown in reference troldborg et al 2014 for a kaimal spectrum a 5 σ y σ u which in turn using eq a 3 implies a direct proportionality between σ y σ t as shown in frandsen 2007 if the response y t can be considered narrow banded where the dominant natural frequency is ω 0 and linear sn curve are assumed the del is also proportional to σ y conditionally on the wöhler exponent and the mean wind speed a 6 l u σ u this relation can also be extended to the mann turbulence model by noting that the latter is built on the kaimal spectrum mann 1998 however since the proportionality is determined by the transfer function which is outside the spectrum the formulation should in principle be valid for any spectrum 
23499,yacht designers and builders are continuously looking for new solutions to reduce construction costs and to improve the quality and innovation of their vessels in the case of superyachts over 30 m in length performances are no longer a primary goal and the efforts of technical offices are mostly addressed on other aspects related to the aesthetic impact of the project and to the on board comfort from this point of view vibrations and noise represent a difficult issues to deal with for designers both in the initial phase of the project when it is necessary to have preliminary information about the response of the structure not yet defined and during construction in case some critical behaviors arose in any part of the structure in this paper the dynamic behavior of a 40 m motor yacht is investigated the vibration velocity spectra obtained by the numerical model of the yacht are compared with the value of level limits imposed by the iso6954 1984 different structural solutions are investigate to improve the comfort level in same area not in compliance with the rule keywords comfort analysis finite elements models frequency response function frf pillars tuned mass damper 1 introduction the commercial success of recreational boats of any dimension depends on several aspects related on one side to the objective technical tasks and on the other side to more subjective aesthetical characteristics before the recent financial crisis the very positive situation of yacht market allowed the designers to exercise all their creativity giving rise to as innovative as disputable projects beyond the related commercial risk this philosophy had the objective to attract potential owners and going over the many passionate competitors in this perspective however the on board comfort hold a secondary position often relegated to the personal feeling of the designer who didn t worry at all to sacrifice it in advantage of other more remarkable performances boote et al 2013 with the rising of the 2008 global crisis the competition in the superyacht field was further exacerbated in this way also by troubling minor shipyards while confirming the prestige of other more experienced ones that continued to focus on yacht quality and reliability this was particularly evident for large motor yachts for which due to their high value design tasks should be achieved with great attention to any detail influencing the final quality of the product or and the owner s approval while the innovative technical aspects were dissected in all perspective onboard comfort remains a matter to be investigated moro et al 2013 the first regulation for verify the conformity of merchant ships crews and later the definition of class notations for passenger ships dates back to 1984 from which the term iso 6954 1984 the latest review occurred on 2000 so that the code is named iso 6954 2000 the value limits imposed by the regulation are very restrict and given the objective difficulty in making any change to the dynamic behavior of hull structure after construction it is extremely important to perform fem predictive analyses to identify the natural frequency of the hull and of local structures such as decks and bulkheads and then their response to exciting loads induced by propellers engines and waves pais et al 2017 in this paper the dynamic behavior of a 40 m motor yacht has been investigated by using the finite element method fem an investigation on the most influencing excitation sources as well as the influence of the main simplifications adopted in the numerical model have been also carried out biot et al 2015 the frequency response analysis have highlighted different living areas not complying with iso 6945 1984 the authors have prefer to use the iso 6954 1984 because this rule allows verifying the response of the structure at each excitation source in order to reduce the vibration peak level that would compromise the habitability onboard three different structural solution have been identified and tested a thickness increase in the critical areas the use of stiffened bars and the installation of tuned mass damper tmd device pais and boote 2017 2 numerical model the vessel assumed as a study case is a particular type of craft named cabin cruiser 40 m long and 8 m wide in aluminum composed by large internal areas distributed on three decks main upper and sun deck generally these crafts are subdivided in internal and external areas the internal one is composed by two living spaces the first called daily includes the main saloon the kitchen and the steering console the second one is conceived for nighttime so cabins and toilets characterize it the external area is provided by a large aft cockpit and an area to enjoy the sun above the superstructure the craft has an open space called fly bridge where is placed an equipped external zone and others steering command console generally it represents the helm position in fig 1 an illustrating picture of the boat is reported the structural modelling of this vessel is the most challenging part of any efficient method for vibration analysis prediction it is very important that structures are reproduced clearly and detailed in order to have an accuracy of results in vibration terms boote et al 2013 by the way the real structural scheme of the yacht is extremely complicated to be reported in a fe model hence it necessary to use some basic approximations that should be carried out in order to have an optimal compromise between reality and the study case another aspect that have to be taken into account in this kind of investigation is to achieve an adequate ratio between result reliability and computational time and costs being the vibration global analysis the aim of this study it is important that the structural hierarchy is respected asmussen et al 2001 the principal reinforcements transverse and longitudinal and all the principal structure as decks and bulkheads should be modelled in a truthful way as better as possible because these structures influence the frequency response the secondary reinforcements as longitudinal stiffeners are modelled in a truthful way to have accurate results the local reinforcements grate bars brackets are neglected because they do not influence results however they were take account in the weights distribution as it will be discuss forward once the modelling accuracy is established the discretization of model is performed as first step the complete 3d cad model of the hull provided by the shipyard is imported in the pre processor software for the dynamic analysis the fineness of the mesh is decisive moro et al 2013 in principle the minimum number of grid points to capture a wave shaped deformation is five but in practice this is the double klyukin 1963 any fe model should be generated according to such simple consideration recalling the fact that larger elements of the mesh grid make the model stiffer and that by limiting the number of grid points a reduction of modelling and calculation time may be obtained in this study the dimension of the mesh is defined starting from the equation of flexural vibrations of a thin plate corradi 2012 in this study six grid point are chosen to represent the wavelength and with a shell elements dimensions of 300 mm it is possible obtained a wavelength correspond to frequency of 35 hz to create a complete model of a superyacht is very difficult so the principle shell element dimensions is 300 mm although small variations about the nominal value are possible in the model the mesh was created using shell elements for plating and main reinforcements such as keelsons floors and girders for secondary stiffeners simple beam elements have been preferred to keep the model dimension as low as possible the yacht has a typical propulsion system for this kind of units in the specific there are two main diesel engines with 2580 kw power 3 5 t weight each and the mass moments correspondent are jxx 221 kg m2 jyy 553 kg m2 jzz 221 kg m2 the engine system has been modelled by using punctual masses where their weight is described by a 0 d element located in the engines center of gravity engines are connected to the hull by resilient mountings which are located in four different areas in the basement in order to better distribute the engine s weight the resilient mounts have been modelled by spring linear elements in order to take account to stiffness constants in the three directions the mounts are t35 ha sh 55 and the stiffness constant of mounts is the same in all the three direction i e 2500 n mm vulkan 2014 dealing with the rigid link between engine and resilient mountings four rbe2 elements is chosen which allow to rigidly transferring the inertial forces of the mass with six degrees of freedom the same approach have been used for linkage two generators at the base in addition the shaft line the brackets and the bearing support of the shaft have been modelled with beam elements instead the propeller has been modelled adding a punctual mass and relative moments of inertia its value have been provided by the shipyard and it has been corrected in order to take into account the added mass i e an addition of the 50 of the propeller mass as mentioned before the machinery weight the propulsion system propellers generators and engines have been modelled as concentrated masses at this point the model has a weight not corresponding to the lightweight ship condition because the weight of the all furniture insulations plants floors etc lacks the shipyard for the part of the deck inside for example saloon rooms etc has suggested the value 100 130 kg m2 and for the deck outside about 40 kg m2 these kinds of loads cannot be treated as concentrated masses but it is necessary to use uniform distributions therefore non structural mass command is used the nonstructural mass defined on the property entries is mass that is added to the structure in addition to the structural mass from the elements the total weight of the lightweight ship condition is 214 tons the loading condition of this study case was not the lightship one but 6 tons of liquid in the tanks must be added moreover the liquid is distributed in 2 tons in stern tanks and 4 tons in bow ones in order to achieve this distribution non structural masses have been used compared to other vehicles ships are more complicate because they work in a fluid that leads high inertial effects due to a high specific weight of the fluid when the ship hull vibrates in the surrounding water pressure fluctuations are excited this effect could be simulated by adding a mass of water that cooperate with the structure called added mass korotkin 2007 to take into account the added mass in the numerical model the nastran card called mfluid is used and it refers to the boundary element method sauter and schwab 2010 this function is defined as the properties of an incompressible fluid volume generating a virtual mass matrix this command can consider the presence of internal tanks or external added mass fluids to solve a vibration problem on ship structures a high level of uncertainties is associated to the total damping forces governing the amplitudes of oscillations of the structure de silva 2007 effects of energy dissipations are usually accounted by a damping coefficient ξ i e the critical damping it is define as the ratio between the actual damping c and the critical damping c r 1 ξ c c r usually its value is defined by a range between 0 1 and 0 5 or 1 5 depending on the author the value 0 01 corresponding to 1 hz and 0 1 corresponding to 100 hz has been established and used for this work the numerical model is completed as shown in fig 2 3 forced vibration analysis in structural engineering many structures are prone to vibrate when excited at or close to natural frequencies kelly 2012 for this reason studying the forced vibration response of the model is very important biot et al 2015 in this study only the vibrations due to shaft line and propellers are studied that are the most significant sources of vibration the bow thruster contribute is not taken into account because is negligible with respect to thrust propellers only the steady state condition have been investigated not considering any transient response by definition the transient state concerns only a temporary range and therefore a limited time than to standard operating condition of the ship to carry out this kind of analysis it is necessary to precisely estimate the excitation forces 3 1 propeller induced vibration in addition to the basic design purpose of generating steady thrust for the ship propulsion propellers also generate undesired fluctuating dynamic forces and moments due to its operation in a non uniform wake caused by interaction of hull and appendages holden et al 1980 wake data are usually presented in iso wake maps where lines are drawn through equal wake points the taylor wake w t is defined as carlton 2012 2 w t 1 v a v s where va is the measured inflow velocity of water to the propeller disk vs id the measured velocity of the ship model these fluctuating forces and moments induced by the propeller at different frequencies are transmitted to the ship structures through the shaft line and the fluctuating pressure generated on the stern hull the load applied to the shaft line are the principle cause of its dynamic behavior instead forces transmitted to the hull through the pressure are the source of the global ship vibration therefore three different forces have been focused in this work which are the main effect induced by the propeller to the hull structures alternating thrust bearing forces that is defined as the force transmitted from the propellers to the thrust bearing hull pressure pulse that is defined as the force transmitted by the propeller to the stern part of the hull and it is described by a pressure field misalignment force that is the force due to the non coincidence between the propeller s center of rotation and the center of the shaft propeller each of these forces have different frequency range of and magnitude so they will be studied singularly in order to estimate their singular contribution in a global vibration analysis 3 1 1 alternating thrust bearing forces the bearing forces are fluctuating stresses generated from the propeller to the thrust bearing through the shaft line and therefore to the hull harnoy 2002 they are dynamic loads caused by a uniform inflow due to wake factor as explained in the paragraph 3 2 effect on the propeller this inflow involves at certain rpm a uniform thrust because some blades could result instant by instant more loaded than other ones the magnitude of the dynamic forces and moments depend on the wake field distribution on the propeller design number of blades skew etc on the ship speed and propeller rotation regime asmussen et al 2001 the main components for the bearing forces are a longitudinal dynamic load coincident with the axis line on which the propeller acts and a bending moment around the coordinated transversal axis deepening this phenomenon the longitudinal load is expressed as a percent of the maximum thrust t0 and the moment is provided in relation with the maximum engine torque the abs rina and gl register suggest a range between 2 and 10 of the maximum longitudinal thrust american bureau of shipping 2008 registro italiano navale 2011 germanischer lloyd 2004 the formulation suggested by the first two classification societies are based on a study dating 1980 veritec 1985 these values of the hydrodynamic forces and moments occurring for 4 5 and 6 bladed propellers are investigated throughout the calculations on 20 merchant ships the results are presented in fig 3 in the numerical model the forces are applied on the propeller s center of mass the thrust is 150 kn so the longitudinal dynamic component is 2 25 kn and the radial one is 1 5 kn 3 1 2 hull pressure pulses the hull vibratory force arises directly from the action of the propeller field induced by the blades and from the velocity field action in the hull which necessitates a reflection response from the hull carlton 2012 the pressures induced on a flat surface of appreciable extent with a similar order of magnitude of propeller diameter axially and transversely are doubled if referred to the same location without surface when the surface is curved or truncated or to one side of the propeller as the skeg area the interaction between surface and propeller is more complicated and difficult to predict by simple techniques there are several contributions to the pressures induces in the field around a propeller for a propeller in uniform inflow and in the absence of other boundaries the pressure is caused by the mean load distribution of the blade and from the thickness or displacing effect of the blade volume bertram 2012 there are many formulations from statistical regressions for the calculation of the pressure pulses depending on the kind of propeller under consideration in this study case the propeller is a non cavitating one it is assumed that the main contribution to the pressure fluctuations on the hull from the non cavitating propellers comes from the blades thickness and from its number moreover the influence of dynamic load on the blades can be neglected the method used for this kind of propeller is the holden method buiten 2012 which calculate the pressure pulses by the following eq 3 3 δ p0 pa 12 45 ρ n 2 d 2 1 z 1 53 t h d 1 33 1 d r h where h 1 8 0 4 d r f o r d r 2 0 h 2 8 f o r d r 2 0 ρ is the density of water n is the number of revolutions n revolutions per minute 60 d is the propeller diameter z is the number of blades th is the thickness at r r 0 7 d is the distance from r r 0 9 when blade is in top position to field point r d 2 in table 1 the propeller geometry is reported instead in table 2 the pressure pulses depending on the rotation regime in rpm and the distance between hull and propeller are calculated in table 2 the distance between hull and propeller is define with the symbol i in addition the distance between hull and propeller is defined in percent of the diameter i d in table 2 the pressure pulse magnitude is identified by the intersection between maximum effective rpm and the distance between hull and propeller a spherical picking have been adopted for the application of the pressure in the numerical model it consists in the selection of all the elements that are within the sphere that has the center in the propeller center of mass and diameter equal to 1 5 times the propeller diameter 3 1 3 misalignment force the exact estimation of the misalignment force cannot be achieved because it is impossible to know the exact shaft eccentricity montalvão e silva and pina da silva 2012 if the shaft is out of balance the resulting centrifugal force will induce the shaft to vibrate actually a perfect alignment between propeller and its shaft is physically impossible to be obtained this motion creates a misalignment force proportional to the eccentricity the weight of the propeller and the shaft rotation regime the equation for the misalignment force is carlton 2012 4 f y z m r ω 2 where r is the eccentricity m is the propeller mass and ω is the shaft rotating speed the following table 3 describe the input values and the resulting force in the numerical model the misalignment force is applied on the propeller center of mass at the frequency range corresponding to the propeller thrust curve as shown in fig 4 the vertical component has a phase of 90 respect the transversal component in order to obtain realistic results 3 1 4 range of frequency of forces and pressures generated by hydrodynamic phenomena once the magnitude of forces and pressures generated by hydrodynamic effects have been calculated the variation of these magnitudes with respect to the frequency range and in particular to the rotation regime of the propeller must be studied in case of yacht with fpp the law can be uniquely identified the propulsion power is proportional to the cube of the shaft rotation regime once having known this law and the maximum propeller speed in this case 452 rpm the graph of the percentage of rpm with respect to the frequency can be created as shown in fig 4 once estimated the law that better describes the propeller s behavior an equation that reflects that relation have to be carried out the distance between blades is constant thus forces momentums and pressures transferred to the shaft could be expressed as a fourier series consisting on components of multiplies of blade passage frequency only the excitation frequencies therefore are 5 f i i z r p m 60 where rpm is the revolutions per minute of the propeller z is the number of propeller s blades i is the integer for example the blade frequency at 1st harmonic i 1 therefore following eq 5 graphs of the percentage of the rotation speed with respect to the frequency for the first and second harmonic is reported respectively in figs 5 and 6 the frequency range interesting the first harmonic is 0 50 hz while the second harmonic is 0 100 hz the aim of this study is investigated the dynamic behavior of the yacht into the range of frequency 0 100 hz the second harmonic is taken into account 4 numerical results an important aspect of a frequency response analysis is the definition of the loading function that have to be defined as a function of frequency in this study case five different loading scenarios have been analyzed one for misalignment force and two for both bearing forces and pressure pulses in order to correctly evaluate the first and second harmonic function respectively in this complex model finding the critical zones could be non trivial and it can take long post processing times theoretically each node of the model could have an independent behavior and potentially it could present an excessive oscillatory behavior at all the analyzed frequencies to avoiding this problem the total enveloped results have been studied it represents the envelope of all maximum vibration velocities in each node of the model considering each frequency the total velocity can also be decomposed in three components describing the principal axis of the model therefore it is possible to evaluate the vibrational velocities of the longitudinal x axis the transversal y axis and the vertical z one by these considerations the critical zones of the model are highlighted in order to evaluate if it is necessary to act in some way to reduce vibration levels in the structure in figs 7 9 the envelope of the maximum velocities due to the bearing force are reported for the three principal components it can be noted that there is a high vibration velocity corresponding to the hull stern in addition the envelope of the maximum values of velocity due to the pressure pulses are checked for the three principal components in this loading scenario there is a high vibration velocity corresponding to the bottom stern zone for the paper length reasons the images of the other results are omitted however the results of second harmonic of blades of both bearing forces and pressure pulse are negligible compared to first harmonic of blade in conclusion for hydrodynamic forces bearing forces and pressure pulses is concerned the bottom stern area has significant vibration levels while for misalignment forces two different zones of the main deck can be considered as critical it must be noted that these two areas are inhabitable so it is important to evaluate the level of vibration because is very dangerous to human health in order to understand if these levels have to be considered not in compliance with the actual regulation in terms of comfort onboard the ffr obtained from the fe results are compared with the limit value given by the iso 6954 1984 in table 4 the vibration limits imposed by the iso 6954 are reported for this reason these enveloped results are analyzed with vibration velocity spectra which are graphs that put frequency in correspondence with velocity goldman 1999 in addition the range of frequency show in fig 10 are used to control that the numerical natural frequencies are in agreement with the reality 4 1 iso 6954 there are not standard for the assessment of the vibration level on the yacht the international organization for standardization iso has issued standards that set the procedure only for merchant vessels as well as the maximum vibration limits the evaluation methodologies of ship vibration ranges within the low frequency range 1 100 hz and the set of vibration limits are provided in the two versions of the standard iso 6954 the first issue of this regulation dates back in 1984 from which the term iso 6954 1984 was introduced the latest review occurred on 2000 hence the code was named iso 6954 2000 the iso 6954 1984 was issued to provide ship designers with guidelines for the vibration measurements on board merchant vessels over 100 m as shown in table 4 the limit values are expressed in acceleration and velocity peaks the standard defines the maximum repetitive value mrv to achieve the peak values from the measured r m s values the mrv is calculated as follows 6 m r v c f 2 v r m s where c f 2 is the crest factor and c f is the conversion factor according to the standard the conversion factor ranges between 1 0 for pure stationary sinusoidal vibration and 1 8 the value to be assigned to the c f coefficient is still the subject of a long and lively debate a relevant criticism to the iso 6954 1984 which was formulated in the report in the issc 2006 in relation to the definition of the mrv cannot be easily defined could be a source of ambiguity in the vibration assessment and development of a procedure to clearly identify the mrv and is still under investigation brocco et al 2015 the situation does not improve in case the mrv is deducted from the r m s value v r m s indeed the standard does not specify the bandwidth and the average time record to be measured for the mrv evaluation and does not define a robust procedure to evaluate c f moreover the mrv can be obtained from a frequency spectrum if the latter is known in this case its value varies depending on the acquisition parameters i e block size and resolution thereby increasing the uncertainty on the outcomes of the measurement surveys the concept of overall frequency weighted r m s was introduced in 1997 to address the multi frequency phenomena with a crest factor c f lower than 9 the typical vibration signals measured on board are generally well below this value the definition of a generic quantity g in terms of the overall frequency weighted r m s in time domain or in spectral terms is defined as follows 7 g w 1 t 0 t g w 2 t d t 8 g w i w i g i 2 where t is the period of the time record g w is the weighted quantity acceleration or velocity w i is the weight function of the i th band and g i is the r m s value of the i th frequency band the measurements performed according to this procedure provide results that are highly insensitive compared to those obtained by measurements performed according to the version of the standard issued in 1984 which means that the ambiguity and the arbitrariness related to the definition of the mrv have been removed moreover the introduction of high quality and powerful digital acquisition systems allows the overall analysis of the acquired data and the integration on the entire frequency range which does not affect the diagnostic capabilities provided by the acquisition in narrowband specified by the previous iso all the reasons listed above led to the alignment of rule iso 6954 to this new approach in 2000 iso standard 6954 1984 presents a suitable formulation that allows the designers to include the vibratory aspect in the design procedure the advantage of the 1984 approach is that the dynamic response of the vessel can be assessed with respect to the maximum exciting force by fixing a limit for a single harmonic component among the possible exciting forces this means that the calculations are reduced to determine the dynamic response of the ship excited by the first propeller blade frequencies first axial exciting frequencies of the propeller and engine and cylinder firing rates of the prime engines these input data for the simulation of the ship structural dynamics are usually available in the early design stage and can be performed using a fe analysis a standard that does not provide the designers with the ability to predict and control the quality of the product with a reasonable accuracy in the early design stages clearly constitutes an issue in some cases this is what happens with iso 6954 2000 final outcomes indeed the energy approach integrates the whole frequency band of the measured vibration levels implying that all the harmonic contributions within the frequency range 1 80 hz are included in the analysis this approach is not easily manageable in numerical analyses because the characteristics of the sources the capability to reproduce the vibratory response of the vessel and the analysis of outcomes of the simulations in terms of the weighted velocity levels are not directly identifiable generally speaking the exciting frequencies that can be found in the frequency ranges 1 and 80 hz are as follows multiple harmonics of the fundamental blade pass propeller broadband contribution resulting from cavitation effects and higher harmonics of the fundamental frequencies of the main machinery according to the newest iso standard all these contributions should be estimated in advance in terms of intensity and frequency then added and weighted the values obtained in this analysis should later be compared with the proposed thresholds one of the challenges of this approach is the high uncertainty on the simulation of cavitating propellers in a dynamic structural analysis without focusing on the complex cavitation problems different types of cavitation can be observed in the marine propellers the first one consists of phenomena located on the blade surface bubble sheet and cloud cavitation the second one is related to flow turbulence phenomena tip or hub vortex cavitation and hull vortex cavitation the sheet cavitation is generally responsible for the presence of a high harmonic frequency of the blade which is usually up to the fifth harmonic component while tip vortex cavitation and breaking vortex cavitation would be the source of broadband noise on a limited frequency range nowadays the intensity of the first two harmonics of the blade frequency is predictable with good reliability meanwhile the estimation of the higher harmonics is still affected by a significant uncertainty the determination of the broadband noise generated by the tip vortex cavitation is affected by the lack of knowledge on the generating mechanisms and the elements that contribute to produce it as for example the viscosity compressibility and inhomogeneity of the wake for design purposes the procedures proposed by the standards should be compatible with the technical resources of the yards moreover the standard requires that the entire energy content of the main sources and of the dynamic structural response should be considered this significantly increases the level of uncertainty in the prediction indeed the identification of the vibration sources that generate high vibration levels of the ship structures and of the effective solutions to mitigate these excessive vibration levels becomes more complex using this approach for these reasons the vibration velocity spectra obtained from the numerical model are compared with the limits imposed by the iso 6954 1984 4 2 vibration velocity spectra in fig 11 the variation of the velocity of the node with the higher level of vibration on the stern area is reported it can be noted a resonance of 10 03 mm s at 37 4 hz which corresponds about an 80 of maximum continuous rating mcr that is the cruising condition so it will be necessary to deeply study this configuration this value must multiplied by the cf 1 8 and it is not in compliance with regulation provided by all the registers the other resonances highlighted in fig 12 correspond to propulsion condition not commonly used during the yacht lifetime for this reason only the study on the resonance peak at 37 4 hz have been carried out as it was expected the most significant component is the vertical vibration velocity in fig 12 the vibration of the stern zone is reported at 37 4 hz as it can be seen there is a plating oscillation which is very dangerous for the yacht habitability for completion reasons in figs 13 and 14 the velocity vibration spectra of the upper and sun deck have been reported as shown in the previous chapter the pressure pulses have a similar behavior of bearing forces these results could be considered reliable because the physical nature of these two loading condition is comparable fig 15 illustrates the vvs of the node on the stern with higher vibration velocity comparing the vvs reported in fig 11 with fig 15 the vibration velocity of is clearly lower the maximum value is equal to 3 25 mm s and must be multiplied by the cf 1 8 so the value 5 85 mm s is in the limit imposed by the iso 6954 1984 in this study case the misalignment force effect affects an important area of the yacht such as the main deck where the living zone is located in figs 16 and 17 the vvs of two nodes with the higher vibration level on the main deck are respectively reported as for the bearing force two different resonances can be noted one of them at 6 03 and another at 7 2 hz the first peak corresponds to the cruising condition at 80 of mcr in this cruising condition the vibration velocity is up to 21 mm s that as mentioned earlier it is cannot be considered acceptable for all the registers the second resonance corresponds to the 100 of mcr usually this cruising condition is not common in the vessel s day life however it is important to avoid uncomfortable resonances and so to project a yacht structure able to damp it even for the maximum speed condition as mentioned for the bearing force the most valuable component is the vertical vibration velocity in this case other components are completely negligible in fig 18 the vibration at 6 03 hz induced by the misalignment force is reported fig 18 also highlights an undesired high amplitude vibration for the main deck this consideration is also confirmed by the vvs reported in fig 19 for a node on the main deck it means that in this loading scenario a damping increase for the entire yacht structure is mandatory also in this case the peak corresponding to the frequency of the 80 of mcr is clearly visible it can be concluded that any solution adopted for the reduction of the vibration level have to be focused on this critical frequency 5 solutions to the vibrational effects the considerations carried out in the previous chapter on the vvs for the different load cases have highlighted the most critical areas in which the capability of the structure to damp vibrations induced by hydrodynamic forces has to be improved this achievement should be accomplished by more or less invading structural modifications these modifications could be extremely complicated to be carried out because modifying an already built structure could deteriorate other vessel s characteristics static architectural etc in this case study two critical resonance frequencies are found one on the craft stern due to hydrodynamic forces 37 04 hz and one on the main deck due to misalignment force 6 03 hz both problems have a high resonance close to cruising condition 80 of mcr and exceed the maximum value of vibration limit imposed by the iso 6954 the herein proposed solutions are based on two different philosophies the increase of the structural stiffness and the use of a tuned mass damped tmd pais and boote 2017 the tmd allows to shift the resonance at a different frequency in the following chapters the procedures used for both stern and main deck problems are explained 5 1 increase of structural stiffness in order to accomplish the aforementioned task by increasing the structural stiffness in the critical areas beams reinforcements transversal or longitudinal fire bars and shell thickness can be modified dealing with the high vibration level in the vessel s stern two different solutions are herein investigated one by increasing the plating thickness of the and the other one by introducing a transverse reinforcement fire bar to reduce the resonance peak in fig 20 the increased thickness of the main deck is shown the red area 7 mm instead of 6 mm identify the modified stern part in order to stiffen the whole structure this solution if studied in the late design stages when the hull is almost completed with the furniture integration is very difficult and expensive to be carried out in fig 21 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the modified one is reported as it can be seen from fig 21 the resonance frequency is not affected by the proposed modification by the way the vibration amplitude has been reduced to 8 5 mm s that multiplied by cf 1 8 in any case is not acceptable for the iso standard it can be concluded that the thickness increase do not significantly increase the capability of the structure to damp critical vibration level in order to have appreciable results the thickness should be increased to too much higher value that compromise the global weight in order to overcome these complications a more refined solution have been tested in this case the structure stiffness has been increased by using fire bars located between two transverse reinforcements in order to split the longitudinal reinforcements span in fig 22 fire bars are shown in yellow bares are made in aluminum light alloy with 6130 mm length 50 mm height and 5 mm thickness the total increase of weight is 5 8 kg in fig 23 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the one with fire bars is reported the comparison proposed in fig 23 highlights a structural dynamic behavior comparable with the solution proposed in fig 21 for the thickness increase by the way the maximum vibration velocity is significantly reduced even though the resonance frequency has not been shifted the remarkable difference between the two solutions is that in the case of fire bars the vibration limit 4 8 mm s by cf 1 8 complies with iso 9654 this structural integration is also less invading than the previous one and it can be carried out even in the late design stages with moderate costs dealing with the misalignment force a more drastic remedy have to be use because the very high vibration velocity affects the entire main deck and not only a portion of it as it happens for pressure pulse and bearing load so two pillars fig 24 in red have been designed and located in proper areas in order to satisfy the requirement in terms of interior design they do not have to be located in the middle of large open living areas and in terms of structural dynamic response the stern pillar has been located in the crew room and the bow pillar in the engine room this solution even though have to be carefully studied to avoid any interaction with the interior habitability is the most valuable because have the doubled effect of reducing resonance peak and shift resonance frequency in fig 25 the comparison of the vvs due to misalignment force for the original structure and the one with pillars is reported adopting this solution the main deck criticism has been solved the higher vibration velocity corresponding to the 100 mcr has been limited to 1 8 mm s multiplied by cf 1 8 it is 3 24 mm s therefore it can be concluded that as it could be expected the installation of one or more pillar onboard is most valuable solution but it must be noted that it is not always possible because of interior design and habitability s tasks 5 2 tuned mass solution the tuned masses damper consists in a mass a spring and a damper linked to a vibrating system in order to reduce the dynamic response of the structure usually the damper is provide by an auxiliary system connected to the main structure soong and rana 1998 soong and spencer 2002 the mass is calculated in order to damp a particular natural frequency of the structure in which it tends to have a resonance peak the damper will resonate out of phase with the structural motion in order to decrease the amplitude and to shift the resonance frequency in fig 26 a typical arrangement of the tuned mass damper tmd in a structural system with one degree of freedom is shown harris and piersol 2002 these devices are considered dynamic vibration absorbers the working principle is to eliminate the resonance frequency of the main structure in two new resonances with less amplitude and different frequencies as mentioned earlier the natural frequency must be equal to the frequency of the mass damper connor and laflamme 2014 the following notation is used to calculate the device parameters the subscript d refers to the tuned mass damper 9 ω 2 k m k d m d ω d 2 the equivalent mass is defined as the ratio of the two masses 10 m e q m d m with the combination of eqs 9 and 10 the device stiffness can be calculated as it follows 11 k d m e q k if the auxiliary mass system has no damping and is tuned to the forcing frequency it acts as a dynamic absorber and enforces a node at its point of attachment the damper s geometry must be designed in order to be adapted to the available space between longitudinal reinforcements for this reasons the absorber device is composed by an aluminum beam with i transversal section and two concentrated masses are located at the end of each beam in table 5 the dimensions of the tuned mass system used in this study case in order to modify the resonance frequency at 37 04 hz are reported two mass of 25 kg are located at the end of the beam the mass damper was collocated corresponding to the longitudinal reinforcement which has the maximum vibration velocity in fig 27 the position of the tuned mass system is shown in fig 28 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the one with tmd is reported in this case the original frequency peak has been shifted with a remarkable velocity reduction to 39 hz i e the 90 of mcr it is the engine firing frequency and it corresponds to an operative cruising condition so the designed tmd device cannot be considered a valuable solution in a further step of the dynamic absorber solution three tmd are located in the principal structure the system remains the same described previously but they have been positioned in three different location reinforcement the same span distance this further solution has been designed with the aim to shift the resonance at lower frequencies with respect to the 80 of mcr in order to have it in a transitory navigation condition in this case the total weight of the tuned mass damper is 150 kg star side and 150 kg port side in fig 29 the location of the three tmd is shown in fig 30 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the one with three tmd is reported the peak has been shifted from the 80 to the 75 of mcr which can be considered as a transitory condition by the way results in terms of vibration velocity reduction does not reflect what it was expected in any case being this solution designed to shift the original resonance frequency it can be considered as a positive starting point for the study of an alternative and innovative way to improve the dynamic response properties of a superyacht structure in conclusion in the following fig 31 the comparison of the herein proposed solution has been reported 6 conclusions the aim of this study was the evaluation of the dynamic response of a superyacht structure by using the finite element method an analytic study of the problem has been carried out and in the future measurements and calculations will be perform onboard of the superyacht in order to validate the results previously obtained a numerical model of a motor yacht of 40 m has been performed for these achievements after the description of the excitation sources have been applied to the model and the forced vibration analysis has been carried out the problem of excessive vibration level with respect to the ongoing rules about comfort onboard has been solved with two different approaches in order to design a structure complying with iso standards the first design philosophy is to increase the stiffness in the zones with high level of vibration velocities in order to decrease the peak corresponding to the natural frequency of the craft it is a solution largely used in marine industries and it provides valuable results the second approach provide the use of tuned mass damper this solution represents an innovative way in yacht manufactory and it operates to shift the resonance peak away from the natural frequency in this case study it was the 80 of mcr in fig 31 it can be noted that the tmd has a more satisfactory results but provides a significant weight increase which in the yacht manufactory is not always possible for this reason the stiffening solution is still the best way to prevent vibration problems in early design stages nevertheless in late design stages or after sea trials when the craft is finished structural modifications could be very expensive because they requires to unassembled all the furniture in order to act directly to the metallic structure the future development of this research activity will be performed sea trials to tune the numerical model acknowledgments authors are thanks to eng angelo tonelli from rina services s p a and to eng davide nuzzo for his kind availability

23499,yacht designers and builders are continuously looking for new solutions to reduce construction costs and to improve the quality and innovation of their vessels in the case of superyachts over 30 m in length performances are no longer a primary goal and the efforts of technical offices are mostly addressed on other aspects related to the aesthetic impact of the project and to the on board comfort from this point of view vibrations and noise represent a difficult issues to deal with for designers both in the initial phase of the project when it is necessary to have preliminary information about the response of the structure not yet defined and during construction in case some critical behaviors arose in any part of the structure in this paper the dynamic behavior of a 40 m motor yacht is investigated the vibration velocity spectra obtained by the numerical model of the yacht are compared with the value of level limits imposed by the iso6954 1984 different structural solutions are investigate to improve the comfort level in same area not in compliance with the rule keywords comfort analysis finite elements models frequency response function frf pillars tuned mass damper 1 introduction the commercial success of recreational boats of any dimension depends on several aspects related on one side to the objective technical tasks and on the other side to more subjective aesthetical characteristics before the recent financial crisis the very positive situation of yacht market allowed the designers to exercise all their creativity giving rise to as innovative as disputable projects beyond the related commercial risk this philosophy had the objective to attract potential owners and going over the many passionate competitors in this perspective however the on board comfort hold a secondary position often relegated to the personal feeling of the designer who didn t worry at all to sacrifice it in advantage of other more remarkable performances boote et al 2013 with the rising of the 2008 global crisis the competition in the superyacht field was further exacerbated in this way also by troubling minor shipyards while confirming the prestige of other more experienced ones that continued to focus on yacht quality and reliability this was particularly evident for large motor yachts for which due to their high value design tasks should be achieved with great attention to any detail influencing the final quality of the product or and the owner s approval while the innovative technical aspects were dissected in all perspective onboard comfort remains a matter to be investigated moro et al 2013 the first regulation for verify the conformity of merchant ships crews and later the definition of class notations for passenger ships dates back to 1984 from which the term iso 6954 1984 the latest review occurred on 2000 so that the code is named iso 6954 2000 the value limits imposed by the regulation are very restrict and given the objective difficulty in making any change to the dynamic behavior of hull structure after construction it is extremely important to perform fem predictive analyses to identify the natural frequency of the hull and of local structures such as decks and bulkheads and then their response to exciting loads induced by propellers engines and waves pais et al 2017 in this paper the dynamic behavior of a 40 m motor yacht has been investigated by using the finite element method fem an investigation on the most influencing excitation sources as well as the influence of the main simplifications adopted in the numerical model have been also carried out biot et al 2015 the frequency response analysis have highlighted different living areas not complying with iso 6945 1984 the authors have prefer to use the iso 6954 1984 because this rule allows verifying the response of the structure at each excitation source in order to reduce the vibration peak level that would compromise the habitability onboard three different structural solution have been identified and tested a thickness increase in the critical areas the use of stiffened bars and the installation of tuned mass damper tmd device pais and boote 2017 2 numerical model the vessel assumed as a study case is a particular type of craft named cabin cruiser 40 m long and 8 m wide in aluminum composed by large internal areas distributed on three decks main upper and sun deck generally these crafts are subdivided in internal and external areas the internal one is composed by two living spaces the first called daily includes the main saloon the kitchen and the steering console the second one is conceived for nighttime so cabins and toilets characterize it the external area is provided by a large aft cockpit and an area to enjoy the sun above the superstructure the craft has an open space called fly bridge where is placed an equipped external zone and others steering command console generally it represents the helm position in fig 1 an illustrating picture of the boat is reported the structural modelling of this vessel is the most challenging part of any efficient method for vibration analysis prediction it is very important that structures are reproduced clearly and detailed in order to have an accuracy of results in vibration terms boote et al 2013 by the way the real structural scheme of the yacht is extremely complicated to be reported in a fe model hence it necessary to use some basic approximations that should be carried out in order to have an optimal compromise between reality and the study case another aspect that have to be taken into account in this kind of investigation is to achieve an adequate ratio between result reliability and computational time and costs being the vibration global analysis the aim of this study it is important that the structural hierarchy is respected asmussen et al 2001 the principal reinforcements transverse and longitudinal and all the principal structure as decks and bulkheads should be modelled in a truthful way as better as possible because these structures influence the frequency response the secondary reinforcements as longitudinal stiffeners are modelled in a truthful way to have accurate results the local reinforcements grate bars brackets are neglected because they do not influence results however they were take account in the weights distribution as it will be discuss forward once the modelling accuracy is established the discretization of model is performed as first step the complete 3d cad model of the hull provided by the shipyard is imported in the pre processor software for the dynamic analysis the fineness of the mesh is decisive moro et al 2013 in principle the minimum number of grid points to capture a wave shaped deformation is five but in practice this is the double klyukin 1963 any fe model should be generated according to such simple consideration recalling the fact that larger elements of the mesh grid make the model stiffer and that by limiting the number of grid points a reduction of modelling and calculation time may be obtained in this study the dimension of the mesh is defined starting from the equation of flexural vibrations of a thin plate corradi 2012 in this study six grid point are chosen to represent the wavelength and with a shell elements dimensions of 300 mm it is possible obtained a wavelength correspond to frequency of 35 hz to create a complete model of a superyacht is very difficult so the principle shell element dimensions is 300 mm although small variations about the nominal value are possible in the model the mesh was created using shell elements for plating and main reinforcements such as keelsons floors and girders for secondary stiffeners simple beam elements have been preferred to keep the model dimension as low as possible the yacht has a typical propulsion system for this kind of units in the specific there are two main diesel engines with 2580 kw power 3 5 t weight each and the mass moments correspondent are jxx 221 kg m2 jyy 553 kg m2 jzz 221 kg m2 the engine system has been modelled by using punctual masses where their weight is described by a 0 d element located in the engines center of gravity engines are connected to the hull by resilient mountings which are located in four different areas in the basement in order to better distribute the engine s weight the resilient mounts have been modelled by spring linear elements in order to take account to stiffness constants in the three directions the mounts are t35 ha sh 55 and the stiffness constant of mounts is the same in all the three direction i e 2500 n mm vulkan 2014 dealing with the rigid link between engine and resilient mountings four rbe2 elements is chosen which allow to rigidly transferring the inertial forces of the mass with six degrees of freedom the same approach have been used for linkage two generators at the base in addition the shaft line the brackets and the bearing support of the shaft have been modelled with beam elements instead the propeller has been modelled adding a punctual mass and relative moments of inertia its value have been provided by the shipyard and it has been corrected in order to take into account the added mass i e an addition of the 50 of the propeller mass as mentioned before the machinery weight the propulsion system propellers generators and engines have been modelled as concentrated masses at this point the model has a weight not corresponding to the lightweight ship condition because the weight of the all furniture insulations plants floors etc lacks the shipyard for the part of the deck inside for example saloon rooms etc has suggested the value 100 130 kg m2 and for the deck outside about 40 kg m2 these kinds of loads cannot be treated as concentrated masses but it is necessary to use uniform distributions therefore non structural mass command is used the nonstructural mass defined on the property entries is mass that is added to the structure in addition to the structural mass from the elements the total weight of the lightweight ship condition is 214 tons the loading condition of this study case was not the lightship one but 6 tons of liquid in the tanks must be added moreover the liquid is distributed in 2 tons in stern tanks and 4 tons in bow ones in order to achieve this distribution non structural masses have been used compared to other vehicles ships are more complicate because they work in a fluid that leads high inertial effects due to a high specific weight of the fluid when the ship hull vibrates in the surrounding water pressure fluctuations are excited this effect could be simulated by adding a mass of water that cooperate with the structure called added mass korotkin 2007 to take into account the added mass in the numerical model the nastran card called mfluid is used and it refers to the boundary element method sauter and schwab 2010 this function is defined as the properties of an incompressible fluid volume generating a virtual mass matrix this command can consider the presence of internal tanks or external added mass fluids to solve a vibration problem on ship structures a high level of uncertainties is associated to the total damping forces governing the amplitudes of oscillations of the structure de silva 2007 effects of energy dissipations are usually accounted by a damping coefficient ξ i e the critical damping it is define as the ratio between the actual damping c and the critical damping c r 1 ξ c c r usually its value is defined by a range between 0 1 and 0 5 or 1 5 depending on the author the value 0 01 corresponding to 1 hz and 0 1 corresponding to 100 hz has been established and used for this work the numerical model is completed as shown in fig 2 3 forced vibration analysis in structural engineering many structures are prone to vibrate when excited at or close to natural frequencies kelly 2012 for this reason studying the forced vibration response of the model is very important biot et al 2015 in this study only the vibrations due to shaft line and propellers are studied that are the most significant sources of vibration the bow thruster contribute is not taken into account because is negligible with respect to thrust propellers only the steady state condition have been investigated not considering any transient response by definition the transient state concerns only a temporary range and therefore a limited time than to standard operating condition of the ship to carry out this kind of analysis it is necessary to precisely estimate the excitation forces 3 1 propeller induced vibration in addition to the basic design purpose of generating steady thrust for the ship propulsion propellers also generate undesired fluctuating dynamic forces and moments due to its operation in a non uniform wake caused by interaction of hull and appendages holden et al 1980 wake data are usually presented in iso wake maps where lines are drawn through equal wake points the taylor wake w t is defined as carlton 2012 2 w t 1 v a v s where va is the measured inflow velocity of water to the propeller disk vs id the measured velocity of the ship model these fluctuating forces and moments induced by the propeller at different frequencies are transmitted to the ship structures through the shaft line and the fluctuating pressure generated on the stern hull the load applied to the shaft line are the principle cause of its dynamic behavior instead forces transmitted to the hull through the pressure are the source of the global ship vibration therefore three different forces have been focused in this work which are the main effect induced by the propeller to the hull structures alternating thrust bearing forces that is defined as the force transmitted from the propellers to the thrust bearing hull pressure pulse that is defined as the force transmitted by the propeller to the stern part of the hull and it is described by a pressure field misalignment force that is the force due to the non coincidence between the propeller s center of rotation and the center of the shaft propeller each of these forces have different frequency range of and magnitude so they will be studied singularly in order to estimate their singular contribution in a global vibration analysis 3 1 1 alternating thrust bearing forces the bearing forces are fluctuating stresses generated from the propeller to the thrust bearing through the shaft line and therefore to the hull harnoy 2002 they are dynamic loads caused by a uniform inflow due to wake factor as explained in the paragraph 3 2 effect on the propeller this inflow involves at certain rpm a uniform thrust because some blades could result instant by instant more loaded than other ones the magnitude of the dynamic forces and moments depend on the wake field distribution on the propeller design number of blades skew etc on the ship speed and propeller rotation regime asmussen et al 2001 the main components for the bearing forces are a longitudinal dynamic load coincident with the axis line on which the propeller acts and a bending moment around the coordinated transversal axis deepening this phenomenon the longitudinal load is expressed as a percent of the maximum thrust t0 and the moment is provided in relation with the maximum engine torque the abs rina and gl register suggest a range between 2 and 10 of the maximum longitudinal thrust american bureau of shipping 2008 registro italiano navale 2011 germanischer lloyd 2004 the formulation suggested by the first two classification societies are based on a study dating 1980 veritec 1985 these values of the hydrodynamic forces and moments occurring for 4 5 and 6 bladed propellers are investigated throughout the calculations on 20 merchant ships the results are presented in fig 3 in the numerical model the forces are applied on the propeller s center of mass the thrust is 150 kn so the longitudinal dynamic component is 2 25 kn and the radial one is 1 5 kn 3 1 2 hull pressure pulses the hull vibratory force arises directly from the action of the propeller field induced by the blades and from the velocity field action in the hull which necessitates a reflection response from the hull carlton 2012 the pressures induced on a flat surface of appreciable extent with a similar order of magnitude of propeller diameter axially and transversely are doubled if referred to the same location without surface when the surface is curved or truncated or to one side of the propeller as the skeg area the interaction between surface and propeller is more complicated and difficult to predict by simple techniques there are several contributions to the pressures induces in the field around a propeller for a propeller in uniform inflow and in the absence of other boundaries the pressure is caused by the mean load distribution of the blade and from the thickness or displacing effect of the blade volume bertram 2012 there are many formulations from statistical regressions for the calculation of the pressure pulses depending on the kind of propeller under consideration in this study case the propeller is a non cavitating one it is assumed that the main contribution to the pressure fluctuations on the hull from the non cavitating propellers comes from the blades thickness and from its number moreover the influence of dynamic load on the blades can be neglected the method used for this kind of propeller is the holden method buiten 2012 which calculate the pressure pulses by the following eq 3 3 δ p0 pa 12 45 ρ n 2 d 2 1 z 1 53 t h d 1 33 1 d r h where h 1 8 0 4 d r f o r d r 2 0 h 2 8 f o r d r 2 0 ρ is the density of water n is the number of revolutions n revolutions per minute 60 d is the propeller diameter z is the number of blades th is the thickness at r r 0 7 d is the distance from r r 0 9 when blade is in top position to field point r d 2 in table 1 the propeller geometry is reported instead in table 2 the pressure pulses depending on the rotation regime in rpm and the distance between hull and propeller are calculated in table 2 the distance between hull and propeller is define with the symbol i in addition the distance between hull and propeller is defined in percent of the diameter i d in table 2 the pressure pulse magnitude is identified by the intersection between maximum effective rpm and the distance between hull and propeller a spherical picking have been adopted for the application of the pressure in the numerical model it consists in the selection of all the elements that are within the sphere that has the center in the propeller center of mass and diameter equal to 1 5 times the propeller diameter 3 1 3 misalignment force the exact estimation of the misalignment force cannot be achieved because it is impossible to know the exact shaft eccentricity montalvão e silva and pina da silva 2012 if the shaft is out of balance the resulting centrifugal force will induce the shaft to vibrate actually a perfect alignment between propeller and its shaft is physically impossible to be obtained this motion creates a misalignment force proportional to the eccentricity the weight of the propeller and the shaft rotation regime the equation for the misalignment force is carlton 2012 4 f y z m r ω 2 where r is the eccentricity m is the propeller mass and ω is the shaft rotating speed the following table 3 describe the input values and the resulting force in the numerical model the misalignment force is applied on the propeller center of mass at the frequency range corresponding to the propeller thrust curve as shown in fig 4 the vertical component has a phase of 90 respect the transversal component in order to obtain realistic results 3 1 4 range of frequency of forces and pressures generated by hydrodynamic phenomena once the magnitude of forces and pressures generated by hydrodynamic effects have been calculated the variation of these magnitudes with respect to the frequency range and in particular to the rotation regime of the propeller must be studied in case of yacht with fpp the law can be uniquely identified the propulsion power is proportional to the cube of the shaft rotation regime once having known this law and the maximum propeller speed in this case 452 rpm the graph of the percentage of rpm with respect to the frequency can be created as shown in fig 4 once estimated the law that better describes the propeller s behavior an equation that reflects that relation have to be carried out the distance between blades is constant thus forces momentums and pressures transferred to the shaft could be expressed as a fourier series consisting on components of multiplies of blade passage frequency only the excitation frequencies therefore are 5 f i i z r p m 60 where rpm is the revolutions per minute of the propeller z is the number of propeller s blades i is the integer for example the blade frequency at 1st harmonic i 1 therefore following eq 5 graphs of the percentage of the rotation speed with respect to the frequency for the first and second harmonic is reported respectively in figs 5 and 6 the frequency range interesting the first harmonic is 0 50 hz while the second harmonic is 0 100 hz the aim of this study is investigated the dynamic behavior of the yacht into the range of frequency 0 100 hz the second harmonic is taken into account 4 numerical results an important aspect of a frequency response analysis is the definition of the loading function that have to be defined as a function of frequency in this study case five different loading scenarios have been analyzed one for misalignment force and two for both bearing forces and pressure pulses in order to correctly evaluate the first and second harmonic function respectively in this complex model finding the critical zones could be non trivial and it can take long post processing times theoretically each node of the model could have an independent behavior and potentially it could present an excessive oscillatory behavior at all the analyzed frequencies to avoiding this problem the total enveloped results have been studied it represents the envelope of all maximum vibration velocities in each node of the model considering each frequency the total velocity can also be decomposed in three components describing the principal axis of the model therefore it is possible to evaluate the vibrational velocities of the longitudinal x axis the transversal y axis and the vertical z one by these considerations the critical zones of the model are highlighted in order to evaluate if it is necessary to act in some way to reduce vibration levels in the structure in figs 7 9 the envelope of the maximum velocities due to the bearing force are reported for the three principal components it can be noted that there is a high vibration velocity corresponding to the hull stern in addition the envelope of the maximum values of velocity due to the pressure pulses are checked for the three principal components in this loading scenario there is a high vibration velocity corresponding to the bottom stern zone for the paper length reasons the images of the other results are omitted however the results of second harmonic of blades of both bearing forces and pressure pulse are negligible compared to first harmonic of blade in conclusion for hydrodynamic forces bearing forces and pressure pulses is concerned the bottom stern area has significant vibration levels while for misalignment forces two different zones of the main deck can be considered as critical it must be noted that these two areas are inhabitable so it is important to evaluate the level of vibration because is very dangerous to human health in order to understand if these levels have to be considered not in compliance with the actual regulation in terms of comfort onboard the ffr obtained from the fe results are compared with the limit value given by the iso 6954 1984 in table 4 the vibration limits imposed by the iso 6954 are reported for this reason these enveloped results are analyzed with vibration velocity spectra which are graphs that put frequency in correspondence with velocity goldman 1999 in addition the range of frequency show in fig 10 are used to control that the numerical natural frequencies are in agreement with the reality 4 1 iso 6954 there are not standard for the assessment of the vibration level on the yacht the international organization for standardization iso has issued standards that set the procedure only for merchant vessels as well as the maximum vibration limits the evaluation methodologies of ship vibration ranges within the low frequency range 1 100 hz and the set of vibration limits are provided in the two versions of the standard iso 6954 the first issue of this regulation dates back in 1984 from which the term iso 6954 1984 was introduced the latest review occurred on 2000 hence the code was named iso 6954 2000 the iso 6954 1984 was issued to provide ship designers with guidelines for the vibration measurements on board merchant vessels over 100 m as shown in table 4 the limit values are expressed in acceleration and velocity peaks the standard defines the maximum repetitive value mrv to achieve the peak values from the measured r m s values the mrv is calculated as follows 6 m r v c f 2 v r m s where c f 2 is the crest factor and c f is the conversion factor according to the standard the conversion factor ranges between 1 0 for pure stationary sinusoidal vibration and 1 8 the value to be assigned to the c f coefficient is still the subject of a long and lively debate a relevant criticism to the iso 6954 1984 which was formulated in the report in the issc 2006 in relation to the definition of the mrv cannot be easily defined could be a source of ambiguity in the vibration assessment and development of a procedure to clearly identify the mrv and is still under investigation brocco et al 2015 the situation does not improve in case the mrv is deducted from the r m s value v r m s indeed the standard does not specify the bandwidth and the average time record to be measured for the mrv evaluation and does not define a robust procedure to evaluate c f moreover the mrv can be obtained from a frequency spectrum if the latter is known in this case its value varies depending on the acquisition parameters i e block size and resolution thereby increasing the uncertainty on the outcomes of the measurement surveys the concept of overall frequency weighted r m s was introduced in 1997 to address the multi frequency phenomena with a crest factor c f lower than 9 the typical vibration signals measured on board are generally well below this value the definition of a generic quantity g in terms of the overall frequency weighted r m s in time domain or in spectral terms is defined as follows 7 g w 1 t 0 t g w 2 t d t 8 g w i w i g i 2 where t is the period of the time record g w is the weighted quantity acceleration or velocity w i is the weight function of the i th band and g i is the r m s value of the i th frequency band the measurements performed according to this procedure provide results that are highly insensitive compared to those obtained by measurements performed according to the version of the standard issued in 1984 which means that the ambiguity and the arbitrariness related to the definition of the mrv have been removed moreover the introduction of high quality and powerful digital acquisition systems allows the overall analysis of the acquired data and the integration on the entire frequency range which does not affect the diagnostic capabilities provided by the acquisition in narrowband specified by the previous iso all the reasons listed above led to the alignment of rule iso 6954 to this new approach in 2000 iso standard 6954 1984 presents a suitable formulation that allows the designers to include the vibratory aspect in the design procedure the advantage of the 1984 approach is that the dynamic response of the vessel can be assessed with respect to the maximum exciting force by fixing a limit for a single harmonic component among the possible exciting forces this means that the calculations are reduced to determine the dynamic response of the ship excited by the first propeller blade frequencies first axial exciting frequencies of the propeller and engine and cylinder firing rates of the prime engines these input data for the simulation of the ship structural dynamics are usually available in the early design stage and can be performed using a fe analysis a standard that does not provide the designers with the ability to predict and control the quality of the product with a reasonable accuracy in the early design stages clearly constitutes an issue in some cases this is what happens with iso 6954 2000 final outcomes indeed the energy approach integrates the whole frequency band of the measured vibration levels implying that all the harmonic contributions within the frequency range 1 80 hz are included in the analysis this approach is not easily manageable in numerical analyses because the characteristics of the sources the capability to reproduce the vibratory response of the vessel and the analysis of outcomes of the simulations in terms of the weighted velocity levels are not directly identifiable generally speaking the exciting frequencies that can be found in the frequency ranges 1 and 80 hz are as follows multiple harmonics of the fundamental blade pass propeller broadband contribution resulting from cavitation effects and higher harmonics of the fundamental frequencies of the main machinery according to the newest iso standard all these contributions should be estimated in advance in terms of intensity and frequency then added and weighted the values obtained in this analysis should later be compared with the proposed thresholds one of the challenges of this approach is the high uncertainty on the simulation of cavitating propellers in a dynamic structural analysis without focusing on the complex cavitation problems different types of cavitation can be observed in the marine propellers the first one consists of phenomena located on the blade surface bubble sheet and cloud cavitation the second one is related to flow turbulence phenomena tip or hub vortex cavitation and hull vortex cavitation the sheet cavitation is generally responsible for the presence of a high harmonic frequency of the blade which is usually up to the fifth harmonic component while tip vortex cavitation and breaking vortex cavitation would be the source of broadband noise on a limited frequency range nowadays the intensity of the first two harmonics of the blade frequency is predictable with good reliability meanwhile the estimation of the higher harmonics is still affected by a significant uncertainty the determination of the broadband noise generated by the tip vortex cavitation is affected by the lack of knowledge on the generating mechanisms and the elements that contribute to produce it as for example the viscosity compressibility and inhomogeneity of the wake for design purposes the procedures proposed by the standards should be compatible with the technical resources of the yards moreover the standard requires that the entire energy content of the main sources and of the dynamic structural response should be considered this significantly increases the level of uncertainty in the prediction indeed the identification of the vibration sources that generate high vibration levels of the ship structures and of the effective solutions to mitigate these excessive vibration levels becomes more complex using this approach for these reasons the vibration velocity spectra obtained from the numerical model are compared with the limits imposed by the iso 6954 1984 4 2 vibration velocity spectra in fig 11 the variation of the velocity of the node with the higher level of vibration on the stern area is reported it can be noted a resonance of 10 03 mm s at 37 4 hz which corresponds about an 80 of maximum continuous rating mcr that is the cruising condition so it will be necessary to deeply study this configuration this value must multiplied by the cf 1 8 and it is not in compliance with regulation provided by all the registers the other resonances highlighted in fig 12 correspond to propulsion condition not commonly used during the yacht lifetime for this reason only the study on the resonance peak at 37 4 hz have been carried out as it was expected the most significant component is the vertical vibration velocity in fig 12 the vibration of the stern zone is reported at 37 4 hz as it can be seen there is a plating oscillation which is very dangerous for the yacht habitability for completion reasons in figs 13 and 14 the velocity vibration spectra of the upper and sun deck have been reported as shown in the previous chapter the pressure pulses have a similar behavior of bearing forces these results could be considered reliable because the physical nature of these two loading condition is comparable fig 15 illustrates the vvs of the node on the stern with higher vibration velocity comparing the vvs reported in fig 11 with fig 15 the vibration velocity of is clearly lower the maximum value is equal to 3 25 mm s and must be multiplied by the cf 1 8 so the value 5 85 mm s is in the limit imposed by the iso 6954 1984 in this study case the misalignment force effect affects an important area of the yacht such as the main deck where the living zone is located in figs 16 and 17 the vvs of two nodes with the higher vibration level on the main deck are respectively reported as for the bearing force two different resonances can be noted one of them at 6 03 and another at 7 2 hz the first peak corresponds to the cruising condition at 80 of mcr in this cruising condition the vibration velocity is up to 21 mm s that as mentioned earlier it is cannot be considered acceptable for all the registers the second resonance corresponds to the 100 of mcr usually this cruising condition is not common in the vessel s day life however it is important to avoid uncomfortable resonances and so to project a yacht structure able to damp it even for the maximum speed condition as mentioned for the bearing force the most valuable component is the vertical vibration velocity in this case other components are completely negligible in fig 18 the vibration at 6 03 hz induced by the misalignment force is reported fig 18 also highlights an undesired high amplitude vibration for the main deck this consideration is also confirmed by the vvs reported in fig 19 for a node on the main deck it means that in this loading scenario a damping increase for the entire yacht structure is mandatory also in this case the peak corresponding to the frequency of the 80 of mcr is clearly visible it can be concluded that any solution adopted for the reduction of the vibration level have to be focused on this critical frequency 5 solutions to the vibrational effects the considerations carried out in the previous chapter on the vvs for the different load cases have highlighted the most critical areas in which the capability of the structure to damp vibrations induced by hydrodynamic forces has to be improved this achievement should be accomplished by more or less invading structural modifications these modifications could be extremely complicated to be carried out because modifying an already built structure could deteriorate other vessel s characteristics static architectural etc in this case study two critical resonance frequencies are found one on the craft stern due to hydrodynamic forces 37 04 hz and one on the main deck due to misalignment force 6 03 hz both problems have a high resonance close to cruising condition 80 of mcr and exceed the maximum value of vibration limit imposed by the iso 6954 the herein proposed solutions are based on two different philosophies the increase of the structural stiffness and the use of a tuned mass damped tmd pais and boote 2017 the tmd allows to shift the resonance at a different frequency in the following chapters the procedures used for both stern and main deck problems are explained 5 1 increase of structural stiffness in order to accomplish the aforementioned task by increasing the structural stiffness in the critical areas beams reinforcements transversal or longitudinal fire bars and shell thickness can be modified dealing with the high vibration level in the vessel s stern two different solutions are herein investigated one by increasing the plating thickness of the and the other one by introducing a transverse reinforcement fire bar to reduce the resonance peak in fig 20 the increased thickness of the main deck is shown the red area 7 mm instead of 6 mm identify the modified stern part in order to stiffen the whole structure this solution if studied in the late design stages when the hull is almost completed with the furniture integration is very difficult and expensive to be carried out in fig 21 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the modified one is reported as it can be seen from fig 21 the resonance frequency is not affected by the proposed modification by the way the vibration amplitude has been reduced to 8 5 mm s that multiplied by cf 1 8 in any case is not acceptable for the iso standard it can be concluded that the thickness increase do not significantly increase the capability of the structure to damp critical vibration level in order to have appreciable results the thickness should be increased to too much higher value that compromise the global weight in order to overcome these complications a more refined solution have been tested in this case the structure stiffness has been increased by using fire bars located between two transverse reinforcements in order to split the longitudinal reinforcements span in fig 22 fire bars are shown in yellow bares are made in aluminum light alloy with 6130 mm length 50 mm height and 5 mm thickness the total increase of weight is 5 8 kg in fig 23 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the one with fire bars is reported the comparison proposed in fig 23 highlights a structural dynamic behavior comparable with the solution proposed in fig 21 for the thickness increase by the way the maximum vibration velocity is significantly reduced even though the resonance frequency has not been shifted the remarkable difference between the two solutions is that in the case of fire bars the vibration limit 4 8 mm s by cf 1 8 complies with iso 9654 this structural integration is also less invading than the previous one and it can be carried out even in the late design stages with moderate costs dealing with the misalignment force a more drastic remedy have to be use because the very high vibration velocity affects the entire main deck and not only a portion of it as it happens for pressure pulse and bearing load so two pillars fig 24 in red have been designed and located in proper areas in order to satisfy the requirement in terms of interior design they do not have to be located in the middle of large open living areas and in terms of structural dynamic response the stern pillar has been located in the crew room and the bow pillar in the engine room this solution even though have to be carefully studied to avoid any interaction with the interior habitability is the most valuable because have the doubled effect of reducing resonance peak and shift resonance frequency in fig 25 the comparison of the vvs due to misalignment force for the original structure and the one with pillars is reported adopting this solution the main deck criticism has been solved the higher vibration velocity corresponding to the 100 mcr has been limited to 1 8 mm s multiplied by cf 1 8 it is 3 24 mm s therefore it can be concluded that as it could be expected the installation of one or more pillar onboard is most valuable solution but it must be noted that it is not always possible because of interior design and habitability s tasks 5 2 tuned mass solution the tuned masses damper consists in a mass a spring and a damper linked to a vibrating system in order to reduce the dynamic response of the structure usually the damper is provide by an auxiliary system connected to the main structure soong and rana 1998 soong and spencer 2002 the mass is calculated in order to damp a particular natural frequency of the structure in which it tends to have a resonance peak the damper will resonate out of phase with the structural motion in order to decrease the amplitude and to shift the resonance frequency in fig 26 a typical arrangement of the tuned mass damper tmd in a structural system with one degree of freedom is shown harris and piersol 2002 these devices are considered dynamic vibration absorbers the working principle is to eliminate the resonance frequency of the main structure in two new resonances with less amplitude and different frequencies as mentioned earlier the natural frequency must be equal to the frequency of the mass damper connor and laflamme 2014 the following notation is used to calculate the device parameters the subscript d refers to the tuned mass damper 9 ω 2 k m k d m d ω d 2 the equivalent mass is defined as the ratio of the two masses 10 m e q m d m with the combination of eqs 9 and 10 the device stiffness can be calculated as it follows 11 k d m e q k if the auxiliary mass system has no damping and is tuned to the forcing frequency it acts as a dynamic absorber and enforces a node at its point of attachment the damper s geometry must be designed in order to be adapted to the available space between longitudinal reinforcements for this reasons the absorber device is composed by an aluminum beam with i transversal section and two concentrated masses are located at the end of each beam in table 5 the dimensions of the tuned mass system used in this study case in order to modify the resonance frequency at 37 04 hz are reported two mass of 25 kg are located at the end of the beam the mass damper was collocated corresponding to the longitudinal reinforcement which has the maximum vibration velocity in fig 27 the position of the tuned mass system is shown in fig 28 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the one with tmd is reported in this case the original frequency peak has been shifted with a remarkable velocity reduction to 39 hz i e the 90 of mcr it is the engine firing frequency and it corresponds to an operative cruising condition so the designed tmd device cannot be considered a valuable solution in a further step of the dynamic absorber solution three tmd are located in the principal structure the system remains the same described previously but they have been positioned in three different location reinforcement the same span distance this further solution has been designed with the aim to shift the resonance at lower frequencies with respect to the 80 of mcr in order to have it in a transitory navigation condition in this case the total weight of the tuned mass damper is 150 kg star side and 150 kg port side in fig 29 the location of the three tmd is shown in fig 30 the comparison of the vvs due to bearing force for the original structure and the one with three tmd is reported the peak has been shifted from the 80 to the 75 of mcr which can be considered as a transitory condition by the way results in terms of vibration velocity reduction does not reflect what it was expected in any case being this solution designed to shift the original resonance frequency it can be considered as a positive starting point for the study of an alternative and innovative way to improve the dynamic response properties of a superyacht structure in conclusion in the following fig 31 the comparison of the herein proposed solution has been reported 6 conclusions the aim of this study was the evaluation of the dynamic response of a superyacht structure by using the finite element method an analytic study of the problem has been carried out and in the future measurements and calculations will be perform onboard of the superyacht in order to validate the results previously obtained a numerical model of a motor yacht of 40 m has been performed for these achievements after the description of the excitation sources have been applied to the model and the forced vibration analysis has been carried out the problem of excessive vibration level with respect to the ongoing rules about comfort onboard has been solved with two different approaches in order to design a structure complying with iso standards the first design philosophy is to increase the stiffness in the zones with high level of vibration velocities in order to decrease the peak corresponding to the natural frequency of the craft it is a solution largely used in marine industries and it provides valuable results the second approach provide the use of tuned mass damper this solution represents an innovative way in yacht manufactory and it operates to shift the resonance peak away from the natural frequency in this case study it was the 80 of mcr in fig 31 it can be noted that the tmd has a more satisfactory results but provides a significant weight increase which in the yacht manufactory is not always possible for this reason the stiffening solution is still the best way to prevent vibration problems in early design stages nevertheless in late design stages or after sea trials when the craft is finished structural modifications could be very expensive because they requires to unassembled all the furniture in order to act directly to the metallic structure the future development of this research activity will be performed sea trials to tune the numerical model acknowledgments authors are thanks to eng angelo tonelli from rina services s p a and to eng davide nuzzo for his kind availability
