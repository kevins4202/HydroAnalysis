6510,mountain watersheds serve as important water sources for socioeconomic activities in semiarid and arid regions this study examined the streamflow response to snow regime shifts associated with climate variability in the us great basin to this end the coupled hydro ecological simulation system chess a process based and distributed model was applied to four mountain watersheds in the us great basin historical weather records for the period of 1961 1990 were used to spin up model simulations so that the soil water and vegetation reached the equilibrium state under long term climate conditions the period of 1991 2015 was selected as the study period the model evaluation suggested that chess was able to simulate major hydrological processes in the four mountain watersheds in addition it was found that annual streamflow was more strongly correlated with snowfall than with rainfall during 1991 2015 and increased by 0 62 0 76 mm as snowfall increased by 1 mm in the study regions recent regional warming advanced the timing of the peak flow and shifts in the snow regime also affected the intra annual pattern of the soil moisture content seasonally spring rainfall and snowmelt were dominant factors in generating spring streamflow and summer baseflow the mechanisms for flow generation were more complex and more variable in the four watersheds in autumn and winter than in spring and summer on an annual basis shifts in snowmelt resulting from climate variability accounted for more than 60 of the variability in the annual streamflow surpassing the contribution of rainfall in the four watersheds overall our results suggest that shifts in the snow regime due to climate variability have important implications for the intra annual distribution and availability of water resources in semiarid and arid regions of the us great basin keywords climate variability snow hydrology snowmelt streamflow precipitation 1 introduction the mountain snowpack in the western us experienced dramatic declines in the last decade due to regional warming mote et al 2018 and the most pronounced increase in temperature occurred in winter dettinger and cayan 1995 tang and arnone 2013 climate change such as warming induced by human activities can also affect the status of other environmental factors such as altering evapotranspiration soil moisture vegetation growth and snowmelt as well as triggering occurrences of extreme weather events cubasch et al 2013 isaak et al 2012 these changes can interact to complicate the impacts of climate variability on terrestrial ecosystems nayak et al 2012 stream hydrographs and water availability given the importance of mountain watersheds in providing water resources in semiarid and arid regions burke and kasahara 2011 an investigation of the impacts of shifts in the snow regime resulting from climate variability on river streamflow is critical for managing water resources and coping with climate change associated risks franz et al 2008 hood and hayashi 2015 previous studies indicated that the precipitation north of 30 n exhibited an increasing trend in the last century hartmann et al 2013 recent studies suggest that wintertime snowfall is either decreasing or turning into rainfall in the great basin due to regional warming knowles et al 2006 kunkel et al 2009 the transformation of snowfall to rainfall was thought to have decreased the streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 in semiarid and arid regions where winter and spring precipitation and the soil moisture deficit at the beginning of the water year account for 83 of the streamflow variability chauvin et al 2011 although climate change has induced changes in snowfall we lack a complete understanding of the effects of shifts in the snow regime on stream hydrographs hartmann et al 2013 in addition although warming seemed to have resulted in an increasing trend in the streamflow in the 20th century dai et al 2009 milliman et al 2008 the effects of climate change on streamflow can vary across regions therefore it is worthwhile to know if the regional discrepancies are the result of differences in the effects of local factors e g the transformation of snowfall to rainfall on river streamflow dai et al 2009 hammond et al 2018 snowmelt is considered the largest contribution to streamflow in snow dominated watersheds godsey et al 2014 kelleners et al 2010 where streamflow is significantly affected by changes in snowfall snowpack and snowmelt it is widely recognized that streamflow generated from snowmelt has decreased and the timing of snowmelt has advanced with snowpack reduction in recent years fritze et al 2011 pederson et al 2011 stewart et al 2004 wang et al 2010 the increasing number of snow free days and snowfall rainfall transformations resulting from warming have already shifted the snow regime fritze et al 2011 pederson et al 2011 wang et al 2010 given the importance of mountain watersheds for providing water sources for local socioeconomic activities and that snowmelt is the principal factor controlling water availability and runoff generation harpold and molotch 2015 the prediction of snowmelt has become critical as the water demand keeps increasing in semiarid and arid regions franz et al 2008 therefore it is important to determine the nature and mechanisms of flow generation in snow dominated mountain watersheds for predicting the impacts of climate change on the availability of water resources the objective of this study is to examine the effects of historical climate variability on streamflow in snow dominated mountain watersheds in the us great basin toward this end a process based and coupled hydro ecological model is applied to four mountain watersheds in the great basin four reference simulations based on historical weather records and two contrasting simulations based on warming and cooling scenarios are conducted respectively to examine how streamflow responds to shifts in snow regime associated with climate variability daily historical temperature and precipitation records for the period of 1961 2015 were used to develop model forcing data for the four watersheds whereas the period of 1991 2015 was selected as the study period given the quality and availability of the model forcing data statistical approaches including a relative importance analysis multivariate regression and t tests are used to analyze the streamflow variations in the streamflow and its response to climate variability induced shifts in the snow regime the results provide insights into the mechanisms of streamflow generation in mountain watersheds in semiarid and arid regions 2 method and data 2 1 study regions four mountain watersheds located in nevada fig 1 a were investigated i e the cleve creek watershed fig 1a the lamoille creek watershed fig 1b the twin river watershed fig 1c and the incline creek watershed fig 1d these mountain watersheds experience warm summers and cold winters with annual mean temperatures ranging from 2 9 for the cleve creek watershed to 7 1 for the incline creek watershed precipitation mostly falls in winter as snowfall and the annual total precipitation ranges from 690 mm in the twin river watershed to 870 mm in the lamoille creek watershed in recent decades the annual mean daily temperature showed an overall increasing trend in most watersheds tang et al 2015 tang and arnone 2013 fig a1 the terrain in the four mountain watersheds is spatially variable with average elevations ranging from 2337 m in the incline creek watershed to 2827 m in the twin river watershed in addition four us geological survey gauge stations provide long term streamflow observations for model calibration and evaluation fig 1 therefore these are ideal watersheds to examine how shifts in snow regime associated with climate variability affect streamflow in snow dominated mountain watersheds in semiarid and arid regions 2 2 modeling snowpack and snowmelt we used the coupled hydro ecological simulation system hereafter chess tang et al 2016 2014 to examine the effects of historical climate variability and associated shifts in the snow regime on the catchment hydrology in the four watersheds unlike in its predecessor the regional hydro ecologic simulation systems rhessys tague and band 2004 in chess the hierarchical structure of the original rhessys is not used and a new model structure is developed to simulate the integrated water carbon and nutrient dynamics and vegetation growth at the watershed and regional scales for land type cells chess explicitly simulates the routing of the surface and subsurface flows through space for channel type cells the surface and subsurface flows are first channelized and then routed in chess since the specific algorithms for the carbon water and nutrient dynamics in chess have been described in tague and band 2004 and tang et al 2016 2014 we herein briefly introduce the calculation of snowfall snow accumulation and snowmelt in general precipitation that falls below the freezing point of water is treated as snowfall and precipitation that falls above the melting point of snow is treated as rainfall liquid precipitation the estimates of snow accumulation and melt assume that these processes occur evenly in each grid cell snowmelt s m is the sum of the melt from radiation m r temperature m t and precipitation m p 1 s m m r m t m p where snowmelt from radiation m r was computed using a quasi energy budget approach that takes into account the melt from latent heat melt and vapor which depends on the snowpack energy deficit sed 2 sed t m a x sed t 1 t air sed max where t is a given day sed t 1 is the previous day s energy deficit tair is the mean daily air temperature on day t and sedmax is the maximum energy deficit that is set as a climate region specific input parameter snowmelt due to radiation can occur as sublimation when sed is 0 and this computed as follows 3 m r k direct k diffuse l λ f ρ water for s e d 0 k direct k diffuse l λ f λ v ρ water for s e d 0 where λv and λf are the latent heat of vaporization and fusion respectively ρwater is the density of water kdirect and kdiffuse are the direct and diffuse shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack l is longwave radiation snowmelt from temperature and advection occur only when the snowpack is ripe snowmelt due to latent and sensible heat flux is based on an empirical relationship with air temperature coughlan and running 1997 that is adjusted for the effects of variation in wind speed due to the fractional forest cover f over a snowpack dunne and leopold 1978 4 m t β mt t air 1 0 8 f where βmt is an empirical temperature melt coefficient that is input as a climate region specific parameter the contribution by advection melt due to warming by incoming precipitation is computed as 5 m p p s p w λ w t air 0 0 t air 0 where p s is the net throughfall entering the snowpack λ w and p w are the heat capacity and density of water respectively 2 3 weather forcing data and experimental simulations time series of daily maximum and minimum temperature c as well as total precipitation mm are required to run chess since there are no weather stations located in the four watersheds we used daily weather records from four nearby snowpack telemetry snotel stations fig 1 to derive the weather forcing data for the four watersheds given the elevational difference between a snotel station and the corresponding watershed we adjusted the effects of elevation on temperature and precipitation in each watershed by applying a local lapse rate for daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily total precipitation respectively these lapse rates table a1 are derived using regression analyses of data from surrounding weather stations to examine how sensitive the streamflow is to shifts in the snow regime such as warming induced changes due to different forms of precipitation forms i e snowfall vs rainfall we conducted two additional experimental simulations under two contrasting scenarios the warming and the cooling scenarios the two experimental simulations were applied to the cleve creek watershed in the warming scenario we increased the daily minimum and maximum temperatures in the time series in 2005 by 2 c whereas in the cooling scenario we decreased the daily minimum and maximum temperatures by 2 c under both scenarios the time series of daily precipitation remained unaltered the year 2005 was selected because its annual total precipitation including snowfall was relatively high which allows us to examine how shifts in the snow regime associated with temperature changes will affect the catchment hydrology 2 4 statistical analysis we used simple linear regression to estimate the temporal trends and variations in the climatic and hydrological variables two tailed p values were used to test the significance of the trends at the 0 05 significance level bivariate and multivariate regression models based on transformed data were used to analyze the interrelationships among the climatic and hydrological variables as well as the associated shifts in the snow regime we used the metric proposed by lindeman merenda and gold lmg grömping 2006 to quantify the relative contribution of each regressor e g snowmelt rainfall to the variation in the streamflow in the watershed the lmg metric decomposes the coefficient of determination r2 of a linear model into non negative contributions that automatically sum to the total r2 the metric is based on sequential r2 values but takes care of the dependence on orderings by averaging over orderings using simple unweighted averages we assume that the r2 of a model with regressors in set s is given as 6 r 2 s model s s m o d e l w i t h r e g r e s s o r s i n s total s s thus the additional r2 after adding the regressors in set m to a model with the regressors in set s is given as 7 seqr 2 m s r 2 m s r 2 s the order of the regressors in a model is a permutation of the available regressors x 1 xp and is denoted by the tuple of indices r r 1 rp let sk r denote the set of regressors entered into the model before regressor xk in the order r the portion of the r2 allocated to the regressor xk in the order r can thus be written as 8 seqr 2 x k s k r r 2 x k s k r r 2 s k r based on eq 8 the metric lmg can be expressed using the following equation 9 lmg x k 1 p r p e r m u t a t i o n s e q r 2 x k r because orders with the same sk r s can be summarized into one summand eq 9 can be simplified into 10 lmg x k 1 p s x 1 x p x k n s p n s 1 s e q r 2 x k s the lmg metric considers both the direct effects of an independent variable e g snowmelt on a dependent variable streamflow and its indirect effects adjusted by other independent variables e g rainfall in a multivariate regression model thus it is suitable for comparing the contributions of snowmelt and rainfall and their interaction to variations in streamflow if required a two sample t test was used to examine whether the two datasets being compared were significantly different 3 results 3 1 calibration and evaluation of model simulations for the 1991 2000 calibration period fig 2 a d the calculated nash sutcliffe coefficients ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 for the streamflow ranged from 0 70 to 0 77 in the four watersheds for the 2001 2012 evaluation period the calculated ns values for the streamflow ranged from 0 66 to 0 82 in the four watersheds fig 2e h for the baseflow the ns values for the four watersheds ranged from 0 68 to 0 82 for the calibration period and from 0 71 to 0 79 for the evaluation period fig a2 in addition the differences in annual average daily streamflow between the simulations and observations were less than 9 for the calibration period and 10 for the evaluation period likewise the simulated baseflow was highly consistent difference 12 with the observed streamflow values in the four watersheds fig 2a additionally we compared the inter annual variations of observed and modeled snow water equivalent hereafter swe in the study period for example the calculated ns value was 0 52 for the cleve creek watershed indicating that chess was able to effectively simulate the variation of swe in this watershed fig 3 the simulated swes for the cleve creek watershed were also in close agreement with the observed values in 1992 1993 1994 1995 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 2007 2008 and 2011 although the maximum simulated swe values were lower than the observed values in some years e g 2005 for the cleve creek watershed this discrepancy may be attributed to the location of the snotel station in a valley with a north facing slope located north of the cleve creek watershed in contrast most slopes in the cleve creek watershed are south facing slopes the difference in receiving solar radiation explains why the modeled peak swe values tended to be lower than the observed values in some years in the cleve creek watershed 3 2 the interrelationships among climate and hydrological variables our results indicated that the annual total streamflow in all investigated watersheds was strongly and positively p 0 01 correlated with rainfall during 1991 2015 except for the twin river watershed p 0 16 the streamflow increased by 0 61 for the cleve creek watershed to 0 74 mm for the incline creek watershed in response to an increase of 1 mm in rainfall fig 4 a likewise the annual mean streamflow was strongly and positively correlated with snowfall p 0 01 and increased by 0 62 for the cleve creek watershed to 0 76 mm for the incline creek watershed as snowfall increased by 1 mm fig 4b overall the annual total streamflow was significantly and positively correlated with annual total precipitation snowfall rainfall and increased by 0 69 for the cleve creek watershed to 1 00 mm for the lamoille creek watershed as the annual total precipitation increased by 1 mm in all four watersheds fig a3 in contrast there was a negative relationship between annual total streamflow and annual mean temperature but this relationship was only statistically significant p 0 05 for the twin river and the incline creek watershed located in central and western nevada fig 4c the annual streamflow decreased by 9 6 mm in the twin river watershed and 15 7 mm in the incline creek watershed as the annual mean temperature increased by 1 c note the annual total precipitation decreased by 10 mm in the twin river watershed and 22 mm in the incline creek watershed as the annual mean temperature increased by 1 c fig a3 the maximum streamflow in the study period was significantly p 0 05 correlated with the maximum snowmelt in the cleve creek lamoille creek and incline creek watersheds but not in the twin river watershed fig 4d for example an increase of 1 mm in the maximum snowmelt resulted in a 0 46 m increase in the maximum streamflow in the incline creek watershed fig 4d except for the twin river watershed the maximum snowmelt was significantly correlated with the maximum snowpack in all watersheds and increased by 0 32 for the lamoille creek watershed to 0 47 mm for the incline creek watershed as the maximum snowpack increased by 1 mm p 0 02 fig 4e in addition there was a significant positive relationship p 0 001 between the maximum streamflow and the maximum snowpack in all four watersheds fig 4f the former increased from 0 56 for the lamoille creek watershed to 1 56 mm for the twin river watershed as the latter increased by 1 mm 3 3 the effects of shifts in warming and precipitation on streamflow fig 5 shows a comparison of the mean annual daily temperature and modeled streamflow for the first 1991 2000 and second 2001 2015 periods in the four watersheds the mean annual daily temperature in the snowmelt months of april to june shifted distinctly between the two compared periods in all four watersheds p 0 05 in the t test fig 5a c e g under warmer conditions the mean annual daily peak streamflow in all watersheds occurred earlier in the second period fig 5b d f h the time difference of the peak between the two periods ranged from 6 days in the incline creek watershed to 19 days in the cleve creek watershed note a t test on the dates of daily peak streamflow for the periods indicated a significant difference in the means p 0 05 nevertheless the mean annual daily maximum snowpack and snowmelt do not exhibit a consistent tendency toward earlier occurrence for the four watersheds fig a4 overall as the temperature increased the peak streamflow occurred earlier in all four watersheds fig 6 depicts the comparisons between the effects of warming and cooling induced shifts in snowfall on the stream hydrograph for 2005 based on the two contrasting scenarios compared to the cooling scenario the snowfall in the period of january to june decreased significantly by 43 0 97 mm under the warming scenario fig 6a as a result the snowpack in the cleve creek watershed decreased on average by 101 141 mm under the warming scenario compared to the cooling scenario fig 6b the difference in the snowpack caused snowmelt to decrease by 27 0 8 mm under the warming scenario fig 6c in addition the peak streamflow was attenuated and occurred earlier under the warming scenario than the cooling scenario fig 6d further analyses indicated that warming cooling induced shifts in snowfall affected the intra annual distribution of streamflow in the cleve creek watershed the total streamflow was larger under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario prior to the day when the two hydrographs intersected subsequently the total streamflow was significantly lower under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario fig 6d nevertheless the annual total streamflow did not differ significantly between the two contrasting scenarios when the time series of daily precipitation remained unaltered shifts in snowfall exerted significant impacts on the intra annual pattern of soil moisture content the soil saturation deficit was much lower under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario prior to the day when the two hydrographs intersected fig 6f subsequently the soil saturation deficit was higher under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario in addition warming resulted in a greater loss of snow via sublimation as illustrated in fig 6e on average however the annual total streamflow and mean soil saturation deficit did not differ significantly under the two contrasting scenarios 3 4 effects of snowmelt and rainfall on streamflow on a seasonal basis on a seasonal basis the autumn september october november streamflow was significantly p 0 05 correlated with autumn rainfall but not with snowmelt in the cleve creek lamoille creek and incline creek watersheds respectively table 1 the correlations between autumn streamflow and rainfall as well as between autumn streamflow and snowmelt however were not significant in the twin river watershed table 1 the winter january february march streamflow was significantly p 0 01 correlated with winter rainfall and snowmelt in both the lamoille creek and the incline creek watersheds table 1 the winter streamflow increased by 0 47 mm in the lamoille creek watershed and 0 44 mm in the incline creek watershed as the winter snowmelt increased by 1 mm in the two watersheds in contrast this correlation is not significant in the cleve creek and the twin river watersheds spring april may june streamflow was significantly correlated with spring rainfall snowmelt in all four watersheds and increased by 0 29 0 47 mm in the cleve creek watershed 0 41 0 61 mm in the lamoille creek watershed 0 44 0 64 mm in the twin river watershed and 0 27 0 50 mm in the incline creek watershed as the spring rainfall snowmelt increased by 1 mm in these watersheds summer july august september streamflow was significantly p 0 001 correlated with summer snowmelt in the lamoille creek twin river and incline creek watershed but not in the cleve creek watershed however the correlation between summer streamflow and rainfall was only significant in the lamoille creek and the incline creek watersheds table 1 3 5 time lag effects of preseason snowmelt and rainfall on seasonal streamflow when considering the time lag effects of preseason snowmelt and rainfall on the baseflow in the following seasons autumn baseflow was significantly p 0 05 correlated with summer snowmelt in the twin river and the incline creek watershed respectively table 2 the autumn baseflow increased by 0 21 mm in the twin river watershed and 0 23 mm in the cleve creek watershed as summer snowmelt increased by 1 mm in the two watersheds for the cleve creek and lamoille creek watersheds autumn baseflow was not significantly correlated with summer snowmelt table 2 in the winter the seasonal baseflow was significantly correlated with autumn rainfall in the cleve creek and twin river watersheds whereas the correlation was not significant in the lamoille creek and incline creek watersheds in addition significant correlations between winter baseflow and autumn snowmelt only occurred in the twin river watershed table 2 spring baseflow was only significantly correlated with winter rainfall in the incline creek watershed table 2 unlike in spring the summer baseflow was significantly p 0 05 correlated with spring rainfall in all four watersheds similarly the summer baseflow was also significantly correlated with spring snowmelt in most watersheds except for the lamoille creek watershed which is located farther north than the other three watersheds table 2 overall winter rainfall and snowmelt seemed to have no significant impacts on spring baseflow whereas spring rainfall and snowmelt exhibited significant impacts on summer baseflow in most watersheds table 2 3 6 the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to river streamflow table 3 shows the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to the variability of streamflow on both seasonal and annual bases our results indicated that autumn preseason summer and spring rainfall jointly contributed more than snowmelt to the variation of autumn streamflow in the four watersheds table 3 for example autumn rainfall accounted for 19 of the variability of autumn streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 80 in the lamoille creek watershed 20 in the twin river watershed and 48 in the incline creek watershed table 3 similarly winter streamflow depended more on rainfall than on snowmelt in the same season winter and the preseason autumn winter rainfall 10 and preseason rainfall in autumn 48 jointly accounted for 58 of the variability in winter streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 77 in the lamoille creek watershed and 65 in the incline creek watershed surpassing the 41 of contribution of snowmelt in the cleve creek watershed 23 in the lamoille creek watershed and 35 in the incline creek watershed for the twin river watershed the contribution of autumn and winter rainfall 48 to the variability in winter streamflow approximates that of snowmelt 52 table 3 unlike in autumn and winter the spring snowmelt accounted for 74 of the variability in spring streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 58 in the lamoille creek watershed and 69 in the incline creek watershed surpassing the 22 of the contribution from spring rainfall in the cleve creek watershed 35 in the lamoille creek watershed and 11 in the incline creek watershed for the twin river watershed the contribution of spring snowmelt to spring streamflow 47 was close to that of spring rainfall 49 table 3 compared to spring streamflow the variation of summer streamflow depended more on spring and summer snowmelt than on rainfall in these two seasons in the lamoille creek watershed 75 the twin river watershed 79 and the incline creek watershed 62 table 3 in contrast spring and summer rainfall jointly explained 60 of the variation in summer streamflow in the cleve creek watershed table 3 exceeding the 40 of variation that was jointly explained by spring and summer snowmelt table 3 on an annual basis the variation of snowmelt explained 63 of the variability in annual streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 66 in the lamoille creek watershed 84 in the twin river watershed and 57 in the incline creek watershed all proportions are greater than those from the annual rainfall table 3 4 discussion 4 1 interrelationships among climate and hydrological variables the strength of correlation as suggested by the r2 value between streamflow and snowfall was stronger than that between streamflow and rainfall in the cleve creek watershed 0 45 vs 0 42 the lamoille creek watershed 0 36 vs 0 29 and the twin river watershed 0 72 vs 0 09 suggesting that the variability in streamflow in these watersheds was more closely correlated with the changes in the snowfall snowmelt than the changes in rainfall e g barnhart et al 2016 the reason is that precipitation falls mostly as snow instead of liquid rain in winter serreze et al 1999 and snowmelt accounts for over 63 of the variability in annual streamflow in the three watersheds table 3 in contrast rainfall mostly occurs in late spring summer and early autumn when the air temperature is above the freezing point and thus greater moisture loss occurs due to evaporation e g vicuña et al 2011 this explains why the strength of correlation between streamflow and rainfall on an annual basis was weaker or the rainfall accounted for less than 37 of the variability in annual streamflow in the three watersheds even for the incline creek watershed located in the westernmost area of the study region fig 1d the contribution of snowmelt to the variability in annual streamflow 57 was still greater than that of rainfall 43 the stronger correlation between snowmelt and seasonal streamflow in spring and summer table 1 indicates that snowmelt increases subsurface flow e g barnhart et al 2016 in addition the significant interrelationships among the annual daily peak streamflow peak snowpack and peak snowmelt in most of the watersheds demonstrate the importance of the snow regime in governing the stream hydrograph in the study region fig 4d f dedieu et al 2014 indicated that the variability in the mountain snowpack in mid latitudes impacts hydrological systems and water management 4 2 effects of shifts in warming and precipitation on river streamflow similar to other studies at the regional or global scale tang et al 2015 annual mean daily temperature trended upward significantly in most watersheds except for the incline creek watershed fig a1 especially during the snowmelt season march june the mean daily temperature was higher in the second period than in the first period fig 5a c e and g under warmer conditions the peak streamflow occurred earlier because the time when the daily temperature passed the snow melting point occurred on average 5 days earlier on the one hand this results in earlier snowmelt e g mote et al 2005 harpold et al 2012 but on the other hand it can cause parts of precipitation to fall as liquid water instead of snow these findings are consistent with our results from two contrasting scenarios under which snowfall was about 47 higher under the cooling scenario 681 mm than under the warming scenario 463 1 mm in 2005 although the peak streamflow occurred earlier in all watersheds due to the warming effect e g stewart et al 2010 the peak snowpack and snowmelt did not occur earlier in any of the watersheds during the study period fig a4 this suggests that factors e g snow persistence snowmelt rate other than temperature also play important roles in the timing of the peak snowpack and snowmelt for example hammond et al 2018 indicated that snow persistence correlated with annual streamflow in dry and cold watersheds in the western us and could be used to map spatial patterns of annual streamflow generation nevertheless our results based on experimental simulations suggest that the peak snowpack occurred about 30 60 days earlier than the peak streamflow fig 6b vs d this finding is in good agreement with the results of hunsaker et al 2012 who found that the peak discharge lagged approximately 60 days behind the peak snowpack at higher elevations and 20 30 days at lower elevations in the southern sierra nevada in addition the annual total streamflow under the warming and cooling scenarios was not sensitive to temperature change associated shifts in snowfall indicating that the amount of precipitation rather than the precipitation type plays a dominant role in determining annual total streamflow nayak et al 2010 indicated that although significant warming during 1962 2006 in idaho in the us caused more precipitation to fall as liquid water there was no significant change in the total streamflow of the water year in a snow dominated mountain watershed because the annual total precipitation did not shift significantly previous studies hammond et al 2018 kormos et al 2016 indicated that the precipitation amount was the dominant factor affecting the streamflow volume nevertheless shifts in precipitation types affect the intra annual pattern of streamflow and soil moisture condition for example berghuijs et al 2014 indicated that a shift in precipitation from snow to rain decreased the annual streamflow across all climate types in the western us because more snow melted under the warming scenario the streamflow increased and the soil saturation deficit was lower prior to the occurrence of the peak streamflow fig 6d and f previous studies e g harpold and molotch 2015 chauvin et al 2011 highlighted the coupling between snowmelt timing and peak soil moisture and the importance of soil water for subsurface flow in contrast since less snow melted during the months of march june an increase in snowfall and the resultant snowpack under the cooling scenario increased the streamflow and soil moisture content in the following summer fig 6 these findings agree well with previous studies e g jefferson 2011 nayak et al 2010 suggesting that warming can lead to a significant trend toward greater winter and lower summer discharge in snow dominated watersheds the amount of rainfall also regulates the effects of shifts in the snow regime on the stream hydrograph although the peak flow occurred earlier in the second period in all the four watersheds the magnitudes of the peak flow were not consistently greater or lower than in the first period fig 5 this inconsistency in the variation of the magnitudes of peak flow is attributed to differences in the amount of rainfall between the two periods fig 7 a for example the higher rainfall in the first period contributed to streamflow generation in the cleve creek watershed which minimized the difference in average peak streamflow triggered by shifts in snowmelt fig 5b 4 3 time lag effects of preseason rainfall and snowmelt on river streamflow the significant relationships between summer baseflow and spring rainfall in most watersheds table 2 can be possibly attributed to the fact that increased rainfall in spring increases the soil water content in these seasons which results in greater subsurface flow in summer seyfried et al 2009 further analyses indicated that winter snowfall accounted for over 26 7 for the twin river watershed to 33 0 for the incline creek watershed of annual total precipitation in contrast winter rainfall accounted for only 5 6 for the lamoille creek watershed to 13 0 for the incline creek watershed of annual total precipitation because precipitation in winter mostly falls as snowfall instead of rainfall serreze et al 1999 and because rainfall in summer and autumn is comparatively low mostly 10 of annual total precipitation and there are greater losses from evaporation the correlations between seasonal baseflow and the preseason rainfall in autumn winter and spring were not significant in most watersheds table 2 similarly increasing snowmelt in spring increases the soil moisture content of dry soil in spring and thus benefits streamflow in summer chauvin et al 2011 indicated that spring snowmelt must first replenish the soil saturation deficit before water is delivered to the stream in fact our results indicate that the soil water content continued to increase as demonstrated by a decrease in the soil saturation deficit from early march to late june in all watersheds fig 7b this contributed to summer flow generation the peak streamflow generally occurred about 1 3 days after the soil saturation deficit reached the lowest value fig 7b again similar to rainfall because snowmelt occurs less in summer autumn and winter or mostly occurs before summer seasonal baseflow in autumn winter and spring were not significantly related to the preseason snowmelt in most watersheds table 2 the consistency of the significant relationships between spring streamflow and spring rainfall snowmelt in the four watersheds table 1 was likely observed because more than 16 of annual total precipitation and 62 of annual total snowmelt occur in spring in the study regions as a result more water is available for spring flow in addition the continuous decrease in the soil saturation deficit that started in march fig 7b as a result of winter rainfall and snowmelt may have caused the soil moisture content to increase to a threshold so that spring rainfall and snowmelt directly generated streamflow in fact the streamflow started to increase sharply beginning in late march or early may in most watersheds fig 5b f h because less rainfall occurred in most watersheds and the amount of snowmelt was greater than that of rainfall in all watersheds in the simulations in summer snowmelt was the major source of summer streamflow godsey et al 2014 barnhart et al 2016 this explains the non significant relationship between summer streamflow and rainfall and the significant relationship between summer streamflow and snowmelt in most watersheds table 1 overall the inconsistency of the relationship between streamflow and rainfall snowmelt in winter and autumn in the four watersheds suggest that the mechanisms for streamflow generation are more complex in autumn and winter than in spring and summer 4 4 contributions of snowmelt and rainfall to the variability in streamflow the higher contribution rate of snowmelt than rainfall to the variability in spring and summer streamflow indicates that the stream hydrographs in the two seasons in the study regions are mainly controlled by the snow regime this is highly consistent with the results of previous studies which suggested that spring snowmelt contributed proportionally more to streamflow than rainfall in snow dominated catchments clow 2010 and that spring snowmelt was the dominant factor in generating summer streamflow barnhart et al 2016 godsey et al 2014 nevertheless the contribution of rainfall to the variability in streamflow in autumn and winter appeared to be larger than that from snowmelt suggesting that rainfall plays a more important role than snowmelt in generating streamflow in these two seasons this is likely because precipitation falls predominantly as liquid water when the temperature is above zero and as snow when the temperature is below zero in the latter case there is less snowmelt and thus rainfall becomes the dominant factor in generating flow for example our statistics indicate that autumn snowmelt accounted for only 4 4 7 6 of total annual snowmelt in most watersheds on an annual basis the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow exceeded that of rainfall table 1 indicating that the variability in streamflow depends more on snowmelt than on rainfall li et al 2017 suggested that over half of the total runoff in the western us originates as snowmelt 5 conclusion in this study we used a coupled hydro ecological model to examine the effects of climatic variability on streamflow in four snow dominated mountain watersheds in the us great basin our results indicated that i annual streamflow in the semiarid and arid regions was significantly correlated with both snowfall and snowmelt during 1991 2015 and increased by 0 62 0 77 mm as snowfall increased by 1 mm in contrast annual streamflow was negatively correlated to annual mean temperature but this correlation was only statistically significant in the twin river and the incline creek watersheds in addition the annual daily peak streamflow was significantly correlated with the annual daily peak snowpack and snowmelt ii an increase in the daily mean temperature during the study period resulted in an earlier occurrence of the peak flow in all watersheds nevertheless the impact of snowmelt on streamflow was subject to the effect of rainfall on soil moisture conditions higher peak snowmelt did not always result in higher peak streamflow on an annual basis the amount of precipitation played a dominant role in determining the streamflow volume whereas the snow regime accounted for the variability of streamflow hydrograph iii spring rainfall and snowmelt played not only dominant roles in generating spring streamflow but also essential roles in generating summer baseflow in almost all watersheds in addition summer flow generation depended more on summer snowmelt than on summer rainfall the mechanisms of the flow generation were more complex in autumn and winter than in spring and summer on an annual basis snowmelt accounted for more than 60 of the variability in streamflow surpassing the contribution of rainfall overall shifts in the snow regime associated with climate variability play a dominant role in governing stream hydrographs in the semiarid and arid regions of the us great basin given that temperatures in the western us are projected to increase by 1 2 c and the warming will shift the snow regime and trigger the occurrence of snow drought harpold et al 2017 hatchett and mcevoy 2018 this

6510,mountain watersheds serve as important water sources for socioeconomic activities in semiarid and arid regions this study examined the streamflow response to snow regime shifts associated with climate variability in the us great basin to this end the coupled hydro ecological simulation system chess a process based and distributed model was applied to four mountain watersheds in the us great basin historical weather records for the period of 1961 1990 were used to spin up model simulations so that the soil water and vegetation reached the equilibrium state under long term climate conditions the period of 1991 2015 was selected as the study period the model evaluation suggested that chess was able to simulate major hydrological processes in the four mountain watersheds in addition it was found that annual streamflow was more strongly correlated with snowfall than with rainfall during 1991 2015 and increased by 0 62 0 76 mm as snowfall increased by 1 mm in the study regions recent regional warming advanced the timing of the peak flow and shifts in the snow regime also affected the intra annual pattern of the soil moisture content seasonally spring rainfall and snowmelt were dominant factors in generating spring streamflow and summer baseflow the mechanisms for flow generation were more complex and more variable in the four watersheds in autumn and winter than in spring and summer on an annual basis shifts in snowmelt resulting from climate variability accounted for more than 60 of the variability in the annual streamflow surpassing the contribution of rainfall in the four watersheds overall our results suggest that shifts in the snow regime due to climate variability have important implications for the intra annual distribution and availability of water resources in semiarid and arid regions of the us great basin keywords climate variability snow hydrology snowmelt streamflow precipitation 1 introduction the mountain snowpack in the western us

2013 climate change such as warming induced by human activities can also affect the status of other environmental factors such as altering evapotranspiration soil moisture vegetation growth and snowmelt as well as triggering occurrences of extreme weather events cubasch et al 2013 isaak et al 2012 these changes can interact to complicate the impacts of climate variability on terrestrial ecosystems nayak et al 2012 stream hydrographs and water availability given the importance of mountain watersheds in providing water resources in semiarid and arid regions burke and kasahara 2011 an investigation of the impacts of shifts in the snow regime resulting from climate variability on river streamflow is critical for managing water resources and coping with climate change associated risks franz et al 2008 hood and hayashi 2015 previous studies indicated that the precipitation north of 30 n exhibited an increasing trend in the last century hartmann et al 2013 recent studies suggest that wintertime snowfall is either decreasing or turning into rainfall in the great basin due to regional warming knowles et al 2006 kunkel et al 2009 the transformation of snowfall to rainfall was thought to have decreased the streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 in semiarid and arid regions where winter and spring precipitation and the soil moisture deficit at the beginning of the water year account for 83 of the streamflow variability chauvin et al 2011 although climate change has induced changes in snowfall we lack a complete understanding of the effects of shifts in the snow regime on stream hydrographs hartmann et al 2013 in addition although warming seemed to have resulted in an increasing trend in the streamflow in the 20th century dai et al 2009 milliman et al 2008 the effects of climate change on streamflow can vary across regions therefore it is worthwhile to know if the regional discrepancies are the result of differences in the effects of local factors e g the transformation of snowfall to rainfall on river streamflow dai et al 2009 hammond et al 2018 snowmelt is considered the largest contribution to streamflow in snow dominated watersheds godsey et al 2014 kelleners et al 2010 where streamflow is significantly affected by changes in snowfall snowpack and snowmelt it is widely recognized that streamflow generated from snowmelt has decreased and the timing of snowmelt has advanced with snowpack reduction in recent years fritze et al 2011 pederson et al 2011 stewart et al 2004 wang et al 2010 the increasing number of snow free days and snowfall rainfall transformations resulting from warming have already shifted the snow regime fritze et al 2011 pederson et al 2011 wang et al 2010 given the importance of mountain watersheds for providing water sources for local socioeconomic activities and that snowmelt is the principal factor controlling water availability and runoff generation harpold and molotch 2015 the prediction of snowmelt has become critical as the water demand keeps increasing in semiarid and arid regions franz et al 2008 therefore it is important to determine the nature and mechanisms of flow generation in snow dominated mountain watersheds for predicting the impacts of climate change on the availability of water resources the objective of this study is to examine the effects of historical climate variability on streamflow in snow dominated mountain watersheds in the us great basin toward this end a process based and coupled hydro ecological model is applied to four mountain watersheds in the great basin four reference simulations based on historical weather records and two contrasting simulations based on warming and cooling scenarios are conducted respectively to examine how streamflow responds to shifts in snow regime associated with climate variability daily historical temperature and precipitation records for the period of 1961 2015 were used to develop model forcing data for the four watersheds whereas the period of 1991 2015 was selected as the study period given the quality and availability of the model forcing data statistical approaches including a relative importance analysis multivariate regression and t tests are used to analyze the streamflow variations in the streamflow and its response to climate variability induced shifts in the snow regime the results provide insights into the mechanisms of streamflow generation in mountain watersheds in semiarid and arid regions 2 method and data 2 1 study regions four mountain watersheds located in nevada fig 1 a were investigated i e the cleve creek watershed fig 1a the lamoille creek watershed fig 1b the twin river watershed fig 1c and the incline creek watershed fig 1d these mountain watersheds experience warm summers and cold winters with annual mean temperatures ranging from 2 9 for the cleve creek watershed to 7 1 for the incline creek watershed precipitation mostly falls in winter as snowfall and the annual total precipitation ranges from 690 mm in the twin river watershed to 870 mm in the lamoille creek watershed in recent decades the annual mean daily temperature showed an overall increasing trend in most watersheds tang et al 2015 tang and arnone 2013 fig a1 the terrain in the four mountain watersheds is spatially variable with average elevations ranging from 2337 m in the incline creek watershed to 2827 m in the twin river watershed in addition four us geological survey gauge stations provide long term streamflow observations for model calibration and evaluation fig 1 therefore these are ideal watersheds to examine how shifts in snow regime associated with climate variability affect streamflow in snow dominated mountain watersheds in semiarid and arid regions 2 2 modeling snowpack and snowmelt we used the coupled hydro ecological simulation system hereafter chess tang et al 2016 2014 to examine the effects of historical climate variability and associated shifts in the snow regime on the catchment hydrology in the four watersheds unlike in its predecessor the regional hydro ecologic simulation systems rhessys tague and band 2004 in chess the hierarchical structure of the original rhessys is not used and a new model structure is developed to simulate the integrated water carbon and nutrient dynamics and vegetation growth at the watershed and regional scales for land type cells chess explicitly simulates the routing of the surface and subsurface flows through space for channel type cells the surface and subsurface flows are first channelized and then routed in chess since the specific algorithms for the carbon water and nutrient dynamics in chess have been described in tague and band 2004 and tang et al 2016 2014 we herein briefly introduce the calculation of snowfall snow accumulation and snowmelt in general precipitation that falls below the freezing point of water is treated as snowfall and precipitation that falls above the melting point of snow is treated as rainfall liquid precipitation the estimates of snow accumulation and melt assume that these processes occur evenly in each grid cell snowmelt s m is the sum of the melt from radiation m r temperature m t and precipitation m p 1 s m m r m t m p where snowmelt from radiation m r was computed using a quasi energy budget approach that takes into account the melt from latent heat melt and vapor which depends on the snowpack energy deficit sed 2 sed t m a x sed t 1 t air sed max where t is a given day sed t 1 is the previous day s energy deficit tair is the mean daily air temperature on day t and sedmax is the maximum energy deficit that is set as a climate region specific input parameter snowmelt due to radiation can occur as sublimation when sed is 0 and this computed as follows 3 m r k direct k diffuse l λ f ρ water for s e d 0 k direct k diffuse l λ f λ v ρ water for s e d 0 where λv and λf are the latent heat of vaporization and fusion respectively ρwater is the density of water kdirect and kdiffuse are the direct and diffuse shortwave radiation absorbed by the snowpack l is longwave radiation snowmelt from temperature and advection occur only when the snowpack is ripe snowmelt due to latent and sensible heat flux is based on an empirical relationship with air temperature coughlan and running 1997 that is adjusted for the effects of variation in wind speed due to the fractional forest cover f over a snowpack dunne and leopold 1978 4 m t β mt t air 1 0 8 f where βmt is an empirical temperature melt coefficient that is input as a climate region specific parameter the contribution by advection melt due to warming by incoming precipitation is computed as 5 m p p s p w λ w t air 0 0 t air 0 where p s is the net throughfall entering the snowpack λ w and p w are the heat capacity and density of water respectively 2 3 weather forcing data and experimental simulations time series of daily maximum and minimum temperature c as well as total precipitation mm are required to run chess since there are no weather stations located in the four watersheds we used daily weather records from four nearby snowpack telemetry snotel stations fig 1 to derive the weather forcing data for the four watersheds given the elevational difference between a snotel station and the corresponding watershed we adjusted the effects of elevation on temperature and precipitation in each watershed by applying a local lapse rate for daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily total precipitation respectively these lapse rates table a1 are derived using regression analyses of data from surrounding weather stations to examine how sensitive the streamflow is to shifts in the snow regime such as warming induced changes due to different forms of precipitation forms i e snowfall vs rainfall we conducted two additional experimental simulations under two contrasting scenarios the warming and the cooling scenarios the two experimental simulations were applied to the cleve creek watershed in the warming scenario we increased the daily minimum and maximum temperatures in the time series in 2005 by 2 c whereas in the cooling scenario we decreased the daily minimum and maximum temperatures by 2 c under both scenarios the time series of daily precipitation remained unaltered the year 2005 was selected because its annual total precipitation including snowfall was relatively high which allows us to examine how shifts in the snow regime associated with temperature changes will affect the catchment hydrology 2 4 statistical analysis we used simple linear regression to estimate the temporal trends and variations in the climatic and hydrological variables two tailed p values were used to test the significance of the trends at the 0 05 significance level bivariate and multivariate regression models based on transformed data were used to analyze the interrelationships among the climatic and hydrological variables as well as the associated shifts in the snow regime we used the metric proposed by lindeman merenda and gold lmg grömping 2006 to quantify the relative contribution of each regressor e g snowmelt rainfall to the variation in the streamflow in the watershed the lmg metric decomposes the coefficient of determination r2 of a linear model into non negative contributions that automatically sum to the total r2 the metric is based on sequential r2 values but takes care of the dependence on orderings by averaging over orderings using simple unweighted averages we assume that the r2 of a model with regressors in set s is given as 6 r 2 s model s s m o d e l w i t h r e g r e s s o r s i n s total s s thus the additional r2 after adding the regressors in set m to a model with the regressors in set s is given as 7 seqr 2 m s r 2 m s r 2 s the order of the regressors in a model is a permutation of the available regressors x 1 xp and is denoted by the tuple of indices r r 1 rp let sk r denote the set of regressors entered into the model before regressor xk in the order r the portion of the r2 allocated to the regressor xk in the order r can thus be written as 8 seqr 2 x k s k r r 2 x k s k r r 2 s k r based on eq 8 the metric lmg can be expressed using the following equation 9 lmg x k 1 p r p e r m u t a t i o n s e q r 2 x k r because orders with the same sk r s can be summarized into one summand eq 9 can be simplified into 10 lmg x k 1 p s x 1 x p x k n s p n s 1 s e q r 2 x k s the lmg metric considers both the direct effects of an independent variable e g snowmelt on a dependent variable streamflow and its indirect effects adjusted by other independent variables e g rainfall in a multivariate regression model thus it is suitable for comparing the contributions of snowmelt and rainfall and their interaction to variations in streamflow if required a two sample t test was used to examine whether the two datasets being compared were significantly different 3 results 3 1 calibration and evaluation of model simulations for the 1991 2000 calibration period fig 2 a d the calculated nash sutcliffe coefficients ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 for the streamflow ranged from 0 70 to 0 77 in the four watersheds for the 2001 2012 evaluation period the calculated ns values for the streamflow ranged from 0 66 to 0 82 in the four watersheds fig 2e h for the baseflow the ns values for the four watersheds ranged from 0 68 to 0 82 for the calibration period and from 0 71 to 0 79 for the evaluation period fig a2 in addition the differences in annual average daily streamflow between the simulations and observations were less than 9 for the calibration period and 10 for the evaluation period likewise the simulated baseflow was highly consistent difference 12 with the observed streamflow values in the four watersheds fig 2a additionally we compared the inter annual variations of observed and modeled snow water equivalent hereafter swe in the study period for example the calculated ns value was 0 52 for the cleve creek watershed indicating that chess was able to effectively simulate the variation of swe in this watershed fig 3 the simulated swes for the cleve creek watershed were also in close agreement with the observed values in 1992 1993 1994 1995 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 2007 2008 and 2011 although the maximum simulated swe values were lower than the observed values in some years e g 2005 for the cleve creek watershed this discrepancy may be attributed to the location of the snotel station in a valley with a north facing slope located north of the cleve creek watershed in contrast most slopes in the cleve creek watershed are south facing slopes the difference in receiving solar radiation explains why the modeled peak swe values tended to be lower than the observed values in some years in the cleve creek watershed 3 2 the interrelationships among climate and hydrological variables our results indicated that the annual total streamflow in all investigated watersheds was strongly and positively p 0 01 correlated with rainfall during 1991 2015 except for the twin river watershed p 0 16 the streamflow increased by 0 61 for the cleve creek watershed to 0 74 mm for the incline creek watershed in response to an increase of 1 mm in rainfall fig 4 a likewise the annual mean streamflow was strongly and positively correlated with snowfall p 0 01 and increased by 0 62 for the cleve creek watershed to 0 76 mm for the incline creek watershed as snowfall increased by 1 mm fig 4b overall the annual total streamflow was significantly and positively correlated with annual total precipitation snowfall rainfall and increased by 0 69 for the cleve creek watershed to 1 00 mm for the lamoille creek watershed as the annual total precipitation increased by 1 mm in all four watersheds fig a3 in contrast there was a negative relationship between annual total streamflow and annual mean temperature but this relationship was only statistically significant p 0 05 for the twin river and the incline creek watershed located in central and western nevada fig 4c the annual streamflow decreased by 9 6 mm in the twin river watershed and 15 7 mm in the incline creek watershed as the annual mean temperature increased by 1 c note the annual total precipitation decreased by 10 mm in the twin river watershed and 22 mm in the incline creek watershed as the annual mean temperature increased by 1 c fig a3 the maximum streamflow in the study period was significantly p 0 05 correlated with the maximum snowmelt in the cleve creek lamoille creek and incline creek watersheds but not in the twin river watershed fig 4d for example an increase of 1 mm in the maximum snowmelt resulted in a 0 46 m increase in the maximum streamflow in the incline creek watershed fig 4d except for the twin river watershed the maximum snowmelt was significantly correlated with the maximum snowpack in all watersheds and increased by 0 32 for the lamoille creek watershed to 0 47 mm for the incline creek watershed as the maximum snowpack increased by 1 mm p 0 02 fig 4e in addition there was a significant positive relationship p 0 001 between the maximum streamflow and the maximum snowpack in all four watersheds fig 4f the former increased from 0 56 for the lamoille creek watershed to 1 56 mm for the twin river watershed as the latter increased by 1 mm 3 3 the effects of shifts in warming and precipitation on streamflow fig 5 shows a comparison of the mean annual daily temperature and modeled streamflow for the first 1991 2000 and second 2001 2015 periods in the four watersheds the mean annual daily temperature in the snowmelt months of april to june shifted distinctly between the two compared periods in all four watersheds p 0 05 in the t test fig 5a c e g under warmer conditions the mean annual daily peak streamflow in all watersheds occurred earlier in the second period fig 5b d f h the time difference of the peak between the two periods ranged from 6 days in the incline creek watershed to 19 days in the cleve creek watershed note a t test on the dates of daily peak streamflow for the periods indicated a significant difference in the means p 0 05 nevertheless the mean annual daily maximum snowpack and snowmelt do not exhibit a consistent tendency toward earlier occurrence for the four watersheds fig a4 overall as the temperature increased the peak streamflow occurred earlier in all four watersheds fig 6 depicts the comparisons between the effects of warming and cooling induced shifts in snowfall on the stream hydrograph for 2005 based on the two contrasting scenarios compared to the cooling scenario the snowfall in the period of january to june decreased significantly by 43 0 97 mm under the warming scenario fig 6a as a result the snowpack in the cleve creek watershed decreased on average by 101 141 mm under the warming scenario compared to the cooling scenario fig 6b the difference in the snowpack caused snowmelt to decrease by 27 0 8 mm under the warming scenario fig 6c in addition the peak streamflow was attenuated and occurred earlier under the warming scenario than the cooling scenario fig 6d further analyses indicated that warming cooling induced shifts in snowfall affected the intra annual distribution of streamflow in the cleve creek watershed the total streamflow was larger under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario prior to the day when the two hydrographs intersected subsequently the total streamflow was significantly lower under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario fig 6d nevertheless the annual total streamflow did not differ significantly between the two contrasting scenarios when the time series of daily precipitation remained unaltered shifts in snowfall exerted significant impacts on the intra annual pattern of soil moisture content the soil saturation deficit was much lower under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario prior to the day when the two hydrographs intersected fig 6f subsequently the soil saturation deficit was higher under the warming scenario than under the cooling scenario in addition warming resulted in a greater loss of snow via sublimation as illustrated in fig 6e on average however the annual total streamflow and mean soil saturation deficit did not differ significantly under the two contrasting scenarios 3 4 effects of snowmelt and rainfall on streamflow on a seasonal basis on a seasonal basis the autumn september october november streamflow was significantly p 0 05 correlated with autumn rainfall but not with snowmelt in the cleve creek lamoille creek and incline creek watersheds respectively table 1 the correlations between autumn streamflow and rainfall as well as between autumn streamflow and snowmelt however were not significant in the twin river watershed table 1 the winter january february march streamflow was significantly p 0 01 correlated with winter rainfall and snowmelt in both the lamoille creek and the incline creek watersheds table 1 the winter streamflow increased by 0 47 mm in the lamoille creek watershed and 0 44 mm in the incline creek watershed as the winter snowmelt increased by 1 mm in the two watersheds in contrast this correlation is not significant in the cleve creek and the twin river watersheds spring april may june streamflow was significantly correlated with spring rainfall snowmelt in all four watersheds and increased by 0 29 0 47 mm in the cleve creek watershed 0 41 0 61 mm in the lamoille creek watershed 0 44 0 64 mm in the twin river watershed and 0 27 0 50 mm in the incline creek watershed as the spring rainfall snowmelt increased by 1 mm in these watersheds summer july august september streamflow was significantly p 0 001 correlated with summer snowmelt in the lamoille creek twin river and incline creek watershed but not in the cleve creek watershed however the correlation between summer streamflow and rainfall was only significant in the lamoille creek and the incline creek watersheds table 1 3 5 time lag effects of preseason snowmelt and rainfall on seasonal streamflow when considering the time lag effects of preseason snowmelt and rainfall on the baseflow in the following seasons autumn baseflow was significantly p 0 05 correlated with summer snowmelt in the twin river and the incline creek watershed respectively table 2 the autumn baseflow increased by 0 21 mm in the twin river watershed and 0 23 mm in the cleve creek watershed as summer snowmelt increased by 1 mm in the two watersheds for the cleve creek and lamoille creek watersheds autumn baseflow was not significantly correlated with summer snowmelt table 2 in the winter the seasonal baseflow was significantly correlated with autumn rainfall in the cleve creek and twin river watersheds whereas the correlation was not significant in the lamoille creek and incline creek watersheds in addition significant correlations between winter baseflow and autumn snowmelt only occurred in the twin river watershed table 2 spring baseflow was only significantly correlated with winter rainfall in the incline creek watershed table 2 unlike in spring the summer baseflow was significantly p 0 05 correlated with spring rainfall in all four watersheds similarly the summer baseflow was also significantly correlated with spring snowmelt in most watersheds except for the lamoille creek watershed which is located farther north than the other three watersheds table 2 overall winter rainfall and snowmelt seemed to have no significant impacts on spring baseflow whereas spring rainfall and snowmelt exhibited significant impacts on summer baseflow in most watersheds table 2 3 6 the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to river streamflow table 3 shows the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to the variability of streamflow on both seasonal and annual bases our results indicated that autumn preseason summer and spring rainfall jointly contributed more than snowmelt to the variation of autumn streamflow in the four watersheds table 3 for example autumn rainfall accounted for 19 of the variability of autumn streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 80 in the lamoille creek watershed 20 in the twin river watershed and 48 in the incline creek watershed table 3 similarly winter streamflow depended more on rainfall than on snowmelt in the same season winter and the preseason autumn winter rainfall 10 and preseason rainfall in autumn 48 jointly accounted for 58 of the variability in winter streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 77 in the lamoille creek watershed and 65 in the incline creek watershed surpassing the 41 of contribution of snowmelt in the cleve creek watershed 23 in the lamoille creek watershed and 35 in the incline creek watershed for the twin river watershed the contribution of autumn and winter rainfall 48 to the variability in winter streamflow approximates that of snowmelt 52 table 3 unlike in autumn and winter the spring snowmelt accounted for 74 of the variability in spring streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 58 in the lamoille creek watershed and 69 in the incline creek watershed surpassing the 22 of the contribution from spring rainfall in the cleve creek watershed 35 in the lamoille creek watershed and 11 in the incline creek watershed for the twin river watershed the contribution of spring snowmelt to spring streamflow 47 was close to that of spring rainfall 49 table 3 compared to spring streamflow the variation of summer streamflow depended more on spring and summer snowmelt than on rainfall in these two seasons in the lamoille creek watershed 75 the twin river watershed 79 and the incline creek watershed 62 table 3 in contrast spring and summer rainfall jointly explained 60 of the variation in summer streamflow in the cleve creek watershed table 3 exceeding the 40 of variation that was jointly explained by spring and summer snowmelt table 3 on an annual basis the variation of snowmelt explained 63 of the variability in annual streamflow in the cleve creek watershed 66 in the lamoille creek watershed 84 in the twin river watershed and 57 in the incline creek watershed all proportions are greater than those from the annual rainfall table 3 4 discussion 4 1 interrelationships among climate and hydrological variables the strength of correlation as suggested by the r2 value between streamflow and snowfall was stronger than that between streamflow and rainfall in the cleve creek watershed 0 45 vs 0 42 the lamoille creek watershed 0 36 vs 0 29 and the twin river watershed 0 72 vs 0 09 suggesting that the variability in streamflow in these watersheds was more closely correlated with the changes in the snowfall snowmelt than the changes in rainfall e g barnhart et al 2016 the reason is that precipitation falls mostly as snow instead of liquid rain in winter serreze et al 1999 and snowmelt accounts for over 63 of the variability in annual streamflow in the three watersheds table 3 in contrast rainfall mostly occurs in late spring summer and early autumn when the air temperature is above the freezing point and thus greater moisture loss occurs due to evaporation e g vicuña et al 2011 this explains why the strength of correlation between streamflow and rainfall on an annual basis was weaker or the rainfall accounted for less than 37 of the variability in annual streamflow in the three watersheds even for the incline creek watershed located in the westernmost area of the study region fig 1d the contribution of snowmelt to the variability in annual streamflow 57 was still greater than that of rainfall 43 the stronger correlation between snowmelt and seasonal streamflow in spring and summer table 1 indicates that snowmelt increases subsurface flow e g barnhart et al 2016 in addition the significant interrelationships among the annual daily peak streamflow peak snowpack and peak snowmelt in most of the watersheds demonstrate the importance of the snow regime in governing the stream hydrograph in the study region fig 4d f dedieu et al 2014 indicated that the variability in the mountain snowpack in mid latitudes impacts hydrological systems and water management 4 2 effects of shifts in warming and precipitation on river streamflow similar to other studies at the regional or global scale tang et al 2015 annual mean daily temperature trended upward significantly in most watersheds except for the incline creek watershed fig a1 especially during the snowmelt season march june the mean daily temperature was higher in the second period than in the first period fig 5a c e and g under warmer conditions the peak streamflow occurred earlier because the time when the daily temperature passed the snow melting point occurred on average 5 days earlier on the one hand this results in earlier snowmelt e g mote et al 2005 harpold et al 2012 but on the other hand it can cause parts of precipitation to fall as liquid water instead of snow these findings are consistent with our results from two contrasting scenarios under which snowfall was about 47 higher under the cooling scenario 681 mm than under the warming scenario 463 1 mm in 2005 although the peak streamflow occurred earlier in all watersheds due to the warming effect e g stewart et al 2010 the peak snowpack and snowmelt did not occur earlier in any of the watersheds during the study period fig a4 this suggests that factors e g snow persistence snowmelt rate other than temperature also play important roles in the timing of the peak snowpack and snowmelt for example hammond et al 2018 indicated that snow persistence correlated with annual streamflow in dry and cold watersheds in the western us and could be used to map spatial patterns of annual streamflow generation nevertheless our results based on experimental simulations suggest that the peak snowpack occurred about 30 60 days earlier than the peak streamflow fig 6b vs d this finding is in good agreement with the results of hunsaker et al 2012 who found that the peak discharge lagged approximately 60 days behind the peak snowpack at higher elevations and 20 30 days at lower elevations in the southern sierra nevada in addition the annual total streamflow under the warming and cooling scenarios was not sensitive to temperature change associated shifts in snowfall indicating that the amount of precipitation rather than the precipitation type plays a dominant role in determining annual total streamflow nayak et al 2010 indicated that although significant warming during 1962 2006 in idaho in the us caused more precipitation to fall as liquid water there was no significant change in the total streamflow of the water year in a snow dominated mountain watershed because the annual total precipitation did not shift significantly previous studies hammond et al 2018 kormos et al 2016 indicated that the precipitation amount was the dominant factor affecting the streamflow volume nevertheless shifts in precipitation types affect the intra annual pattern of streamflow and soil moisture condition for example berghuijs et al 2014 indicated that a shift in precipitation from snow to rain decreased the annual streamflow across all climate types in the western us because more snow melted under the warming scenario the streamflow increased and the soil saturation deficit was lower prior to the occurrence of the peak streamflow fig 6d and f previous studies e g harpold and molotch 2015 chauvin et al 2011 highlighted the coupling between snowmelt timing and peak soil moisture and the importance of soil water for subsurface flow in contrast since less snow melted during the months of march june an increase in snowfall and the resultant snowpack under the cooling scenario increased the streamflow and soil moisture content in the following summer fig 6 these findings agree well with previous studies e g jefferson 2011 nayak et al 2010 suggesting that warming can lead to a significant trend toward greater winter and lower summer discharge in snow dominated watersheds the amount of rainfall also regulates the effects of shifts in the snow regime on the stream hydrograph although the peak flow occurred earlier in the second period in all the four watersheds the magnitudes of the peak flow were not consistently greater or lower than in the first period fig 5 this inconsistency in the variation of the magnitudes of peak flow is attributed to differences in the amount of rainfall between the two periods fig 7 a for example the higher rainfall in the first period contributed to streamflow generation in the cleve creek watershed which minimized the difference in average peak streamflow triggered by shifts in snowmelt fig 5b 4 3 time lag effects of preseason rainfall and snowmelt on river streamflow the significant relationships between summer baseflow and spring rainfall in most watersheds table 2 can be possibly attributed to the fact that increased rainfall in spring increases the soil water content in these seasons which results in greater subsurface flow in summer seyfried et al 2009 further analyses indicated that winter snowfall accounted for over 26 7 for the twin river watershed to 33 0 for the incline creek watershed of annual total precipitation in contrast winter rainfall accounted for only 5 6 for the lamoille creek watershed to 13 0 for the incline creek watershed of annual total precipitation because precipitation in winter mostly falls as snowfall instead of rainfall serreze et al 1999 and because rainfall in summer and autumn is comparatively low mostly 10 of annual total precipitation and there are greater losses from evaporation the correlations between seasonal baseflow and the preseason rainfall in autumn winter and spring were not significant in most watersheds table 2 similarly increasing snowmelt in spring increases the soil moisture content of dry soil in spring and thus benefits streamflow in summer chauvin et al 2011 indicated that spring snowmelt must first replenish the soil saturation deficit before water is delivered to the stream in fact our results indicate that the soil water content continued to increase as demonstrated by a decrease in the soil saturation deficit from early march to late june in all watersheds fig 7b this contributed to summer flow generation the peak streamflow generally occurred about 1 3 days after the soil saturation deficit reached the lowest value fig 7b again similar to rainfall because snowmelt occurs less in summer autumn and winter or mostly occurs before summer seasonal baseflow in autumn winter and spring were not significantly related to the preseason snowmelt in most watersheds table 2 the consistency of the significant relationships between spring streamflow and spring rainfall snowmelt in the four watersheds table 1 was likely observed because more than 16 of annual total precipitation and 62 of annual total snowmelt occur in spring in the study regions as a result more water is available for spring flow in addition the continuous decrease in the soil saturation deficit that started in march fig 7b as a result of winter rainfall and snowmelt may have caused the soil moisture content to increase to a threshold so that spring rainfall and snowmelt directly generated streamflow in fact the streamflow started to increase sharply beginning in late march or early may in most watersheds fig 5b f h because less rainfall occurred in most watersheds and the amount of snowmelt was greater than that of rainfall in all watersheds in the simulations in summer snowmelt was the major source of summer streamflow godsey et al 2014 barnhart et al 2016 this explains the non significant relationship between summer streamflow and rainfall and the significant relationship between summer streamflow and snowmelt in most watersheds table 1 overall the inconsistency of the relationship between streamflow and rainfall snowmelt in winter and autumn in the four watersheds suggest that the mechanisms for streamflow generation are more complex in autumn and winter than in spring and summer 4 4 contributions of snowmelt and rainfall to the variability in streamflow the higher contribution rate of snowmelt than rainfall to the variability in spring and summer streamflow indicates that the stream hydrographs in the two seasons in the study regions are mainly controlled by the snow regime this is highly consistent with the results of previous studies which suggested that spring snowmelt contributed proportionally more to streamflow than rainfall in snow dominated catchments clow 2010 and that spring snowmelt was the dominant factor in generating summer streamflow barnhart et al 2016 godsey et al 2014 nevertheless the contribution of rainfall to the variability in streamflow in autumn and winter appeared to be larger than that from snowmelt suggesting that rainfall plays a more important role than snowmelt in generating streamflow in these two seasons this is likely because precipitation falls predominantly as liquid water when the temperature is above zero and as snow when the temperature is below zero in the latter case there is less snowmelt and thus rainfall becomes the dominant factor in generating flow for example our statistics indicate that autumn snowmelt accounted for only 4 4 7 6 of total annual snowmelt in most watersheds on an annual basis the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow exceeded that of rainfall table 1 indicating that the variability in streamflow depends more on snowmelt than on rainfall li et al 2017 suggested that over half of the total runoff in the western us originates as snowmelt 5 conclusion in this study we used a coupled hydro ecological model to examine the effects of climatic variability on streamflow in four snow dominated mountain watersheds in the us great basin our results indicated that i annual streamflow in the semiarid and arid regions was significantly correlated with both snowfall and snowmelt during 1991 2015 and increased by 0 62 0 77 mm as snowfall increased by 1 mm in contrast annual streamflow was negatively correlated to annual mean temperature but this correlation was only statistically significant in the twin river and the incline creek watersheds in addition the annual daily peak streamflow was significantly correlated with the annual daily peak snowpack and snowmelt ii an increase in the daily mean temperature during the study period resulted in an earlier occurrence of the peak flow in all watersheds nevertheless the impact of snowmelt on streamflow was subject to the effect of rainfall on soil moisture conditions higher peak snowmelt did not always result in higher peak streamflow on an annual basis the amount of precipitation played a dominant role in determining the streamflow volume whereas the snow regime accounted for the variability of streamflow hydrograph iii spring rainfall and snowmelt played not only dominant roles in generating spring streamflow but also essential roles in generating summer baseflow in almost all watersheds in addition summer flow generation depended more on summer snowmelt than on summer rainfall the mechanisms of the flow generation were more complex in autumn and winter than in spring and summer on an annual basis snowmelt accounted for more than 60 of the variability in streamflow surpassing the contribution of rainfall overall shifts in the snow regime associated with climate variability play a dominant role in governing stream hydrographs in the semiarid and arid regions of the us great basin given that temperatures in the western us are projected to increase by 1 2 c and the warming will shift the snow regime and trigger the occurrence of snow drought harpold et al 2017 hatchett and mcevoy 2018 this

6511,this study aims to clarify groundwater and stream water flow systems in the geum river basin korea which is an area with a crystalline basement using δ18o δ2h and 3h stable isotopes of precipitation showed clear differences between dry and rainy seasons due to the asian monsoon groundwater and stream water samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons in three hydrographic zones of the upper middle and lower zones the contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge based on deuterium excess was 71 89 far exceeding the amount fraction of the season in total precipitation stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water showed little seasonal variation and indicated the dominance of high altitude recharge in the upper zone groundwater with lower 3h was mainly observed in that area indicating a contribution of intermediate flow with a longer residence time in contrast stream water and some groundwater samples in the lower zone showed seasonal variability and signatures of 10 20 evaporation in their stable isotopic composition the 3h content of groundwater in the lower zone was high indicating that the local flow system is dominant these regional features also influenced the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation dry season precipitation and local recharge with evaporation signature as estimated from δ18o and deuterium excess values and 3h in groundwater stream water from lower order streams of the river had stable isotopic compositions similar to those in the upper zone indicating a considerable contribution of groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas to the lower reach of the river these results have implications for sustainable management of water resources in the basin during predicted changes in water usage and precipitation patterns due to climate change as well as in regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions keywords crystalline bedrock aquifer groundwater

resources abbott et al 2000 kortelainen and karhu 2004 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 kabeya et al 2007 beisner et al 2018 rey et al 2018 since tóth 1963 first proposed a conceptual model of groundwater flow divided into local intermediate and regional groundwater flow in hypothetical homogeneous and isotropic drainage basins several studies have attempted to characterize water flow processes by developing various environmental tracers and hydrogeochemical parameters paternoster et al 2008 wassenaar et al 2011 liu and yamanaka 2012 jódar et al 2016 panda et al 2018 rey et al 2018 often

groundwater flow systems using conceptual models associated with various hydrological and structural settings based on stable isotopes james et al 2000 used multi isotopic tracers to demonstrate that the lower opal springs and spring river were controlled by mixing processes of local and regional groundwater flow while the regional flow system was influenced mainly by the metolius river in the central oregon cascades kim and jeong 2005 found that natural occurrence of fluoride rich groundwater was associated with the hydrologic conditions of a fault zone using the relationship between stable isotope and fluoride concentrations tsujimura et al 2007 successfully identified interactions between groundwater and river water in a stream network using a multi tracer approach pacheco and van der weijden 2014a used δ18o and 87sr 86sr to estimate depth of water circulation in a small watershed peng et al 2018 evaluated the recharge processes of montane water and their importance to adjacent valley plain groundwater in a tectonic suture zone using natural tracer based end member mixing analysis emma multiple environmental tracers provide additional information on groundwater flow systems maloszewski et al 2002 in particular environmental 3h is commonly used alongside stable isotopes to trace the origin of water in the hydrological cycle abbott et al 2000 revealed that the degree of mixing between local recharge and deep groundwater is temporally and spatially variable due to differences in the interconnection of bedrock fractures based on a comparison of δ18o in groundwater and precipitation and groundwater age which was determined from 3h joshi et al 2018 used stable isotopes and 3h to identify the recharge sources of groundwater and to systematically characterize flow paths in the northwest indian aquifer system considerable research on groundwater flow systems has been conducted using environmental tracers in karst aquifers vandenschrick et al 2002 perrin et al 2003 zhao et al 2018 and volcanic aquifer systems demlie et al 2007 paternoster et al 2008 hernández antonio et al 2015 but few studies have been conducted in crystalline aquifer systems praamsma et al 2009 leketa et al 2018 petelet giraud et al 2018 the geum river basin in south korea consists of high mountains in the east and plains in the west and its major lithology is crystalline bedrock and alluvium in 2017 annual groundwater usage in the basin was 46 8 billion tons corresponding to 11 6 of total groundwater usage in south korea kowaco 2017 a few studies have employed environmental isotopes to characterize geothermal water systems or trace the origin of co2 rich water in bedrock aquifers at a local scale kim et al 2000 jeong et al 2001 kim et al 2005 however no regional studies have been carried out to delineate the groundwater flow system in the geum river basin using environmental isotopes this study aims to describe the surface and groundwater flow systems in the geum river basin using stable isotopes of δ18o and δ2h as well as 3h the specific objectives are to identify the factors controlling the spatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes and 3h in alluvial and crystalline bedrock aquifers at the regional scale and to assess the recharge processes and flow paths of groundwater as well as stream aquifer interactions in the basin we also established a conceptual model of the water flow systems in the basin considering its hydrographic and hydrogeologic settings 2 study area the area of the geum river basin is around 9915 km2 and is located in the central part of the korean peninsula fig 1 the geum river one of four national rivers has a linear length from source to mouth of about 85 km and a total length of stream channels of 396 km kowaco 2002 the geum river consists of 10 national streams 20 first class regional streams and 460 s class regional streams and discharges into the yellow sea the ten sub basins of the geum river watershed were classified into three hydrographic groups upper zone k1 k3 middle zone k4 k6 and lower zone k7 k10 table 1 the geum river basin consists primarily of precambrian meta sedimentary rocks and jurassic cretaceous granitic rocks cheong et al 2003 no sizeable exposures of carbonates or evaporites have been reported weathered zones of granitic rocks and gneiss are widely dispersed in the study area alluvial aquifers are present in the lower parts of the sub basins at a thickness of 7 20 m but are poorly developed in the upper parts of the sub basins within mountainous areas kowaco 2002 a large number of fractures with random orientations can be observed in the study area groundwater flow within the crystalline bedrock is controlled by structural discontinuity and the connectivity of fractures lee and lee 2000 maréchal et al 2004 the monthly mean air temperature from 1981 to 2010 was 13 c and ranged from 1 0 c in january to 25 6 c in august the mean annual precipitation 1981 2010 is 1458 6 mm around 71 of which falls during summer june to september winter december to february is cold and dry whereas summer june to september is hot and humid with frequent heavy rainfall lee et al 1999 in this study june to september were classified as rainy season and october to may as dry season considering monthly rainfall lee et al 1999 annual precipitation is mainly controlled by the east asian monsoon annual precipitation in 2017 was 1127 5 mm approximately 77 of which occurred rainy season kma 2018 the recharge rate of the geum river basin ranged from 9 2 to 15 8 for sub basins with an average of 13 6 and no clear trend was not observed for the three hydrographic zones molit 2012 the geum river is highly regulated like other rivers in korea and various water storage facilities has been constructed in the basin including two large dams in the upper basin weirs and reservoirs on the tributaries to secure water supply for drought conditions ahn et al 2014 in recent years the four rivers restoration project launched as part of the green new deal policy in 2009 has incurred significant environmental changes in the geum river after construction of three barrages on the mainstream kim et al 2016 however this restoration project and policy were implemented without a conceptual model of the groundwater flow system and its interaction with surface water which has led to limitations in the understanding of regional hydrogeological processes 3 methods 3 1 sample collection a total of 195 rainfall and snowfall samples were collected weekly at three stations located at altitudes of 140 431 and 790 m a m s l over two years from august 2014 to august 2016 at mt gyeryong which is located in the central portion of the study area precipitation samples were stored in 30 l plastic containers coupled with a filter mesh to prevent debris contamination which were coated with about 250 ml of mineral oil to prevent evaporation the mineral oil in the precipitation samples was removed using a 1 l glass separatory funnel all precipitation samples were stored upside down at 4 c in 20 ml polyethylene vials with polycone lined caps and parafilm seals until analysis rainfall and air temperature were measured at three stations using tipping bucket rain gauges with hobo loggers 1 pulse 0 2 mm rain aerodynamic rain gauge eijkelkamp giesbeek netherlands the loggers were programmed to record air temperature at 1 min intervals in total 67 groundwater samples from 46 bedrock aquifer wells and 21 shallow aquifer wells in the national groundwater monitoring network ngmn were collected in april and september 2017 each ngmn site has a bedrock aquifer monitoring well with total depth of 40 150 m avg 76 m and some sites also have a shallow aquifer monitoring well with total depth of 8 27 m avg 15 m in addition 67 water samples were collected from perennial streams near the groundwater monitoring sites under base flow conditions at least three days after any rainfall event to minimize the contribution of direct runoff to stream discharge stream order numbers based on the strahler ordering system were assigned to the stream network table 2 a headwater stream with no tributaries is classified as order 1 in the strahler ordering system and the order increases wherever two segments of the same order meet when two segments of unequal order meet the highest order number is retained strahler 1957 water temperature electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured in the field using portable instruments water samples were filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filters in the field 3 2 analytical methods the isotopic and chemical compositions of the water samples were analyzed at the groundwater research center korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources kigam daejeon south korea the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were determined through wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds l2120 i picarro santa clara ca usa a type of isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy that is widely used in hydrologic applications penna et al 2010 liu and yamanaka 2012 all water samples were heated to 110 c in a vaporizer and then sent to the cavity of ws crds under dry n2 gas 99 999 purity all isotopic ratio results are reported using δ notation relative to the international standard vsmow2 vienna standard mean ocean water 2 the primary standards vsmow2 gisp and slap2 and secondary standards were used to calibrate the stable isotopic composition and to identify day to day changes in analytical quality and drift effects ws crds has uncertainties of 0 1 and 0 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively jung et al 2013 kim et al 2017 groundwater samples collected in april were also analyzed for their 3h contents 3h was analyzed using low level liquid scintillation counting after electrolytic enrichment of the initial sample from a volume of 500 to 1000 ml at the university of waterloo waterloo on canada university of miami miami fl usa and kigam typical detection limits are 0 6 0 1 tu mainly depending on the degree of electrolytic enrichment more detailed analytical procedures were reported by yoon et al 2010 4 results 4 1 stable isotopic composition of precipitation the measured δ18o and δ2h in precipitation ranged from 15 6 to 0 1 and 116 to 5 respectively fig 2 seasonal local meteoric water lines lmwl were defined using these measurements resulting in δ2h 7 98 δ18o 9 28 n 69 r2 0 98 for summer june to september and δ2h 7 16 δ18o 17 97 n 66 r2 0 87 for winter november to february precipitation and snowfall the lmwl for summer was close to the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 whereas the lmwl for winter was plotted to the left of the gmwl with more widely scattered data than the lmwl for summer these two lmwls were very similar to those defined by lee et al 1999 for precipitation in daejeon and seoul korea deuterium excess d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 ranged from 3 8 to 38 7 and the seasonal averages were 8 9 3 9 and 23 7 7 5 for summer and winter respectively because the study area is located in east asia where the asian monsoon dominates precipitation patterns seasonally distinct d values were obtained due to the changing air masses and moisture sources lee et al 2003 altitude effects on δ18o and δ2h in precipitation were determined using measurements collected at three stations in mt gyeryong as well as the cheongju station of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip in 2015 even though the cheongju station is about 37 km from the stations in mt gyeryong the amount of precipitation and weighted mean stable isotopic composition of precipitation were similar during the same period strong correlations were observed between altitude and the mean stable isotopic composition weighted based on the amount of precipitation fig 3 the isotopic lapse rate with changing altitude was calculated to be 0 12 per 100 m for δ18o and 0 7 per 100 m for δ2h the isotopic lapse rates in the study area were relatively small compared to the global average isotopic lapse rate of 0 28 per 100 m for δ18o poage and chamberlain 2001 but were similar to the average lapse rate in china liu et al 2014 because the extent of the altitude effect can reflect the local climate and topography of a region similar lapse rates have been reported in some other regions influenced by the asian monsoon system machida and shindo 1999 mandal et al 2011 in mid latitude regions temperature and precipitation amount are important factors controlling the final isotopic composition of precipitation dansgaard 1964 lee et al 2003 however their relative contributions to the isotopic fractionation of precipitation vary spatially particularly in the asian monsoon region liu et al 2014 because both air temperature and rainfall amount are highest in summer in this region the effects of temperature and precipitation amount on the isotopic composition of precipitation offset each other to some extent johnson and ingram 2004 in the study area the latitude effect was not considered as a major factor because the lmwls in daejeon seoul and pohang showed no significant differences lee and lee 1999 the effect of precipitation amount and the altitude effect by orographic lift are the main factors considered to influence the isotopic fractionation of precipitation in the geum river basin in the mt gyeryong area the amount of annual precipitation increased from 688 mm at the base to 1245 mm at the top which could be attributed to orographic lift 4 2 stable isotopic composition of stream water and groundwater the average values of δ18o and δ2h for stream water were 7 0 and 48 in the dry season and 8 0 and 55 in the rainy season respectively table 3 the lowest δ18o and δ2h values were observed in the stream network in the upper zone most stream water was below the lmwl in summer indicating that stream water has undergone isotopic enrichment due to evaporation fig 4 local evaporation lines were determined using the δ18o and δ2h values of stream water resulting in δ2h 6 4 δ18o 2 6 n 67 r2 0 93 for the dry season and δ2h 5 7 δ18o 9 0 n 67 r2 0 87 for the rainy season fig 4 b the stable isotopic composition was more depleted in the upper zone than the lower zone with that in the middle zones falling between these two groups but closer to the upper zone fig 5 a the spatial differences in δ18o and δ2h were significantly reduced in the rainy season compared to the dry season figs 4 and 5 b in addition the range of δ18o in the plain area during the rainy season was much narrower than that in the dry season the difference in the median value of δ18o between the upper zone and lower zone was reduced from 1 8 in the dry season to 0 3 in the rainy season the seasonal variation of δ18o in the upper zone was smaller than in other zones based on the median value and range in contrast stream water in the lower zones showed strong seasonality in estimated recharge altitude compared to other zones fig 6 the seasonal δ18o and δ2h values of evaporating water were calculated using rayleigh distillation with a total fractionation factor according to the equations defined by majoube 1971 and gonfiantini 1986 the average annual air temperature and relative humidity over the last 30 years 1981 2010 of cheonan and jangsu kma stations were 11 1 c and 72 8 respectively which were used for the evaporation calculation and the average δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater in the upper zone 8 6 and 58 6 were used as the initial values the seasonal variability of stream water in the lower zone was significantly higher than those of other zones fig 4 c and d based on rayleigh evaporation lines stream water in the lower zone was affected by 10 20 evaporation in the dry season and 5 10 evaporation in the rainy season fig 4 the evaporation estimate in the rainy season is similar to 7 13 obtained for the han river basin in korea during summer season ryu et al 2007 to identify the sources of stream water in the lower zones the stream network in the geum river basin was classified using the strahler stream order system and stream water δ18o was compared in the dry and rainy seasons fig 7 the δ18o of stream water became enriched with increasing stream order in the upper zones and middle zones regardless of season however the δ18o of stream water became depleted with increasing stream order in the lower zones in the rainy season despite extensive agricultural activities in the area these isotopic trends indicate that the contribution of stream water originating from the upper zones is high throughout the stream network in the rainy season which was confirmed by the similarity of the stable isotopic compositions of stream water and groundwater during the rainy season fig 4 the spatial variations in δ18o and δ2h of groundwater indicated more depleted isotopic compositions in the upper zone than the lower zone similar to those of stream water fig 4 the average values of stable isotopic composition in groundwater were relatively constant in two seasons fig 5 indicating that the groundwater flow system was stable in the basin as a whole however the ranges of isotopic composition showed considerable variations between the two seasons suggesting that some aquifers had local recharge with higher seasonal variability the relative contribution of precipitation to total recharge in dry and rainy seasons was calculated based on two component mixing using average d values in precipitation of the two seasons winograd et al 1998 lee et al 1999 the representative d values of precipitation were estimated from the measurements at cheongju gnip station from 1999 to 2016 as 16 2 and 8 3 for dry and rainy season respectively compared with precipitation amount of rainy season as a fraction of total precipitation of 69 71 over the last 30 years the contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge was disproportionately dominant accounting for 71 89 while the contribution of rainy season precipitation to surface water was similar to the amount fractions except the middle zone in dry season table 4 the predominance of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge was most pronounced in the lower zone in dry season 4 3 reconstructed 3h input and groundwater 3h to estimate residence time of groundwater from measured 3h the 3h input history of the geum river basin was reconstructed koh and chae 2008 reconstructed the 3h input history in daejeon from 1950 to 2000 using 3h measurement data at 11 gnip stations in the northern hemisphere and 3 gnip stations in south korea in this study 3h input from precipitation was extended to the period between 2001 and 2015 using monthly 3h measurements for precipitation at the daejeon station of the korea institute of nuclear safety which were weighted based on monthly precipitation the two series of 3h inputs matched well without significant discontinuity in temporal trends fig 8 based on the reconstructed 3h values in precipitation groundwater recharged before 1950 contained 3h below 0 5 tu while young groundwater with recent recharge contained 3h ranging from 2 to 6 tu the effect of bomb 3h was assumed to be negligible for most groundwater samples because the 3h peak is highly likely to be dispersed and mixed in aquifers if there is no significant lag in the thick unsaturated zone 3h concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 2 tu can be regarded as mixtures of 3h free old water and young groundwater in this study qualitative groundwater ages using 3h concentration were used to designate samples as old groundwater with 3h less than 0 5 tu young groundwater with 3h greater than 2 tu and mixed groundwater with 3h from 0 5 tu to 2 tu this approach has been previously applied to volcanic aquifers on jeju island korea koh et al 2005 the 3h concentration in groundwater in the study area ranged from 0 3 to 5 4 tu table 5 the median 3h concentration was 2 8 tu in shallow groundwater and 2 2 tu in bedrock groundwater which did not differ significantly p value 0 22 t test fig 9 a in shallow groundwater 19 of samples corresponded to mixed groundwater and 81 to young groundwater in bedrock groundwater 11 corresponded to old groundwater 35 to mixed groundwater and 54 to young groundwater the 3h concentrations in groundwater were clearly distinguished among hydrographic zones groundwater in the upper zone showed a significant difference from that in the lower zone p value 0 01 t test groundwater in the middle zone had a median 3h value similar to the upper zone but a wider range fig 9 b 4 4 end member mixing analysis of environmental isotopes the emma approach based on the mass balance of tracers has been widely used for hydrograph separation burns et al 2001 maurya et al 2011 previous studies have used the δ18o and δ2h values of water with cl concentration or ec to distinguish sources and flow paths in groundwater systems nakaya et al 2007 peng et al 2018 rey et al 2018 cl is a conservative tracer that can be used to evaluate groundwater recharge in alluvial sediments subyani 2004 liu and yamanaka 2012 ec is also a useful tracer and can be used to identify seawater intrusion effects or differences in water rock interactions depending on aquifer type in the study area mountainous terrain acts as water storage therefore understanding the hydrological processes in the mountainous area is important for maintaining water resources in the adjacent plain area viviroli et al 2007 peng et al 2018 recently groundwater recharge in the mountainous area has been determined to significantly contribute to regional groundwater and streamflow systems tetzlaff and soulsby 2008 ajami et al 2011 previous studies have identified the process of mountain system recharge msr as the main source of water to plain areas anderson et al 1992 viviroli and weingarther 2004 wilson and guan 2004 liu and yamanaka 2012 peng et al 2018 we tried to determine the relative importance of msr and surface water groundwater interactions using emma for δ18o and δ2h in groundwater and stream water cl concentration and ec were also considered but could not easily distinguish end members associated with sources of water and flow paths these tracers can be affected in various ways depending on lithology and land use patterns distribution of contamination sources and the influence of seawater in coastal areas peng et al 2016 shin et al 2017 in this regard emma using δ18o and d value and 3h in groundwater was employed to clarify the contributions of groundwater flow in mountainous areas and surface groundwater interaction in the geum river basin few studies have applied δ18o and d value for evaluation of evaporation effects and groundwater mixing processes tsujimura et al 2007 joshi et al 2018 three end members were assigned using the amount weighted average values of summer precipitation end member a winter precipitation end member b and evaporated stream water end member c in plain areas most groundwater and stream water samples fell within the triangle made by these end members fig 10 indicating that the end member system could account for the majority of variance in the stable isotopic composition of water samples therefore these three end members represented the seasonal variability in groundwater recharge and the surface water flow system associated with the hydroclimatic conditions of rainfall snowfall and evaporation as well as the degree of surface water groundwater interaction emma of environmental tracers revealed distinct spatial and temporal patterns of the relative contributions of recharge sources in the study area each end member was characteristic of a distinct group of water samples groundwater with high fraction of end member a had the lowest 3h concentration representing the contribution to regional flow from summer precipitation meanwhile groundwater in the lower zone had higher 3h values indicating the dominance of local recharge in accordance with the more enriched isotopic composition of groundwater in that area some stream water samples collected in the upper zone had higher fractions of end member b which is generally attributed to winter precipitation end member c mainly contributed to stream water in the lower zone where local recharge including that of evaporated water is most likely to discharge into streams the relative contributions of three end members to groundwater and stream water showed clear differences according to the three hydrographic zones fig 11 a considerable portion of stream water sampled in the upper zones and the middle zones overlapped with groundwater in the emma of stable isotopes fig 10 indicating that groundwater from mountainous terrain is the main source of stream water in these areas other stream water samples away from groundwater appear to be affected by rapid infiltration of precipitation leading to seasonal variability of isotopic composition 5 discussion 5 1 water sources and flow processes in the basin the depleted isotopic compositions of stream water in the upper zone with less seasonal variability can be attributed to the significant contribution of groundwater inflow from adjacent mountainous terrains where orographic lift enhances the amount of precipitation at higher altitudes resulting in accelerated precipitation infiltration with depleted δ18o and δ2h tappa et al 2016 choi et al 2007 and combalicer et al 2008 reported recharge rate higher than 21 in mountainous areas in korea which is significantly higher than average recharge rate of 14 in the geum river basin previous studies in the mt gyeryong region of the geum river basin showed that groundwater significantly contributed to discharge in headwater streams in the mountainous region with a thin soil layer based on antecedent precipitation index models jung et al 2016 these results indicate that active groundwater discharge to streams may occur in the study area due to the hydrologic features of its mountainous terrain corroborating that first order streams in mountainous terrains play significant roles in maintaining stream discharge for the whole stream network alexander et al 2007 nadeau and rains 2007 tezlaff and soulsby 2008 also reported that mountainous catchments can make an important contribution to downstream flows although mountainous regions underlain by crystalline aquifers with thin soil have limited aquifer potential and groundwater storage the more enriched isotopic composition of stream water in the lower zones with greater seasonal variability could be attributed to the seasonally variable effect of evaporation and less influence of msr at higher altitudes which was more pronounced in the dry season fig 6 these observations indicate that streams in the lower zone are controlled by seasonally variable and presumably more local flow systems in the lower zones the land use of most areas near the stream consists of rice paddies where impounded water affected by evaporation contributes to stream discharge as base flow todd et al 2006 or return flow koh et al 2010 negrel et al 2011 conversely during the rainy season the increased groundwater contribution from mountainous terrains maintains a higher stream water level than the groundwater in adjacent aquifers gabrielli et al 2012 decreasing the inflow of impounded water buttle et al 2012 stream water impounded by various storage facilities in the basin for water use may be evaporated to a considerable degree in dry season which also contribute to evaporation signature in stable isotopic composition simpson and herczeg 1991 ryu et al 2007 vanplantinga et al 2017 these features shows that anthropogenic activities significantly affect sources and processes of streamflow in the lower zone of the geum river basin the stable isotopic composition of groundwater was close to the lmwl in summer and fairly stable regardless of season fig 4 the d value of groundwater exhibited minor seasonal differences of less than 1 considering the highly variable d value of seasonal precipitation due to changing water vapor sources these results suggest that groundwater is mainly recharged through rainy season precipitation among seasonal sources of groundwater recharge in areas with thick soil layers and heavy vegetation many studies have emphasized the importance of snow pack and precipitation in winter due to increased evapotranspiration in summer wassenaar 1995 winograd et al 1998 blasch and bryson 2007 rey et al 2018 in contrast some studies in asian monsoon regions have reported the dominance of rainy season precipitation in groundwater recharge accounting for 66 71 in various regions of korea lee et al 1999 lee and kim 2007 gautam et al 2018 and 75 5 in taiwan yeh et al 2014 which are similar or lower than the fractions of rainy season precipitation in total precipitation in this study the contribution of rainy season precipitation to recharge was 82 91 excluding that in the lower zone sampled in dry season which can be affected by evaporation and was higher than the amount fraction in precipitation table 4 in contrast to the results of previous studies this finding suggests a weak contribution of precipitation in winter including through snow melt in early spring and highly efficient recharge from summer precipitation due to reduced evapotranspiration compared to areas without monsoon seasons a considerable portion of groundwater in the upper zones and the middle zones had depleted δ18o values due to recharge from high altitude areas figs 5 and 6 in addition the lower 3h of groundwater in bedrock aquifers in those areas indicates that groundwater flow through longer flow paths plays a key role in recharging the aquifers because tectonic structures such as dense sub horizontal and sub vertical fractures create major flow paths in crystalline bedrock aquifers taylor and howard 2000 dewandel et al 2006 pacheco 2015 meanwhile in the lower zones seasonal variations in the isotopic composition and 3h concentration of groundwater were greater than those in other zones seasonally some groundwater had more depleted stable isotopic composition in rainy season compared to that in dry season due to fast infiltration of depleted heavy rainfall whose proportion is 8 57 and 72 for the upper middle and lower zones respectively this indicates that local groundwater flow is more active in the well developed permeable alluvial layers of the lower zone in rainy season in agricultural areas near streams in korea impounded water in paddy fields during growing season has strong evaporation signature and can infiltrate to the aquifers below in some riparian areas the large gradient in groundwater level caused by pumping induces inflow from adjacent streams kwon et al 2017 for these reasons groundwater in the lower zones is highly likely to have multiple sources of recharge resulting in a wide range of stable isotopic compositions and 3h contents 5 2 stream water and groundwater flow systems and their implications stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples indicate that higher altitude recharge in the upper zone seem to be less significant to the lower zone while the middle zone may have a certain amount of recharge from the upper zone fig 5 3h concentration in groundwater indicates that young water predominate in the lower zone and old water significantly contributes to the upper and middle zones fig 9 the emma results showed an intermediate recharge process with long flow paths originating from mountainous terrains was dominant for groundwater in the upper zones whereas the contribution of local recharge and stream aquifer interactions to groundwater increased toward the lower zones fig 10 based on these isotopic signatures in the three hydrographic zones regional groundwater flow across the basin appears to be insignificant while intermediate groundwater flow between the upper zone and the middle zone can be significant groundwater and stream water in the lower zones were widely separated in terms of the contributions of the three end members fig 10 a permeable sandy point bar is generally developed around higher order streams in the plain area due to the absence of impermeable silty soil chae et al 2004 considering these alluvial strata lateral flow through the sandy layer in plain area may be the dominant flow path supplying evaporated water to streams in the dry season meanwhile the depth of the sandy alluvium strata decreases and impermeable mud and silty layers are frequently observed further from stream channels in the plain area choi et al 2010 in the rainy season streams under losing conditions appear to affect adjacent groundwater in the lower zones based on the higher estimated recharge altitude and elevated 3h in groundwater we constructed a conceptual model for groundwater flow systems involving local and intermediate flows and streamflow generation sustained by the groundwater flows for the geum river basin for the two representative seasons integrating the results of environmental isotopes in groundwater and stream water fig 12 this model highlights that groundwater flow systems are spatially different and seasonally less variable in the three hydrographic zones while streamflow from groundwater is seasonally highly variable with higher contribution from mountainous terrains to the whole stream network in rainy season in some previous studies the groundwater flow systems in the basin were constructed based on compilation of fractured zones and faults of the basin pacheco and van der weijden 2014a pacheco 2015 however these data are not available for the basin at present which suggests more research is necessary to understand the groundwater flow systems of the basin in particular regional groundwater flow on the korean peninsula the intensity and frequency of extreme summer precipitation is expected increase in the near future 2021 2100 compared with the present and the number of non precipitation days during spring and summer are also expected to rise based on regional climate models kim et al 2018 in the study area amount of precipitation days of heavy rainfall and precipitation intensity in the study area are expected to increase by 22 4 mm 10 years 12 94 10 years and 1 71 10 years from 2011 to 2100 respectively according to the rcp8 5 scenario in the geum river basin area kma 2012 these changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change may have considerable impacts on groundwater and surface water flow systems as our results indicate a disproportionately large role of summer precipitation in the water resources in the study area the maximum shortage rate of water for agricultural use will be 38 for the 2040 s in the geum river basin under the rcp 4 5 scenario and an obvious decrease in water shortage was expected to be common in june whereas the water stress was expected to intensify in august because of the increased variability in future climate ahn et al 2016 the sensitivity of streamflow in the upper zone of the geum river basin to timing shift of the monsoon season was also shown by hydrologic modeling using future climate change scenarios ryu et al 2011 in terms of the hydrographic zones of the geum river basin the impact of climate change is likely to affect the lower zone on a short term scale and other zones on a longer term due to different groundwater flow systems and streamflow to be highly sensitive to changes in groundwater discharge in the mountainous terrain comprising the upper and middle zones fig 12 this research may provide important information for sustainable management of water resources in the geum river basin and will serve as a prototype to assess stream and groundwater flow systems in other regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions 6 conclusions stable isotopes and 3h in groundwater and stream water in the geum river basin showed spatial and temporal variations depending on the three hydrographic zones of upper middle and lower zones and these trends were compared with the stable isotopes in precipitation in the basin groundwater derived from rainy season precipitation was significantly higher than amount fractions of rainy season precipitation in total precipitation indicating the minor role of dry season precipitation including snow melt in recharge the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water in the upper and middle zones were fairly constant throughout the dry and rainy seasons and most groundwater and stream water were derived from high altitude areas based on the altitude effect on δ18o this indicates that groundwater recharge from mountainous terrains is the main source of streamflow and groundwater flow in the upper and middle zones in contrast groundwater in the lower zone exhibited some seasonal variabilities of its stable isotopic composition as well as changes in recharge altitude in some groundwater samples an evaporation signature of stable isotopes was considerable in groundwater and stream water of the lower zone which was more pronounced in the dry season the δ18o values of stream water became more depleted with increasing stream order in the lower zone approaching those in the upper zone which indicated that groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas contributed considerably to the discharge of the main stream of the geum river the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation dry season precipitation and local recharge with evaporation signature were quantified using δ18o and d value along with 3h in groundwater rainy season precipitation was dominant in the groundwater of the upper zone while local recharge affected by evaporation was the greatest contributor to stream water in the lower zone 3h in groundwater indicated that intermediate recharge with longer flow paths originating from the mountainous areas was a dominant factor affecting groundwater in the upper zone but its contribution decreased toward the lower zone these results contribute to understanding the water sources and hydrologic processes of the groundwater and stream water systems in the geum river basin and promote sustainable management of water resources at the regional scale considering

6511,this study aims to clarify groundwater and stream water flow systems in the geum river basin korea which is an area with a crystalline basement using δ18o δ2h and 3h stable isotopes of precipitation showed clear differences between dry and rainy seasons due to the asian monsoon groundwater and stream water samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons in three hydrographic zones of the upper middle and lower zones the contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge based on deuterium excess was 71 89 far exceeding the amount fraction of the season in total precipitation stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water showed little seasonal variation and indicated the dominance of high altitude recharge in the upper zone groundwater with lower 3h was mainly observed in that area indicating a contribution of intermediate flow with a longer residence time in contrast stream water and some groundwater samples in the lower zone showed seasonal variability and signatures of 10 20 evaporation in their stable isotopic composition the 3h content of groundwater in the lower zone was high indicating that the local flow system is dominant these regional features also influenced the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation dry season precipitation and local recharge with evaporation signature as estimated from δ18o and deuterium excess values and 3h in groundwater stream water from lower order streams of the river had stable isotopic compositions similar to those in the upper zone indicating a considerable contribution of groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas to the lower reach of the river these results have implications for sustainable management of water resources in the basin during predicted changes in water usage and precipitation patterns due to climate change as well as in regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions keywords crystalline bedrock aquifer groundwater

groundwater flow systems using conceptual models associated with various hydrological and structural settings based on stable isotopes james et al 2000 used multi isotopic tracers to demonstrate that the lower opal springs and spring river were controlled by mixing processes of local and regional groundwater flow while the regional flow system was influenced mainly by the metolius river in the central oregon cascades kim and jeong 2005 found that natural occurrence of fluoride rich groundwater was associated with the hydrologic conditions of a fault zone using the relationship between stable isotope and fluoride concentrations tsujimura et al 2007 successfully identified interactions between groundwater and river water in a stream network using a multi tracer approach pacheco and

systems maloszewski et al 2002 in particular environmental 3h is commonly used alongside stable isotopes to trace the origin of water in the hydrological cycle abbott et al 2000 revealed that the degree of mixing between local recharge and deep groundwater is temporally and spatially variable due to differences in the interconnection of bedrock fractures based on a comparison of δ18o in groundwater and precipitation and groundwater age which was determined from 3h joshi et al 2018 used stable isotopes and 3h to identify the recharge sources of groundwater and to systematically

2002 perrin et al 2003 zhao et al 2018 and volcanic aquifer systems demlie et al 2007 paternoster et al 2008 hernández antonio et al 2015 but few studies have been conducted in crystalline aquifer systems praamsma et al 2009 leketa et al 2018 petelet giraud et al 2018 the geum river basin in south korea consists of high mountains in the east and plains in the west and its major lithology is crystalline bedrock and alluvium in 2017 annual groundwater usage in the basin was 46 8 billion tons corresponding to 11 6 of total groundwater usage in south korea kowaco 2017 a few studies have employed environmental isotopes to characterize geothermal water systems or trace the origin of co2 rich water in bedrock aquifers at a local scale kim et al 2000 jeong et al 2001 kim et al 2005 however no regional studies have been carried out to delineate the groundwater flow system in the geum river basin using environmental isotopes this study aims to describe the surface and groundwater flow systems in the geum river basin using stable isotopes of δ18o and δ2h as well as 3h the specific objectives are to identify the factors controlling the spatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes and 3h in alluvial and crystalline bedrock aquifers at the regional scale and to assess the recharge processes and flow paths of groundwater as well as stream aquifer interactions in the basin we also established a conceptual model of the water flow systems in the basin considering its hydrographic and hydrogeologic settings 2 study area the area of the geum river basin is around 9915 km2 and is located in the central part of the korean peninsula fig 1 the geum river one of four national rivers has a linear length from source to mouth of about 85 km and a total length of stream channels of 396 km kowaco 2002 the geum river consists of 10 national streams 20 first class regional streams and 460 s class regional streams and discharges into the yellow sea the ten sub basins of the geum river watershed were classified into three hydrographic groups upper zone k1 k3 middle zone k4 k6 and lower zone k7 k10 table 1 the geum river basin consists primarily of precambrian meta sedimentary rocks and jurassic cretaceous granitic rocks cheong et al 2003 no sizeable exposures of carbonates or evaporites have been reported weathered zones of granitic rocks and gneiss are widely dispersed in the study area alluvial aquifers are present in the lower parts of the sub basins at a thickness of 7 20 m but are poorly developed in the upper parts of the sub basins within mountainous areas kowaco 2002 a large number of fractures with random orientations can be observed in the study area groundwater flow within the crystalline bedrock is controlled by structural discontinuity and the connectivity of fractures lee and lee 2000 maréchal et al 2004 the monthly mean air temperature from 1981 to 2010 was 13 c and ranged from 1 0 c in january to 25 6 c in august the mean annual precipitation 1981 2010 is 1458 6 mm around 71 of which falls during summer june to september winter december to february is cold and dry whereas summer june to september is hot and humid with frequent heavy rainfall lee et al 1999 in this study june to september were classified as rainy season and october to may as dry season considering monthly rainfall lee et al 1999 annual precipitation is mainly controlled by the east asian monsoon annual precipitation in 2017 was 1127 5 mm approximately 77 of which occurred rainy season kma 2018 the recharge rate of the geum river basin ranged from 9 2 to 15 8 for sub basins with an average of 13 6 and no clear trend was not observed for the three hydrographic zones molit 2012 the geum river is highly regulated like other rivers in korea and various water storage facilities has been constructed in the basin including two large dams in the upper basin weirs and reservoirs on the tributaries to secure water supply for drought conditions ahn et al 2014 in recent years the four rivers restoration project launched as part of the green new deal policy in 2009 has incurred significant environmental changes in the geum river after construction of three barrages on the mainstream kim et al 2016 however this restoration project and policy were implemented without a conceptual model of the groundwater flow system and its interaction with surface water which has led to limitations in the understanding of regional hydrogeological processes 3 methods 3 1 sample collection a total of 195 rainfall and snowfall samples were collected weekly at three stations located at altitudes of 140 431 and 790 m a m s l over two years from august 2014 to august 2016 at mt gyeryong which is located in the central portion of the study area precipitation samples were stored in 30 l plastic containers coupled with a filter mesh to prevent debris contamination which were coated with about 250 ml of mineral oil to prevent evaporation the mineral oil in the precipitation samples was removed using a 1 l glass separatory funnel all precipitation samples were stored upside down at 4 c in 20 ml polyethylene vials with polycone lined caps and parafilm seals until analysis rainfall and air temperature were measured at three stations using tipping bucket rain gauges with hobo loggers 1 pulse 0 2 mm rain aerodynamic rain gauge eijkelkamp giesbeek netherlands the loggers were programmed to record air temperature at 1 min intervals in total 67 groundwater samples from 46 bedrock aquifer wells and 21 shallow aquifer wells in the national groundwater monitoring network ngmn were collected in april and september 2017 each ngmn site has a bedrock aquifer monitoring well with total depth of 40 150 m avg 76 m and some sites also have a shallow aquifer monitoring well with total depth of 8 27 m avg 15 m in addition 67 water samples were collected from perennial streams near the groundwater monitoring sites under base flow conditions at least three days after any rainfall event to minimize the contribution of direct runoff to stream discharge stream order numbers based on the strahler ordering system were assigned to the stream network table 2 a headwater stream with no tributaries is classified as order 1 in the strahler ordering system and the order increases wherever two segments of the same order meet when two segments of unequal order meet the highest order number is retained strahler 1957 water temperature electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured in the field using portable instruments water samples were filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filters in the field 3 2 analytical methods the isotopic and chemical compositions of the water samples were analyzed at the groundwater research center korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources kigam daejeon south korea the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were determined through wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds l2120 i picarro santa clara ca usa a type of isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy that is widely used in hydrologic applications penna et al 2010 liu and yamanaka 2012 all water samples were heated to 110 c in a vaporizer and then sent to the cavity of ws crds under dry n2 gas 99 999 purity all isotopic ratio results are reported using δ notation relative to the international standard vsmow2 vienna standard mean ocean water 2 the primary standards vsmow2 gisp and slap2 and secondary standards were used to calibrate the stable isotopic composition and to identify day to day changes in analytical quality and drift effects ws crds has uncertainties of 0 1 and 0 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively jung et al 2013 kim et al 2017 groundwater samples collected in april were also analyzed for their 3h contents 3h was analyzed using low level liquid scintillation counting after electrolytic enrichment of the initial sample from a volume of 500 to 1000 ml at the university of waterloo waterloo on canada university of miami miami fl usa and kigam typical detection limits are 0 6 0 1 tu mainly depending on the degree of electrolytic enrichment more detailed analytical procedures were reported by yoon et al 2010 4 results 4 1 stable isotopic composition of precipitation the measured δ18o and δ2h in precipitation ranged from 15 6 to 0 1 and 116 to 5 respectively fig 2 seasonal local meteoric water lines lmwl were defined using these measurements resulting in δ2h 7 98 δ18o 9 28 n 69 r2 0 98 for summer june to september and δ2h 7 16 δ18o 17 97 n 66 r2 0 87 for winter november to february precipitation and snowfall the lmwl for summer was close to the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 whereas the lmwl for winter was plotted to the left of the gmwl with more widely scattered data than the lmwl for summer these two lmwls were very similar to those defined by lee et al 1999 for precipitation in daejeon and seoul korea deuterium excess d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 ranged from 3 8 to 38 7 and the seasonal averages were 8 9 3 9 and 23 7 7 5 for summer and winter respectively because the study area is located in east asia where the asian monsoon dominates precipitation patterns seasonally distinct d values were obtained due to the changing air masses and moisture sources lee et al 2003 altitude effects on δ18o and δ2h in precipitation were determined using measurements collected at three stations in mt gyeryong as well as the cheongju station of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip in 2015 even though the cheongju station is about 37 km from the stations in mt gyeryong the amount of precipitation and weighted mean stable isotopic composition of precipitation were similar during the same period strong correlations were observed between altitude and the mean stable isotopic composition weighted based on the amount of precipitation fig 3 the isotopic lapse rate with changing altitude was calculated to be 0 12 per 100 m for δ18o and 0 7 per 100 m for δ2h the isotopic lapse rates in the study area were relatively small compared to the global average isotopic lapse rate of 0 28 per 100 m for δ18o poage and chamberlain 2001 but were similar to the average lapse rate in china liu et al 2014 because the extent of the altitude effect can reflect the local climate and topography of a region similar lapse rates have been reported in some other regions influenced by the asian monsoon system machida and shindo 1999 mandal et al 2011 in mid latitude regions temperature and precipitation amount are important factors controlling the final isotopic composition of precipitation dansgaard 1964 lee et al 2003 however their relative contributions to the isotopic fractionation of precipitation vary spatially particularly in the asian monsoon region liu et al 2014 because both air temperature and rainfall amount are highest in summer in this region the effects of temperature and precipitation amount on the isotopic composition of precipitation offset each other to some extent johnson and ingram 2004 in the study area the latitude effect was not considered as a major factor because the lmwls in daejeon seoul and pohang showed no significant differences lee and lee 1999 the effect of precipitation amount and the altitude effect by orographic lift are the main factors considered to influence the isotopic fractionation of precipitation in the geum river basin in the mt gyeryong area the amount of annual precipitation increased from 688 mm at the base to 1245 mm at the top which could be attributed to orographic lift 4 2 stable isotopic composition of stream water and groundwater the average values of δ18o and δ2h for stream water were 7 0 and 48 in the dry season and 8 0 and 55 in the rainy season respectively table 3 the lowest δ18o and δ2h values were observed in the stream network in the upper zone most stream water was below the lmwl in summer indicating that stream water has undergone isotopic enrichment due to evaporation fig 4 local evaporation lines were determined using the δ18o and δ2h values of stream water resulting in δ2h 6 4 δ18o 2 6 n 67 r2 0 93 for the dry season and δ2h 5 7 δ18o 9 0 n 67 r2 0 87 for the rainy season fig 4 b the stable isotopic composition was more depleted in the upper zone than the lower zone with that in the middle zones falling between these two groups but closer to the upper zone fig 5 a the spatial differences in δ18o and δ2h were significantly reduced in the rainy season compared to the dry season figs 4 and 5 b in addition the range of δ18o in the plain area during the rainy season was much narrower than that in the dry season the difference in the median value of δ18o between the upper zone and lower zone was reduced from 1 8 in the dry season to 0 3 in the rainy season the seasonal variation of δ18o in the upper zone was smaller than in other zones based on the median value and range in contrast stream water in the lower zones showed strong seasonality in estimated recharge altitude compared to other zones fig 6 the seasonal δ18o and δ2h values of evaporating water were calculated using rayleigh distillation with a total fractionation factor according to the equations defined by majoube 1971 and gonfiantini 1986 the average annual air temperature and relative humidity over the last 30 years 1981 2010 of cheonan and jangsu kma stations were 11 1 c and 72 8 respectively which were used for the evaporation calculation and the average δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater in the upper zone 8 6 and 58 6 were used as the initial values the seasonal variability of stream water in the lower zone was significantly higher than those of other zones fig 4 c and d based on rayleigh evaporation lines stream water in the lower zone was affected by 10 20 evaporation in the dry season and 5 10 evaporation in the rainy season fig 4 the evaporation estimate in the rainy season is similar to 7 13 obtained for the han river basin in korea during summer season ryu et al 2007 to identify the sources of stream water in the lower zones the stream network in the geum river basin was classified using the strahler stream order system and stream water δ18o was compared in the dry and rainy seasons fig 7 the δ18o of stream water became enriched with increasing stream order in the upper zones and middle zones regardless of season however the δ18o of stream water became depleted with increasing stream order in the lower zones in the rainy season despite extensive agricultural activities in the area these isotopic trends indicate that the contribution of stream water originating from the upper zones is high throughout the stream network in the rainy season which was confirmed by the similarity of the stable isotopic compositions of stream water and groundwater during the rainy season fig 4 the spatial variations in δ18o and δ2h of groundwater indicated more depleted isotopic compositions in the upper zone than the lower zone similar to those of stream water fig 4 the average values of stable isotopic composition in groundwater were relatively constant in two seasons fig 5 indicating that the groundwater flow system was stable in the basin as a whole however the ranges of isotopic composition showed considerable variations between the two seasons suggesting that some aquifers had local recharge with higher seasonal variability the relative contribution of precipitation to total recharge in dry and rainy seasons was calculated based on two component mixing using average d values in precipitation of the two seasons winograd et al 1998 lee et al 1999 the representative d values of precipitation were estimated from the measurements at cheongju gnip station from 1999 to 2016 as 16 2 and 8 3 for dry and rainy season respectively compared with precipitation amount of rainy season as a fraction of total precipitation of 69 71 over the last 30 years the contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge was disproportionately dominant accounting for 71 89 while the contribution of rainy season precipitation to surface water was similar to the amount fractions except the middle zone in dry season table 4 the predominance of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge was most pronounced in the lower zone in dry season 4 3 reconstructed 3h input and groundwater 3h to estimate residence time of groundwater from measured 3h the 3h input history of the geum river basin was reconstructed koh and chae 2008 reconstructed the 3h input history in daejeon from 1950 to 2000 using 3h measurement data at 11 gnip stations in the northern hemisphere and 3 gnip stations in south korea in this study 3h input from precipitation was extended to the period between 2001 and 2015 using monthly 3h measurements for precipitation at the daejeon station of the korea institute of nuclear safety which were weighted based on monthly precipitation the two series of 3h inputs matched well without significant discontinuity in temporal trends fig 8 based on the reconstructed 3h values in precipitation groundwater recharged before 1950 contained 3h below 0 5 tu while young groundwater with recent recharge contained 3h ranging from 2 to 6 tu the effect of bomb 3h was assumed to be negligible for most groundwater samples because the 3h peak is highly likely to be dispersed and mixed in aquifers if there is no significant lag in the thick unsaturated zone 3h concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 2 tu can be regarded as mixtures of 3h free old water and young groundwater in this study qualitative groundwater ages using 3h concentration were used to designate samples as old groundwater with 3h less than 0 5 tu young groundwater with 3h greater than 2 tu and mixed groundwater with 3h from 0 5 tu to 2 tu this approach has been previously applied to volcanic aquifers on jeju island korea koh et al 2005 the 3h concentration in groundwater in the study area ranged from 0 3 to 5 4 tu table 5 the median 3h concentration was 2 8 tu in shallow groundwater and 2 2 tu in bedrock groundwater which did not differ significantly p value 0 22 t test fig 9 a in shallow groundwater 19 of samples corresponded to mixed groundwater and 81 to young groundwater in bedrock groundwater 11 corresponded to old groundwater 35 to mixed groundwater and 54 to young groundwater the 3h concentrations in groundwater were clearly distinguished among hydrographic zones groundwater in the upper zone showed a significant difference from that in the lower zone p value 0 01 t test groundwater in the middle zone had a median 3h value similar to the upper zone but a wider range fig 9 b 4 4 end member mixing analysis of environmental isotopes the emma approach based on the mass balance of tracers has been widely used for hydrograph separation burns et al 2001 maurya et al 2011 previous studies have used the δ18o and δ2h values of water with cl concentration or ec to distinguish sources and flow paths in groundwater systems nakaya et al 2007 peng et al 2018 rey et al 2018 cl is a conservative tracer that can be used to evaluate groundwater recharge in alluvial sediments subyani 2004 liu and yamanaka 2012 ec is also a useful tracer and can be used to identify seawater intrusion effects or differences in water rock interactions depending on aquifer type in the study area mountainous terrain acts as water storage therefore understanding the hydrological processes in the mountainous area is important for maintaining water resources in the adjacent plain area viviroli et al 2007 peng et al 2018 recently groundwater recharge in the mountainous area has been determined to significantly contribute to regional groundwater and streamflow systems tetzlaff and soulsby 2008 ajami et al 2011 previous studies have identified the process of mountain system recharge msr as the main source of water to plain areas anderson et al 1992 viviroli and weingarther 2004 wilson and guan 2004 liu and yamanaka 2012 peng et al 2018 we tried to determine the relative importance of msr and surface water groundwater interactions using emma for δ18o and δ2h in groundwater and stream water cl concentration and ec were also considered but could not easily distinguish end members associated with sources of water and flow paths these tracers can be affected in various ways depending on lithology and land use patterns distribution of contamination sources and the influence of seawater in coastal areas peng et al 2016 shin et al 2017 in this regard emma using δ18o and d value and 3h in groundwater was employed to clarify the contributions of groundwater flow in mountainous areas and surface groundwater interaction in the geum river basin few studies have applied δ18o and d value for evaluation of evaporation effects and groundwater mixing processes tsujimura et al 2007 joshi et al 2018 three end members were assigned using the amount weighted average values of summer precipitation end member a winter precipitation end member b and evaporated stream water end member c in plain areas most groundwater and stream water samples fell within the triangle made by these end members fig 10 indicating that the end member system could account for the majority of variance in the stable isotopic composition of water samples therefore these three end members represented the seasonal variability in groundwater recharge and the surface water flow system associated with the hydroclimatic conditions of rainfall snowfall and evaporation as well as the degree of surface water groundwater interaction emma of environmental tracers revealed distinct spatial and temporal patterns of the relative contributions of recharge sources in the study area each end member was characteristic of a distinct group of water samples groundwater with high fraction of end member a had the lowest 3h concentration representing the contribution to regional flow from summer precipitation meanwhile groundwater in the lower zone had higher 3h values indicating the dominance of local recharge in accordance with the more enriched isotopic composition of groundwater in that area some stream water samples collected in the upper zone had higher fractions of end member b which is generally attributed to winter precipitation end member c mainly contributed to stream water in the lower zone where local recharge including that of evaporated water is most likely to discharge into streams the relative contributions of three end members to groundwater and stream water showed clear differences according to the three hydrographic zones fig 11 a considerable portion of stream water sampled in the upper zones and the middle zones overlapped with groundwater in the emma of stable isotopes fig 10 indicating that groundwater from mountainous terrain is the main source of stream water in these areas other stream water samples away from groundwater appear to be affected by rapid infiltration of precipitation leading to seasonal variability of isotopic composition 5 discussion 5 1 water sources and flow processes in the basin the depleted isotopic compositions of stream water in the upper zone with less seasonal variability can be attributed to the significant contribution of groundwater inflow from adjacent mountainous terrains where orographic lift enhances the amount of precipitation at higher altitudes resulting in accelerated precipitation infiltration with depleted δ18o and δ2h tappa et al 2016 choi et al 2007 and combalicer et al 2008 reported recharge rate higher than 21 in mountainous areas in korea which is significantly higher than average recharge rate of 14 in the geum river basin previous studies in the mt gyeryong region of the geum river basin showed that groundwater significantly contributed to discharge in headwater streams in the mountainous region with a thin soil layer based on antecedent precipitation index models jung et al 2016 these results indicate that active groundwater discharge to streams may occur in the study area due to the hydrologic features of its mountainous terrain corroborating that first order streams in mountainous terrains play significant roles in maintaining stream discharge for the whole stream network alexander et al 2007 nadeau and rains 2007 tezlaff and soulsby 2008 also reported that mountainous catchments can make an important contribution to downstream flows although mountainous regions underlain by crystalline aquifers with thin soil have limited aquifer potential and groundwater storage the more enriched isotopic composition of stream water in the lower zones with greater seasonal variability could be attributed to the seasonally variable effect of evaporation and less influence of msr at higher altitudes which was more pronounced in the dry season fig 6 these observations indicate that streams in the lower zone are controlled by seasonally variable and presumably more local flow systems in the lower zones the land use of most areas near the stream consists of rice paddies where impounded water affected by evaporation contributes to stream discharge as base flow todd et al 2006 or return flow koh et al 2010 negrel et al 2011 conversely during the rainy season the increased groundwater contribution from mountainous terrains maintains a higher stream water level than the groundwater in adjacent aquifers gabrielli et al 2012 decreasing the inflow of impounded water buttle et al 2012 stream water impounded by various storage facilities in the basin for water use may be evaporated to a considerable degree in dry season which also contribute to evaporation signature in stable isotopic composition simpson and herczeg 1991 ryu et al 2007 vanplantinga et al 2017 these features shows that anthropogenic activities significantly affect sources and processes of streamflow in the lower zone of the geum river basin the stable isotopic composition of groundwater was close to the lmwl in summer and fairly stable regardless of season fig 4 the d value of groundwater exhibited minor seasonal differences of less than 1 considering the highly variable d value of seasonal precipitation due to changing water vapor sources these results suggest that groundwater is mainly recharged through rainy season precipitation among seasonal sources of groundwater recharge in areas with thick soil layers and heavy vegetation many studies have emphasized the importance of snow pack and precipitation in winter due to increased evapotranspiration in summer wassenaar 1995 winograd et al 1998 blasch and bryson 2007 rey et al 2018 in contrast some studies in asian monsoon regions have reported the dominance of rainy season precipitation in groundwater recharge accounting for 66 71 in various regions of korea lee et al 1999 lee and kim 2007 gautam et al 2018 and 75 5 in taiwan yeh et al 2014 which are similar or lower than the fractions of rainy season precipitation in total precipitation in this study the contribution of rainy season precipitation to recharge was 82 91 excluding that in the lower zone sampled in dry season which can be affected by evaporation and was higher than the amount fraction in precipitation table 4 in contrast to the results of previous studies this finding suggests a weak contribution of precipitation in winter including through snow melt in early spring and highly efficient recharge from summer precipitation due to reduced evapotranspiration compared to areas without monsoon seasons a considerable portion of groundwater in the upper zones and the middle zones had depleted δ18o values due to recharge from high altitude areas figs 5 and 6 in addition the lower 3h of groundwater in bedrock aquifers in those areas indicates that groundwater flow through longer flow paths plays a key role in recharging the aquifers because tectonic structures such as dense sub horizontal and sub vertical fractures create major flow paths in crystalline bedrock aquifers taylor and howard 2000 dewandel et al 2006 pacheco 2015 meanwhile in the lower zones seasonal variations in the isotopic composition and 3h concentration of groundwater were greater than those in other zones seasonally some groundwater had more depleted stable isotopic composition in rainy season compared to that in dry season due to fast infiltration of depleted heavy rainfall whose proportion is 8 57 and 72 for the upper middle and lower zones respectively this indicates that local groundwater flow is more active in the well developed permeable alluvial layers of the lower zone in rainy season in agricultural areas near streams in korea impounded water in paddy fields during growing season has strong evaporation signature and can infiltrate to the aquifers below in some riparian areas the large gradient in groundwater level caused by pumping induces inflow from adjacent streams kwon et al 2017 for these reasons groundwater in the lower zones is highly likely to have multiple sources of recharge resulting in a wide range of stable isotopic compositions and 3h contents 5 2 stream water and groundwater flow systems and their implications stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples indicate that higher altitude recharge in the upper zone seem to be less significant to the lower zone while the middle zone may have a certain amount of recharge from the upper zone fig 5 3h concentration in groundwater indicates that young water predominate in the lower zone and old water significantly contributes to the upper and middle zones fig 9 the emma results showed an intermediate recharge process with long flow paths originating from mountainous terrains was dominant for groundwater in the upper zones whereas the contribution of local recharge and stream aquifer interactions to groundwater increased toward the lower zones fig 10 based on these isotopic signatures in the three hydrographic zones regional groundwater flow across the basin appears to be insignificant while intermediate groundwater flow between the upper zone and the middle zone can be significant groundwater and stream water in the lower zones were widely separated in terms of the contributions of the three end members fig 10 a permeable sandy point bar is generally developed around higher order streams in the plain area due to the absence of impermeable silty soil chae et al 2004 considering these alluvial strata lateral flow through the sandy layer in plain area may be the dominant flow path supplying evaporated water to streams in the dry season meanwhile the depth of the sandy alluvium strata decreases and impermeable mud and silty layers are frequently observed further from stream channels in the plain area choi et al 2010 in the rainy season streams under losing conditions appear to affect adjacent groundwater in the lower zones based on the higher estimated recharge altitude and elevated 3h in groundwater we constructed a conceptual model for groundwater flow systems involving local and intermediate flows and streamflow generation sustained by the groundwater flows for the geum river basin for the two representative seasons integrating the results of environmental isotopes in groundwater and stream water fig 12 this model highlights that groundwater flow systems are spatially different and seasonally less variable in the three hydrographic zones while streamflow from groundwater is seasonally highly variable with higher contribution from mountainous terrains to the whole stream network in rainy season in some previous studies the groundwater flow systems in the basin were constructed based on compilation of fractured zones and faults of the basin pacheco and van der weijden 2014a pacheco 2015 however these data are not available for the basin at present which suggests more research is necessary to understand the groundwater flow systems of the basin in particular regional groundwater flow on the korean peninsula the intensity and frequency of extreme summer precipitation is expected increase in the near future 2021 2100 compared with the present and the number of non precipitation days during spring and summer are also expected to rise based on regional climate models kim et al 2018 in the study area amount of precipitation days of heavy rainfall and precipitation intensity in the study area are expected to increase by 22 4 mm 10 years 12 94 10 years and 1 71 10 years from 2011 to 2100 respectively according to the rcp8 5 scenario in the geum river basin area kma 2012 these changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change may have considerable impacts on groundwater and surface water flow systems as our results indicate a disproportionately large role of summer precipitation in the water resources in the study area the maximum shortage rate of water for agricultural use will be 38 for the 2040 s in the geum river basin under the rcp 4 5 scenario and an obvious decrease in water shortage was expected to be common in june whereas the water stress was expected to intensify in august because of the increased variability in future climate ahn et al 2016 the sensitivity of streamflow in the upper zone of the geum river basin to timing shift of the monsoon season was also shown by hydrologic modeling using future climate change scenarios ryu et al 2011 in terms of the hydrographic zones of the geum river basin the impact of climate change is likely to affect the lower zone on a short term scale and other zones on a longer term due to different groundwater flow systems and streamflow to be highly sensitive to changes in groundwater discharge in the mountainous terrain comprising the upper and middle zones fig 12 this research may provide important information for sustainable management of water resources in the geum river basin and will serve as a prototype to assess stream and groundwater flow systems in other regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions 6 conclusions stable isotopes and 3h in groundwater and stream water in the geum river basin showed spatial and temporal variations depending on the three hydrographic zones of upper middle and lower zones and these trends were compared with the stable isotopes in precipitation in the basin groundwater derived from rainy season precipitation was significantly higher than amount fractions of rainy season precipitation in total precipitation indicating the minor role of dry season precipitation including snow melt in recharge the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water in the upper and middle zones were fairly constant throughout the dry and rainy seasons and most groundwater and stream water were derived from high altitude areas based on the altitude effect on δ18o this indicates that groundwater recharge from mountainous terrains is the main source of streamflow and groundwater flow in the upper and middle zones in contrast groundwater in the lower zone exhibited some seasonal variabilities of its stable isotopic composition as well as changes in recharge altitude in some groundwater samples an evaporation signature of stable isotopes was considerable in groundwater and stream water of the lower zone which was more pronounced in the dry season the δ18o values of stream water became more depleted with increasing stream order in the lower zone approaching those in the upper zone which indicated that groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas contributed considerably to the discharge of the main stream of the geum river the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation dry season precipitation and local recharge with evaporation signature were quantified using δ18o and d value along with 3h in groundwater rainy season precipitation was dominant in the groundwater of the upper zone while local recharge affected by evaporation was the greatest contributor to stream water in the lower zone 3h in groundwater indicated that intermediate recharge with longer flow paths originating from the mountainous areas was a dominant factor affecting groundwater in the upper zone but its contribution decreased toward the lower zone these results contribute to understanding the water sources and hydrologic processes of the groundwater and stream water systems in the geum river basin and promote sustainable management of water resources at the regional scale considering

6512,general circulation models gcms provide vital information on the likely future climate much needed for the effective planning and management of water resources the performance assessment of gcms has received significant attention in recent years for reliable estimation of future climate even though many approaches have been trialled in the ranking of gcms for the selection of an appropriate ensemble there is still a need to explore the potential of the state of the art ranking approaches for a more dependable selection of gcms suitable for a given task over a region of interest the present study assessed the potential of a state of the art feature selection method known as symmetrical uncertainty su in ranking 20 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gcms based on their ability to simulate monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for annual monsoon and winter seasons the performance of gcms was assessed using gridded climate data obtained from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc climatic research unit cru and princeton global meteorological forcing dataset prin over the period 1961 2005 considering pakistan as the study area the ranks obtained with su were compared with those obtained using two well established ranking approaches 1 compromise programming cp and 2 wavelet based skill score wss according to the results of this study for the simulation of all the three climate variables in all seasons cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and hadgem2 es were identified as the best gcms by su whereas cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and gfdl cm3 were identified as the best gcms by cp and ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 gfdl esm2g and hadgem2 es by wss the comparison of ranks of gcms obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given gcm however the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data but employing different ranking approaches the approach presented in this study can be extended to any number of gcms and can be applied over any region for the identification of the best performing ensemble of gcms for a set of climate variables keywords general circulation models multivariable ensemble symmetrical uncertainty compromise programming wavelet based skill score temperature and precipitation 1 introduction increase in concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases ghgs have altered the global energy balance and thus the earth s surface temperature flanner et al 2018 ipcc 2014 there is a wide agreement among the scientific community that increase in surface temperature will cause sea level rise affect freshwater availability increase extreme weather events and damage ecosystems which in turn may severely affect the economy and livelihood of people particularly in developing countries akhter et al 2016 therefore it is important to assess and analyse the likely future variations in primary climate variables such as precipitation and temperature for the formulation of necessary mitigation and adaptation strategies general circulation models gcms are often employed to project future climate on global scales sachindra et al 2014 wright et al 2015 you et al 2018 2016 currently outputs of 39 gcms with different spatial resolutions are publicly available through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 archive demirel and moradkhani 2015 taylor et al 2012 however it is not practical to use the simulations projections of all gcms in the cmip5 archive for impact assessment ekström et al 2016 usually a small set of gcms an ensemble is selected for the climate change impact assessment in focus lutz et al 2016 furthermore to identify and narrow the uncertainties arising from gcms it is necessary to select an ensemble of gcms for the region of interest by excluding the gcms which do not perform well over that region with respect to the climate variables of interest e g precipitation selection approaches of gcms can be grouped into two categories 1 past performance approach biemans et al 2013 in which gcms are chosen considering their capability to mimic past climate and 2 envelope approach warszawski et al 2014 in which an ensemble of gcms encompassing the whole range of future projections is chosen from the available set of gcms the downside of the past performance approach is that it neglects the agreement between the gcms in their projections of the future climate whereas the downside of the envelope approach is that it ignores the ability of gcms to mimic the historical observed climate however most of the studies argued that past performance approach is the best way to identify better performing models despite the fact that past performance of gcms does not guarantee equally good performance in the future ahmadalipour et al 2017 hidalgo and alfaro 2012 raju et al 2016 reichler and kim 2008 the past performance approach employs feature selection methods for identifying an ensemble of better performing gcms from a large pool of gcms with respect to a climate variable feature selection also known as the variable selection is the process of ranking of gcms with respect to a climate variable or variables based on their past performance chandrashekar and sahin 2014 feature selection methods can be broadly classified into three groups 1 filters where an ensemble of gcms i e gcms with respect to a climate variable or variables is selected on the basis of their scores derived from various statistical tests such as correlation coefficient significance test linear discriminant analysis and information gain barfus and bernhofer 2015 gleckler et al 2008 gu et al 2015 wu et al 2016 2 wrappers which select an ensemble of gcms by employing iterative learning algorithms such as forward selection recursive variable elimination and greedy search dudek 2010 3 hybrids of filters and wrappers where wrappers such as elastic net and ridge regression are used to identify better performing gcms from an initially filtered ensemble of gcms hammami et al 2012 the major drawback of filters is that they ignore inter dependencies among gcms for a given variable and therefore may select inappropriate gcms for the ensemble the wrappers are computationally very intensive and also often found to select inappropriate gcms due to overfitting of the regression model the hybrids of filters and wrappers are computationally less intense compared to wrappers but found to perform similarly to wrappers sutha and tamilselvi 2015 hybrids of filters and wrappers are more suitable to be used with a large number of gcms filters and wrappers are more suitable to be used with a smaller number of gcms lutz et al 2016 mcsweeney et al 2015 many investigations have been done to evaluate the performance of gcms employing various wrappers and filters mcmahon et al 2015 a variety of performance metrics based on correlation coefficients barfus and bernhofer 2015 gleckler et al 2008 gu et al 2015 wu et al 2016 clustering knutti et al 2013 weighted skill score maxino et al 2008 perkins et al 2007 information entropy shukla et al 2006 and bayesian weighting min and hense 2006 have been used for the above purpose in many studies the metrics are jointly assessed using a single performance index to select gcms ahmadalipour et al 2017 baker and taylor 2016 raju et al 2016 the chief demerit of performance indices is that they are centred on the overall state of climate e g correlation over a specific period between observations and simulations of a variable where temporal variability of the climate is not given full attention though it is quite crucial in the assessment of model performance reichler and kim 2008 feature variable selection methods based on various machine learning algorithms such as entropy theory novaković et al 2011 artificial neural networks hajnayeb et al 2011 support vector machine maldonado and weber 2009 and random forest genuer et al 2010 are being used in hydroclimatological studies each independent variable e g a set of gcm simulated temperature is ranked by analysing its ability to mimic the dependent variable e g observed temperature by feature selection methods among the filters symmetrical uncertainty su which is based on the information entropy press et al 1996 has gained the attention of researchers kannan and ramaraj 2010 kumar and sree 2014 gcms can be ranked using su based on the agreement of a given gcm output e g gcm simulated temperature with the corresponding observations considering the entropy of the entire sequence of time series the chief advantage of su is its ability to provide an overall measure of the relationship between the dependent e g observed temperature and independent variables e g gcm simulated temperature irrespective of the character of the distributions and conditional dependencies between the independent variables e g temperature simulated by different gcms hall 1999 in su mutual information information gain decreases when there is a higher degree of difference present in the temporal sequences of observations of the variable of interest and its gcm simulations this allows su in ranking gcms according to their capability to imitate the temporal sequence trends and patterns in the climate variable of interest unlike the most widely used measures such as correlation coefficients and clustering model performance index it can trace the pairwise similarities and dissimilarities between two data sequences bakhshandeh et al 2019 and thus can be used for the overall assessment of the association between observations and gcm simulations by avoiding the need to use multiple statistical metrics for the performance assessment therefore it is argued that the use of su in ranking gcms in relation to a climate variable of interest is a more reliable approach compared to other gcm ranking approaches the present study aims to employ a filter using su to rank gcms for the selection of an appropriate ensemble based on their ability to simulate the historical observed monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature considering pakistan as the case study an information aggregation approach was employed to combine the ranks to identify the best performing ensemble of gcms for the simulation of the above three variables in order to understand the uncertainties in the ranks of gcms due to the use of different ranking approaches this study compared the gcm ranks derived using su with those derived from two other well established ranking approaches 1 compromising programming cp raju et al 2016 and 2 wavelet based skill score wss johnson et al 2011 furthermore the above ranking approaches were used with different gridded precipitation and temperature data products for the quantification of impacts of different gridded data products on the ranks of gcms in addition to that this study details the validation of the ability of the ranking approaches to identify the better performing gcms from a pool of given gcms 2 study area and data 2 1 study area pakistan 23 n 61 e 37 n76 e occupies an area of 796 100 km2 is dominated by arid and semi arid climate fig 1 shows the location of pakistan in central south asia where it shares its borders with china in the north the arabian sea in the south iran and afghanistan in the west and india in the east pakistan is a country with great topographic contrast and precipitation and temperature across the country vary widely with topography fig 1 pakistan has two discrete wet seasons 1 summer monsoon which spans over june to september and 2 winter season which spans over december to march also there are two transition periods recognised as pre and post monsoon from april to may and october to november respectively sheikh 2001 the westerly disturbances in the mediterranean sea cause most of the precipitation in winter and the bulk of the precipitation in summer is caused by monsoon winds that originate from the bay of bengal monsoon precipitation is vital for kharif season a cropping season that begins in may and ends in october while winter precipitation is vital for rabi season a cropping season that starts in november and finishes in april the annual mean precipitation over pakistan varies from less than 100 mm in the northwest corner and more than 1000 mm in the northern parts of the country since the country is located in a region with arid and semi arid climate the bulk of the country gets less than 500 mm of annual mean precipitation while a very small area receives more than 1000 mm of annual mean precipitation ahmed et al 2017b the lowest temperature is generally recorded in the himalayan region in the north and the highest in the low lying south eastern region the annual maximum temperature ranges from 15 to 35 c and the minimum temperature varies between 0 and 20 c across the country iqbal et al 2016 a recent study by pakistan meteorological department gop 2013 stated that pakistan s surface temperature has risen at a rate of 0 1 c per decade during 1960 2010 and the precipitation has increased by 22 6 mm and 20 8 mm in monsoon and winter seasons respectively during 1901 2010 according to recent trends it is anticipated that the climate in the region will be more variable in the future due to global warming which may increase the frequency of natural disasters such as heat waves extreme precipitation etc which may severely affect the agriculture based economy of pakistan khan et al 2018b syed et al 2013 2 2 data 2 2 1 gridded precipitation and temperature data the scarcity of long records of reliable hydroclimatological observations pertaining to a dense network of stations is a major issue in hydroclimatological investigations ahmed et al 2017a as a solution to this issue many multi source climate datasets such as observation based gridded precipitation and temperature satellite based precipitation and temperature and reanalysis precipitation and temperature have been developed among them the observation based gridded precipitation and temperature data are widely used because of their extensive spatial and temporal coverage kishore et al 2015

berkeleyearth org were used as surrogates for observed maximum and minimum temperature all datasets were interpolated to a grid with a spatial resolution of 2 2 35 grid points to cover whole pakistan as shown in fig 1 in order to comply with the common grid used for the gcm simulated precipitation maximum and minimum temperature in the present study ability of the gpcc cru and aphrodite precipitation data and cru prin and berk temperature data to mimic monthly precipitation hereafter referred to as p monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature hereafter referred to as tmax and tmin over pakistan during the period 1961 2005 was assessed by comparing them with observed p tmax and tmin data obtained from 16 stations maintained by the pakistan meteorological department www pmd gov pk the stations were selected based on the availability of data and locations representing different climate regimes of the country 2 2 2 gcm simulated precipitation and temperature data the data of monthly precipitation hereafter referred to as gcm simulated p and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature hereafter referred to as gcm simulated tmax and tmin were obtained from the cmip5 database http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 for the period 1961 2005 the p tmax and tmin projections for all representative concentration pathways rcp are only available for 20 of the cmip5 gcms in the above database therefore only those 20 gcms were used in this investigation the selected gcms and their spatial resolutions along with modelling centres are provided in table 1 to perform a fair comparison the precipitation and temperature data of all the selected cmip5 gcm were interpolated onto a common grid with a spatial resolution of 2 2 the spatial resolution of the common grid was set to 2 2 as it is approximately equal to the average spatial resolution of these 20 gcms jiang et al 2012 salman et al 2018 the interpolation was done using the bilinear interpolation method bilinear interpolation is frequently used for the smooth transformation of spatially coarse gcm data into spatially fine data through interpolation of gcm data from the four nearest neighbouring grid points ahmed et al 2018 cmip5 gcms have several ensemble members such as r1i1p1 r2i1p1 r3i1p1 r4i1p1 etc that represent the realization initialization and physics of the models in order to conduct an unbiased comparison among gcms r1i1p1 for the historical period 1961 2005 was considered 3 methodology the procedure for ranking of gcms and identification of a better performing ensemble of gcms for simulation of multiple climate variables and the validation of the performance of gcm ensemble are outlined as follows more details on the ranking procedure can be found in section 3 4 1 all gcm simulated historical p tmax and tmin data for the period 1961 2005 were re gridded to 2 2 resolution 2 su cp and wss were applied at each grid point for assessing the association between gridded observations e g cru tmax and corresponding simulations of different gcms e g tmax of 20 gcms for the period 1961 2005 for each season i e annual monsoon and winter separately 3 the su coefficients lp metric values calculated using cp and skill score values calculated by wss were used in ranking gcms separately at each grid point for each season 4 the overall weights of gcms were derived for each season considering their ranks at all grid points over the study area using an information aggregation approach based on the frequency of occurrence of a gcm at a particular rank these overall weights were averaged and used to obtain overall ranks for each gcm for each season separately one single rank for each gcm for each variable for each season valid for the entire study area 5 a comprehensive rating metric was used to determine the final rank of each gcm for each variable by combining the overall ranks pertaining to annual monsoon and winter seasons one single rank for all the three seasons for each gcm for each variable valid for the entire study area 6 an ensemble of top ranked 4 gcms in terms of the final rank was identified for each climate variable and its performance was validated considering 1 return period of droughts and 2 agreement between observed and simulated spatial patterns of climate variables details of su cp and wss and the determination of the best performing ensemble of gcms are provided in the following sections 3 1 symmetrical uncertainty symmetrical uncertainty su is based on the concept of information entropy

independent variable y e g gcm simulated tmax h x y is given by eq 2 2 h x y y y p y x x p x y log 2 p x y in eq 2 p x are the prior probabilities of all values of x and p x y is the posterior probabilities of x given the values of y the amount by which the entropy of x decreases reflects additional information about x provided by y and is called information gain ig which is given by eq 3 3 i g x y h x h x y ig tends to favour variables with more values and it can be normalized by the sum of entropies of the corresponding variables as given in eq 4 wu and zhang 2004 to obtain a fairer measure of dependence called the su 4 s u x y 2 i g x y h x h y su values vary between 0 and 1 where 1 refers to a perfect agreement between the observations of a variable e g cru tmax and gcm simulated values of that variable e g gcm simulated tmax and a value of 0 refers to no agreement shreem et al 2016 in the current investigation gcms were ranked using the su values estimated using eq 4 for gpcc p cru tmax and tmin separately 3 2 compromise programming compromise programming cp zeleny and cochrane 1973 is a technique used to measure the combined effect of several statistical performance measures in the present study cp was used to rank gcms based on three statistical performance measures 1 normalised root mean square error nrmse 2 pearson correlation coefficient cc and 3 skill score ss the nrmse was computed by dividing the root mean square error of gcm simulations of a climate variable i e p tmax and tmin by the average of observations cc pearson 1948 is a measure of linear association between gcm simulations and observations ss proposed by perkins et al 2007 measures the overlap between the probability density functions pdf of gcm simulations and observations the values of the above three statistical performance measures were used to calculate the distance measure lp metric of cp lp metric is defined in eq 5 as below 5 l p j 1 j f j f j p 1 p where fj is the value of statistical performance measure j f j is the ideal value of the statistical performance measure j and p is a parameter which is equal to 1 the ideal value of a statistical performance measure refers to its value corresponding to a perfect match between the simulations produced by the model and the relevant observations the lp metric value is always positive and the lower the value the higher the model performance hence the smallest value of lp is preferred 3 3 wavelet based skill score johnson et al 2011 introduced a discrete wavelet based skill score wss to assess the suitability of gcms in simulating the observed variability with different frequencies of climate variables following the procedure detailed in johnson et al 2011 the observations and gcm simulated data of each climate variable at different grid points were decomposed into 6 levels using daubechies db family of orthogonal wavelets in the current study p tmax and tmin data were divided into three classes 1 sub annual shorter than a year 2 interannual longer than a year but less than a decade and 3 decadal longer than 10 years it was observed that wavelet db4 decomposed time series into sub annual as 0 23 years interannual as 5 8 and decadal as 14 9 years johnson et al 2011 reported that assessment based on interannual variability provides vital information for drought and reservoir management and this is seen a very crucial need for arid regions like pakistan thus in this study an assessment was performed considering interannual frequencies following johnson et al 2011 the decomposed details were used to assess the performance of gcms in correctly representing interannual variability using the skill score proposed by taylor 2001 and used by johnson et al 2011 the wss is calculated using eq 6 as below 6 wss 4 1 r 4 σ f 1 σ f 2 1 r 0 4 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between observed and gcm simulated values of the climate variable of interest i e p tmax and tmin r 0 is the highest possible value of correlation which is 1 σ f is the ratio of standard deviation of gcm simulated data of the climate variable of interest e g precipitation to standard deviation of corresponding observations gcms were ranked based on the wss values obtained at each grid point for simulating p tmax and tmin 3 4 ranking of gcms the assessment and ranking of gcms at a single grid point is generally a relatively simple task nevertheless ranking and identification of better performing gcms become a difficult task when a large number of grid points are used in the ranking exercise where different gcms may display different degrees of accuracies at different grid points in such a case an information aggregation approach that combines information from several sources can be employed various approaches such as numerical averaging majority rule and frequency of occurrence have been used for combining information originating from several sources e g raju and kumar 2016 in the current investigation gcms were ranked considering their frequency of occurrence at different ranks raju and kumar 2015 as outlined below ranks of the gcms pertaining to each grid point for each climate variable for each season were determined based on su cp and wss before the application of steps 1 6 outlined below 1 the number of grid points where a gcm attained a certain rank was computed payoff matrix containing the frequency of occurrence this matrix had the dimensions of 20 20 as the number of gcms considered in this study was 20 2 each rank 1 to 20 was assigned a weight defined as the inverse of the rank weight 1 rank for example gcms ranked 1 2 3 were assigned weights 1 0 5 0 33 and so on respectively 3 then the frequency of occurrence of each gcm at a particular rank found in step 1 was multiplied by the weight found in step 2 corresponding to its rank 4 the overall weight wo of a gcm was calculated by summing all the values found in step 3 as shown in eq 7 as below 7 w o x 1 w 1 x 2 w 2 x 3 w 3 x 20 w 20 where x represents the frequency of occurrence e g x 1 corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of gcm at rank 1 w represents the weight corresponding to each rank e g w 1 corresponds to rank 1 and w o denotes the overall weight of a specific gcm 5 overall weights calculated in step 4 for each season i e annual monsoon and winter were averaged for each variable i e p tmax and tmin for each gcm separately and hence an overall rank for each gcm was determined overall rank refers to a single rank for each gcm for each climate variable which combines their performance in different seasons 6 finally a comprehensive rating metric mr chen et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 was used for the derivation of final ranks of gcms final rank refers to a single rank for each gcm combining their performance in different seasons for all climate variables the final ranks of gcms based on different seasons i e annual monsoon and winter were derived using eq 8 as below 8 mr 1 1 nm i 1 n r a n k i where m is the number of gcms n is the number of seasons and i refers to the rank of a gcm in the ith season a value of mr closer to 1 represents a better gcm 3 5 identification of multi model ensemble mme of gcms the uncertainty in gcm produced climate projections can be reduced by identifying an ensemble of better performing gcms and using them in impact assessment studies kim et al 2015 many studies miao et al 2012 weigel et al 2010 have recommended that one gcm is insufficient to assess the uncertainties associated with future likely climate therefore identification of a better performing ensemble of gcms is a necessity in climate change impact assessments the main aim of the identification of an ensemble of gcms for simulation of multiple climate variables is to maximize the reliability of climate projections by minimizing the uncertainties introduced by the gcms in the present study the most appropriate ensembles of gcms were identified by considering the 4 top ranked gcms in simulating monthly p tmax and tmin an ensemble of 4 gcms later the time series of each climate variable simulated by the 4 top ranked gcms were used to compute the mean for each climate variable for each season separately 3 6 validation of rankings of gcms the rankings of gcms obtained using su cp and wss were validated employing two approaches in the first approach the return period of drought rpd estimated from the 4 top ranked gcms and mme mean were compared with the rpd computed from the gpcc p in the second approach the spatial patterns of gcms at rank 1 the best and 20 the worst and the spatial patterns of the mean of the mme derived from the 4 top ranked gcms were visually compared with the spatial patterns of gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin additionally spatial correlation pearson correlation coefficient was used to quantify the agreement between the spatial patterns of climate variables characterised in observations and those simulated by gcms the comparisons were performed individually considering average annual average monsoon and average winter p tmax and tmin the details of the above approaches are provided below 3 6 1 validation based on return period of droughts standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which is used as an indicator of the severity of droughts offers a comparison between the precipitation over a specific period and the precipitation totals corresponding to the same period for all the years included in the historical record for example a six month spi at the end of november compares the april to november precipitation total in that particular year with the april to november precipitation totals of all previous years in the record of observations alamgir et al 2015 spi produces positive and negative values where positive values refer to wet conditions and negative values refer to drought conditions mckee et al 1993 classified negative spi values into 4 categories 1 mild drought spi 1 0 2 moderate drought 1 5 spi 1 0 3 severe drought 2 0 spi 1 5 and 4 extreme drought spi 2 0 the calculation procedure of rpd based on spi is detailed in the studies by ahmed et al 2015 alamgir et al 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 santos et al 2011 in the current investigation the rpd for 3 6 and 12 month spi were calculated for gcms and ensembles and compared with those obtained from gpcc p 3 6 2 validation based on the spatial patterns of climate variables the comparison of spatial patterns of climate variables simulated by gcms with those of observations can provide an understanding of the ability of gcms to simulate the spatial characteristics of climate variables in the current investigation to compare the spatial patterns of p tmax and tmin simulated by gcms with that of observations coarse resolution gcm simulations were first interpolated to fine spatial resolution using ordinary kriging ahmed et al 2014 demonstrated that ordinary kriging performs better over this study area compared to other interpolation techniques in the kriging family the spatial pattern obtained from each climate variable i e p tmax and tmin for each season i e annual monsoon and winter for the top ranked rank 1 and the bottom ranked rank 20 gcms identified from each method i e su cp and wss and their ensembles were visually and numerically compared with the spatial patterns of observations of each climate variable a similar validation procedure was also adopted by mcgregor et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy assessment of gridded precipitation and temperature data as a preliminary analysis the gpcc cru and aphrodite precipitation data and cru berk and prin temperature data were validated against precipitation and temperature data obtained from 16 in situ observation stations for the period 1961 to 2005 over pakistan in this study two statistical indicators namely nrmse and cc were used to assess the accuracy of monthly p tmax and tmin in replicating the mean variability and distribution of observed precipitation and temperature a data product is considered more accurate if nrmse and cc values are found closer to 0 and 1 respectively results obtained using nrmse and cc for the validation of gridded data are provided in table 2 for precipitation the gpcc data showed the lowest nrmse 0 63 and the highest cc 0 82 followed by cru data nrmse 0 75 and cc 0 77 aphrodite data were found to have relatively higher nrmse 0 90 and lower cc 0 76 for tmax and tmin cru data displayed the lowest nrmse and the highest cc the nrmse for cru data of tmax and tmin were 0 21 and 0 18 while those were 0 60 and 0 24 for prin data and 0 62 and 0 26 for berk data overall gpcc and cru precipitation data showed better agreement with observed precipitation while cru and prin temperature data showed better agreement with observed temperature the skill of gpcc cru and prin data in replicating observed precipitation and temperature over pakistan was also reported by ahmed et al 2017a and khan et al 2018a ahmed et al 2017a stated that the better agreement of gpcc and cru data with observed climate over pakistan is possibly due to the use of a higher number of observation stations and extensive quality controlling conducted during the generation of these datasets khan et al 2018a stated that prin data are developed based on a number of meteorological databases which enhanced its accuracy over pakistan therefore gpcc and cru gridded p data and cru and prin gridded tmax and tmin data were used for the ranking of gcms 4 2 assessment of gcms using su cp and wss su cp and wss were individually applied to each grid point considering each climate variable separately the details of the application of su cp and wss are provided in sections 4 2 1 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 4 2 1 application of su su was individually applied to 35 common grid points over pakistan see fig 1 using gpcc and cru p and cru and prin tmax and tmin considering each gcm separately as an example su coefficients obtained for the tmax with cru data for the grid point at 26 n 61 e are shown in table 3 for the calculation of su coefficients in table 3 the whole time series of gcm simulations and cru temperature data were used considering the period 1961 2005 annual ranking gcms were ranked according to their coefficients derived from su technique su coefficients define the potential of one gcm over the others in simulating observations and the higher the coefficients the better performance of the gcm of interest in this example csiro mk3 6 0 was found to have the highest su coefficient of 0 680 and therefore ranked top while miroc esm was found to have the lowest su coefficient of 0 540 and therefore ranked last in many cases only a small difference in coefficients among the gcms was observed small differences among gcms in relation to temperature have also been reported in previous studies raju and kumar 2015 raju et al 2016 sperber et al 2013 the smaller difference in su values among gcms indicated that all the gcms performed with a similar degree of accuracy in replicating observations of tmax table 4 shows the frequency of occurrence of gcms at different ranks obtained with su using cru tmax over the 35 grid points in other words table 4 presents the number of grid points where a gcm attained a certain rank for tmax as seen in table 4 csiro mk3 6 0 attained rank 1 at 17 grid points refers to 48 5 of the land area of pakistan by far the highest number of grid points at rank 1 compared to that of other gcms also mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m were ranked 1 at 6 and 5 gcm grid points respectively table 5 shows the distribution of weights frequency of occurrence and overall weights of gcms for tmax considering the 35 grid points over pakistan obtained with su using cru data the performance of each gcm in terms of overall weight was assessed using eq 7 following the procedure detailed in section 3 4 as an example for tmax csiro mk3 6 0 attained ranks 1 2 3 and 20 with frequencies of occurrence 17 8 0 and 0 respectively 6th column of table 4 frequencies of occurrence 17 8 0 and 0 corresponded to weights 1 0 5 0 33 0 05 2nd column of table 5 respectively the overall weight of csiro mk3 6 0 was computed as 1 17 0 5 8 0 33 0 0 05 0 22 42 the same procedure was applied to the other gcms in order to determine the overall weights for p tmax and tmin the ranking procedure detailed in section 3 4 was also followed for tmax corresponding to monsoon and winter seasons the overall weights derived from su coefficients obtained for annual also shown in table 5 monsoon and winter seasons for tmax were averaged and then used to rank gcms based on the average performance in simulating tmax in annual monsoon and winter seasons table 6 as shown in table 6 based on the average of the overall weights derived from su coefficients csiro mk3 6 0 and giss e2 r were identified as the most skilful and the least skilful gcms in simulating tmax over pakistan respectively the overall ranks attained by different gcms calculated using the overall weights derived from su according to their ability to simulate gpcc p cru tmax and tmin over pakistan for the period 1961 2005 are shown in table 7 the gcms in table 7 are arranged according to the descending order of the ranks computed with the mr technique hadgem2 ao was found to have the highest rank based on the mr value followed by cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 es and noresm1 m while the ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr giss e2 r miroc esm were found to have the lowest ranks based on the mr value 4 2 2 application of cp cp was used to rank the gcms based on statistical metrics nrmse cc and ss lp metric of cp calculated for each grid point for each season for each climate variable were used in ranking gcms as an example the ranks of gcms obtained from cp technique for tmax for grid point at 30 n 61 e are shown in table 8 as seen in table 8 csiro mk3 6 0 was found to have the minimum lp value hence attained rank 1 and gfdl cm3 was found to have the maximum lp value hence attained rank 20 it was observed that some gcms developed by the same modelling centre attained similar rankings e g gfdl esm2m gfdl esm2g and gfdl cm3 of geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory of the usa attained ranks 18 19 and 20 respectively on the other hand some gcms developed by the same modelling centre attained markedly different rankings e g ipsl cm5a lr and ipsl cm5a mr of institut pierre simon laplace france attained ranks 5 and 10 respectively ranks of each gcm obtained from lp metric of cp for each season for all climate variables were used to calculate mr values table 9 shows the overall ranks obtained from lp metric of cp mr values and final ranks of gcm corresponding to mr values the mr based final ranks of gcms in table 9 showed that gfdl cm3 and giss e2 h are the most skilful and least skilful gcms respectively in simulating p tmax and tmin over pakistan according to table 9 it was understood that a gcm which simulates a particular climate variable with high accuracy may not simulate some other climate variable s with such degree of accuracy as an example miroc5 which attained rank 1 in simulating p attained ranks 11 and 17 in simulating tmax and tmin respectively similar results were also reported in the study by johnson et al 2011 where they ranked gcms based on their capabilities in simulating sea surface temperature precipitation and pressure and found that some gcms performed well in simulating sea surface temperature but showed poor performance in simulating precipitation or pressure and vice versa 4 2 3 application of wss wss was individually applied to each grid point and climate variable i e p tmax and tmin separately as an example the results obtained for grid point 30 n 61 e for tmax are shown in table 10 gcms are arranged according to their performance based on wss scores ranging from 0 867 to 0 919 noresm1 m was identified as the best gcm while bcc csm1 1 was identified as worst gcm at grid point 30 n 61 e as seen in table 10 the wss values among gcms were similar indicating that all gcms were able to simulate the interannual variability of tmax at grid point 30 n 61 e ranks of each gcm obtained using wss for each season i e annual monsoon and winter for all climate variables were used to calculate mr values table 11 shows the overall ranks obtained using wss mr values and final gcm ranks determined based on mr values as seen in table 11 the final rank based on mr values indicated that ccsm4 is the most skilled gcm in simulating the interannual variability of p tmax and tmin over pakistan the overall ranks of fio esm indicated that it poorly performed in simulating all climate variables attaining ranks 11 20 and 17 for p tmax and tmin respectively as seen in table 11 miroc esm was the most skilful gcm in simulating the interannual variability of p but showed poor performance in simulating the interannual variability of tmax and tmin 4 3 validation of performance of top ranked gcms and their ensemble mean performances of the 4 top ranked gcms and their ensemble mean were validated by considering the rpd and the spatial patterns of climate variables as detailed in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 4 3 1 validation of performance of gcms considering rpd the rpds of moderate droughts 1 5 spi 1 0 severe droughts 2 0 spi 1 5 and extreme droughts spi 2 0 calculated based on 3 6 and 12 month spis are presented in fig 2 the rpds were estimated from gpcc precipitation precipitation simulations of the 4 top ranked gcms identified using su cp and wss and their ensembles the rpd values of moderate and severe droughts for 3 6 and 12 month time scales identified by the individual gcms and their ensembles were mostly similar to the rpd values estimated from gpcc p as an example corresponding to su a 3 month moderate drought with an rpd of 6 years was perfectly simulated by hadgem2 ao hadgem2 es and noresm1 m and their ensemble similarly corresponding to su a 6 month severe drought with an rpd of 17 years was well simulated by all selected gcms and their ensemble with minor differences 1 to 4 years it is worth noting that rpd values of moderate droughts 3 6 and 12 month spi estimated from each ensemble of gcms identified by su cp and wss were in perfect agreement with the rpd values derived from gpcc p in general gcms and their ensembles showed difficulty in capturing extreme droughts at all timescales for example corresponding to su and cp a 12 month extreme drought with an rpd of 54 years derived from gpcc p was estimated by hadgem2 ao with an rpd of about 270 years the same 12 month extreme drought was estimated with an rdp of about 77 years by hadgem2 es corresponding to wss overall it can be remarked that the selected gcms and their ensembles performed well in simulating the return periods of observed moderate and severe droughts the mismatches in the rpds were high for extreme droughts which indicated that gcms were unable to simulate low precipitation correctly the inability of gcms to accurately simulate low precipitation and drought conditions has also been noted in the study by lee et al 2016 where they reported that despite numerous improvements in the cmip phases gcms are still unable to simulate extreme droughts 4 3 2 validation of gcms using spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature the spatial patterns of observed p tmax and tmin were also used to validate the gcms ranked using su cp and wss the validation was done by estimating spatial correlation and visually comparing the spatial patterns of observations of each climate variable gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin used as surrogates for observations with the spatial patterns generated from the gcms ranked 1 the best and 20 the worst and the ensemble mean generated from the 4 top ranked gcms fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of the annual average of precipitation simulated by the gcms ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms along with the gpcc p pertaining to period 1961 2005 the gcms ranked 1 by su cp and wss showed spatial patterns similar to that of observed precipitation with spatial correlations of 0 662 0 550 and 0 595 respectively fig 3 on the other hand for su cp and wss the gcms ranked 20 showed little agreements with the spatial pattern of gpcc p with spatial correlations of 0 362 0 333 and 0 364 respectively furthermore overall the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms was also able to reproduce the spatial patterns of annual average precipitation similar to that of gpcc p the spatial correlations for the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms were 0 674 0 670 and 0 647 for su cp and wss respectively and these correlations were higher than the correlations for the gcms ranked 1 in general the gcm ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms over predicted the precipitation in the northern region of pakistan fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of average monsoon precipitation simulated by the gcms ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms along with the gpcc p pertaining to period 1961 2005 the spatial patterns of the average monsoon precipitation were better captured by the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms compared to the gcms ranked 1 and 20 the same can be confirmed from the spatial correlations presented in fig 4 the gcms ranked 1 showed spatial correlations of 0 616 0 657 and 0 731 for su cp and wss respectively the gcms ranked 20 by su and cp heavily underestimated the average monsoon precipitation the gcms ranked 20 showed the spatial correlations of 0 220 0 005 and 0 487 for su cp and wss respectively the spatial correlations of the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms were found much higher 0 670 0 742 and 0 745 for su cp and wss respectively fig 5 shows the spatial patterns of average winter precipitation simulated by the gcms ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms along with the gpcc p pertaining to period 1961 2005 according to fig 5 the lowest precipitation was recorded in the southeast corners while the highest in the northern region of the country this characteristic was better captured by the gcms ranked 1 by su and cp compared to gcm ranked 1 by wss the spatial correlations of gcms ranked 1 also confirmed that su 0 720 and cp 0 649 have better capability compared with wss 0 557 in identifying gcms which can better capture the average winter precipitation over pakistan the gcms ranked 20 displayed a widespread underestimation of average winter precipitation in the southern region of the country the gcms ranked 20 showed spatial correlations of 0 580 0 541 and 0 508 for su cp and wss respectively furthermore the gcms ranked 1 and 20 as well as the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms overestimated the average winter precipitation in the northernmost part of the country overall the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms displayed better performance with spatial correlations of 0 758 0 710 and 0 659 for su cp and wss respectively overall it was observed that the gcms ranked 1 and the ensembles of 4 top ranked gcms identified using su cp and wss were able to approximately replicate the spatial patterns of gpcc p figs 3 4 and 5 cru tmax figs s1 s3 in supporting document and cru tmin figs s4 s6 in supporting document the gcms ranked 20 by su cp and wss were not able to replicate the spatial patterns of gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin as good as the gcms ranked 1 and the ensembles of 4 top ranked gcms a similar pattern of performance was also noticed for gcms ranked 2 19 not shown here where the performance of gcms declined with the increase in rank this indicated that the ranking of gcms assists in identifying better performing gcms owing to the coarse spatial resolution of gcms they were still unable to replicate finer spatial variations of the climate variables however downscaling of simulations projections produced by better performing gcms or their ensembles identified through a ranking exercise can be a potential way to produce more dependable reduce uncertainties hydro climatic information at a finer spatial resolution the inter comparison of spatial correlation values obtained using su cp and wss corresponding to the top ranked gcm and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms for p tmax and tmin pertaining to annual monsoon and winter seasons are shown in table 12 bold numbers refer to the highest spatial correlation values in each case for p su showed the highest spatial correlations in annual and winter seasons while wss showed the highest spatial correlations in monsoon season for both the top ranked gcm and the ensemble for tmax su displayed the highest spatial correlations for annual and monsoon seasons pertaining to the ensemble while cp showed the highest spatial correlations in winter season for both the top ranked gcm and the ensemble for tmin su showed the highest spatial correlations for both the top ranked gcm and the ensemble in annual and monsoon while in winter it displayed the highest spatial correlation corresponding to the top ranked gcm overall it was observed that the spatial correlation values obtained for each method are in close agreement with each other this indicated that all methods were able to identify potential gcms however the spatial correlation values pertaining to su were found relatively high in most of the cases 4 4 uncertainties in the ranks of gcms in order to assess the uncertainties associated with the ranks of gcms for p tmax and tmin obtained with different gridded data sets using su cp and wss were compared with each other and shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 gpcc cru refers to the use of gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin while cru prin refers to the use of cru p and prin tmax and tmin as it is seen in fig 6 the rankings of gcms obtained using different gridded data products and different ranking approaches i e su cp and wss indicated that there are small differences in most of the cases when the same ranking approach was used with different gridded data products for example bcc csm1 1 m showed no differences in its ranks with both gpcc cru and cru prin when the ranking was done using su and cp this is attributed to the high degree of similarity between the different gridded data products which all originate from more or less the same set of gauge based observations similar results were also reported by brown et al 2013 where they compared the ranks of gcms in simulating western pacific monsoon precipitation using gridded data from climate prediction centre merged analysis of precipitation and global precipitation climatology project version 2 the differences in ranks of gcms when the ranking was performed with su cp and wss even with the same combinations of datasets i e gpcc and cru or cru and prin indicated some notable mismatches in the ranks of certain gcms see fig 7 however the members of ensembles the 4 top ranked gcms identified by su cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao hadgem2 es noresm1 m and cp cesm1 cam5 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m ranking approaches showed significant similarity among most of the ensemble members the differences between the ranks of gcms when the ranking was performed with su and cp with the same combinations of gridded datasets i e gpcc and cru or cru and prin was limited compared to that when the ranking was performed with su and wss and cp and wss the similarities between the ranks of gcms obtained with su and cp are possibly due to the consideration of nrmse and correlations in cp as su also tries to assess such similarities in variables on the other hand wss attempts to rank the gcms based on correlation and variability conflicting ranks are a common issue seen in gcm ranking exercises where several different ranking approaches are used and it is argued that different methods evaluate different aspects of model simulations and hence they yield contradictory rankings kou et al 2012 selmi et al 2013 osorio and galiano 2013 commented that gcm evaluation is pragmatic and somewhat a subjective task where the end results reflect the priorities of the decision maker as stated by raäisaänen 2007 and schaller et al 2011 there is no universally accepted procedure for the assessment of gcms smith and chandler 2010 stated that the gcm performance evaluation is a complex assignment due to the availability of a large number of metrics variables spatial and temporal scales mcmahon et al 2015 and smith and chandler 2010 reported that in a gcm performance assessment exercise some gcms consistently perform well or poorly which indicates those models have strengths or weaknesses in simulating the variable s of interest in the present study also some gcms like cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 es consistently performed well in simulating precipitation and temperature on the other hand some gcms like giss e2 r giss e2 h consistently performed poorly in simulating precipitation and temperature it is worth to note that ensemble members 4 top ranked gcms identified from each ranking approach table 7 9 11 in this study consistently performing well in simulating p tmax and tmin also it can be noted that almost all gcms which attained top 5 to 6 ranks are common for the combinations of su and cp su and wss and cp and wss even though there were differences among ranking orders due to the differences in the backgrounds of approaches generally the better performing gcms and their ensembles identified by each approach showed more or less similar performance therefore it can be stated that all ranking approaches have the strength to identify better performing gcms when different aspects are considered e g interannual variability overall su introduced in this study can rank gcms like the well established ranking approaches cp and wss it is important to mention that the better performing gcms identified in this study are based on their ability to simulate the past climate it has been reported that both past and future climate can be considered in the identification of better performing gcms in the future a study can be conducted for the selection of gcms based on both past and future climate employing the methodologies detailed in johnson and sharma 2009 and lutz et al 2016 5 conclusions following major conclusions were derived from the study detailed in this paper 1 this study investigated the potential of the state of the art feature selection method known as su in ranking gcms for the identification of an ensemble of better performing gcms suitable for projection of multiple climate variables for different seasons the ranks of gcms produced by su for p tmax and tmin for annual monsoon and winter seasons were compared with the ranks obtained from two well established ranking approaches 1 cp and 2 wss the results revealed that despite some differences in the ranks of gcms in most of the cases su identified better performing gcms as identified by the other two approaches therefore it can be remarked that su has the capability to rank gcms like well established methods cp and wss unlike the application of cp and wss which involves a number of steps e g cp need the calculation of l p which requires information from a number of statistical parameters i e nrmse correlation skill score etc the application of su is relatively straightforward 2 for the simulation of p tmax and tmin for annual monsoon and winter seasons over pakistan cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and hadgem2 es were identified as the best gcms by su whereas cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and gfdl cm3 were identified as the best gcms by cp and ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 gfdl esm2g and hadgem2 es were identified as the best gcms by wss the comparison of ranks of gcms obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given gcm this characteristic was probably due to the fact that all gridded data products are more or less derived from the same set of observations however the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data products but employing different ranking approaches this was because different ranking approaches assess different aspects of the model simulations e g wss assesses interannual variability and correlation whereas cp assesses nrmse correlation and skill score 3 the validation of the gcms and ensemble of better performing gcms identified from different ranking approaches revealed all gcms in general can capture return periods associated with moderate and severe droughts in the observed records however in general gcms showed difficulty in replicating the return period of extreme droughts the validation by comparison of the spatial patterns of observed p tmax and tmin during annual monsoon and winter season with those of gcms and their ensembles indicated more or less similar patterns confirming the suitability of ensemble members and their ensembles 4 it should be noted that the simulation skills of gcms vary from variable to variable from season to season from region to region as well as with the temporal scale of the data used the ensemble of gcms identified in this study is only valid for monthly p tmax and tmin during annual monsoon winter seasons over pakistan therefore caution should be practised in using the ensembles of gcms identified in this study in impact assessment exercises over other regions

6512,general circulation models gcms provide vital information on the likely future climate much needed for the effective planning and management of water resources the performance assessment of gcms has received significant attention in recent years for reliable estimation of future climate even though many approaches have been trialled in the ranking of gcms for the selection of an appropriate ensemble there is still a need to explore the potential of the state of the art ranking approaches for a more dependable selection of gcms suitable for a given task over a region of interest the present study assessed the potential of a state of the art feature selection method known as symmetrical uncertainty su in ranking 20 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gcms based on their ability to simulate monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for annual monsoon and winter seasons the performance of gcms was assessed using gridded climate data obtained from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc climatic research unit cru and princeton global meteorological forcing dataset prin over the period 1961 2005 considering pakistan as the study area the ranks obtained with su were compared with those obtained using two well established ranking approaches 1 compromise programming cp and 2 wavelet based skill score wss according to the results of this study for the simulation of all the three climate variables in all seasons cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and hadgem2 es were identified as the best gcms by su whereas cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and gfdl cm3 were identified as the best gcms by cp and ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 gfdl esm2g and hadgem2 es by wss the comparison of ranks of gcms obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given gcm however the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data but employing different ranking approaches the approach presented in this study can be extended to any number of gcms and can be applied over any region for the identification of the best performing ensemble of gcms for a set of climate variables keywords general circulation models multivariable ensemble symmetrical uncertainty compromise programming wavelet based skill score temperature and precipitation 1 introduction increase in concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases ghgs have altered the global energy balance and thus the earth s surface temperature flanner et al 2018 ipcc 2014 there is a wide agreement among the scientific community that increase in surface temperature will cause sea level rise affect freshwater availability increase extreme weather events and damage ecosystems which in turn may severely affect the economy and livelihood of people particularly in developing countries akhter et al 2016 therefore it is important to assess and analyse the likely future variations in primary climate variables such as precipitation and temperature for the formulation of necessary mitigation and adaptation strategies general circulation models gcms are often employed to project future climate on global scales sachindra et al 2014 wright et al 2015 you et al 2018 2016 currently outputs of 39 gcms with different spatial resolutions are publicly available through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 archive demirel and moradkhani 2015 taylor et al 2012 however it is not practical to use the simulations projections of all gcms in the cmip5 archive for impact assessment ekström et al 2016 usually a small set of gcms an ensemble is selected for the climate change impact assessment in focus lutz et al 2016 furthermore to identify and narrow the uncertainties arising from gcms it is necessary to select an ensemble of gcms for the region of interest by excluding the gcms which do not perform well over that region with respect to the climate variables of interest e g precipitation selection approaches of gcms can be grouped into two categories 1 past performance approach biemans et al 2013 in which gcms are chosen considering their capability to mimic past climate and 2 envelope approach warszawski et al 2014 in which an ensemble of gcms encompassing the whole range of future projections is chosen from the available set of gcms the downside of the past performance approach is that it neglects the agreement between the gcms in their projections of the future climate whereas the downside of the envelope approach is that it ignores the ability of gcms to mimic the historical observed climate however most of the studies argued that past performance approach is the best way to identify better performing models despite the fact that past performance of gcms does not guarantee equally good performance in the future ahmadalipour et al 2017 hidalgo and alfaro 2012 raju et al 2016 reichler and kim 2008 the past performance approach employs feature selection methods for identifying an ensemble of better performing gcms from a large pool of gcms with respect to a climate variable feature selection also known as the variable selection is the process of ranking of gcms with respect to a climate variable or variables based on their past performance chandrashekar and sahin 2014 feature selection methods can be broadly classified into three groups 1 filters where an ensemble of gcms i e gcms with respect to a climate variable or variables is selected on the basis of their scores derived from various statistical tests such as correlation coefficient significance test linear discriminant analysis and information gain barfus and bernhofer 2015 gleckler et al 2008 gu et al 2015 wu et al 2016 2 wrappers which select an ensemble of gcms by employing iterative learning algorithms such as forward selection recursive variable elimination and greedy search dudek 2010 3 hybrids of filters and wrappers where wrappers such as elastic net and ridge regression are used to identify better performing gcms from an initially filtered ensemble of gcms hammami et al 2012 the major drawback of filters is that they ignore inter dependencies among gcms for a given variable and therefore may select inappropriate gcms for the ensemble the wrappers are computationally very intensive and also often found to select inappropriate gcms due to overfitting of the regression model the hybrids of filters and wrappers are computationally less intense compared to wrappers but found to perform similarly to wrappers sutha and tamilselvi 2015 hybrids of filters and wrappers are more suitable to be used with a large number of gcms filters and wrappers are more suitable to be used with a smaller number of gcms lutz et al 2016 mcsweeney et al 2015 many investigations have been done to evaluate the performance of gcms employing various wrappers and filters mcmahon et al 2015 a variety of performance metrics based on correlation coefficients barfus and bernhofer 2015 gleckler et al 2008 gu et al 2015 wu et al 2016 clustering knutti et al 2013 weighted skill score maxino et al 2008 perkins et al 2007 information entropy shukla et al 2006 and bayesian weighting min and hense 2006 have been used for the above purpose in many studies the metrics are jointly assessed using a single performance index to select gcms ahmadalipour et al 2017 baker and taylor 2016 raju et al 2016 the chief demerit of performance indices is that they are centred on the overall state of climate e g correlation over a specific period between observations and simulations of a variable where temporal variability of the climate is not given full attention though it is quite crucial in the assessment of model performance reichler and kim 2008 feature variable selection methods based on various machine learning algorithms such as entropy theory novaković et al 2011 artificial neural networks hajnayeb et al 2011 support vector machine maldonado and weber 2009 and random forest genuer et al 2010 are being used in hydroclimatological studies each independent variable e g a set of gcm simulated temperature is ranked by analysing its ability to mimic the dependent variable e g observed temperature by feature selection methods among the filters symmetrical uncertainty su which is based on the information entropy press et al 1996 has gained the attention of researchers kannan and ramaraj 2010 kumar and sree 2014 gcms can be ranked using su based on the agreement of a given gcm output e g gcm simulated temperature with the corresponding observations considering the entropy of the entire sequence of time series the chief advantage of su is its ability to provide an overall measure of the relationship between the dependent e g observed temperature and independent variables e g gcm simulated temperature irrespective of the character of the distributions and conditional dependencies between the independent variables e g temperature simulated by different gcms hall 1999 in su mutual information information gain decreases when there is a higher degree of difference present in the temporal sequences of observations of the variable of interest and its gcm simulations this allows su in ranking gcms according to their capability to imitate the temporal sequence trends and patterns in the climate variable of interest unlike the most widely used measures such as correlation coefficients and clustering model performance index it can trace the pairwise similarities and dissimilarities between two data sequences bakhshandeh et al 2019 and thus can be used for the overall assessment of the association between observations and gcm simulations by avoiding the need to use multiple statistical metrics for the performance assessment therefore it is argued that the use of su in ranking gcms in relation to a climate variable of interest is a more reliable approach compared to other gcm ranking approaches the present study aims to employ a filter using su to rank gcms for the selection of an appropriate ensemble based on their ability to simulate the historical observed monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature considering pakistan as the case study an information aggregation approach was employed to combine the ranks to identify the best performing ensemble of gcms for the simulation of the above three variables in order to understand the uncertainties in the ranks of gcms due to the use of different ranking approaches this study compared the gcm ranks derived using su with those derived from two other well established ranking approaches 1 compromising programming cp raju et al 2016 and 2 wavelet based skill score wss johnson et al 2011 furthermore the above ranking approaches were used with different gridded precipitation and temperature data products for the quantification of impacts of different gridded data products on the ranks of gcms in addition to that this study details the validation of the ability of the ranking approaches to identify the better performing gcms from a pool of given gcms 2 study area and data 2 1 study area pakistan 23 n 61 e 37 n76 e occupies an area of 796 100 km2 is dominated by arid and semi arid climate fig 1 shows the location of pakistan in central south asia where it shares its borders with china in the north the arabian sea in the south iran and afghanistan in the west and india in the east pakistan is a country with great topographic contrast and precipitation and temperature across the country vary widely with topography fig 1 pakistan has two discrete wet seasons 1 summer monsoon which spans over june to september and 2 winter season which spans over december to march also there are two transition periods recognised as pre and post monsoon from april to may and october to november respectively sheikh 2001 the westerly disturbances in the mediterranean sea cause most of the precipitation in winter and the bulk of the precipitation in summer is caused by monsoon winds that originate from the bay of bengal monsoon precipitation is vital for kharif season a cropping season that begins in may and ends in october while winter precipitation is vital for rabi season a cropping season that starts in november and finishes in april the annual mean precipitation over pakistan varies from less than 100 mm in the northwest corner and more than 1000 mm in the northern parts of the country since the country is located in a region with arid and semi arid climate the bulk of the country gets less than 500 mm of annual mean precipitation while a very small area receives more than 1000 mm of annual mean precipitation ahmed et al 2017b the lowest temperature is generally recorded in the himalayan region in the north and the highest in the low lying south eastern region the annual maximum temperature ranges from 15 to 35 c and the minimum temperature varies between 0 and 20 c across the country iqbal et al 2016 a recent study by pakistan meteorological department gop 2013 stated that pakistan s surface temperature has risen at a rate of 0 1 c per decade during 1960 2010 and the precipitation has increased by 22 6 mm and 20 8 mm in monsoon and winter seasons respectively during 1901 2010 according to recent trends it is anticipated that the climate in the region will be more variable in the future due to global warming which may increase the frequency of natural disasters such as heat waves extreme precipitation etc which may severely affect the agriculture based economy of pakistan khan et al 2018b syed et al 2013 2 2 data 2 2 1 gridded precipitation and temperature data the scarcity of long records of reliable hydroclimatological observations pertaining to a dense network of stations is a major issue in hydroclimatological investigations ahmed et al 2017a as a solution to this issue many multi source climate datasets such as observation based gridded precipitation and temperature satellite based precipitation and temperature and reanalysis precipitation and temperature have been developed among them the observation based gridded precipitation and temperature data are widely used because of their extensive spatial and temporal coverage kishore et al 2015 in the present study the monthly gridded precipitation data of 1 global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2013 dwd de en ourservices gpcc gpcc html 2 climatic research unit cru harris et al 2014 of the east anglia university crudata uea ac uk and 3 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite yatagai et al 2009 chikyu ac jp were used as surrogates for observed precipitation the monthly average of daily gridded maximum and minimum temperature data of 1 climatic research unit cru harris et al 2014 of the east anglia university crudata uea ac uk 2 princeton global meteorological forcing dataset prin sheffield et al 2006 hydrology princeton edu and 3 university of california berkeley dataset berk rohde et al 2013 berkeleyearth org were used as surrogates for observed maximum and minimum temperature all datasets were interpolated to a grid with a spatial resolution of 2 2 35 grid points to cover whole pakistan as shown in fig 1 in order to comply with the common grid used for the gcm simulated precipitation maximum and minimum temperature in the present study ability of the gpcc cru and aphrodite precipitation data and cru prin and berk temperature data to mimic monthly precipitation hereafter referred to as p monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature hereafter referred to as tmax and tmin over pakistan during the period 1961 2005 was assessed by comparing them with observed p tmax and tmin data obtained from 16 stations maintained by the pakistan meteorological department www pmd gov pk the stations were selected based on the availability of data and locations representing different climate regimes of the country 2 2 2 gcm simulated precipitation and temperature data the data of monthly precipitation hereafter referred to as gcm simulated p and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature hereafter referred to as gcm simulated tmax and tmin were obtained from the cmip5 database http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 for the period 1961 2005 the p tmax and tmin projections for all representative concentration pathways rcp are only available for 20 of the cmip5 gcms in the above database therefore only those 20 gcms were used in this investigation the selected gcms and their spatial resolutions along with modelling centres are provided in table 1 to perform a fair comparison the precipitation and temperature data of all the selected cmip5 gcm were interpolated onto a common grid with a spatial resolution of 2 2 the spatial resolution of the common grid was set to 2 2 as it is approximately equal to the average spatial resolution of these 20 gcms jiang et al 2012 salman et al 2018 the interpolation was done using the bilinear interpolation method bilinear interpolation is frequently used for the smooth transformation of spatially coarse gcm data into spatially fine data through interpolation of gcm data from the four nearest neighbouring grid points ahmed et al 2018 cmip5 gcms have several ensemble members such as r1i1p1 r2i1p1 r3i1p1 r4i1p1 etc that represent the realization initialization and physics of the models in order to conduct an unbiased comparison among gcms r1i1p1 for the historical period 1961 2005 was considered 3 methodology the procedure for ranking of gcms and identification of a better performing ensemble of gcms for simulation of multiple climate variables and the validation of the performance of gcm ensemble are outlined as follows more details on the ranking procedure can be found in section 3 4 1 all gcm simulated historical p tmax and tmin data for the period 1961 2005 were re gridded to 2 2 resolution 2 su cp and wss were applied at each grid point for assessing the association between gridded observations e g cru tmax and corresponding simulations of different gcms e g tmax of 20 gcms for the period 1961 2005 for each season i e annual monsoon and winter separately 3 the su coefficients lp metric values calculated using cp and skill score values calculated by wss were used in ranking gcms separately at each grid point for each season 4 the overall weights of gcms were derived for each season considering their ranks at all grid points over the study area using an information aggregation approach based on the frequency of occurrence of a gcm at a particular rank these overall weights were averaged and used to obtain overall ranks for each gcm for each season separately one single rank for each gcm for each variable for each season valid for the entire study area 5 a comprehensive rating metric was used to determine the final rank of each gcm for each variable by combining the overall ranks pertaining to annual monsoon and winter seasons one single rank for all the three seasons for each gcm for each variable valid for the entire study area 6 an ensemble of top ranked 4 gcms in terms of the final rank was identified for each climate variable and its performance was validated considering 1 return period of droughts and 2 agreement between observed and simulated spatial patterns of climate variables details of su cp and wss and the determination of the best performing ensemble of gcms are provided in the following sections 3 1 symmetrical uncertainty symmetrical uncertainty su is based on the concept of information entropy shannon 2001 and it measures the average information content in the dependent variable e g cru tmax about an independent variable e g gcm simulated tmax singh and fiorentino 2012 in the current investigation su was employed to gauge the ability of different gcms in simulating gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin the entropy h x of a dependent variable x e g cru tmax is given in eq 1 as below 1 h x x x p x log 2 p x where x refers to the ith value in the time series of x and p x refers to the probabilities of values of x the entropy of the dependent variable x after observing the values of independent variable y e g gcm simulated tmax h x y is given by eq 2 2 h x y y y p y x x p x y log 2 p x y in eq 2 p x are the prior probabilities of all values of x and p x y is the posterior probabilities of x given the values of y the amount by which the entropy of x decreases reflects additional information about x provided by y and is called information gain ig which is given by eq 3 3 i g x y h x h x y ig tends to favour variables with more values and it can be normalized by the sum of entropies of the corresponding variables as given in eq 4 wu and zhang 2004 to obtain a fairer measure of dependence called the su 4 s u x y 2 i g x y h x h y su values vary between 0 and 1 where 1 refers to a perfect agreement between the observations of a variable e g cru tmax and gcm simulated values of that variable e g gcm simulated tmax and a value of 0 refers to no agreement shreem et al 2016 in the current investigation gcms were ranked using the su values estimated using eq 4 for gpcc p cru tmax and tmin separately 3 2 compromise programming compromise programming cp zeleny and cochrane 1973 is a technique used to measure the combined effect of several statistical performance measures in the present study cp was used to rank gcms based on three statistical performance measures 1 normalised root mean square error nrmse 2 pearson correlation coefficient cc and 3 skill score ss the nrmse was computed by dividing the root mean square error of gcm simulations of a climate variable i e p tmax and tmin by the average of observations cc pearson 1948 is a measure of linear association between gcm simulations and observations ss proposed by perkins et al 2007 measures the overlap between the probability density functions pdf of gcm simulations and observations the values of the above three statistical performance measures were used to calculate the distance measure lp metric of cp lp metric is defined in eq 5 as below 5 l p j 1 j f j f j p 1 p where fj is the value of statistical performance measure j f j is the ideal value of the statistical performance measure j and p is a parameter which is equal to 1 the ideal value of a statistical performance measure refers to its value corresponding to a perfect match between the simulations produced by the model and the relevant observations the lp metric value is always positive and the lower the value the higher the model performance hence the smallest value of lp is preferred 3 3 wavelet based skill score johnson et al 2011 introduced a discrete wavelet based skill score wss to assess the suitability of gcms in simulating the observed variability with different frequencies of climate variables following the procedure detailed in johnson et al 2011 the observations and gcm simulated data of each climate variable at different grid points were decomposed into 6 levels using daubechies db family of orthogonal wavelets in the current study p tmax and tmin data were divided into three classes 1 sub annual shorter than a year 2 interannual longer than a year but less than a decade and 3 decadal longer than 10 years it was observed that wavelet db4 decomposed time series into sub annual as 0 23 years interannual as 5 8 and decadal as 14 9 years johnson et al 2011 reported that assessment based on interannual variability provides vital information for drought and reservoir management and this is seen a very crucial need for arid regions like pakistan thus in this study an assessment was performed considering interannual frequencies following johnson et al 2011 the decomposed details were used to assess the performance of gcms in correctly representing interannual variability using the skill score proposed by taylor 2001 and used by johnson et al 2011 the wss is calculated using eq 6 as below 6 wss 4 1 r 4 σ f 1 σ f 2 1 r 0 4 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between observed and gcm simulated values of the climate variable of interest i e p tmax and tmin r 0 is the highest possible value of correlation which is 1 σ f is the ratio of standard deviation of gcm simulated data of the climate variable of interest e g precipitation to standard deviation of corresponding observations gcms were ranked based on the wss values obtained at each grid point for simulating p tmax and tmin 3 4 ranking of gcms the assessment and ranking of gcms at a single grid point is generally a relatively simple task nevertheless ranking and identification of better performing gcms become a difficult task when a large number of grid points are used in the ranking exercise where different gcms may display different degrees of accuracies at different grid points in such a case an information aggregation approach that combines information from several sources can be employed various approaches such as numerical averaging majority rule and frequency of occurrence have been used for combining information originating from several sources e g raju and kumar 2016 in the current investigation gcms were ranked considering their frequency of occurrence at different ranks raju and kumar 2015 as outlined below ranks of the gcms pertaining to each grid point for each climate variable for each season were determined based on su cp and wss before the application of steps 1 6 outlined below 1 the number of grid points where a gcm attained a certain rank was computed payoff matrix containing the frequency of occurrence this matrix had the dimensions of 20 20 as the number of gcms considered in this study was 20 2 each rank 1 to 20 was assigned a weight defined as the inverse of the rank weight 1 rank for example gcms ranked 1 2 3 were assigned weights 1 0 5 0 33 and so on respectively 3 then the frequency of occurrence of each gcm at a particular rank found in step 1 was multiplied by the weight found in step 2 corresponding to its rank 4 the overall weight wo of a gcm was calculated by summing all the values found in step 3 as shown in eq 7 as below 7 w o x 1 w 1 x 2 w 2 x 3 w 3 x 20 w 20 where x represents the frequency of occurrence e g x 1 corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of gcm at rank 1 w represents the weight corresponding to each rank e g w 1 corresponds to rank 1 and w o denotes the overall weight of a specific gcm 5 overall weights calculated in step 4 for each season i e annual monsoon and winter were averaged for each variable i e p tmax and tmin for each gcm separately and hence an overall rank for each gcm was determined overall rank refers to a single rank for each gcm for each climate variable which combines their performance in different seasons 6 finally a comprehensive rating metric mr chen et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 was used for the derivation of final ranks of gcms final rank refers to a single rank for each gcm combining their performance in different seasons for all climate variables the final ranks of gcms based on different seasons i e annual monsoon and winter were derived using eq 8 as below 8 mr 1 1 nm i 1 n r a n k i where m is the number of gcms n is the number of seasons and i refers to the rank of a gcm in the ith season a value of mr closer to 1 represents a better gcm 3 5 identification of multi model ensemble mme of gcms the uncertainty in gcm produced climate projections can be reduced by identifying an ensemble of better performing gcms and using them in impact assessment studies kim et al 2015 many studies miao et al 2012 weigel et al 2010 have recommended that one gcm is insufficient to assess the uncertainties associated with future likely climate therefore identification of a better performing ensemble of gcms is a necessity in climate change impact assessments the main aim of the identification of an ensemble of gcms for simulation of multiple climate variables is to maximize the reliability of climate projections by minimizing the uncertainties introduced by the gcms in the present study the most appropriate ensembles of gcms were identified by considering the 4 top ranked gcms in simulating monthly p tmax and tmin an ensemble of 4 gcms later the time series of each climate variable simulated by the 4 top ranked gcms were used to compute the mean for each climate variable for each season separately 3 6 validation of rankings of gcms the rankings of gcms obtained using su cp and wss were validated employing two approaches in the first approach the return period of drought rpd estimated from the 4 top ranked gcms and mme mean were compared with the rpd computed from the gpcc p in the second approach the spatial patterns of gcms at rank 1 the best and 20 the worst and the spatial patterns of the mean of the mme derived from the 4 top ranked gcms were visually compared with the spatial patterns of gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin additionally spatial correlation pearson correlation coefficient was used to quantify the agreement between the spatial patterns of climate variables characterised in observations and those simulated by gcms the comparisons were performed individually considering average annual average monsoon and average winter p tmax and tmin the details of the above approaches are provided below 3 6 1 validation based on return period of droughts standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which is used as an indicator of the severity of droughts offers a comparison between the precipitation over a specific period and the precipitation totals corresponding to the same period for all the years included in the historical record for example a six month spi at the end of november compares the april to november precipitation total in that particular year with the april to november precipitation totals of all previous years in the record of observations alamgir et al 2015 spi produces positive and negative values where positive values refer to wet conditions and negative values refer to drought conditions mckee et al 1993 classified negative spi values into 4 categories 1 mild drought spi 1 0 2 moderate drought 1 5 spi 1 0 3 severe drought 2 0 spi 1 5 and 4 extreme drought spi 2 0 the calculation procedure of rpd based on spi is detailed in the studies by ahmed et al 2015 alamgir et al 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 santos et al 2011 in the current investigation the rpd for 3 6 and 12 month spi were calculated for gcms and ensembles and compared with those obtained from gpcc p 3 6 2 validation based on the spatial patterns of climate variables the comparison of spatial patterns of climate variables simulated by gcms with those of observations can provide an understanding of the ability of gcms to simulate the spatial characteristics of climate variables in the current investigation to compare the spatial patterns of p tmax and tmin simulated by gcms with that of observations coarse resolution gcm simulations were first interpolated to fine spatial resolution using ordinary kriging ahmed et al 2014 demonstrated that ordinary kriging performs better over this study area compared to other interpolation techniques in the kriging family the spatial pattern obtained from each climate variable i e p tmax and tmin for each season i e annual monsoon and winter for the top ranked rank 1 and the bottom ranked rank 20 gcms identified from each method i e su cp and wss and their ensembles were visually and numerically compared with the spatial patterns of observations of each climate variable a similar validation procedure was also adopted by mcgregor et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy assessment of gridded precipitation and temperature data as a preliminary analysis the gpcc cru and aphrodite precipitation data and cru berk and prin temperature data were validated against precipitation and temperature data obtained from 16 in situ observation stations for the period 1961 to 2005 over pakistan in this study two statistical indicators namely nrmse and cc were used to assess the accuracy of monthly p tmax and tmin in replicating the mean variability and distribution of observed precipitation and temperature a data product is considered more accurate if nrmse and cc values are found closer to 0 and 1 respectively results obtained using nrmse and cc for the validation of gridded data are provided in table 2 for precipitation the gpcc data showed the lowest nrmse 0 63 and the highest cc 0 82 followed by cru data nrmse 0 75 and cc 0 77 aphrodite data were found to have relatively higher nrmse 0 90 and lower cc 0 76 for tmax and tmin cru data displayed the lowest nrmse and the highest cc the nrmse for cru data of tmax and tmin were 0 21 and 0 18 while those were 0 60 and 0 24 for prin data and 0 62 and 0 26 for berk data overall gpcc and cru precipitation data showed better agreement with observed precipitation while cru and prin temperature data showed better agreement with observed temperature the skill of gpcc cru and prin data in replicating observed precipitation and temperature over pakistan was also reported by ahmed et al 2017a and khan et al 2018a ahmed et al 2017a stated that the better agreement of gpcc and cru data with observed climate over pakistan is possibly due to the use of a higher number of observation stations and extensive quality controlling conducted during the generation of these datasets khan et al 2018a stated that prin data are developed based on a number of meteorological databases which enhanced its accuracy over pakistan therefore gpcc and cru gridded p data and cru and prin gridded tmax and tmin data were used for the ranking of gcms 4 2 assessment of gcms using su cp and wss su cp and wss were individually applied to each grid point considering each climate variable separately the details of the application of su cp and wss are provided in sections 4 2 1 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 4 2 1 application of su su was individually applied to 35 common grid points over pakistan see fig 1 using gpcc and cru p and cru and prin tmax and tmin considering each gcm separately as an example su coefficients obtained for the tmax with cru data for the grid point at 26 n 61 e are shown in table 3 for the calculation of su coefficients in table 3 the whole time series of gcm simulations and cru temperature data were used considering the period 1961 2005 annual ranking gcms were ranked according to their coefficients derived from su technique su coefficients define the potential of one gcm over the others in simulating observations and the higher the coefficients the better performance of the gcm of interest in this example csiro mk3 6 0 was found to have the highest su coefficient of 0 680 and therefore ranked top while miroc esm was found to have the lowest su coefficient of 0 540 and therefore ranked last in many cases only a small difference in coefficients among the gcms was observed small differences among gcms in relation to temperature have also been reported in previous studies raju and kumar 2015 raju et al 2016 sperber et al 2013 the smaller difference in su values among gcms indicated that all the gcms performed with a similar degree of accuracy in replicating observations of tmax table 4 shows the frequency of occurrence of gcms at different ranks obtained with su using cru tmax over the 35 grid points in other words table 4 presents the number of grid points where a gcm attained a certain rank for tmax as seen in table 4 csiro mk3 6 0 attained rank 1 at 17 grid points refers to 48 5 of the land area of pakistan by far the highest number of grid points at rank 1 compared to that of other gcms also mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m were ranked 1 at 6 and 5 gcm grid points respectively table 5 shows the distribution of weights frequency of occurrence and overall weights of gcms for tmax considering the 35 grid points over pakistan obtained with su using cru data the performance of each gcm in terms of overall weight was assessed using eq 7 following the procedure detailed in section 3 4 as an example for tmax csiro mk3 6 0 attained ranks 1 2 3 and 20 with frequencies of occurrence 17 8 0 and 0 respectively 6th column of table 4 frequencies of occurrence 17 8 0 and 0 corresponded to weights 1 0 5 0 33 0 05 2nd column of table 5 respectively the overall weight of csiro mk3 6 0 was computed as 1 17 0 5 8 0 33 0 0 05 0 22 42 the same procedure was applied to the other gcms in order to determine the overall weights for p tmax and tmin the ranking procedure detailed in section 3 4 was also followed for tmax corresponding to monsoon and winter seasons the overall weights derived from su coefficients obtained for annual also shown in table 5 monsoon and winter seasons for tmax were averaged and then used to rank gcms based on the average performance in simulating tmax in annual monsoon and winter seasons table 6 as shown in table 6 based on the average of the overall weights derived from su coefficients csiro mk3 6 0 and giss e2 r were identified as the most skilful and the least skilful gcms in simulating tmax over pakistan respectively the overall ranks attained by different gcms calculated using the overall weights derived from su according to their ability to simulate gpcc p cru tmax and tmin over pakistan for the period 1961 2005 are shown in table 7 the gcms in table 7 are arranged according to the descending order of the ranks computed with the mr technique hadgem2 ao was found to have the highest rank based on the mr value followed by cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 es and noresm1 m while the ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr giss e2 r miroc esm were found to have the lowest ranks based on the mr value 4 2 2 application of cp cp was used to rank the gcms based on statistical metrics nrmse cc and ss lp metric of cp calculated for each grid point for each season for each climate variable were used in ranking gcms as an example the ranks of gcms obtained from cp technique for tmax for grid point at 30 n 61 e are shown in table 8 as seen in table 8 csiro mk3 6 0 was found to have the minimum lp value hence attained rank 1 and gfdl cm3 was found to have the maximum lp value hence attained rank 20 it was observed that some gcms developed by the same modelling centre attained similar rankings e g gfdl esm2m gfdl esm2g and gfdl cm3 of geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory of the usa attained ranks 18 19 and 20 respectively on the other hand some gcms developed by the same modelling centre attained markedly different rankings e g ipsl cm5a lr and ipsl cm5a mr of institut pierre simon laplace france attained ranks 5 and 10 respectively ranks of each gcm obtained from lp metric of cp for each season for all climate variables were used to calculate mr values table 9 shows the overall ranks obtained from lp metric of cp mr values and final ranks of gcm corresponding to mr values the mr based final ranks of gcms in table 9 showed that gfdl cm3 and giss e2 h are the most skilful and least skilful gcms respectively in simulating p tmax and tmin over pakistan according to table 9 it was understood that a gcm which simulates a particular climate variable with high accuracy may not simulate some other climate variable s with such degree of accuracy as an example miroc5 which attained rank 1 in simulating p attained ranks 11 and 17 in simulating tmax and tmin respectively similar results were also reported in the study by johnson et al 2011 where they ranked gcms based on their capabilities in simulating sea surface temperature precipitation and pressure and found that some gcms performed well in simulating sea surface temperature but showed poor performance in simulating precipitation or pressure and vice versa 4 2 3 application of wss wss was individually applied to each grid point and climate variable i e p tmax and tmin separately as an example the results obtained for grid point 30 n 61 e for tmax are shown in table 10 gcms are arranged according to their performance based on wss scores ranging from 0 867 to 0 919 noresm1 m was identified as the best gcm while bcc csm1 1 was identified as worst gcm at grid point 30 n 61 e as seen in table 10 the wss values among gcms were similar indicating that all gcms were able to simulate the interannual variability of tmax at grid point 30 n 61 e ranks of each gcm obtained using wss for each season i e annual monsoon and winter for all climate variables were used to calculate mr values table 11 shows the overall ranks obtained using wss mr values and final gcm ranks determined based on mr values as seen in table 11 the final rank based on mr values indicated that ccsm4 is the most skilled gcm in simulating the interannual variability of p tmax and tmin over pakistan the overall ranks of fio esm indicated that it poorly performed in simulating all climate variables attaining ranks 11 20 and 17 for p tmax and tmin respectively as seen in table 11 miroc esm was the most skilful gcm in simulating the interannual variability of p but showed poor performance in simulating the interannual variability of tmax and tmin 4 3 validation of performance of top ranked gcms and their ensemble mean performances of the 4 top ranked gcms and their ensemble mean were validated by considering the rpd and the spatial patterns of climate variables as detailed in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 4 3 1 validation of performance of gcms considering rpd the rpds of moderate droughts 1 5 spi 1 0 severe droughts 2 0 spi 1 5 and extreme droughts spi 2 0 calculated based on 3 6 and 12 month spis are presented in fig 2 the rpds were estimated from gpcc precipitation precipitation simulations of the 4 top ranked gcms identified using su cp and wss and their ensembles the rpd values of moderate and severe droughts for 3 6 and 12 month time scales identified by the individual gcms and their ensembles were mostly similar to the rpd values estimated from gpcc p as an example corresponding to su a 3 month moderate drought with an rpd of 6 years was perfectly simulated by hadgem2 ao hadgem2 es and noresm1 m and their ensemble similarly corresponding to su a 6 month severe drought with an rpd of 17 years was well simulated by all selected gcms and their ensemble with minor differences 1 to 4 years it is worth noting that rpd values of moderate droughts 3 6 and 12 month spi estimated from each ensemble of gcms identified by su cp and wss were in perfect agreement with the rpd values derived from gpcc p in general gcms and their ensembles showed difficulty in capturing extreme droughts at all timescales for example corresponding to su and cp a 12 month extreme drought with an rpd of 54 years derived from gpcc p was estimated by hadgem2 ao with an rpd of about 270 years the same 12 month extreme drought was estimated with an rdp of about 77 years by hadgem2 es corresponding to wss overall it can be remarked that the selected gcms and their ensembles performed well in simulating the return periods of observed moderate and severe droughts the mismatches in the rpds were high for extreme droughts which indicated that gcms were unable to simulate low precipitation correctly the inability of gcms to accurately simulate low precipitation and drought conditions has also been noted in the study by lee et al 2016 where they reported that despite numerous improvements in the cmip phases gcms are still unable to simulate extreme droughts 4 3 2 validation of gcms using spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature the spatial patterns of observed p tmax and tmin were also used to validate the gcms ranked using su cp and wss the validation was done by estimating spatial correlation and visually comparing the spatial patterns of observations of each climate variable gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin used as surrogates for observations with the spatial patterns generated from the gcms ranked 1 the best and 20 the worst and the ensemble mean generated from the 4 top ranked gcms fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of the annual average of precipitation simulated by the gcms ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms along with the gpcc p pertaining to period 1961 2005 the gcms ranked 1 by su cp and wss showed spatial patterns similar to that of observed precipitation with spatial correlations of 0 662 0 550 and 0 595 respectively fig 3 on the other hand for su cp and wss the gcms ranked 20 showed little agreements with the spatial pattern of gpcc p with spatial correlations of 0 362 0 333 and 0 364 respectively furthermore overall the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms was also able to reproduce the spatial patterns of annual average precipitation similar to that of gpcc p the spatial correlations for the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms were 0 674 0 670 and 0 647 for su cp and wss respectively and these correlations were higher than the correlations for the gcms ranked 1 in general the gcm ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms over predicted the precipitation in the northern region of pakistan fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of average monsoon precipitation simulated by the gcms ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms along with the gpcc p pertaining to period 1961 2005 the spatial patterns of the average monsoon precipitation were better captured by the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms compared to the gcms ranked 1 and 20 the same can be confirmed from the spatial correlations presented in fig 4 the gcms ranked 1 showed spatial correlations of 0 616 0 657 and 0 731 for su cp and wss respectively the gcms ranked 20 by su and cp heavily underestimated the average monsoon precipitation the gcms ranked 20 showed the spatial correlations of 0 220 0 005 and 0 487 for su cp and wss respectively the spatial correlations of the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms were found much higher 0 670 0 742 and 0 745 for su cp and wss respectively fig 5 shows the spatial patterns of average winter precipitation simulated by the gcms ranked 1 and 20 and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms along with the gpcc p pertaining to period 1961 2005 according to fig 5 the lowest precipitation was recorded in the southeast corners while the highest in the northern region of the country this characteristic was better captured by the gcms ranked 1 by su and cp compared to gcm ranked 1 by wss the spatial correlations of gcms ranked 1 also confirmed that su 0 720 and cp 0 649 have better capability compared with wss 0 557 in identifying gcms which can better capture the average winter precipitation over pakistan the gcms ranked 20 displayed a widespread underestimation of average winter precipitation in the southern region of the country the gcms ranked 20 showed spatial correlations of 0 580 0 541 and 0 508 for su cp and wss respectively furthermore the gcms ranked 1 and 20 as well as the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms overestimated the average winter precipitation in the northernmost part of the country overall the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms displayed better performance with spatial correlations of 0 758 0 710 and 0 659 for su cp and wss respectively overall it was observed that the gcms ranked 1 and the ensembles of 4 top ranked gcms identified using su cp and wss were able to approximately replicate the spatial patterns of gpcc p figs 3 4 and 5 cru tmax figs s1 s3 in supporting document and cru tmin figs s4 s6 in supporting document the gcms ranked 20 by su cp and wss were not able to replicate the spatial patterns of gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin as good as the gcms ranked 1 and the ensembles of 4 top ranked gcms a similar pattern of performance was also noticed for gcms ranked 2 19 not shown here where the performance of gcms declined with the increase in rank this indicated that the ranking of gcms assists in identifying better performing gcms owing to the coarse spatial resolution of gcms they were still unable to replicate finer spatial variations of the climate variables however downscaling of simulations projections produced by better performing gcms or their ensembles identified through a ranking exercise can be a potential way to produce more dependable reduce uncertainties hydro climatic information at a finer spatial resolution the inter comparison of spatial correlation values obtained using su cp and wss corresponding to the top ranked gcm and the ensemble of 4 top ranked gcms for p tmax and tmin pertaining to annual monsoon and winter seasons are shown in table 12 bold numbers refer to the highest spatial correlation values in each case for p su showed the highest spatial correlations in annual and winter seasons while wss showed the highest spatial correlations in monsoon season for both the top ranked gcm and the ensemble for tmax su displayed the highest spatial correlations for annual and monsoon seasons pertaining to the ensemble while cp showed the highest spatial correlations in winter season for both the top ranked gcm and the ensemble for tmin su showed the highest spatial correlations for both the top ranked gcm and the ensemble in annual and monsoon while in winter it displayed the highest spatial correlation corresponding to the top ranked gcm overall it was observed that the spatial correlation values obtained for each method are in close agreement with each other this indicated that all methods were able to identify potential gcms however the spatial correlation values pertaining to su were found relatively high in most of the cases 4 4 uncertainties in the ranks of gcms in order to assess the uncertainties associated with the ranks of gcms for p tmax and tmin obtained with different gridded data sets using su cp and wss were compared with each other and shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 gpcc cru refers to the use of gpcc p and cru tmax and tmin while cru prin refers to the use of cru p and prin tmax and tmin as it is seen in fig 6 the rankings of gcms obtained using different gridded data products and different ranking approaches i e su cp and wss indicated that there are small differences in most of the cases when the same ranking approach was used with different gridded data products for example bcc csm1 1 m showed no differences in its ranks with both gpcc cru and cru prin when the ranking was done using su and cp this is attributed to the high degree of similarity between the different gridded data products which all originate from more or less the same set of gauge based observations similar results were also reported by brown et al 2013 where they compared the ranks of gcms in simulating western pacific monsoon precipitation using gridded data from climate prediction centre merged analysis of precipitation and global precipitation climatology project version 2 the differences in ranks of gcms when the ranking was performed with su cp and wss even with the same combinations of datasets i e gpcc and cru or cru and prin indicated some notable mismatches in the ranks of certain gcms see fig 7 however the members of ensembles the 4 top ranked gcms identified by su cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao hadgem2 es noresm1 m and cp cesm1 cam5 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m ranking approaches showed significant similarity among most of the ensemble members the differences between the ranks of gcms when the ranking was performed with su and cp with the same combinations of gridded datasets i e gpcc and cru or cru and prin was limited compared to that when the ranking was performed with su and wss and cp and wss the similarities between the ranks of gcms obtained with su and cp are possibly due to the consideration of nrmse and correlations in cp as su also tries to assess such similarities in variables on the other hand wss attempts to rank the gcms based on correlation and variability conflicting ranks are a common issue seen in gcm ranking exercises where several different ranking approaches are used and it is argued that different methods evaluate different aspects of model simulations and hence they yield contradictory rankings kou et al 2012 selmi et al 2013 osorio and galiano 2013 commented that gcm evaluation is pragmatic and somewhat a subjective task where the end results reflect the priorities of the decision maker as stated by raäisaänen 2007 and schaller et al 2011 there is no universally accepted procedure for the assessment of gcms smith and chandler 2010 stated that the gcm performance evaluation is a complex assignment due to the availability of a large number of metrics variables spatial and temporal scales mcmahon et al 2015 and smith and chandler 2010 reported that in a gcm performance assessment exercise some gcms consistently perform well or poorly which indicates those models have strengths or weaknesses in simulating the variable s of interest in the present study also some gcms like cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 es consistently performed well in simulating precipitation and temperature on the other hand some gcms like giss e2 r giss e2 h consistently performed poorly in simulating precipitation and temperature it is worth to note that ensemble members 4 top ranked gcms identified from each ranking approach table 7 9 11 in this study consistently performing well in simulating p tmax and tmin also it can be noted that almost all gcms which attained top 5 to 6 ranks are common for the combinations of su and cp su and wss and cp and wss even though there were differences among ranking orders due to the differences in the backgrounds of approaches generally the better performing gcms and their ensembles identified by each approach showed more or less similar performance therefore it can be stated that all ranking approaches have the strength to identify better performing gcms when different aspects are considered e g interannual variability overall su introduced in this study can rank gcms like the well established ranking approaches cp and wss it is important to mention that the better performing gcms identified in this study are based on their ability to simulate the past climate it has been reported that both past and future climate can be considered in the identification of better performing gcms in the future a study can be conducted for the selection of gcms based on both past and future climate employing the methodologies detailed in johnson and sharma 2009 and lutz et al 2016 5 conclusions following major conclusions were derived from the study detailed in this paper 1 this study investigated the potential of the state of the art feature selection method known as su in ranking gcms for the identification of an ensemble of better performing gcms suitable for projection of multiple climate variables for different seasons the ranks of gcms produced by su for p tmax and tmin for annual monsoon and winter seasons were compared with the ranks obtained from two well established ranking approaches 1 cp and 2 wss the results revealed that despite some differences in the ranks of gcms in most of the cases su identified better performing gcms as identified by the other two approaches therefore it can be remarked that su has the capability to rank gcms like well established methods cp and wss unlike the application of cp and wss which involves a number of steps e g cp need the calculation of l p which requires information from a number of statistical parameters i e nrmse correlation skill score etc the application of su is relatively straightforward 2 for the simulation of p tmax and tmin for annual monsoon and winter seasons over pakistan cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and hadgem2 es were identified as the best gcms by su whereas cesm1 cam5 hadgem2 ao noresm1 m and gfdl cm3 were identified as the best gcms by cp and ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 gfdl esm2g and hadgem2 es were identified as the best gcms by wss the comparison of ranks of gcms obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given gcm this characteristic was probably due to the fact that all gridded data products are more or less derived from the same set of observations however the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data products but employing different ranking approaches this was because different ranking approaches assess different aspects of the model simulations e g wss assesses interannual variability and correlation whereas cp assesses nrmse correlation and skill score 3 the validation of the gcms and ensemble of better performing gcms identified from different ranking approaches revealed all gcms in general can capture return periods associated with moderate and severe droughts in the observed records however in general gcms showed difficulty in replicating the return period of extreme droughts the validation by comparison of the spatial patterns of observed p tmax and tmin during annual monsoon and winter season with those of gcms and their ensembles indicated more or less similar patterns confirming the suitability of ensemble members and their ensembles 4 it should be noted that the simulation skills of gcms vary from variable to variable from season to season from region to region as well as with the temporal scale of the data used the ensemble of gcms identified in this study is only valid for monthly p tmax and tmin during annual monsoon winter seasons over pakistan therefore caution should be practised in using the ensembles of gcms identified in this study in impact assessment exercises over other regions

6513,the lack of knowledge on precipitation frequency over ungauged areas introduces a significant source of uncertainty in relevant engineering designs and risk estimation procedures radar based observations offer precipitation information over ungauged areas and thus have gained increasing attention as a potential solution to this problem however due to their relative short data records and inherent uncertainty sources their ability to provide accurate estimates on the frequency of precipitation extremes requires evaluation this study involves the evaluation of at site precipitation frequency estimates from nexrad stage iv radar precipitation dataset we derive precipitation annual maxima series from the 16yrs record 2002 2017 of nexrad and we compare against 539 long term 50yrs hourly gauge records in addition intensity duration frequency idf curves are estimated from both radar and gauge dataset and compared idf estimation is based on fitting the generalize extreme value distribution to annual precipitation maxima evaluation is carried out over the contiguous united states and results are grouped and presented for five dominant climate classes and for a range of return period and precipitation durations nexrad was shown to overestimate intensities at shorter durations 1 and 3 h and low quantiles while it tends to underestimate higher quantiles at longer durations 24 h in addition evaluation of the idf curves estimated from nexrad revealed a distinct geographic dependence with certain regions exhibiting a tendency to overestimation e g east of the rocky mountains or underestimation midwest overall this analysis suggests that while significant discrepancies may exist there are several cases where nexrad provide estimates within the uncertainty bounds of the reference rain gauge dataset the climate geographic region and the temporal duration are important aspects to consider findings provided in this work on these aspects will hopefully serve as a general guideline for those interested in using nexrad estimates for further research or applications on precipitation extremes keywords nexrad precipitation extremes intensity duration frequency contiguous united states 1 introduction precipitation frequency analysis is an important topic within the field of water resources engineering with applications in flood risk mitigation drainage and storm water management and hydraulic structures design kleindorfer and kunreuther 1999 a practical way to describe precipitation frequency consists in the so called intensity duration frequency idf relationships at a given location idf curves directly relate the precipitation intensity averaged over a given duration to its probability of exceedance wurbs and james 2002 the common approach for deriving idf relationships requires the use of historical precipitation records and consists in the identification of a statistical distribution able to model the probabilities of exceedance observed in the past extreme value theory fischer and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 provides statistical bases supporting the use of the generalized extreme value gev distribution to model the annual maximum series ams and of the generalized pareto distribution to model the exceedances with respect to a sufficiently high threshold worldwide the derivation of idfs has most commonly used rain gauges as primary source of historical data fennessey 1998 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 libertino et al 2018 this is mainly motivated by their long reliable records for the united states in particular rain gauge data even for sub daily temporal resolutions which are generally rare compared to daily records can date back to 1948 perica et al 2013 however the idfs generated using rain gauges are only representative of the gauge scale individual rain gauges sample areas of 400 cm2 and the gauge location and immediate surrounding area therefore indirect information must be derived for greater areal scales e g hydrologic catchment or basin scale which is of particular interest for water resources applications sivapalan and bloschl 1998 and for regions in which the density of rain gauge networks is insufficient to adequately sample the climatological gradients marra and morin 2015 a body of research has been dedicated to the quantification of areal precipitation frequency by means of areal reduction factors arfs which are factors used to adjust the point based idf derived from rain gauges to the areal scale e g sivapalan and bloschl 1998 possibly including distributed information from weather radar systems e g durrans et al 2002 conversely the lack of information for ungauged regions remains largely unaddressed since the majority of the earth s land surface is underrepresented by rain gauges kidd et al 2017 and the possibility of extrapolating information from stations located in similar climatic conditions is limited marra and morin 2015 other sources of precipitation estimates should be explored weather radars are able to provide areal quantitative precipitation estimates qpe with continuous coverage over wide areas 106 km2 with fine spatial 0 5 4 km and temporal 5 10 min resolutions krajewski and smith 2002 this provides a possible alternative data source to rain gauges promising valuable applications for those areas lacking in situ stations and direct availability of areal scale estimates owing to these advantages the use of radar based qpes for idf estimation became an increasingly followed topic of research over the last decade e g overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 marra and morin 2015 panziera et al 2016 goudenhoofdt et al 2017 overall i systematic and random errors in radar qpe and ii short record length are recognized as the most important issues affecting the accuracy of radar based idf errors in radar qpe can have differing impacts on the estimated quantiles systematic underestimation often associated to radar estimates can be enhanced by the presence of conditional biases affecting the most extreme values and may translate into severe underestimation of the quantiles overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 large random errors usually characterize the data leading to an overestimation of the high quantiles owing to the increased dispersion marra and morin 2015 regionalization methods buishand 1991 or stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 were used to address the short record length issue substantially decreasing the uncertainty in the derived quantiles however such methods require strong homogeneity assumptions that become doubtful when wide areas are considered or when strong climatic gradients characterize the study area as a result so far these methods were only applied on relatively small areas characterized by homogeneous climatic conditions overeem et al 2009 wright et al 2013 eldardiry et al 2015 panziera et al 2016 goudenhoofdt et al 2017 the next generation radar nexrad network operated by the national weather service an agency of the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa covers the united states with 160 s band doppler weather radars for which radar precipitation estimation is based on a common algorithmic process and products are made publicly available fulton et al 1998 as such nexrad possesses high potential for the derivation of idf curves over the united states the first investigations attempted to utilize the spatial coverage of radar in generating arfs durrans et al 2002 allen and degaetano 2005 olivera et al 2008 more recently eldardiry et al 2015 investigated the use of nexrad data to derive idfs over louisiana focusing on the impact of errors in qpe short data record and regionalization methods short data record was highlighted as the main source of uncertainty with a significant contribution from systematic underestimation due to conditional bias this study expands on previous investigations on the use of nexrad data to compute sub daily to daily idfs in particular a comparative analysis between at site idfs derived from the nexrad stage iv product and from long recording rain gauges used as reference is carried out over the whole contiguous united states conus this involves extreme precipitation frequency analysis across a wide variety of climatic regions that present different extreme precipitation event characteristics brooks and stensrud 2000 hitchens et al 2013 marra and morin 2015 marra et al 2017 marra et al 2018 specific objectives of this study are a examining whether previous findings are consistent across a variety of climates b providing conus wide evaluation of nexrad based idf and c identifying those climatic areas in which nexrad based idf can potentially provide alternative information in case of poor or no rain gauge coverage the study area and datasets are presented in section 2 the methods used to compare the data and metrics used are described in section 3 the results of the analysis are presented and discussed in section 4 conclusions and suggestions for future research are provided in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study is focused on the contiguous united states due to the large extent of the area and to the wide variety of climatic conditions the koppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 was used to organize the analysis into climate classes fig 1 in particular five climatic classes are used 1 bs or steppe classification that covers the flat un forested land that is primarily east of the rocky mountains covering most of the great plains 2 cf or temperate classification covers mainly the southeastern united states that spans from part of texas to the chesapeake bay 3 cs or mediterranean classification is primarily the west coast of the country encompassing the entire coast of california 4 dfa cold areas with hot summers consisting of the central part of the united states encompassing the area east of the great plains to the atlantic coast and 5 dfb cold areas with warm summers spanning all new england as well as a small patch of the appalachian mountains 2 2 rain gauge data the rain gauge data were obtained from the cooperative observers program hourly precipitation dataset of noaa national centers for environmental information 2017 this dataset contains data from 1920 stations covering the conus with varying record lengths some dating back to 1948 in addition to the quality check done by noaa the authors conducted further quality control on the data in particular years with less than 80 of available hours were excluded marra et al 2018 and stations with less than 50 years of record were removed from the dataset the phillips perron test phillips and perron 1988 was then applied to check stationarity of the annual maxima series for 1 and 24 hour durations and only gauges that were not rejected at a 0 1 significance level were included in the analysis marra et al 2017 after implementing those procedures a total of 539 gauges belonging to the five dominant climate classes were selected for this study fig 1 specifically the distribution of gauges per climate class is as follows bs steppe 139 gauges cf temperate 88 gauges cs mediterranean 53 gauges dfa cold hot summer 140 gauges and dfb cold warm summer 119 gauges 2 3 radar data the nexrad stage iv product is the radar precipitation dataset used in this study stage iv is a nationally mosaicked quality controlled and gauge adjusted product covering the conus and produced regionally by the 12 river forecast centers lin and mitchell 2005 the 16 years stage iv archive 2002 2017 characterized by hourly precipitation estimates at 4 km resolution is used in the study 3 methods radar precipitation time series for the 539 pixels collocated to the selected rain gauges were extracted for the analyses the comparative analysis of precipitation extremes from radar and gauge estimates focuses on 5 durations 1 3 6 12 and 24 h as underlined the application of regionalization methods requires prior knowledge on the characteristics of extreme precipitation which is generally unavailable over ungauged areas the analysis is thus limited to at site applications meaning that each rain gauge and each corresponding radar pixel is treated independently the analysis is divided into a two step evaluation first a comparison of empirical quantiles of annual maxima series at the durations of interest is performed and second a comparison between idfs derived from nexrad stage iv and the corresponding rain gauge data is carried out results of the analyses are presented and examined based on the above defined climate classes in order to identify possible links between climatic conditions and nexrad performance three data analyzed included a the full 50 year rain gauge record referred to as long record gauge lrg that served as the baseline for evaluation b a shortened rain gauge record srg obtained using only the last 16 years of available gauge data thus matching the nexrad s record length and c the nexrad stage iv data record referred to as nexrad it should be noted that due to the scale mismatch between rain gauges 400 cm2 and nexrad pixels 16 km2 differences in the precipitation estimates and in the estimated quantiles are to be expected even in case of perfect measurement from both instruments peleg et al 2018 in general radar scale quantiles are expected to represent smoother area averaged values than point scale from here the concept of arfs but both under and over estimation are to be expected as possible outcome owing to the natural small scale variability of precipitation the interested reader is referred to peleg et al 2018 for additional details on this issue 3 1 ams quantile comparison as an initial step the distribution of annual maxima series ams from the data sources were qualitatively assessed the ams for 1 3 6 12 and 24 hour durations were extracted from the three sources and the corresponding empirical distributions were compared using quantile quantile plots nexrad and srg were compared against reference lrg with the aim of a assessing how nexrad estimates compare to the baseline nexrad vs lrg performance and b providing a realization of the expected discrepancies due to sub sampling srg vs lrg to group results from all sites within a climate class ams quantiles were normalized with their corresponding average ams value a quantitative comparison was then carried out to determine the bias expressed as ratio of nexrad or srg over lrg in the estimation of ams quantiles focusing on the 5th 95th and average ams values 3 2 idf estimation method the pot approach of extreme value theory is commonly believed to provide improved quantile estimates in presence of short data records however the selection of the threshold is non trivial when automatic methods are required langousis et al 2016 particularly when dealing with diverse climatic conditions and when possible applications to distributed datasets are foreseen in addition to this recent studies showed that the uncertainties related to the use of short records with pot and ams approaches are practically indistinguishable schlögl and laaha 2017 marra et al 2018 consequently we based our analyses on the more straightforward ams approach and used the generalized extreme value gev distribution to model the exceedances this distribution was recommended by several past studies gellens 2002 fowler and kilsby 2003 overeem et al 2008 eldardiry et al 2015 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 particularly over conus perica et al 2015 noaa atlas 14 http www nws noaa gov oh hdsc currentpf htm the gev cumulative distribution function described by the

1990 this method provides improved estimates of the parameters in presence of short data records such as in this study and is less sensitive to outliers with respect to the maximum likelihood method martins and stedinger 2000 the distribution was then used to derive the precipitation intensity quantiles for 2 5 15 25 50 and 100 year return periods 3 3 reference values and relative uncertainty the bootstrap method proposed by overeem et al 2008 was used to quantify the sampling uncertainty of the reference values i e the ones derived from the full rain gauge records as a basis for comparison with the srg and nexrar derived idfs for a given gauge with full record length equal to m ams values m values were sampled with replacement from the full records and the idf values were derived as described above the process was iterated 1000 times for each station and the median was considered as the baseline for the idf comparison and the 5th and 95th bounds were used to characterize the confidence interval 3 4 idf evaluation metrics to evaluate the accuracy of idfs estimated using srg and nexrad two main metrics were used in this study the exceedance ratio rex and relative idf difference δ the exceedance ratio eq 2 is defined as the fraction of times the estimated srg or nexrad quantiles exceed the reference confidence bounds 2 r ex n ex n it is computed as a function of return period duration and climate class and therefore nex corresponds to number of radar pixels or gauges for which nexrad or srg estimated quantiles exceeded reference confidence bounds and n corresponds to the total number of radar gauge pairs considered in each climate class the closer the rex value is to zero the better with rex 0 rex 1 indicating that all the quantiles are within outside the reference confidence interval the relative idf difference is defined as the difference between nexrad or srg and reference idf relative to the uncertainty in the reference idf 3 δ i estimate i reference 1 2 i 95 i 5 for a given return period and duration i estimate is intensity from nexrad or srg and i reference is the median intensity the i 5 a n d i 95 correspond to the 5th and 95th intensity values from lrg a value δ 0 indicates that nexrad idf is equal to reference i e median estimate of long record gauge idf while a positive negative δ indicates overestimation underestimation of nexrad idf relative to the reference an illustrative example is shown in fig 2 in fig 2a nexrad idf largely exceeds the reference uncertainty bounds and therefore rex 1 and δ 1 for all return periods in fig 2b rex 1 and δ varies from almost zero at low return periods to values 1 for higher return periods 4 results and discussion this section presents and discusses the results of the analysis the evaluation of ams quantiles comparison is presented in section 4 1 and the comparison of nexrad stage iv and gauge derived idfs in section 4 2 4 1 evaluation of ams quantiles fig 3 shows the quantile quantile plots of ams from nexrad and srg against the reference for the various climate classes for 1 h duration all the climate classes except cs show similar behaviors between srg and nexrad suggesting general agreement in the ams empirical distribution of nexrad and srg datasets note that comparison between srg and lrg provides a realization of the expected discrepancy in the representation of empirical quantiles due to sub sampling of the population on the other hand disagreement between the nexrad and srg results indicates the impact of discrepancies between nexrad qpe and gauge estimates that can be attributed as previously mentioned to retrieval errors and or spatial scale mismatch between the two see nelson et al 2016 for a more detailed evaluation of nexrad qpe with this in mind a distinct feature of fig 3 is the inconsistency of nexrad based ams quantiles for the mediterranean climate cs region in western us results for the cs climate zone exhibit the problems faced due to errors in the radar quantitative precipitation estimates in the west coast of the united states and areas of complex terrain a known problem with the nexrad observations and precipitation products westrick et al 1999 both the cf and dfa climates display comparable distributions of intensities in particular the medians of these distributions in general the nexrad based density plots tend to exhibit a wider scatter with respect to srg which varied among different climate groups and depends on the considered quantile to better analyze magnitude dependence of the discrepancies the ratio of quantiles was calculated for the low 5th quantile q5 mean and high 95th quantile q95 quantile values between nexrad srg and reference quantiles fig 4 a number of points can be derived from these results with respect to the dependence of the observed differences on record length precipitation magnitude and climate first for the low magnitude of ams values q5 there is a distinct difference between srg and nexrad based ratio values especially for 1 h duration nexrad based estimates tend to overestimate 1 q5 values relative to reference while short gauge tend to underestimate 1 this difference between nexrad and srg patterns tends to reduce with increasing duration except for the cs climate group that is consistently associated with large discrepancies results for increasing quantiles generally improve for both srg and nexrad results where median values of boxplots tend to align on the value of 1 however certain climate groups like dfa and dfb exhibited significant variability manifested as length of boxplot whiskers which increased for higher quantiles indicating increasing discrepancy on the extremes of ams values considering that a similar pattern is not observed for the srf results of the same climate groups this is a clear indication of the increasing uncertainty in radar qpe of extremes for these climates results from srg suggest that differences in record length have a profound effect on the high overestimation and low underestimation end of the ams quantiles 4 2 comparison of idf estimates fig 5 presents the exceedance ratios of nexrad and srg exceedance ratios of nexrad idfs overall ranging between 50 and 60 are systematically higher than the ones of the srg idfs overall 30 40 this suggests that a large degree of the discrepancy in nexrad radar idf is associated to the impact of record length on the estimation but at the same time attribution to differences in radar and gauge qpe is also important variability of exceedance ratios among climate groups at the order of 10 is evident in both nexrad and srg consistently to the results on ams results on idfs for the cs group are also poor highlighting the low performance of the nexrad qpe in this region results remained rather stable for the different return periods examined with an exception for the lowest 5 yr period for nexrad rex where for cf region values for 1 h duration were as high as 68 and for increasing duration the different climate classes were distinguished in two main groups bs dfb and cs dfa fig 6 presents the δ values for nexrad and srg for various durations and return periods note that the horizontal blue lines represent the bounds within which an estimate nexrad or srg is between half of the confidence interval 5th 95th from the reference results for srg fig 6b d f h are generally consistent for different durations and return periods with the interquartile ranges the boxes in boxplots been well within the 1 to 1 range extension of whiskers outside the 1 to 1 range are expected given the exceedance ratios results results for nexrad δ fig 6a c e g exhibit significantly higher variability among climate groups with the different boxplots oscillating within the 1 to 1 range for most of the cases an exception as expected is the cs climate class where apart from the large discrepancy the values ranged from underestimation of low quantiles to overestimation for the rest of the quantiles examined another notable feature is the dependence of δ on duration in the dfb climate class in fact for 1 h duration the boxplot for dfb is well above 1 indicating considerable overestimation and as duration increases the variance reduces significantly in table 1 we report the percentage of nexrad based δ values falling within the 1 to 1 range for the different duration return periods and climate classes the primary purpose of providing this table is to summarize findings from fig 6a c e g and provide an overall mapping of nexrad based idf comparison for the various cases based on table 1 one can quickly recognize that comparison of nexrad based idf is poor for cs climate region and it is best for cf and dfa particularly for higher durations the results presented above gave an indication of the nexrad based idf estimates for the major climate regions of conus however while it is clear that idf discrepancies are directly related to the quality of radar qpe it is important to note that part of the differences presented in these results should also be attributed to the scale mismatch between radar pixel i e areal estimate and gauge point estimate peleg et al 2018 found that the subpixel variability of precipitation extreme values increased with longer return periods and shorter durations confirming the idea that short but very intense storms had the largest amount of sub grid variability the referenced study used weather radar with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 as previously mentioned the nexrad stage iv product has a resolution of 16 km2 due to the amount of area covered and the subpixel variability that exists the nexrad based ams values may differ and the degree of point to area average precipitation representativeness is also expected to depend on climate with areas dominated by short duration high intensity precipitation further emphasizing the scale mismatch observation of the spatial distribution of the δ values reported in fig 7 allows us to better understand the geographical pattern of the performance of nexrad based idf estimates overall the qualitative distribution of the δ values is rather consistent for return periods ranging from 5 to 100 years in some regions e g the midwest there is a number of cases where results improve from triangles become circles in fig 7 from 5 to 100 years return period this probably reflects the cases where the uncertainty characterizing longer return periods increases significantly relative to the uncertainty in lower return periods in other words the δ value seems to improve reduce in absolute sense because it is dominated by the uncertainty i e denominator of eq 3 on the west coast characterized by cs climate and less accurate radar coverage due to complex topography numerous nexrad gauge pairs exhibited δ values outside the 1 to 1 range this situation also involves other regions in which the classification is rather complex due to topography see e g results close to rocky mountains in the midwest clusters of stations with a majority of underestimated quantiles δ 1 are observed particularly in dfa finally as already shown in fig 6 regions classified as bs generally drier are characterized by a tendency towards overestimation of the quantiles δ 1 which also confirms previous findings based on arid areas marra and morin 2015 5 conclusions this study expanded on previous radar based extreme precipitation analysis studies by evaluating the potential use of nexrad stage iv data to derive sub daily idfs over conus based on the assessment of ams quantiles from nexrad and rain gauge data sources nexrad was shown to overestimate intensities at shorter durations 1 and 3 h and low quantiles while it tends to underestimate higher quantiles at longer durations 24 h in fact short duration extremes are subject to large estimation uncertainties that are partially smoothed out by the temporal averaging of long durations as highlighted by marra and morin 2015 large estimation uncertainties increase the variance of the data sample thus leading to overestimation of the high quantiles discrepancies in both low q5 and high q95 ams quantiles depend considerable on the record length as it was revealed by the comparison between srg and lrg same results demonstrate also that the variability in those discrepancies exhibits temporal and climatic dependence with certain climate classes e g bs being associated with much higher variability than others e g cs exceedance ratio was generally 40 60 for nexrad and around 40 for srg based idf this indicates that around 50 of the time the nexrad based idf values were exceeding over or under the reference uncertainty bounds however with increasing duration the bs cf dfa and dfb climate zones exhibit a reduction in exceedance which is corroborated also by the reduction in δ values i e reduction in size of boxplots with increasing duration additionally the geographic distribution of δ values reveals regions with a tendency to overestimation e g east of the rocky mountains or underestimation midwest overall the nexrad derived idf s in the cs climate were systematically exceeding the uncertainty bounds i e δ 1 or δ 1 for all durations at all return periods which explains why in all included evaluation metrics the cs red in the figures appeared to be problematic this can be expected based on previous research that demonstrated challenges faced by nexrad in complex terrain areas primarily due to beam blockage and beam overshooting national research council 2005 bales et al 2006 results from this work provide an overview of nexrad stage iv precipitation product s performance for estimating extreme precipitation frequency in different climate regions of conus the evidence from this analysis suggests that while significant discrepancies may exist there are several cases where nexrad provides estimates within the uncertainty bounds of the reference rain gauge dataset the climate geographic region and the temporal duration are important aspects to consider results provided in this work on these aspects will hopefully serve as a general guideline for those interested in using nexrad estimates for further research or application of precipitation extremes finally the relatively short record length in conjunction with the use of the gev approach merits further investigation future research on this should focus on alternative approaches such as the metastatistical extreme value marani and ignaccolo 2015 or multifractal based approaches langousis and veneziano 2007 that have shown to provide robust estimates of extreme precipitation from short records and data subject to measurement errors

6513,the lack of knowledge on precipitation frequency over ungauged areas introduces a significant source of uncertainty in relevant engineering designs and risk estimation procedures radar based observations offer precipitation information over ungauged areas and thus have gained increasing attention as a potential solution to this problem however due to their relative short data records and inherent uncertainty sources their ability to provide accurate estimates on the frequency of precipitation extremes requires evaluation this study involves the evaluation of at site precipitation frequency estimates from nexrad stage iv radar precipitation dataset we derive precipitation annual maxima series from the 16yrs record 2002 2017 of nexrad and we compare against 539 long term 50yrs hourly gauge records in addition intensity duration frequency idf curves are estimated from both radar and gauge dataset and compared idf estimation is based on fitting the generalize extreme value distribution to annual precipitation maxima evaluation is carried out over the contiguous united states and results are grouped and presented for five dominant climate classes and for a range of return period and precipitation durations nexrad was shown to overestimate intensities at shorter durations 1 and 3 h and low quantiles while it tends to underestimate higher quantiles at longer durations 24 h in addition evaluation of the idf curves estimated from nexrad revealed a distinct geographic dependence with certain regions exhibiting a tendency to overestimation e g east of the rocky mountains or underestimation midwest overall this analysis suggests that while significant discrepancies may exist there are several cases where nexrad provide estimates within the uncertainty bounds of the reference rain gauge dataset the climate geographic region and the temporal duration are important aspects to consider findings provided in this work on these aspects will hopefully serve as a general guideline for those interested in using nexrad estimates for further research or applications on precipitation extremes keywords nexrad precipitation extremes intensity duration frequency contiguous united states 1 introduction precipitation frequency analysis is an important topic within the field of water resources engineering with applications in flood risk mitigation drainage and storm water management and hydraulic structures design kleindorfer and kunreuther 1999 a practical way to describe precipitation frequency consists in the so called intensity duration frequency idf relationships at a given location idf curves directly relate the precipitation intensity averaged over a given duration to its probability of exceedance wurbs and james 2002 the common approach for deriving idf relationships requires the use of historical precipitation records and consists in the identification of a statistical distribution able to model the probabilities of exceedance observed in the past extreme value theory fischer and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 provides statistical bases supporting the use of the generalized extreme value gev distribution to model the annual maximum series ams and of the generalized pareto distribution to model the exceedances with respect to a sufficiently high threshold worldwide the derivation of idfs has most commonly used rain gauges as primary source of historical data fennessey 1998 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 libertino et al 2018 this is mainly motivated by their long reliable records for the united states in particular rain gauge data even for sub daily temporal resolutions which are generally rare compared to daily records can date back to 1948 perica et al 2013 however the idfs generated using rain gauges are only representative of the gauge scale individual rain gauges sample areas of 400 cm2 and the gauge location and immediate surrounding area therefore indirect information must be derived for greater areal scales e g hydrologic catchment or basin scale which is of particular interest for water resources applications sivapalan and bloschl 1998 and for regions in which the density of rain gauge networks is insufficient to adequately sample the climatological gradients marra and morin 2015 a body of research has been dedicated to the quantification of areal precipitation frequency by means of areal reduction factors arfs which are factors used to adjust the point based idf derived from rain gauges to the areal scale e g sivapalan and bloschl 1998 possibly including distributed information from weather radar systems e g durrans et al 2002 conversely the lack of information for ungauged regions remains largely unaddressed since the majority of the earth s land surface is underrepresented by rain gauges kidd et al 2017 and the possibility of extrapolating information from stations located in similar climatic conditions is limited marra and morin 2015 other sources of precipitation estimates should be explored weather radars are able to provide areal quantitative precipitation estimates qpe with continuous coverage over wide areas 106 km2 with fine spatial 0 5 4 km and temporal 5 10 min resolutions krajewski and smith 2002 this provides a possible alternative data source to rain gauges promising valuable applications for those areas lacking in situ stations and direct availability of areal scale estimates owing to these advantages the use of radar based qpes for idf estimation became an increasingly followed topic of research over the last decade e g overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 marra and morin 2015 panziera et al 2016 goudenhoofdt et al 2017 overall i systematic and random errors in radar qpe and ii short record length are recognized as the most important issues affecting the accuracy of radar based idf errors in radar qpe can have differing impacts on the estimated quantiles systematic underestimation often associated to radar estimates can be enhanced by the presence of conditional biases affecting the most extreme values and may translate into severe underestimation of the quantiles overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 large random errors usually characterize the data leading to an overestimation of the high quantiles owing to the increased dispersion marra and morin 2015 regionalization methods buishand 1991 or stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 were used to address the short record length issue substantially decreasing the uncertainty in the derived quantiles however such methods require strong homogeneity assumptions that become doubtful when wide areas are considered or when strong climatic gradients characterize the study area as a result so far these methods were only applied on relatively small areas characterized by homogeneous climatic conditions overeem et al 2009 wright et al 2013 eldardiry et al 2015 panziera et al 2016 goudenhoofdt et al 2017 the next generation radar nexrad network operated by the national weather service an agency of the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa covers the united states with 160 s band doppler weather radars for which radar precipitation estimation is based on a common algorithmic process and products are made publicly available fulton et al 1998 as such nexrad possesses high potential for the derivation of idf curves over the united states the first investigations attempted to utilize the spatial coverage of radar in generating arfs durrans et al 2002 allen and degaetano 2005 olivera et al 2008 more recently eldardiry et al 2015 investigated the use of nexrad data to derive idfs over louisiana focusing on the impact of errors in qpe short data record and regionalization methods short data record was highlighted as the main source of uncertainty with a significant contribution from systematic underestimation due to conditional bias this study expands on previous investigations on the use of nexrad data to compute sub daily to daily idfs in particular a comparative analysis between at site idfs derived from the nexrad stage iv product and from long recording rain gauges used as reference is carried out over the whole contiguous united states conus this involves extreme precipitation frequency analysis across a wide variety of climatic regions that present different extreme precipitation event characteristics brooks and stensrud 2000 hitchens et al 2013 marra and morin 2015 marra et al 2017 marra et al 2018 specific objectives of this study are a examining whether previous findings are consistent across a variety of climates b providing conus wide evaluation of nexrad based idf and c identifying those climatic areas in which nexrad based idf can potentially provide alternative information in case of poor or no rain gauge coverage the study area and datasets are presented in section 2 the methods used to compare the data and metrics used are described in section 3 the results of the analysis are presented and discussed in section 4 conclusions and suggestions for future research are provided in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study is focused on the contiguous united states due to the large extent of the area and to the wide variety of climatic conditions the koppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 was used to organize the analysis into climate classes fig 1 in particular five climatic classes are used 1 bs or steppe classification that covers the flat un forested land that is primarily east of the rocky mountains covering most of the great plains 2 cf or temperate classification covers mainly the southeastern united states that spans from part of texas to the chesapeake bay 3 cs or mediterranean classification is primarily the west coast of the country encompassing the entire coast of california 4 dfa cold areas with hot summers consisting of the central part of the united states encompassing the area east of the great plains to the atlantic coast and 5 dfb cold areas with warm summers spanning all new england as well as a small patch of the appalachian mountains 2 2 rain gauge data the rain gauge data were obtained from the cooperative observers program hourly precipitation dataset of noaa national centers for environmental information 2017 this dataset contains data from 1920 stations covering the conus with varying record lengths some dating back to 1948 in addition to the quality check done by noaa the authors conducted further quality control on the data in particular years with less than 80 of available hours were excluded marra et al 2018 and stations with less than 50 years of record were removed from the dataset the phillips perron test phillips and perron 1988 was then applied to check stationarity of the annual maxima series for 1 and 24 hour durations and only gauges that were not rejected at a 0 1 significance level were included in the analysis marra et al 2017 after implementing those procedures a total of 539 gauges belonging to the five dominant climate classes were selected for this study fig 1 specifically the distribution of gauges per climate class is as follows bs steppe 139 gauges cf temperate 88 gauges cs mediterranean 53 gauges dfa cold hot summer 140 gauges and dfb cold warm summer 119 gauges 2 3 radar data the nexrad stage iv product

and gauge estimates that can be attributed as previously mentioned to retrieval errors and or spatial scale mismatch between the two see nelson et al 2016 for a more detailed evaluation of nexrad qpe with this in mind a distinct feature of fig 3 is the inconsistency of nexrad based ams quantiles for the mediterranean climate cs region in western us results for the cs climate zone exhibit the problems faced due to errors in the radar quantitative precipitation estimates in the west coast of the united states and areas of complex terrain a known problem with the nexrad observations and precipitation products westrick et al 1999 both the cf and dfa climates display comparable distributions of intensities in particular the medians of these distributions in general the nexrad based density plots tend to exhibit a wider scatter with respect to srg which varied among different climate groups and depends on the considered quantile to better analyze magnitude dependence of the discrepancies the ratio of quantiles was calculated for the low 5th quantile q5 mean and high 95th quantile q95 quantile values between nexrad srg and reference quantiles fig 4 a number of points can be derived from these results with respect to the dependence of the observed differences on record length precipitation magnitude and climate first for the low magnitude of ams values q5 there is a distinct difference between srg and nexrad based ratio values especially for 1 h duration nexrad based estimates tend to overestimate 1 q5 values relative to reference while short gauge tend to underestimate 1 this difference between nexrad and srg patterns tends to reduce with increasing duration except for the cs climate group that is consistently associated with large discrepancies results for increasing quantiles generally improve for both srg and nexrad results where median values of boxplots tend to align on the value of 1 however certain climate groups like dfa and dfb exhibited significant variability manifested as length of boxplot whiskers which increased for higher quantiles indicating increasing discrepancy on the extremes of ams values considering that a similar pattern is not observed for the srf results of the same climate groups this is a clear indication of the increasing uncertainty in radar qpe of extremes for these climates results from srg suggest that differences in record length have a profound effect on the high overestimation and low underestimation end of the ams quantiles 4 2 comparison of idf estimates fig 5 presents the exceedance ratios of nexrad and srg exceedance ratios of nexrad idfs overall ranging between 50 and 60 are systematically higher than the ones of the srg idfs overall 30 40 this suggests that a large degree of the discrepancy in nexrad radar idf is associated to the impact of record length on the estimation but at the same time attribution to differences in radar and gauge qpe is also important variability of exceedance ratios among climate groups at the order of 10 is evident in both nexrad and srg consistently to the results on ams results on idfs for the cs group are also poor highlighting the low performance of the nexrad qpe in this region results remained rather stable for the different return periods examined with an exception for the lowest 5 yr period for nexrad rex where for cf region values for 1 h duration were as high as 68 and for increasing duration the different climate classes were distinguished in two main groups bs dfb and cs dfa fig 6 presents the δ values for nexrad and srg for various durations and return periods note that the horizontal blue lines represent the bounds within which an estimate nexrad or srg is between half of the confidence interval 5th 95th from the reference results for srg fig 6b d f h are generally consistent for different durations and return periods with the interquartile ranges the boxes in boxplots been well within the 1 to 1 range extension of whiskers outside the 1 to 1 range are expected given the exceedance ratios results results for nexrad δ fig 6a c e g exhibit significantly higher variability among climate groups with the different boxplots oscillating within the 1 to 1 range for most of the cases an exception as expected is the cs climate class where apart from the large discrepancy the values ranged from underestimation of low quantiles to overestimation for the rest of the quantiles examined another notable feature is the dependence of δ on duration in the dfb climate class in fact for 1 h duration the boxplot for dfb is well above 1 indicating considerable overestimation and as duration increases the variance reduces significantly in table 1 we report the percentage of nexrad based δ values falling within the 1 to 1 range for the different duration return periods and climate classes the primary purpose of providing this table is to summarize findings from fig 6a c e g and provide an overall mapping of nexrad based idf comparison for the various cases based on table 1 one can quickly recognize that comparison of nexrad based idf is poor for cs climate region and it is best for cf and dfa particularly for higher durations the results presented above gave an indication of the nexrad based idf estimates for the major climate regions of conus however while it is clear that idf discrepancies are directly related to the quality of radar qpe it is important to note that part of the differences presented in these results should also be attributed to the scale mismatch between radar pixel i e areal estimate and gauge point estimate peleg et al 2018 found that the subpixel variability of precipitation extreme values increased with longer return periods and shorter durations confirming the idea that short but very intense storms had the largest amount of sub grid variability the referenced study used weather radar with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 as previously mentioned the nexrad stage iv product has a resolution of 16 km2 due to the amount of area covered and the subpixel variability that exists the nexrad based ams values may differ and the degree of point to area average precipitation representativeness is also expected to depend on climate with areas dominated by short duration high intensity precipitation further emphasizing the scale mismatch observation of the spatial distribution of the δ values reported in fig 7 allows us to better understand the geographical pattern of the performance of nexrad based idf estimates overall the qualitative distribution of the δ values is rather consistent for return periods ranging from 5 to 100 years in some regions e g the midwest there is a number of cases where results improve from triangles become circles in fig 7 from 5 to 100 years return period this probably reflects the cases where the uncertainty characterizing longer return periods increases significantly relative to the uncertainty in lower return periods in other words the δ value seems to improve reduce in absolute sense because it is dominated by the uncertainty i e denominator of eq 3 on the west coast characterized by cs climate and less accurate radar coverage due to complex topography numerous nexrad gauge pairs exhibited δ values outside the 1 to 1 range this situation also involves other regions in which the classification is rather complex due to topography see e g results close to rocky mountains in the midwest clusters of stations with a majority of underestimated quantiles δ 1 are observed particularly in dfa finally as already shown in fig 6 regions classified as bs generally drier are characterized by a tendency towards overestimation of the quantiles δ 1 which also confirms previous findings based on arid areas marra and morin 2015 5 conclusions this study expanded on previous radar based extreme precipitation analysis studies by evaluating the potential use of nexrad stage iv data to derive sub daily idfs over conus based on the assessment of ams quantiles from nexrad and rain gauge data sources nexrad was shown to overestimate intensities at shorter durations 1 and 3 h and low quantiles while it tends to underestimate higher quantiles at longer durations 24 h in fact short duration extremes are subject to large estimation uncertainties that are partially smoothed out by the temporal averaging of long durations as highlighted by marra and morin 2015 large estimation uncertainties increase the variance of the data sample thus leading to overestimation of the high quantiles discrepancies in both low q5 and high q95 ams quantiles depend considerable on the record length as it was revealed by the comparison between srg and lrg same results demonstrate also that the variability in those discrepancies exhibits temporal and climatic dependence with certain climate classes e g bs being associated with much higher variability than others e g cs exceedance ratio was generally 40 60 for nexrad and around 40 for srg based idf this indicates that around 50 of the time the nexrad based idf values were exceeding over or under the reference uncertainty bounds however with increasing duration the bs cf dfa and dfb climate zones exhibit a reduction in exceedance which is corroborated also by the reduction in δ values i e reduction in size of boxplots with increasing duration additionally the geographic distribution of δ values reveals regions with a tendency to overestimation e g east of the rocky mountains or underestimation midwest overall the nexrad derived idf s in the cs climate were systematically exceeding the uncertainty bounds i e δ 1 or δ 1 for all durations at all return periods which explains why in all included evaluation metrics the cs red in the figures appeared to be problematic this can be expected based on previous research that demonstrated challenges faced by nexrad in complex terrain areas primarily due to beam blockage and beam overshooting national research council 2005 bales et al 2006 results from this work provide an overview of nexrad stage iv precipitation product s performance for estimating extreme precipitation frequency in different climate regions of conus the evidence from this analysis suggests that while significant discrepancies may exist there are several cases where nexrad provides estimates within the uncertainty bounds of the reference rain gauge dataset the climate geographic region and the temporal duration are important aspects to consider results provided in this work on these aspects will hopefully serve as a general guideline for those interested in using nexrad estimates for further research or application of precipitation extremes finally the relatively short record length in conjunction with the use of the gev approach merits further investigation future research on this should focus on alternative approaches such as the metastatistical extreme value marani and ignaccolo 2015 or multifractal based approaches langousis and veneziano 2007 that have shown to provide robust estimates of extreme precipitation from short records and data subject to measurement errors

in the area van tu et al 2016 floods also have an effect on the geo environment through the transportion of chemicals and other hazardous industrial wastes that can contaminate surface and subsurface waters as well as agricultural lands over the past two decades the worldwide frequency of floods has increased by over 40 hirabayashi et al 2013 in fact between 1995 and 2015 roughly 109 million people were affected by floods with damages reaching up to us 75 billion per year alfieri et al 2017 floods can have both natural and anthropogenic causes chang and chen 2016 with climate change being

rainfall between the period of april to june this increased rainfall has led to flooding in many parts of the ningdu county report of the ningdu county government http www ningdu gov cn changing rainfall patterns in general have been tied to an increase in anthropogenic activities which have been deemed responsible for the increased frequency of flooding zhang et al 2018 given the impact on human life floods can have an extreme effect on a region s socioeconomic health accordingly appropriate action is required to mitigate flood hazards many different approaches have been used to predict the many different aspects of flood phenomena one of the first approaches used was the statistical correlation of flood characteristics to the physical properties of watersheds wheater et al 1993 more recently conceptual and physically based models have been used for flood prediction in many parts of the world solomatine and ostfeld 2008 however generation of flood maps remains a major challenge khosravi et al 2016a khosravi et al 2016b given the inherent complexity of watersheds floods cannot be modelled using simple nonlinear models in recent years however data driven models including

having reviewed 128 papers employing mcdm methods de brito and evers 2016 found that the analytic hierarchy process ahp was the most widespread mcdm method but concluded that other mcdm methods should be tested recently de brito et al 2018 applied the ahp and analytic network process anp to flood vulnerability assessment and mapping in brazil the authors noted that due to dependences among criteria the anp had greater predictive power than the ahp these new approaches have demonstrated many advantages including i that compared to physically based models they do not require a great deal of detailed information regarding watershed characteristics and ii that these models generally achieved high prediction accuracy abedini et al 2018 dou et al 2015 pham et al 2018c the developement of new individual and hybrid models however is still necessary to increase the accuracy of modelled parameters according to the literature several bivariate mcdm and ml models have been applied to flood susceptibility mapping however of all the papers consulted no universal guidelines were found to exist regarding the assessement of the predictive power of these models moreover research has shown that all models have their own advantages and disadvantages consequently a range of models must first be applied to a given area and only after an assessment of the models predictive power can one be selected for use khosravi et al 2018 the present study sought to introduce and compare the predictive power of several novel models based on mcdm techniques and ml techniques for the spatial

2018a pham et al 2018d a flood inventory map of ningdu county was prepared using available data from 166 flood events supplied by the chinese academy of science fig 1 using gps the locations of flood events were validated from records of flood level marker posts and through extensive field surveys the flood data was randomly divided into two groups using a 7 3 ratio to construct the model 70 of the flood and non flood locations were used whereas the remaining 30 of flood and non flood locations were used to generate the testing dataset in order to validate the models 3 2 flood conditioning factors a flood s magnitude depends on rainfall intensity and duration meteorological factors and catchment characteristics including topography vegetation and soil characteristics also have an affect on flood susceptibility in the present study 12 flood conditioning factors in conjunction with the catchment s geo environmental characteristics were initially considered for flood susceptibility

land cover and lithology were classified using a standard classification scheme de moel and aerts 2011 tehrany et al 2014 termeh et al 2018 4 methods two main techniques were used to develop flood susceptibility models the first technique multiple criteria decision making mcdm ormultiple criteria decision analysis mcda evaluates multiple conflictingcriteriaindecision making the vikor topsis and saw methods were applied for the development of the models the second technique looks at ml methods specifically using the naive bayes tree nbt and naive bayes nb classifiers 4 1 multiple criteria decision making mcdm techniques each conditioning factor was first converted to stretch raster format with a 30 m 30 m pixel size distance from the river and other similar distances were calculated using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 2 this format consists of several columns and rows for each factor resulting in a single matrix the required steps for each model were then performed resulting in data that was used for flood susceptibility mapping finally all factors were normalized between 0 and 1 using the proper fuzzy membership function in arcgis 10 2 to reduce any biases stemming from expert judgment 4 1 1 vise kriterijumska optimizacijaik ompromisno resenje vikor the vikor method developed by duckstein and opricovic 1980 is one of the most popular mcdm methods for the optimization of complex systems it is used to identify the compromise ranking list and solution and is also used to weight stability intervals this method introduces a multicriteria ranking index that is nearest to the ideal opricovic and tzeng 2004 the alternatives are then evaluated according to the established criteria chitsaz and banihabib 2015 opricovic and tzeng 2004 4 1 2 technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis the topsis method presented by ching and yoon 1981 is based on the euclidean distance between decision making alternatives ameri et al 2018 chitsaz and banihabib 2015 it was developed to solve decision making problems consisting of conflicting and non commensurable criteria in this method the ranking of alternatives is based on 1 the shortest distance from the ideal solution and 2 the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution jozaghi et al 2018 opricovic and tzeng 2004 4 1 3 simple additive weighting saw the saw technique introduced by fishburn 1967 is based on weighted averages jain and raj 2013 an evaluation score is first calculated for each alternative by multiplying the scaled value given to the alternative of a given attribute with the weighted importance assigned by decision makers products for all criteria are then summed pourkhabbaz et al 2014 the advantage of this method is that it is a proportional linear transformation of the raw data this means that the relative order of magnitude of the standardized scores remains equal jain and raj 2013 4 2 machine learning ml algorithms in order to obtain the highest prediction performance using ml methods an optimum value of each operator for the proposed models is determined using trial and error method by using proper conditioning factors the nbt and nb models were built and validated using training and validation datasets furthermore these models were constructed and run using a batch size of 100 with two decimal places a 10 fold cross validation method was used to prevent over fitting 4 2 1 naive bayes tree nbt nbt classifiers generally used for solving classification problems can improve upon the performance of other individual classifiers such as naïve bayes nb and decision tree dt kohavi 1996 one of the main assumptions of the nbt is that the class conditional independence factor s does not show a correlation between the values of the conditioning factor shirzadi et al 2017 for each pixel in the leaves the computation of posterior probability proceeds as follows chen et al 2017 kohavi 1996 pham et al 2016 i after creating the tree and following its growth pre pruning occurs ii to segment the data univariate splits are made of each node as a normal dt classifier and iii a given instance is classified using the following classification rule eq 5 kohavi 1996 5 c arg max c j c p c j s 1 s 1 s n p c j i 1 n p s i c j j 1 m p c j i 1 n p s i c j μ arg max p c j c j c i 1 n p s i c j where s 1 s 2 sn are the predictive attributes c j is a class attribute flood and non flood of class set c μ is the mean of observations and m is the total number of classes 4 2 2 naive bayes nb the nb is a bayes based classifier in which no dependency exists between conditioning factors and the variables used to maximize posterior probability pham et al 2017 soni et al 2011 the nb is constructed by 1 collecting relevant examples 2 estimating the prior probability for each class label flood and non flood locations 3 calculating each class label and computing covariance matrices for each class and 4 determining their inverse and determinant to ultimately construct the discriminant function for each class in this study r r 1 r 2 r n is the vector of flood conditioning factors whereas f f 1 f 2 corresponds to the vector of classifier variables flood non flood the conditional probability for all class labels of the study area is then obtained for the nb classifier the prediction is based on the largest posterior probability and can be formulated using eq 6 mccallum and nigam 1998 6 fnb arg max p f i i 1 n p r i f i f i f l o o d n o n f l o o d where p f i is the prior probability and is calculated as the proportion of observations with output class f i in the training dataset and p r i f i is the conditional probability given by eq 7 7 p r i f i 1 2 π λ e a i μ 2 2 λ 2 where µ is the mean deviation and λ is the standard deviation of observations ri 4 3 model evaluation criteria 4 3 1 statistical measures criteria for both the training and validation datasets the effectiveness of the models was evaluated using statistical criteria results from the training dataset indicate degree of fit whereas results from the validation dataset provide information about the predictive ability of the proposed models pham and prakash 2018 pham et al 2018b different model prediction results were evaluated true positive tp representing the number of pixels correctly classified as positive flood predictions and true negative tn representing the number of pixels correctly classified as negative non flood predictions furthermore false positive fp and false negative fn representing the number of pixels incorrectly classified as positive floods or negative non floods respectively were also evaluated althuwaynee et al 2014 onan 2015 the statistical measures of accuracy mae kappa index k and rmse served to evaluate model performance they can be determined using eqs 8 11 below armstrong and collopy 1992 dawson et al 2006 8 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 9 mae 1 n

agreements x o i and x e i are the i th observed and model predicted values respectively and n is the number of data points 4 3 2 receiver operating characteristic roc curve the roc curve widely used in geoscience is a standard technique to determine the general performance of models and is one of the most important and widely used methods in spatial modeling chen et al 2018b this curve can be constructed by plotting the values of two statistical indexes sensitivity and 100 specificity on the ordinate and abscissa respectively shahabi and hashim 2015 the prediction of an event s occurrence or non occurrence can be quantitatively evaluated using the area under the roc curve auc chen et al 2018a which highlights the performance of a suggested flood model it ranges between 0 5 inaccurate and 1 highly accurate shirzadi et al 2017 4 4 feature selection methods the current study applies two main methods i variance inflation factors vif and tolerances dormann et al 2013 and ii information gain ratio igr test kannan et al 2009 to identify the most effective conditioning factors for flood occurrence and to remove null factors from the model in order to improve the prediction power and performance of the models studied chapi et al 2017 in the multicollinearity diagnosis test vif and tolerance criteria pearson s correlation coefficients variance decomposition proportions and the conditional index are used khosravi et al 2018 multicollinearity evaluates the possible correlation between the 12 conditioning factors used multicollinearity between factors suggests that correlated factors can be predicted by other factors and must thusly be removed from the modeling process vif and tolerance values of 10 and 0 1 respectively indicate a multicollinearity problem khosravi et al 2018 the igr is considered one of the best methods for feature selection chen et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 and is used to determine the relative importance of each conditioning factor on event occurance the average merit am was calculated as a quantitative criterion for identifying the relative importance of factors the greater the am for each conditioning factor the greater its effect on the occurrence 5 results 5 1 selection of the conditioning factors the vif and tolerance values of all factors are less than 10 and exceed 0 1 respectively table 1 this indicates that no multicollinearity problems exist among the conditioning factors application of the igr test to evaluate the importance of each factor in flood modeling table 1 showed that for the ningdu catchment altitude am 0 99 had the greatest effect on flood occurrence this is followed by distance from the river am 0 81 ndvi am 0 69 soil type am 0 59 ground slope am 0 49 lithology am 0 48 land use am 0 32 sti am 0 23 twi am 0 18 rainfall am 0 058 spi am 0 056 and curvature am 0 respectively these results show that among the 12 factors curvature had no effect on flood occurrence it was therefore removed from model developement 5 2 training and validating the models validation criteria were applied to investigate the accuracy and prediction effectiveness of each built model on both training and

respectively 5 3 generation of flood susceptibility map flood susceptibility maps were generated separately using the topsis vikor and saw methods using the vikor method fig 4 a b the positive and negative impacts varied between 0 09 and 3 27 and 0 046 and 0 63 respectively in comparison for the topsis method positive impact ranged from 0 06 to 1 26 while negative impacts ranged from 0 33 to 1 33 fig 4c and fig 4d the flood susceptibility maps for vikor topsis and saw are shown in fig 5 flood susceptibility maps were also generated using nbt and nb methods the nb and nbt models were constructed in the training phase using optimal parameters to calculate the flood susceptibility indices fsi while considering the entirety of the pixels within the study area first the entire area was converted to pixels of 30 m 30 m then during the learning phase of the model the fsi were assigned to each pixel based on the training dataset flood susceptibility maps were constructed by classifying susceptibility into five classes very low low moderate high and very high this classification was based on the quantile method in arc gis 10 2 tehrany et al 2015b fig 5 6 discussion complex natural disasters such as flash floods can never be fully prevented it is therefore extremely important to improve flood prediction and mitigation methods in order to minimize the loss of human life and the socio economic impacts related to flooding flood susceptibility mapping is both the first and the key step in flood modeling and risk assessment by mapping flood susceptibility flood prone areas can be identified and the appropriate structural and non structural measures can be applied to reduce losses related to flooding the present study applied and compared various mcdm methods saw vikor and topsis and ml methods nb and nbt for the mapping of flood susceptibility in the ningdu catchment of china in general flood susceptibility mapping isolates vulnerable areas based on the consideration of a variety of flood affecting factors hong et al 2018 however floods are affected by many other factors related to geological hydrological topographical and morphological conditions tehrany et al 2015a moreover only some of these factors contribute to flood susceptibility models thus the selection of suitable flood affecting factors is a important step in flood susceptibility modeling the effective feature selection method igr employed in the current study allowed for the selection of input factors for flood susceptibility modeling it was determined that the most effective conditioning factor for flood susceptibility mapping was altitude while the least effective conditioning factors were rainfall spi and curvature these results are in line with many other recent studies khosravi et al 2018 khosravi et al 2016b tehrany et al 2015a while rainfall is the main source of flooding it does not necessarily have a linear effect on flooding results showed that at higher elevations an increase in rainfall can actually reduce the occurance of flooding validation of model performance was achieved through the use of several statistical model performance criteria the validation phase results showed that ml methods nb and nbt outperform mcdm methods saw vikor and topsis for flood susceptibility assessment ml methods used two strategies post pruning and pre pruning to prevent over fitting and noise problems hence greater accuracy was achieved kotsiantis et al 2007 in contrast mcdm methods saw vikor and topsis have several disadvantages i they are extremely data intensive in terms of recording a decision maker s preferences ii the required amount of data may not be available for all decision making problems iii due to the weighting of variables they require strong assumptions from decision makers making them relatively subjective velasquez and hester 2013 among the ml methods the nbt outperformed the nb for flood susceptibility assessment this can be explained due to the nbt being a hybrid model as a hybrid model the nbt has several advantages over the nb model including its ability to enhance the classification accuracy by using the naïve bayes algorithm and the decision tree algorithm to construct the classification trees overall it is a simple effective and interpretable model that allows for quick learning from the training dataset kohavi 1996 in addition the nb faces a disadvantage of assuming independence between input variables which is not always the case with flood prediction the findings of the present study may be of use to flood hazard managers or researchers when selecting the most suitable methods for flood susceptibility modeling however the limitation of the present approach is the non availability of temporal changes and real time flood data another main limitation of the methods used and of flood susceptibility mapping in general is that these maps can only show where floods are likely to occur but provide no information relating to flood depth or velocity in the future it is recommended that studies such as this one be combined with hydraulic modeling such as the new version of the hydrologic engineering center s ceiwr hec river analysis system hec ras 5 and newer versions that can provide 2d maps for both depth and velocity in addition future studies must evaluate whether overlapping criteria based on a dem be included as part of the model 7 conclusions in this study the mcdm techniques vikor topsis and saw and the ml methods nbt and nb were applied for flood susceptibility mapping of the ningdu catchment china models were constructed using a spatial database which included twelve geo environmental and topographic flood conditioning factors as well as data from 166 past flooding events the importance of these factors was evaluated following multi collinearity diagnostic tests a consideration of tolerance and vif methods and an igr test test results showed that no multicollinearity problem existed among the conditioning factors selected the igr test however indicated that land surface curvature had no effect on flood occurrence in the area curvature was thusly removed and the final analysis was performed using the remaining eleven conditioning factors ndvi lithology land use distance from river curvature altitude sti twi spi soil type slope and rainfall the training and validation phase accuracy for the studied models was evaluated using several statistical measures acc kappa rmse mae and auc validation results showed that all models studied nbt nb saw topsis and vikor models performed well but that the nbt model performed best the nbt model can therefore be explored for the construction of flood susceptibility maps flood susceptibility maps generated from this study may be useful for land use planning of areas likely to be affected by floods the results of this study can also be used to improve and inform flood risk

significant losses to human life resulting in significant socio economic impacts for example in coastal and in land regions affected by heavy monsoon rains chapi et al 2015 komi et al 2017 minh et al 2018 wang et al 2014 flash floods are even more dangerous given their ability to flood areas without warning rapid erosion and landslides resulting from floods can cause sudden morphological changes in the area van tu et al 2016 floods also have an effect on the geo environment through the transportion of chemicals and other hazardous industrial wastes that can contaminate surface and subsurface waters as well as agricultural lands over the past two decades the worldwide frequency of floods has increased by over 40 hirabayashi et al 2013 in fact between 1995 and 2015 roughly 109 million people were affected by floods with damages reaching up to us 75 billion per year alfieri et al 2017 floods can have both natural and anthropogenic causes chang and chen 2016 with climate change being considered as one of the main causes for changes in flood patterns intensity and magnitude dawod et al 2011 hens et al 2018 thai et al 2017 van thanh et al 2017 many asian countries are heavily affected by floods china for example was the site of the deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century the 1931 central china flood this flood led to the deaths of an estimated 3 7 million people ma et al 2010 the estimated annual damage caused by flooding rivers in china in 2010 was us 51 billion stoynov et al 2017 in recent years china has observed changing rainfall patterns leading to heavier rainfall between the period of april to june this increased rainfall has led to flooding in many parts of the ningdu county report of the ningdu county government http www ningdu gov cn changing rainfall patterns in general have been tied to an increase in anthropogenic activities which have been deemed responsible for the increased frequency of flooding zhang et al 2018 given the impact on human life floods can have an extreme effect on a region s socioeconomic health accordingly appropriate action is required to mitigate flood hazards many different approaches have been used to predict the many different aspects of flood phenomena one of the first approaches used was the statistical correlation of flood characteristics to the physical properties of watersheds wheater et al 1993 more recently conceptual and physically based models have been used for flood prediction in many parts of the world solomatine and ostfeld 2008 however generation of flood maps remains a major challenge khosravi et al 2016a khosravi et al 2016b given the inherent complexity of watersheds floods cannot be modelled using simple nonlinear models in recent years however data driven models including bivariate statistical models multi criteria decision making mcdm and artificial intelligence ai machine learning ml computational intelligence ci soft computing sc data mining dm knowledge discovery in databases kdd and intelligent data analysis ida models have shown promise in many branches of prediction sciences including flood susceptibility mapping fms solomatine et al 2009 these models and their hybrids have already been applied to many natural disasters in a wide range of studies ahmadlou et al 2018 chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 phuong et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 having reviewed 128 papers employing mcdm methods de brito and evers 2016 found that the analytic hierarchy process ahp was the most widespread mcdm method but concluded that other mcdm methods should be tested recently de brito et al 2018 applied the ahp and analytic network process anp to flood vulnerability assessment and mapping in brazil the authors noted that due to dependences among criteria the anp had greater predictive power than the ahp these new approaches have demonstrated many advantages including i that compared to physically based models they do not require a great deal of detailed information regarding watershed characteristics and ii that these models generally achieved high prediction accuracy abedini et al 2018 dou et al 2015 pham et al 2018c the developement of new individual and hybrid models however is still necessary to increase the accuracy of modelled parameters according to the literature several bivariate mcdm and ml models have been applied to flood susceptibility mapping however of all the papers consulted no universal guidelines were found to exist regarding the assessement of the predictive power of these models moreover research has shown that all models have their own advantages and disadvantages consequently a range of models must first be applied to a given area and only after an assessment of the models predictive power can one be selected for use khosravi et al 2018 the present study sought to introduce and compare the predictive power of several novel models based on mcdm techniques and ml techniques for the spatial prediction of floods the novel mcdm techniques include vikor vlse kriterijuska optamizacija i komoromisno resenje topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and saw simple additive weighting these are well known mcdm models though they have yet to be applied to flood susceptibility mapping the predictive power of the mcdm models was assesed and then compared to two popular ml models naïve bayes trees nbt and naïve bayes nb validation and comparison of the models was done using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve method and several statistical indices

data 3 1 flood inventory map when predicting future flood occurrences a region s flood hazards can be analyzed using prior flood records drawn from a flood inventory map khosravi et al 2018 pham et al 2018a pham et al 2018d a flood inventory map of ningdu county was prepared using available data from 166 flood events supplied by the chinese academy of science fig 1 using gps the locations of flood events were validated from records of flood level marker posts and through extensive field surveys the flood data was randomly divided into two groups using a 7 3 ratio to construct the model 70 of the flood and non flood locations were used whereas the remaining 30 of flood and non flood locations were used to generate the testing dataset in order to validate the models 3 2 flood conditioning factors a flood s magnitude depends on rainfall intensity and duration meteorological factors and catchment characteristics including topography vegetation and soil characteristics also have an affect on flood susceptibility in the present study 12 flood conditioning factors in conjunction with the catchment s geo environmental characteristics were initially considered for flood susceptibility

ground surface and can affect flooding in a given area curvature maps were therefore generated using the dem and classified into three classes concave flat and convex fig 2b convex surfaces are more prone to runoff and are predominantly responsible for down slope flooding il inskii and yakimov 1987 at higher elevations the flood risk is relatively low except for as a result of glacial meltwaters

susceptibility models the first technique multiple criteria decision making mcdm ormultiple criteria decision analysis mcda evaluates multiple conflictingcriteriaindecision making the vikor topsis and saw methods were applied for the development of the models the second technique looks at ml methods specifically using the naive bayes tree nbt and naive bayes nb classifiers 4 1 multiple criteria decision making mcdm techniques each conditioning factor was first converted to stretch raster format with a 30 m 30 m pixel size distance from the river and other similar distances were calculated using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 2 this format consists of several columns and rows for each factor resulting in a single matrix the required steps for each model were then performed resulting in data that was used for flood susceptibility mapping finally all factors were normalized between 0 and 1 using the proper fuzzy membership function in arcgis 10 2 to reduce any biases stemming from expert judgment 4 1 1 vise kriterijumska optimizacijaik ompromisno resenje vikor the vikor method developed by duckstein and opricovic 1980 is one of the most popular mcdm methods for the optimization of complex systems it is used to identify the compromise ranking list and solution and is also used to weight stability intervals this method introduces a multicriteria ranking index that is nearest to the ideal opricovic and tzeng 2004 the alternatives are then evaluated according to the established criteria chitsaz and banihabib 2015 opricovic and tzeng 2004 4 1 2 technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis the topsis method presented by ching and yoon 1981 is based on the euclidean distance between decision making alternatives ameri et al 2018 chitsaz and banihabib 2015 it was developed to solve decision making problems consisting of conflicting and non commensurable criteria in this method the ranking of alternatives is based on 1 the shortest distance from the ideal solution and 2 the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution jozaghi et al 2018 opricovic and tzeng 2004 4 1 3 simple additive weighting saw the saw technique introduced by fishburn 1967 is based on weighted averages jain and raj 2013 an evaluation score is first calculated for each alternative by multiplying the scaled value given to the alternative of a given attribute with the weighted importance assigned by decision makers products for all criteria are then summed pourkhabbaz et al 2014 the advantage of this method is that it is a proportional linear transformation of the raw data this means that the relative order of magnitude of the standardized scores remains equal jain and raj 2013 4 2 machine learning ml algorithms in order to obtain the highest prediction performance using ml methods an optimum value of each operator for the proposed models is determined using trial and error method by using proper conditioning factors the nbt and nb models were built and validated using training and validation datasets furthermore these models were constructed and run using a batch size of 100 with two decimal places a 10 fold cross validation method was used to prevent over fitting 4 2 1 naive bayes tree nbt nbt classifiers generally used for solving classification problems can improve upon the performance of other individual classifiers such as naïve bayes nb and decision tree dt kohavi 1996 one of the main assumptions of the nbt is that the class conditional independence factor s does not show a correlation between the values of the conditioning factor shirzadi et al 2017 for each pixel in the leaves the computation of posterior probability proceeds as follows chen et al 2017 kohavi 1996 pham et al 2016 i after creating the tree and following its growth pre pruning occurs ii to segment the data univariate splits are made of each node as a normal dt classifier and iii a given instance is classified using the following classification rule eq 5 kohavi 1996 5 c arg max c j c p c j s 1 s 1 s n p c j i 1 n p s i c j j 1 m p c j i 1 n p s i c j μ arg max p c j c j c i 1 n p s i c j where s 1 s 2 sn are the predictive attributes c j is a class attribute flood and non flood of class set c μ is the mean of observations and m is the total number of classes 4 2 2 naive bayes nb the nb is a bayes based classifier in which no dependency exists between conditioning factors and the variables used to maximize posterior probability pham et al 2017 soni et al 2011 the nb is constructed by 1 collecting relevant examples 2 estimating the prior probability for each class label flood and non flood locations 3 calculating each class label and computing covariance matrices for each class and 4 determining their inverse and determinant to ultimately construct the discriminant function for each class in this study r r 1 r 2 r n is the vector of flood conditioning factors whereas f f 1 f 2 corresponds to the vector of classifier variables flood non flood the conditional probability for all class labels of the study area is then obtained for the nb classifier the prediction is based on the largest posterior probability and can be formulated using eq 6 mccallum and nigam 1998 6 fnb arg max p f i i 1 n p r i f i f i f l o o d n o n f l o o d where p f i is the prior probability and is calculated as the proportion of observations with output class f i in the training dataset and p r i f i is the conditional probability given by eq 7 7 p r i f i 1 2 π λ e a i μ 2 2 λ 2 where µ is the mean deviation and λ is the standard deviation of observations ri 4 3 model evaluation criteria 4 3 1 statistical measures criteria for both the training and validation datasets the effectiveness of the models was evaluated using statistical criteria results from the training dataset indicate degree of fit whereas results from the validation dataset provide information about the predictive ability of the proposed models pham and prakash 2018 pham et al 2018b different model prediction results were evaluated true positive tp representing the number of pixels correctly classified as positive flood predictions and true negative tn representing the number of pixels correctly classified as negative non flood predictions furthermore false positive fp and false negative fn representing the number of pixels incorrectly classified as positive floods or negative non floods respectively were also evaluated althuwaynee et al 2014 onan 2015 the statistical measures of accuracy mae kappa index k and rmse served to evaluate model performance they can be determined using eqs 8 11 below armstrong and collopy 1992 dawson et al 2006 8 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 9 mae 1 n i 1 i n x ei x oi 10 kappa i n d e x k p c p exp 1 p exp 11 rmse 1 n i 1 i n x ei x oi 2 where pc is the number of pixels to be classified correctly as flood or non flood pixels pexp are the expected agreements x o i and x e i are the i th observed and model predicted values respectively and n is the number of data points 4 3 2 receiver operating characteristic roc curve the roc curve widely used in geoscience is a standard technique to determine the general performance of models and is one of the most important and widely used methods in spatial modeling chen et al 2018b this curve can be constructed by plotting the values of two statistical indexes sensitivity and 100 specificity on the ordinate and abscissa respectively shahabi and hashim 2015 the prediction of an event s occurrence or non occurrence can be quantitatively evaluated using the area under the roc curve auc chen et al 2018a which highlights the performance of a suggested flood model it ranges between 0 5 inaccurate and 1 highly accurate shirzadi et al 2017 4 4 feature selection methods the current study applies two main methods i variance inflation factors vif and tolerances dormann et al 2013 and ii information gain ratio igr test kannan et al 2009 to identify the most effective conditioning factors for flood occurrence and to remove null factors from the model in order to improve the prediction power and performance of the models studied chapi et al 2017 in the multicollinearity diagnosis test vif and tolerance criteria pearson s correlation coefficients variance decomposition proportions and the conditional index are used khosravi et al 2018 multicollinearity evaluates the possible correlation between the 12 conditioning factors used multicollinearity between factors suggests that correlated factors can be predicted by other factors and must thusly be removed from the modeling process vif and tolerance values of 10 and 0 1 respectively indicate a multicollinearity problem khosravi et al 2018 the igr is considered one of the best methods for feature selection chen et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 and is used to determine the relative importance of each conditioning factor on event occurance the average merit am was calculated as a quantitative criterion for identifying the relative importance of factors the greater the am for each conditioning factor the greater its effect on the occurrence 5 results 5 1 selection of the conditioning factors the vif and tolerance values of all factors are less than 10 and exceed 0 1 respectively table 1 this indicates that no multicollinearity problems exist among the conditioning factors application of the igr test to evaluate the importance of each factor in flood modeling table 1 showed that for the ningdu catchment altitude am 0 99 had the greatest effect on flood occurrence this is followed by distance from the river am 0 81 ndvi am 0 69 soil type am 0 59 ground slope am 0 49 lithology am 0 48 land use am 0 32 sti am 0 23 twi am 0 18 rainfall am 0 058 spi am 0 056 and curvature am 0 respectively these results show that among the 12 factors curvature had no effect on flood occurrence it was therefore removed from model developement 5 2 training and validating the models validation criteria were applied to investigate the accuracy and prediction effectiveness of each built model on both training and testing parts result show that the nb model outperforms the nbt in terms of acc 96 8 kappa 0 95 lower rmse 0 115 and mae 0 12 in the training phase table 2 both nb and nbt models were then evaluated in the testing phase with the obtained results being similar to those of the training phase prediction capability of the nb model is higher than the nbt model table 2 and a comparison of the results of the kappa index show almost perfect agreement between estimation and actual observations in both the training and testing phases applied to all models the roc curve method showed that the nbt model auc 0 984 outperforms the nb auc 0 979 saw auc 0 97 topsis auc 0 968 and vikor auc 0 965 models in the validation phase fig 3 a the prediction rate fig 3b showed that despite all models providing similarly suitable results the nb model outperformed the rest in terms of prediction effectiveness auc 0 98 the nb model was followed by the nbt auc 0 97 saw and vikor auc 0 96 and topsis auc 0 95 i respectively 5 3 generation of flood susceptibility map flood susceptibility maps were generated separately using the topsis vikor and saw methods using the vikor method fig 4 a b the positive and negative impacts varied between 0 09 and 3 27 and 0 046 and 0 63 respectively in comparison for the topsis method positive impact ranged from 0 06 to 1 26 while negative impacts ranged from 0 33 to 1 33 fig 4c and fig 4d the flood susceptibility maps for vikor topsis and saw are shown in fig 5 flood susceptibility maps were also generated using nbt and nb methods the nb and nbt models were constructed in the training phase using optimal parameters to calculate the flood susceptibility indices fsi while considering the entirety of the pixels within the study area first the entire area was converted to pixels of 30 m 30 m then during the learning phase of the model the fsi were assigned to each pixel based on the training dataset flood susceptibility maps were constructed by classifying susceptibility into five classes very low low moderate high and very high this classification was based on the quantile method in arc gis 10 2 tehrany et al 2015b fig 5 6 discussion complex natural disasters such as flash floods can never be fully prevented it is therefore extremely important to improve flood prediction and mitigation methods in order to minimize the loss of human life and the socio economic impacts related to flooding flood susceptibility mapping is both the first and the key step in flood modeling and risk assessment by mapping flood susceptibility flood prone areas can be identified and the appropriate structural and non structural measures can be applied to reduce losses related to flooding the present study applied and compared various mcdm methods saw vikor and topsis and ml methods nb and nbt for the mapping of flood susceptibility in the ningdu catchment of china in general flood susceptibility mapping isolates vulnerable areas based on the consideration of a variety of flood affecting factors hong et al 2018 however floods are affected by many other factors related to geological hydrological topographical and morphological conditions tehrany et al 2015a moreover only some of these factors contribute to flood susceptibility models thus the selection of suitable flood affecting factors is a important step in flood susceptibility modeling the effective feature selection method igr employed in the current study allowed for the selection of input factors for flood susceptibility modeling it was determined that the most effective conditioning factor for flood susceptibility mapping was altitude while the least effective conditioning factors were rainfall spi and curvature these results are in line with many other recent studies khosravi et al 2018 khosravi et al 2016b tehrany et al 2015a while rainfall is the main source of flooding it does not necessarily have a linear effect on flooding results showed that at higher elevations an increase in rainfall can actually reduce the occurance of flooding validation of model performance was achieved through the use of several statistical model performance criteria the validation phase results showed that ml methods nb and nbt outperform mcdm methods saw vikor and topsis for flood susceptibility assessment ml methods used two strategies post pruning and pre pruning to prevent over fitting and noise problems hence greater accuracy was achieved kotsiantis et al 2007 in contrast mcdm methods saw vikor and topsis have several disadvantages i they are extremely data intensive in terms of recording a decision maker s preferences ii the required amount of data may not be available for all decision making problems iii due to the weighting of variables they require strong assumptions from decision makers making them relatively subjective velasquez and hester 2013 among the ml methods the nbt outperformed the nb for flood susceptibility assessment this can be explained due to the nbt being a hybrid model as a hybrid model the nbt has several advantages over the nb model including its ability to enhance the classification accuracy by using the naïve bayes algorithm and the decision tree algorithm to construct the classification trees overall it is a simple effective and interpretable model that allows for quick learning from the training dataset kohavi 1996 in addition the nb faces a disadvantage of assuming independence between input variables which is not always the case with flood prediction the findings of the present study may be of use to flood hazard managers or researchers when selecting the most suitable methods for flood susceptibility modeling however the limitation of the present approach is the non availability of temporal changes and real time flood data another main limitation of the methods used and of flood susceptibility mapping in general is that these maps can only show where floods are likely to occur but provide no information relating to flood depth or velocity in the future it is recommended that studies such as this one be combined with hydraulic modeling such as the new version of the hydrologic engineering center s ceiwr hec river analysis system hec ras 5 and newer versions that can provide 2d maps for both depth and velocity in addition future studies must evaluate whether overlapping criteria based on a dem be included as part of the model 7 conclusions in this study the mcdm techniques vikor topsis and saw and the ml methods nbt and nb were applied for flood susceptibility mapping of the ningdu catchment china models were constructed using a spatial database which included twelve geo environmental and topographic flood conditioning factors as well as data from 166 past flooding events the importance of these factors was evaluated following multi collinearity diagnostic tests a consideration of tolerance and vif methods and an igr test test results showed that no multicollinearity problem existed among the conditioning factors selected the igr test however indicated that land surface curvature had no effect on flood occurrence in the area curvature was thusly removed and the final analysis was performed using the remaining eleven conditioning factors ndvi lithology land use distance from river curvature altitude sti twi spi soil type slope and rainfall the training and validation phase accuracy for the studied models was evaluated using several statistical measures acc kappa rmse mae and auc validation results showed that all models studied nbt nb saw topsis and vikor models performed well but that the nbt model performed best the nbt model can therefore be explored for the construction of flood susceptibility maps flood susceptibility maps generated from this study may be useful for land use planning of areas likely to be affected by floods the results of this study can also be used to improve and inform flood risk
