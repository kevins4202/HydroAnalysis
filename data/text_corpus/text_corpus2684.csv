13420,this study addresses the comparison of three iron sources to remove sulfamethoxazole smx at 50 μg l as a surrogate contaminant of emerging concern by continuous flow solar photo fenton at neutral ph in secondary effluents from two wastewater treatment plants experiments were conducted in a stirred tank reactor with a liquid depth of 5 cm using two ferric iron complexes 0 1 mm with ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds and nitrilotriacetic acid nta as chelating agents and feso4 0 36 mm in this regard this is the first time fe3 nta has been used in the continuous operation of the photo fenton process on the one hand fe3 edds led to the highest smx removal around 60 in both effluents at hydraulic residence times of 30 and 60 min respectively on the other hand wastewater composition significantly affected reagent consumption and consequently operating costs in terms of cost efficiency of smx removal the order was fe3 nta 3 25 7 81 mgsmx m3 feso4 2 03 5 09 mgsmx m3 fe3 edds 1 12 2 48 mgsmx m3 keywords advanced oxidation process micropollutant nitrilotriacetic acid sulfamethoxazole wastewater treatment 1 introduction the global water scarcity in which the planet is currently immersed has motivated the research for new and efficient alternatives which help to reuse wastewater through processes of disinfection and decontamination of secondary effluents hence municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp must be upgraded in order to mitigate the problems related to the presence of organic micropollutants which are responsible for serious public health problems 1 along these lines a publication of the european chemical agency 2017 2 has revealed the presence of more than 100 000 compounds in surface waters in levels of ng l μg l among which pesticides antibiotics and personal care products can be highlighted these compounds are named contaminants of emerging concern cecs and included in a watch list updated periodically august 2020 in decision 2020 1161 eu 3 as such there is an urgent need to implement tertiary treatments able to improve and comply with the current environmental regulations with this in mind advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as one of the best alternatives 4 6 under these circumstances solar photo fenton process has shown successful results in terms of micropollutant degradation as well as bacterial inactivation 7 9 this can be explained by the large amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by the catalytic cycle of iron ions fe2 and fe3 combined with h2o2 and uv vis radiation one of the main variables that must be considered is the process ph 10 acidic ph is optimal for the photo fenton process since iron is soluble however to work at a large scale the operation at neutral ph is proposed as an alternative regarding the cost associated with the acidification ph control neutralisation post treatment and also to avoid the increase in salinity of treated effluents in this regard two different operating strategies are currently being studied with promising results i the use of ferrous sulfate feso4 at circumneutral ph and ii the use of iron complexes for the first strategy the reaction mechanism can be summarised as follows firstly ferrous iron fe2 reacts with h2o2 reaction 1 to yield hydroxyl radicals h o and ferric iron fe3 that precipitates as iron hydroxides after that the heterogeneous photo fenton process with iron hydroxides f e 3 o h f e 2 fe3 occurs in a redox cycle reactions 2 3 11 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o 2 f e 3 o h h v f e 2 h o 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o as for the second strategy the use of chelating agents allows the iron to be kept in solution and the contribution of the homogeneous photo fenton process enhances micropollutant removal in general the reaction mechanism with iron complexes can be summarised as follows iron complexes fe3 l photoactivate f e 3 l under uv vis radiation giving rise to fe2 reactions 4 5 then ferrous iron is oxidised by h2o2 fenton reaction 1 to yield h o and fe3 which instantaneously precipitates as iron hydroxides 4 f e 3 l h υ f e 3 l 5 f e 3 l f e 2 l the ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds has been revealed as a strong and biodegradable complexing agent with ferric iron fe3 meaning it can be considered environmentally friendly 12 furthermore this complex displays a high level of photo activity which leads to increase h o production for a wide range of ph values 3 9 13 recently nitrilotriacetic acid nta has emerged as another possible complexing agent with successful results in terms of micropollutant degradation as well as a lower cost alternative to edds 14 de luca 15 studied the photo fenton process at neutral ph comparing different iron chelates in batch mode operation confirming the potential of nta for micropollutant removal furthermore cec removal and bacterial inactivation have been studied at neutral ph using edds and nta as well as iron precipitates in actual secondary effluents from mwwtp 16 18 where the matrix composition can lead to serious operating difficulties 19 indeed soriano molina et al 20 assessed the effect of different mwwtp effluents for micropollutant degradation showing the significant effect of the real matrix on this type of treatment this evaluation is very important because the feasibility of tertiary treatments can be highly affected by the water matrix composition as a result different factors such as the dissolved organic carbon doc the turbidity and the concentration of phosphate and chloride ions can be a critical issue that means the study and monitoring of this variable is absolutely necessary to operate an advanced oxidation process under real conditions most of the studies mentioned above were carried out in batch mode however for processes with short reaction times continuous mode operation is recommended concerning that the use of feso4 was evaluated in terms of bacterial inactivation operating in continuous flow with a real mwwtp effluent this operating mode was able to achieve bacterial inactivation under the detection limit 1 cfu ml with hydraulic residence times hrt of around 30 60 min depending on the season in which the system is operated 21 on the other hand the use of edds has also been evaluated when operating in continuous flow mode 22 in this case the research focused on the evaluation of micropollutant degradation however regarding the use of fe3 nta for continuous flow mode processes only the work of dong 23 has been found in the literature where carbamazepine crotamiton and ibuprofen at 452 6 394 6 and 101 1 μg l respectively was treated by uva 365 nm fe3 nta h2o2 in continuous flow mode the initial operating conditions were 0 178 mm fe3 nta 1 1 10 mg l 4 54 mm h2o2 154 4 mg l 40 5 w m2 uva irradiance 365 nm and hrt of 120 min in this regard research on the operation of the process in continuous flow mode under more realistic conditions low reagent concentrations and low cec initial concentration is necessary in addition the impact of iron source on operating cost should be considered before scaling up the process the main goal of this work is to assess the effect of iron source and mwwtp effluent composition on the continuous flow operation of the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph to this end the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx was selected as the model cec at an initial concentration of 50 μg l this antibiotic was selected because is a recalcitrant contaminant frequently detected in the aquatic environment 24 25 in addition this compound is included in the watch list of substances for european union wide monitoring reported in decision 2020 1161 eu of 4 june 2020 3 the experiments were carried out with three iron sources fe3 edds fe3 nta and feso4 in actual mwwtp effluents from two mwwtps located in almería southeastern spain 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents sulfamethoxazole smx 99 provided by sigma aldrich was selected as the model antibiotic ferric sulphate monohydrate fe2 so4 3 h2o 75 w w ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o 99 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 33 w v were supplied by panreac hplc grade acetonitrile methanol acetic acid glacial 99 w v ortho phenanthroline 99 w w and sulphuric acid 96 w v were also supplied by panreac two different complexing agents were used in this work nitrilotriacetic acid nta 99 w w and ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds 35 w v both supplied by sigma aldrich all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced by a milli q water purification system from merck millipore with a specific resistance of 18 2 mω cm and 5 μg l of doc 2 2 water matrices the experiments were carried out with real secondary effluents from two mwwtps located in the south east of spain almería the first of them called el toyo provided the secondary effluent denoted as se a and the second one called el bobar provided the secondary effluent denoted as se b every week batches of 100 l were collected collected after filtration through sand filters the effluents were stored at laboratory temperature and used for experimentation within the following two days table 1 shows the average composition values of both effluents used during the experimentation 2 3 experimental set up mwwtp effluents were pretreated with sulphuric acid to reduce the concentration of bicarbonate species since it is known that bicarbonate species act as scavengers of ho radicals 10 bicarbonates measured as inorganic carbon ic were reduced from initial value table 1 to 15 mg l due to the acidification pretreatment sulfate concentration increased around 160 mg l and 400 mg l in se a and se b respectively the experimental conditions were based on previous studies 0 36 mm feso4 0 1 mm fe3 edds 0 1 mm fe3 nta both at fe3 l molar ratio of 1 1 and 1 47 mm h2o2 to begin the treatment in batch mode with further reduction to 0 88 mm for continuous flow operation 17 18 every week a stock solution of sxm 3 5 g l was prepared in methanol and prior to the experimentation the solution was diluted down to 50 μg l in the wastewater feed tank methanol increased the doc of the water matrix by 4 mg l experiments were conducted under controlled conditions of uv irradiance in a solar simulator sun test cps set at 30 w m2 and a temperature of 25 thermo scientific neslab rte 7 thermostatic bath fig 1 a stirred tank reactor with a liquid depth of 5 cm was used a spectroradiometer avantes avaspec dual channel fiber optic spectrometer was used to measure uv irradiance on the reactor surface all the experiments were done in duplicate with all the figures showing mean values standard deviation firstly the reactor was started in batch mode for 120 min for that purpose the reactor was loaded charged with the doped effluent and then the h2o2 was added and the initial concentration was checked after 2 min once the system had been prepared the iron source feso4 fe3 edds or fe3 nta was subsequently added and at the same time the reactor was uncovered giving rise to the beginning of the reaction edds and nta increased the doc of the water matrix by 12 mg l and 7 mg l respectively after the batch operation time both feed reagent pumps iron and h2o2 as well as the real mwwtp effluent were switched on and after that the process was carried out in continuous flow for 3 h the hrts were set according to the results obtained in the batch operation 2 4 chemical and analytical determinations iron and hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured by a standardised method in this case the o phenantroline standardised method according to iso 6332 and titanium iv oxysulphate solution spectro photometric method at 410 nm method din 38 402 h15 respectively the quantification limits were 3 6 10 3 mm and 2 9 10 2 mm for iron and hydrogen peroxide respectively doc and ic were analysed by a shimadzu toc vcsn analyser the anions described in table 1 were determined by ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact ic pro while smx concentration was monitored by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography using a diode array detector uhplc dad agilent technologies 1200 series instrument the analytical method uses 10 solution of acetonitrile as mobile phase and 90 of dilute formic acid 0 1 v v to be more precise a gradient method was used which consisted of an initial 10 of acetonitrile that was progressively increased to 100 over 12 min providing an smx retention time of 3 min the smx detection wavelength and the smx quantification limit were 267 nm and 5 μg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of iron source and mwwtp effluent composition to evaluate the effect of iron source on the kinetics of the solar photo fenton process an experimental plan was carried out with fe3 nta fe3 edds and feso4 in actual secondary effluents collected from two mwwtps named el toyo se a and el bobar se b as can be observed in table 1 doc concentration and turbidity in se b were 2 and 3 times higher than in se a respectively nonetheless conductivity was almost the same in both effluents all the experiments were carried out in batch and continuous flow mode under the operating conditions described in section 2 3 3 1 1 batch mode operation as can be seen in fig 2 a and b when using fe3 nta the iron remained in solution for longer than with fe3 edds this is due to fe3 edds being more photoactive 17 and consequently it is photo decomposed r4 r5 faster giving rise to fe2 that reacts with h2o2 r1 after 30 min of reaction the average concentrations of iron remaining in se a were 0 034 mm and 0 004 mm for fe3 nta and fe3 edds respectively for the experiments with feso4 the dissolved iron profile is not shown because it precipitated after the initial fenton reaction r1 r2 instantaneously in general iron remained in solution for a longer time in se b than in se a with the average concentrations of iron remaining in solution after 30 min of reaction being 0 058 mm and 0 012 mm for fe3 nta and fe3 edds respectively this could be explained by the attenuation of light penetration in se b due to the higher turbidity 12 4 in se b vs 4 1 in se a table 1 leading to a lower rate of photon absorption meaning iron complexes would remain in solution for a longer time without being photo decomposed when using iron complexes h2o2 consumption followed pseudo first order kinetics in both secondary effluents in se a the reaction rate with fe3 edds was 2 7 times faster than with fe3 nta fig 2c and table 2 due to the higher photon absorption of fe3 edds leading to the faster generation of ferrous iron fe2 consequently h2o2 consumption and hydroxyl radical generation as a result of the fenton reaction r1 were also accelerated in addition with fe3 edds the h2o2 consumption stopped after 50 min of reaction due to all the iron complex was photo decomposed however with fe3 nta the consumption continued as there was iron in solution and the same h2o2 conversion 40 as with fe3 edds was achieved after 90 min of reaction in se a as for the assays with feso4 the reaction occurred in two stages in the first stage a fast initial drop of 22 is observed in h2o2 concentration due to the fast initial fenton reaction r1 giving rise to a stoichiometric amount of hydroxyl radicals and ferric iron fe3 that instantaneously precipitated as ferric hydroxides in the second stage a slower h2o2 consumption related to the heterogeneous photo fenton reaction with ferric hydroxides r2 r3 is observed in this case the reaction rate was zero order in concordance with previous work 18 regarding the effect of the water matrix h2o2 consumption in se b was 1 3 1 1 and 2 2 times faster with fe3 edds fe3 nta and feso4 respectively than in se a fig 2c and d to evaluate this phenomenon blank assays of h2o2 consumption in the absence of iron were carried out in the dark in both mwwtp effluents the results showed a significant and variable h2o2 consumption in se b 38 18 after 120 min whereas in se a there was no consumption of h2o2 this explains the higher h2o2 consumption during the photo fenton experiments in se b as such when scaling up the process the effect of water matrix on reagent consumption must be considered and not only the conversion by reaction h2o2 consumption in actual wastewater could be explained by the following hypotheses i the presence of a significant concentration of reactive species such as nitrite ions no2 which react with h2o2 yielding peroxynitrite ions onoo 26 and ii the presence of a high concentration of aerobic bacteria which are commonly used in biological treatment to decompose organic matter these bacteria contain the enzyme catalase which is responsible for h2o2 decomposing to water and oxygen 27 considering that concentrations of nitrite ions in both effluents were negligible 1 2 mg l table 1 the first hypothesis was discarded in addition the higher doc concentration in this effluent 20 mg l in se b vs 9 1 in se a table 1 could also contribute to h2o2 consumption concerning smx removal fig 2e and f there is a parallelism between h2o2 consumption and contaminant degradation profiles the higher rate of complex photo decomposition when using fe3 edds led to a faster generation of hydroxyl radicals and consequently smx removal was faster when compared with the use of fe3 nta with both complexes microcontaminant removal followed pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants were 3 and 6 times higher with fe3 edds in se a and se b respectively table 2 after 30 min of reaction with fe3 edds at which point more than 90 of iron was precipitated smx degradation stopped whereas with fe3 nta the reaction continued as there was iron in solution the same removal percentage 86 was achieved with both iron complexes after 90 min of the reaction in se a as for the effect of water matrix the kinetic constants were 35 with fe3 edds and 67 with fe3 nta lower in se b table 2 than in se a in concordance with the lower rate of photon absorption of iron complexes the higher doc content which acts as a sink for hydroxyl radicals and the h2o2 consumption by water matrix the lower reaction rates with fe3 nta could explain the greater effect of the water matrix when using this complex as the longer the reaction time the higher the impact of secondary reactions with the matter present in the water with feso4 an initial drop in smx profile due to the initial fenton was observed achieving 46 and 36 antibiotic removal in se a and se b respectively however during the heterogeneous redox cycle r2 r3 the removal percentage was not increased pointing out that the heterogeneous photo fenton process is not efficient for cec removal considering the reaction time at which more than 80 and 70 smx removal was achieved in se a with fe3 edds and fe3 nta respectively an hrt of 30 min was set for the continuous flow operation in se a as for the treatment of se b hrt was extended to 60 min due to the lower reaction rates 3 1 2 continuous mode operation once the feed pumps for reagents and wastewater were switched on both reagent and smx concentrations increased with regard to the end of the batch wise operation reaching steady state in less than 30 min nonetheless when using feso4 as the iron source the steady state concentration of h2o2 in se a 0 30 mm was reached after 60 min this delay is due to the concentration of h2o2 remaining in this effluent after batch operation with feso4 0 98 mm being higher than with iron complexes and it was also higher than the concentration added to the reaction bulk during the continuous flow operation 0 88 mm in line with the lower rate of photon absorption of fe3 nta the steady state concentration of total dissolved iron was higher with fe3 nta than with fe3 edds in se a the values were 0 042 mm with fe3 nta and 0 030 mm with fe3 edds and consequently the steady state concentrations of h2o2 were 0 54 mm and 0 63 mm respectively in se b concentrations of iron were 0 049 mm with fe3 nta and 0 022 mm with fe3 edds however for h2o2 consumption steady state was not reached in this regard it needs to be taken into account that reagent stock solutions were prepared in actual effluents to avoid dilution when adding them to the reaction bulk and there was an effect of the water matrix on h2o2 consumption in se b consequently the concentration of oxidant in the stock solution decreased over the experimental time giving rise to a decrease in h2o2 profiles during the continuous flow operation despite this the reaction with iron complexes and contaminant degradation were not affected as h2o2 was the excess reactant in contrast to what is observed during the operation in batch mode during the continuous flow operation the h2o2 consumption with feso4 was higher than with iron complexes in both effluents this is due to the continuous addition of h2o2 and fe2 to the reactor giving rise to a continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals through the initial fenton reaction r1 and not only during the first few minutes of treatment as occurred in batch mode operation 28 however the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals during the continuous flow operation with feso4 did not improve the smx removal efficiency indeed removal percentages in steady state 40 in se a and 34 in se b were lower than in batch operation accordingly it can be concluded that there was an inefficient consumption of h2o2 probably due to the continuous addition of oxidant enhanced the unwanted reaction between h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals 29 the steady state percentages of smx removal in se a were 60 with fe3 edds 47 with fe3 nta and 40 with feso4 whereas in se b the values were 56 44 and 35 respectively comparing the results obtained in both water matrices differences between removal percentages were less than 10 so it could be concluded that the same removal efficiency was achieved in se b and se a with hrts of 30 min and 60 min respectively these results highlight the impact of the composition of mwwtp effluents on the continuous flow operation in addition the removal percentages agree with those obtained by arzate et al 22 and de la obra et al 30 who reported that it is possible to remove around 60 and 30 of the total load of cecs detected in mwwtp effluents with fe3 edds and feso4 respectively in raceway pond reactors rprs operated in continuous flow mode therefore the selection of smx as a surrogate of the total microcontaminants as a whole has been validated the results reveal that in terms of cec removal the process with fe3 edds is the most efficient however the treatment costs also play an important role when choosing the iron source 3 2 economic assessment to compare different strategies regarding solar photo fenton it is fundamental to consider its economic feasibility to this end operating costs were estimated as reagent and electricity consumption it is worth mentioning that this study is based on data obtained at laboratory scale and large scale research is needed for rigorous economic assessment the costs were calculated assuming the continuous flow operation of a 5 cm deep raceway pond reactor rpr under the same conditions of reagent concentration effluent composition and hrt as in the experimental runs considering 200 l day of wastewater generation per population equivalent 31 the design flow rate was set at 400 m3 day to comply with the european directive 91 271 eec 32 the total number of operating hours per day were set at 7 5 h 365 days per year bearing in mind the annual average hours per day at which solar irradiance is 10 w m2 in almería city energy costs included requirements for mixing in the photoreactor reactant dosing and wastewater pumping the price of electricity and the unitary power of paddle wheel for mixing were set at 0 1 kwh and 0 03 kw h m3 respectively 20 in addition the electricity cost of the centrifugal pump for wastewater pumping with an energy consumption of 0 25 kw h m3 and the electricity cost of three pumps for reactant dosing with an energy consumption of 0 83 kw h m3 each were considered as for reagent costs the industrial grade prices were 0 95 kg nta 99 w w 3 5 l edds 35 w v 0 1 l h2so4 98 w w 0 45 l h2o2 33 w v 0 71 kg fe2 so4 3 h2o and 0 72 kg feso4 7h2o 17 18 table 3 shows operating cost and economic efficiency in terms of mg of smx removed per unit of treated water volume and unit of currency estimated for the different strategies of solar photo fenton being investigated in this work as mentioned above the composition of mwwtp effluents substantially affects the kinetics of the process and consequently the hrt must be set as a function of this variable to achieve the treatment goal along these lines the unitary operating costs estimated for the treatment of se b with an hrt of 60 min are 0 02 m3 higher than those estimated for the treatment of se a with an hrt of 30 min this increase is mainly due to the greater h2so4 consumption in se b to reduce ic concentration down to 15 mg l in addition the longer the hrt the greater the energy consumption for mixing in the photoreactor as increasing hrt requires a larger reactor surface to treat the design flow rate however the effect of hrt on operating cost could be considered negligible as when increasing the hrt from 30 min se a to 60 min se b the energy costs only increase by 1 in contrast hrt has a great effect on economic efficiency as the values estimated for the operation with an hrt of 30 min are around 2 times higher than for 60 min table 3 concerning the iron source the treatment with fe3 edds 0 1 mm is the most expensive due to the high cost of the chelating agent and this represents almost 80 of the total operating cost fig 3 on replacing the use of this complex with fe3 nta 0 1 mm the operating cost is reduced by 75 furthermore it is important to remark that economic efficiency increases by three times table 3 in this case the cost is mainly affected by h2o2 and energy consumption whereas the chelating agent represents less than 20 as for the process with feso4 0 36 mm iron salt represents 50 of total cost and this treatment is less efficient and 30 more expensive when compared with the use of fe3 nta 0 1 mm thus it can be concluded that the strategy of solar photo fenton with fe3 nta is the most cost effective 4 conclusions the operation of the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph has been assessed in batch and continuous flow mode with three different iron sources fe3 edds fe3 nta and feso4 in secondary effluents from two mwwtps spiked with smx the results reveal that the continuous flow solar photo fenton process with fe3 nta is the most cost effective strategy for removing microcontaminants similar removal percentages were achieved in both mwwtp effluents operating the process with hrt times of 30 and 60 min respectively which points out the impact of wastewater composition on continuous flow operation in addition it is important to remark that h2o2 consumption by the water matrix and not only the conversion by reaction must be considered when selecting the operating conditions the presented results encourage the research of continuous flow solar photo fenton with fe3 nta at pilot plant scale

13420,this study addresses the comparison of three iron sources to remove sulfamethoxazole smx at 50 μg l as a surrogate contaminant of emerging concern by continuous flow solar photo fenton at neutral ph in secondary effluents from two wastewater treatment plants experiments were conducted in a stirred tank reactor with a liquid depth of 5 cm using two ferric iron complexes 0 1 mm with ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds and nitrilotriacetic acid nta as chelating agents and feso4 0 36 mm in this regard this is the first time fe3 nta has been used in the continuous operation of the photo fenton process on the one hand fe3 edds led to the highest smx removal around 60 in both effluents at hydraulic residence times of 30 and 60 min respectively on the other hand wastewater composition significantly affected reagent consumption and consequently operating costs in terms of cost efficiency of smx removal the order was fe3 nta 3 25 7 81 mgsmx m3 feso4 2 03 5 09 mgsmx m3 fe3

currently immersed has motivated the research for new and efficient alternatives which help to reuse wastewater through processes of disinfection and decontamination of secondary effluents hence municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp must be upgraded in order to mitigate the problems related to the presence of organic micropollutants which are responsible for serious public health problems 1 along these lines a publication of the european chemical agency 2017 2 has revealed the presence of more than 100 000 compounds in surface waters in levels of ng l μg l among which pesticides antibiotics and personal care products can be highlighted these compounds are named contaminants of emerging concern cecs and included in a watch list updated periodically august 2020 in decision 2020 1161 eu 3 as such there is an urgent need to implement tertiary treatments able to improve and comply with the current environmental regulations with this in mind advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as one of the best alternatives 4 6 under these circumstances solar photo fenton process has shown successful results in terms of micropollutant degradation as well as bacterial inactivation 7 9 this can be explained by the large amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by the catalytic cycle of iron ions fe2 and fe3 combined with h2o2 and uv vis radiation one of the main variables that must be considered is the process ph 10 acidic ph is optimal for the photo fenton process since iron is soluble however to work at a large scale the operation at neutral ph is proposed as an alternative regarding the cost associated with the acidification ph control neutralisation post treatment and also to avoid the increase in salinity of treated effluents in this regard two different operating strategies are currently being studied with promising results i the use of ferrous sulfate feso4 at circumneutral ph and ii the use of iron complexes for the first strategy the reaction mechanism can be summarised as follows firstly ferrous iron fe2 reacts with h2o2 reaction 1 to yield hydroxyl radicals h o and ferric iron fe3 that precipitates as iron hydroxides after that the heterogeneous photo fenton process with iron hydroxides f e 3 o h f e 2 fe3 occurs in a redox cycle reactions 2 3 11 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o 2 f e 3 o h h v f e 2 h o 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o as for the second strategy the use of chelating agents allows the iron to be kept in solution and the contribution of the homogeneous photo fenton process enhances micropollutant removal in general the reaction mechanism with iron complexes can be summarised as follows iron complexes fe3 l photoactivate f e 3 l under uv vis radiation giving rise to fe2 reactions 4 5 then ferrous iron is oxidised by h2o2 fenton reaction 1 to yield h o and fe3 which instantaneously precipitates as iron hydroxides 4 f e 3 l h υ f e 3 l 5 f e 3 l f e 2 l the ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds has been revealed as a strong and biodegradable complexing agent with ferric iron fe3 meaning it can be considered environmentally friendly 12 furthermore this complex displays a high level of photo activity which leads to increase h o production for a wide range of ph values 3 9 13 recently nitrilotriacetic acid nta has emerged as another possible complexing agent with successful results in terms of micropollutant degradation as well as a lower cost alternative to edds 14 de luca 15 studied the photo fenton process at neutral ph comparing different iron chelates in batch mode operation confirming the potential of nta for micropollutant removal furthermore cec removal and bacterial inactivation have been studied at neutral ph using edds and nta as well as iron precipitates in actual secondary effluents from mwwtp 16 18 where the matrix composition can lead to serious operating difficulties 19 indeed soriano molina et al 20 assessed the effect of different mwwtp effluents for micropollutant degradation showing the significant effect of the real matrix on this type of treatment this evaluation is very important because the feasibility of tertiary treatments can be highly affected by the water matrix composition as a result different factors such as the dissolved organic carbon doc the turbidity and the concentration of phosphate and chloride ions can be a critical issue that means the study and monitoring of this variable is absolutely necessary to operate an advanced oxidation process under real conditions most of the studies mentioned above were carried out in batch mode however for processes with short reaction times continuous mode operation is recommended concerning that the use of feso4 was evaluated in terms of bacterial inactivation operating in continuous flow with a real mwwtp effluent this operating mode was able to achieve bacterial inactivation under the detection limit 1 cfu ml with hydraulic residence times hrt of around 30 60 min depending on the season in which the system is operated 21 on the other hand the use of edds has also been evaluated when operating in continuous flow mode 22 in this case the research focused on the evaluation of micropollutant degradation however regarding the use of fe3 nta for continuous flow mode processes only the work of dong 23 has been found in the literature where carbamazepine

concentrations and low cec initial concentration is necessary in addition the impact of iron source on operating cost should be considered before scaling up the process the main goal of this work is to assess the effect of iron source and mwwtp effluent composition on the continuous flow operation of the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph to this end the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx was selected as the model cec at an initial concentration of 50 μg l this antibiotic was selected because is a recalcitrant contaminant frequently detected in the aquatic environment 24 25 in addition this compound is included in the watch list of substances for european union wide monitoring reported in decision 2020 1161 eu of 4 june 2020 3 the experiments were carried out with three iron sources fe3 edds fe3 nta and feso4 in actual mwwtp effluents from two mwwtps located in almería southeastern spain 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents sulfamethoxazole smx 99 provided by sigma aldrich was selected as the model antibiotic ferric sulphate monohydrate fe2 so4 3 h2o 75 w w ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o 99 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 33 w v were supplied by panreac hplc grade acetonitrile methanol acetic acid glacial 99 w v ortho phenanthroline 99 w w and sulphuric acid 96 w v were also supplied by panreac two different complexing agents were used in this work nitrilotriacetic acid nta 99 w w and ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds 35 w v both supplied by sigma aldrich all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced by a milli q water purification system from merck millipore with a specific resistance of 18 2 mω cm and 5 μg l of doc 2 2 water matrices the experiments were carried out with real secondary effluents from two mwwtps located in the south east of spain almería the first of them called el toyo provided the secondary effluent denoted as se a and the second one called el bobar provided the secondary effluent denoted as se b every week batches of 100 l were collected collected after filtration through sand filters the effluents were stored at laboratory temperature and used for experimentation within the following two days table 1 shows the average composition values of both effluents used during the experimentation 2 3 experimental set up mwwtp effluents were pretreated with sulphuric acid to reduce the concentration of bicarbonate species since it is known that bicarbonate species act as scavengers of ho radicals 10 bicarbonates measured as inorganic carbon ic were reduced from initial value table 1 to 15 mg l due to the acidification pretreatment sulfate concentration increased around 160 mg l and 400 mg l in se a and se b respectively the experimental conditions were based on previous studies 0 36 mm feso4 0 1 mm fe3 edds 0 1 mm fe3 nta both at fe3 l molar ratio of 1 1 and 1 47 mm h2o2 to begin the treatment in batch mode with further reduction to 0 88 mm for continuous flow operation 17 18 every week a stock solution of sxm 3 5 g l was prepared in methanol and prior to the experimentation the solution was diluted down to 50 μg l in the wastewater feed tank methanol increased the doc of the water matrix by 4 mg l experiments were conducted under controlled conditions of uv irradiance in a solar simulator sun test cps set at 30 w m2 and a temperature of 25 thermo scientific neslab rte 7 thermostatic bath fig 1 a stirred tank reactor with a liquid depth of 5 cm was used a spectroradiometer avantes avaspec dual channel fiber optic spectrometer was used to measure uv irradiance on the reactor surface all the experiments were done in duplicate with all the figures showing mean values standard deviation firstly the reactor was started in batch mode for 120 min for that purpose the reactor was loaded charged with the doped effluent and then the h2o2 was added and the initial concentration was checked after 2 min once the system had been prepared the iron source feso4 fe3 edds or fe3 nta was subsequently added and at the same time the reactor was uncovered giving rise to the beginning of the reaction edds and nta increased the doc of the water matrix by 12 mg l and 7 mg l respectively after the batch operation time both feed reagent pumps iron and h2o2 as well as the real mwwtp effluent were switched on and after that the process was carried out in continuous flow for 3 h the hrts were set according to the results obtained in the batch operation 2 4 chemical and analytical determinations iron and hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured by a standardised method in this case the o phenantroline standardised method according to iso 6332 and titanium iv oxysulphate solution spectro photometric method at 410 nm method din 38 402 h15 respectively the quantification limits were 3 6 10 3 mm and 2 9 10 2 mm for iron and hydrogen peroxide respectively doc and ic were analysed by a shimadzu toc vcsn analyser the anions described in table 1 were determined by ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact ic pro while smx concentration was monitored by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography using a diode array detector uhplc dad agilent technologies 1200 series instrument the analytical method uses 10 solution of acetonitrile as mobile phase and 90 of dilute formic acid 0 1 v v to be more precise a gradient method was used which consisted of an initial 10 of acetonitrile that was progressively increased to 100 over 12 min providing an smx retention time of 3 min the smx detection wavelength and the smx quantification limit were 267 nm and 5 μg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of iron source and mwwtp effluent composition to evaluate the effect of iron source on the kinetics of the solar photo fenton process an experimental plan was carried out with fe3 nta fe3 edds and feso4 in actual secondary effluents collected from two mwwtps named el toyo se a and el bobar se b as can be observed in table 1 doc concentration and turbidity in se b were 2 and 3 times higher than in se a respectively nonetheless conductivity was almost the same in both effluents all the experiments were carried out in batch and continuous flow mode under the operating conditions described in section 2 3 3 1 1 batch mode operation as can be seen in fig 2 a and b when using fe3 nta the iron remained in solution for longer than with fe3 edds this is due to fe3 edds being more photoactive 17 and consequently it is photo decomposed r4 r5 faster giving rise to fe2 that reacts with h2o2 r1 after 30 min of reaction the average concentrations of iron remaining in se a were 0 034 mm and 0 004 mm for fe3 nta and fe3 edds respectively for the experiments with feso4 the dissolved iron profile is not shown because it precipitated after the initial fenton reaction r1 r2 instantaneously in general iron remained in solution for a longer time in se b than in se a with the average concentrations of iron remaining in solution after 30 min of reaction being 0 058 mm and 0 012 mm for fe3 nta and fe3 edds respectively this could be explained by the attenuation of light penetration in se b due to the higher turbidity 12 4 in se b vs 4 1 in se a table 1 leading to a lower rate of photon absorption meaning iron complexes would remain in solution for a longer time without being photo decomposed when using iron complexes h2o2 consumption followed pseudo first order kinetics in both secondary effluents in se a the reaction rate with fe3 edds was 2 7 times faster than with fe3 nta fig 2c and table 2 due to the higher photon absorption of fe3 edds leading to the faster generation of ferrous iron fe2 consequently h2o2 consumption and hydroxyl radical generation as a result of the fenton reaction r1 were also accelerated in addition with fe3 edds the h2o2 consumption stopped after 50 min of reaction due to all the iron complex was photo decomposed however with fe3 nta the consumption continued as there was iron in solution and the same h2o2 conversion 40 as with fe3 edds was achieved after 90 min of reaction in se a as for the assays with feso4 the reaction occurred in two stages in the first stage a fast initial drop of 22 is observed in h2o2 concentration due to the fast initial fenton reaction r1 giving rise to a stoichiometric amount of hydroxyl radicals and ferric iron fe3 that instantaneously precipitated as ferric hydroxides in the second stage a slower h2o2 consumption related to the heterogeneous photo fenton reaction with ferric hydroxides r2 r3 is observed in this case the reaction rate was zero order in concordance with previous work 18 regarding the effect of the water matrix h2o2 consumption in se b was 1 3 1 1 and 2 2 times faster with fe3 edds fe3 nta and feso4 respectively than in se a fig 2c and d to evaluate this phenomenon blank assays of h2o2 consumption in the absence of iron were carried out in the dark in both mwwtp effluents the results showed a significant and variable h2o2 consumption in se b 38 18 after 120 min whereas in se a there was no consumption of h2o2 this explains the higher h2o2 consumption during the photo fenton experiments in se b as such when scaling up the process the effect of water matrix on reagent consumption must be considered and not only the conversion by reaction h2o2 consumption in actual wastewater could be explained by the following hypotheses i the presence of a significant concentration of reactive species such as nitrite ions no2 which react with h2o2 yielding peroxynitrite ions onoo 26 and ii the presence of a high concentration of aerobic bacteria which are commonly used in biological treatment to decompose organic matter these bacteria contain the enzyme catalase which is responsible for h2o2 decomposing to water and oxygen 27 considering that concentrations of nitrite ions in both effluents were negligible 1 2 mg l table 1 the first hypothesis was discarded in addition the higher doc concentration in this effluent 20 mg l in se b vs 9 1 in se a table 1 could also contribute to h2o2 consumption concerning smx removal fig 2e and f there is a parallelism between h2o2 consumption and contaminant degradation profiles the higher rate of complex photo decomposition when using fe3 edds led to a faster generation of hydroxyl radicals and consequently smx removal was faster when compared with the use of fe3 nta with both complexes microcontaminant removal followed pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants were 3 and 6 times higher with fe3 edds in se a and se b respectively table 2 after 30 min of reaction with fe3 edds at which point more than 90 of iron was precipitated smx degradation stopped whereas with fe3 nta the reaction continued as there was iron in solution the same removal percentage 86 was achieved with both iron complexes after 90 min of the reaction in se a as for the effect of water matrix the kinetic constants were 35 with fe3 edds and 67 with fe3 nta lower in se b table 2 than in se a in concordance with the lower rate of photon absorption of iron complexes the higher doc content which acts as a sink for hydroxyl radicals and the h2o2 consumption by water matrix the lower reaction rates with fe3 nta could explain the greater effect of the water matrix when using this complex as the longer the reaction time the higher the impact of secondary reactions with the matter present in the water with feso4 an initial drop in smx profile due to the initial fenton was observed achieving 46 and 36 antibiotic removal in se a and se b respectively however during the heterogeneous redox cycle r2 r3 the removal percentage was not increased pointing out that the heterogeneous photo fenton process is not efficient for cec removal considering the reaction time at which more than 80 and 70 smx removal was achieved in se a with fe3 edds and fe3 nta respectively an hrt of 30 min was set for the continuous flow operation in se a as for the treatment of se b hrt was extended to 60 min due to the lower reaction rates 3 1 2 continuous mode operation once the feed pumps for reagents and wastewater were switched on both reagent and smx concentrations increased with regard to the end of the batch wise operation reaching steady state in less than 30 min nonetheless when using feso4 as the iron source the steady state concentration of h2o2 in se a 0 30 mm was reached after 60 min this delay is due to the concentration of h2o2 remaining in this effluent after batch operation with feso4 0 98 mm being higher than with iron complexes and it was also higher than the concentration added to the reaction bulk during the continuous flow operation 0 88 mm in line with the lower rate of photon absorption of fe3 nta the steady state concentration of total dissolved iron was higher with fe3 nta than with fe3 edds in se a the values were 0 042 mm with fe3 nta and 0 030 mm with fe3 edds and consequently the steady state concentrations of h2o2 were 0 54 mm and 0 63 mm respectively in se b concentrations of iron were 0 049 mm with fe3 nta and 0 022 mm with fe3 edds however for h2o2 consumption steady state was not reached in this regard it needs to be taken into account that reagent stock solutions were prepared in actual effluents to avoid dilution when adding them to the reaction bulk and there was an effect of the water matrix on h2o2 consumption in se b consequently the concentration of oxidant in the stock solution decreased over the experimental time giving rise to a decrease in h2o2 profiles during the continuous flow operation despite this the reaction with iron complexes and contaminant degradation were not affected as h2o2 was the excess reactant in contrast to what is observed during the operation in batch mode during the continuous flow operation the h2o2 consumption with feso4 was higher than with iron complexes in both effluents this is due to the continuous addition of h2o2 and fe2 to the reactor giving rise to a continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals through the initial fenton reaction r1 and not only during the first few minutes of treatment as occurred in batch mode operation 28 however the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals during the continuous flow operation with feso4 did not improve the smx removal efficiency indeed removal percentages in steady state 40 in se a and 34 in se b were lower than in batch operation accordingly it can be concluded that there was an inefficient consumption of h2o2 probably due to the continuous addition of oxidant enhanced the unwanted reaction between h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals 29 the steady state percentages of smx removal in se a were 60 with fe3 edds 47 with fe3 nta and 40 with feso4 whereas in se b the values were 56 44 and 35 respectively comparing the results obtained in both water matrices differences between removal percentages were less than 10 so it could be concluded that the same removal efficiency was achieved in se b and se a with hrts of 30 min and 60 min respectively these results highlight the impact of the composition of mwwtp effluents on the continuous flow operation in addition the removal percentages agree with those obtained by arzate et al 22 and de la obra et al 30 who reported that it is possible to remove around 60 and 30 of the total load of cecs detected in mwwtp effluents with fe3 edds and feso4 respectively in raceway pond reactors rprs operated in continuous flow mode therefore the selection of smx as a surrogate of the total microcontaminants as a whole has been validated the results reveal that in terms of cec removal the process with fe3 edds is the most efficient however the treatment costs also play an important role when choosing the iron source 3 2 economic assessment to compare different strategies regarding solar photo fenton it is fundamental to consider its economic feasibility to this end operating costs were estimated as reagent and electricity consumption it is worth mentioning that this study is based on data obtained at laboratory scale and large scale research is needed for rigorous economic assessment the costs were calculated assuming the continuous flow operation of a 5 cm deep raceway pond reactor rpr under the same conditions of reagent concentration effluent composition and hrt as in the experimental runs considering 200 l day of wastewater generation per population equivalent 31 the design flow rate was set at 400 m3 day to comply with the european directive 91 271 eec 32 the total number of operating hours per day were set at 7 5 h 365 days per year bearing in mind the annual average hours per day at which solar irradiance is 10 w m2 in almería city energy costs included requirements for mixing in the photoreactor reactant dosing and wastewater pumping the price of electricity and the unitary power of paddle wheel for mixing were set at 0 1 kwh and 0 03 kw h m3 respectively 20 in addition the electricity cost of the centrifugal pump for wastewater pumping with an energy consumption of 0 25 kw h m3 and the electricity cost of three pumps for reactant dosing with an energy consumption of 0 83 kw h m3 each were considered as for reagent costs the industrial grade prices were 0 95 kg nta 99 w w 3 5 l edds 35 w v 0 1 l h2so4 98 w w 0 45 l h2o2 33 w v 0 71 kg fe2 so4 3 h2o and 0 72 kg feso4 7h2o 17 18 table 3 shows operating cost and economic efficiency in terms of mg of smx removed per unit of treated water volume and unit of currency estimated for the different strategies of solar photo fenton being investigated in this work as mentioned above the composition of mwwtp effluents substantially affects the kinetics of the process and consequently the hrt must be set as a function of this variable to achieve the treatment goal along these lines the unitary operating costs estimated for the treatment of se b with an hrt of 60 min are 0 02 m3 higher than those estimated for the treatment of se a with an hrt of 30 min this increase is mainly due to the greater h2so4 consumption in se b to reduce ic concentration down to 15 mg l in addition the longer the hrt the greater the energy consumption for mixing in the photoreactor as increasing hrt requires a larger reactor surface to treat the design flow rate however the effect of hrt on operating cost could be considered negligible as when increasing the hrt from 30 min se a to 60 min se b the energy costs only increase by 1 in contrast hrt has a great effect on economic efficiency as the values estimated for the operation with an hrt of 30 min are around 2 times higher than for 60 min table 3 concerning the iron source the treatment with fe3 edds 0 1 mm is the most expensive due to the high cost of the chelating agent and this represents almost 80 of the total operating cost fig 3 on replacing the use of this complex with fe3 nta 0 1 mm the operating cost is reduced by 75 furthermore it is important to remark that economic efficiency increases by three times table 3 in this case the cost is mainly affected by h2o2 and energy consumption whereas the chelating agent represents less than 20 as for the process with feso4 0 36 mm iron salt represents 50 of total cost and this treatment is less efficient and 30 more expensive when compared with the use of fe3 nta 0 1 mm thus it can be concluded that the strategy of solar photo fenton with fe3 nta is the most cost effective 4 conclusions the operation of the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph has been assessed in batch and continuous flow mode with three different iron sources fe3 edds fe3 nta and feso4 in secondary effluents from two mwwtps spiked with smx the results reveal that the continuous flow solar photo fenton process with fe3 nta is the most cost effective strategy for removing microcontaminants similar removal percentages were achieved in both mwwtp effluents operating the process with hrt times of 30 and 60 min respectively which points out the impact of wastewater composition on continuous flow operation in addition it is important to remark that h2o2 consumption by the water matrix and not only the conversion by reaction must be considered when selecting the operating conditions the presented results encourage the research of continuous flow solar photo fenton with fe3 nta at pilot plant scale

13421,winery wastewater is characterized by high organic content low nutrient content and low ph at least during vintage periods the effect of nutrient shortage and low ph on constructed wetlands cws operation was scarcely studied but early field studies indicate that some operational problems can arise this work aims to determine the effect of nutrient shortage and acidic ph during the treatment of high organic load wastewater in one step vertical subsurface flow vf cws two lab scale vf units at hydraulic loading rates over 70 l m2 d and surface loading rate in the range of 110 170 g cod m2 d were operated for periods with and without nutrients in the influent as well as with influent ph of 7 0 and 4 5 the results showed that neither low nutrient nor low ph impair organic matter removal whilst low ph decreased nitrogen removal rates at low ph the effluent concentration of ammonia and nitrate increased indicating deterioration in both nitrification and denitrification processes the paper discuss the implications of these findings for a better strategy in the treatment of winery process wastewater such as options for separate treatment or its combination with other nutrient containing streams keywords constructed wetlands winery wastewater high organic load low ph nutrient shortage 1 introduction in the last two decades constructed wetlands cws have been successfully applied to different kind of effluents including wastewater from petrochemical industry food industry meat processing dairy industry fruit and vegetable canning forestry winery and distillery textile tanning aquaculture metal finishing and mining among others 1 2 the wine industry produces wastewater throughout the different processes of wine production winery wastewater comes mainly from the washing waters of equipment and bottles and from the cooling processes and represents a serious environmental problem in wine producing countries this requires the adoption of measures ensuring that their potential environmental impacts are minimal and within an acceptable range 3 5 the characteristics of the effluents and the seasonal variability make the use of cw for the treatment of wastewater from wineries of special interest 3 4 6 winery wastewaters contain higher concentrations of soluble organic matter readily biodegradable and variable content of suspended solids chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations vary from 340 to 49 000 mg l total suspended solids tss from 12 to 18 300 mg l and biological oxygen demand bod5 is about 0 4 0 9 of the cod value 3 7 9 even higher concentration values were recorded 4 the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in winery wastewaters is usually low and the ph is acidic the recalcitrant constituents account for less than 10 of total cod 7 conventional biological treatment systems as well as co treatment in municipal wastewater treatment plants are not effective for effluents from the wine industry particularly for small scale wineries due to their cost and complexity 4 9 10 this is because the wastewater from these facilities is highly concentrated in terms of cod and have shown highly variable flows and loadings daily and seasonal nature based on site solutions like constructed wetlands cws have been taken into consideration 3 6 7 11 the surface loading rates slrs applied to the 13 cw systems reviewed by masi et al 3 ranged from about 30 up to about 5000 g cod m2 d with the 80th percentile of the reported values being below 297 g cod m2 d and the median at 164 g cod m2 d the highest slr values have in all cases been measured during the peak season vintage and often linked to lower surface removal rates srrs despite the high interest in recent years for this treatment alternative percentage removal rate showed a high variability ranging from 49 to 99 low removal efficiencies can affect both the removal of organic matter and nitrogen 3 6 among the main problems in processing winery wastewater masi et al 3 listed variable ph and low nutrient content and consequent unfavourable c n ratio for the microbial growth johnson and mehrvar 4 reported the addition of nutrients for the biological treatment of winery wastewater in conventional systems while other authors 12 14 reported the addition of nutrients during the treatment of other types of wastewater in cws in the case of winery wastewater this practice is based on theoretical considerations about bacterial growth in biological systems and not on empirical studies that demonstrate it 4 thus considering the large variability of treatment efficiency and surface removal rates in cw systems treating winery wastewater and the sudden increase in applied loading rates during the vintage period our first hypothesis is that a negative effect of nutrient shortage on the treatment efficiency of vf cw treating this kind of effluents may not be discarded on the other hand serrano et al 15 indicated the possibility of a negative effect caused by the low ph values registered which ranged from 3 3 to 7 2 and reported the use of sodium hydroxide addition to the inﬂuent arienzo et al 16 found winery wastewater toxic to wetland plant species and other biological tests species and prescribed ph neutralization in some cases the combination of different types of effluents may increase the level of nutrients in the treated wastewater but it is usually not enough to correct the ph 6 17 thus our second hypothesis is that low ph values can affect not only the removal of organic matter but also the processes of nitrogen transformation i e nitrification and denitrification whose microbial populations are generally more sensitive to unfavourable environmental conditions despite the evidence already mentioned no specific study has been found in the literature on the effect of nutrient level or ph on the performance of cws treating wastewater from wineries thus this work aims to determine the effect of nutrient shortage and acidic ph during the treatment of high organic load wastewater in vf cws to do this two laboratory scale vf cw units were operated in parallel under high load rates and varying the ph and nutrient content of the influent 2 material and methods 2 1 lab scale vf cw units two lab columns vf1 and vf2 units of 13 9 cm diameter were used as vf cw systems fig 1 the effective height was 50 cm consisting of an upper layer of 5 cm of 0 25 2 mm sand a main filtering layer of 35 cm of 4 8 mm gravel and a 10 cm drainage layer at the bottom of 8 16 mm gravel vf units were fed intermittently by pulses each 3 h for 4 days with rest periods of 3 days a week both columns were planted with phragmites australis 5 young seedlings about 30 cm tall and monitored during subsequent operational periods with and without nutrients in the influent vf1 as well as with an influent ph of 6 5 and 4 5 vf2 the influent entered the vf units over the filtering medium by means of a peristaltic pump dinko instruments d 21 v in an intermittent mode and drained by gravity to the bottom of the column and from there to a receiving tank the units were operated without resting 12 pulses per day during start up period and onwards with a weekly feeding regimen of 4 day on and 3 days resting 8 pulses per day following previously recommended feeding strategies 18 2 2 winery synthetic wastewater to prepare the synthetic feed red wine and white vinegar have been used as sources of organic matter whose cod concentrations were 203 g l and 71 g l respectively these components as well as sources of macro and micro nutrients were added as indicate in table 1 to prepare a concentrate stock solution from several considerations about the requirements of nitrogen n and phosphorus p for bacterial growth and typical biomass yields in cws 13 19 a cod n p ratio of 250 7 1 was used as reference for non limitation of nutrients the concentrated was first diluted with distilled water to the required concentration and the ph was regulated to circa neutral 6 5 7 0 or acidic 4 5 values as required by adding naoh or hcl on the other hand nutrients were not added to the vf1 unit during some operational periods 2 3 analysis and monitoring tss cod bod5 total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and phosphates po4 3 p were determined in composite samples collected weekly i e during the 4 day feeding period besides in situ measurement of ph dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp was carried out allylthiourea was used as a nitrification inhibitor in bod5 assays analytical methods were carried out in duplicated as described in standard methods 20 an integrated ph redox 26 crison electrode was used for ph and orp determination a selective electrode crison 9663 for ammonia and a ysi proodo electrode for do the determination of no3 n was made in a biochrom libra s6 spectrophotometer following the second derivative method of the uv absorption spectrum 20 to analyze tn samples were first digested with potassium persulfate to oxidize all the nitrogenous compounds to no3 and after that the nitrates were determined by spectrophotometry the viscosity of the effluents was measured using a cannon fenske viscometer with a glass capillary 0 42 mm in diameter the infiltration rate was periodically determined in both columns for this the effluent flow was measured for an entire dosing cycle in order to obtain the effluent flow profile and derived parameters particularly the mean retention time tm defined as the time required to drain off the 50 of the wastewater volume added in a feeding pulse 2 4 operational characteristics and surface loading rates the operational characteristics of the vf units are shown in table 2 the start up period lasted 43 days and was followed by a reference period of 2 3 weeks in which both columns operated in the same conditions subsequently vf1 unit was subjected to nutrient shortage and vf2 unit to low ph for about 2 months of operation table 2 the influent cod concentration was established in the range of 1500 2100 mg l which was considered representative of winery wastewater during harvesting and wine making periods 6 during the start up period both columns were fed with a high hydraulic loading rate and so with a high surface loading rate which averaged 133 13 and 172 44 g cod m2 d for vf1 and vf2 cw units respectively after start up slightly lower but similar slr were applied in both columns this type of down flow columns were used extensively to simulate actual high rate vf cws 18 vf cws fed intermittently with large pulses batch mode lead to flooding of the bed surface and then wastewater is gradually percolated down through the bed being collected by the drainage layer at the base 7 21 one of the features of unsaturated vf cws is that most of the pulse volume must be drained before the next pulse occurs which necessarily leads to a short retention time thus the very short retention time of discrete water pulses is typical of unsaturated vertical flow cws 21 23 while biological processes improve due to complex phenomena such as sorption and the transfer of compounds to the retained interstitial water after the pulse favoured by the large specific surface area of the filtering media on the other hand the rapid drainage of the water pulse allows oxygen to enter the filtering bed which greatly increases biomass activity and degradation processes 21 22 in the opposite situation non separation of drainage episodes and approach to continuous effluent flow would indicate hydraulic clogging of the vf cw and reduced oxygenation rates 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up and operation of vf units treating high strength winery wastewater the effluent characteristics and removal efficiency of the vf units are shown in table 3 the slrs applied table 2 were approximately the same as the median reported by masi et al 3 for field systems that treat wastewater from wineries while surface removal rates were higher in addition the volumetric load rates twice the slr due to the total bed height of 0 5 m and the resulting ratio of 0 5 m3 bed m2 bed were clearly higher than those applied by welz and le roes hill 24 and holtman et al 25 i e 46 and 152 g cod m3 d respectively for biological sand filters treating winery wastewater on the other hand the higher slr applied in vf2 in relation to vf1 can explain the higher effluent concentration in cod and bod5 and the slightly lower cod and bod5 percentage removal in vf2 in any case cod removal was high reaching 88 in vf2 and 95 in vf1 whilst bod5 removal was approximately 97 in both cases nutrient removal was high during the start up period reaching 86 89 removal of ammonia and tn and 60 76 of phosphorus taking into account the nitrogen slr and the removal percentage the columns removed about 3 5 4 5 g tn m2 d accounting up for cod and tn removal the performance of both vf units is indicative of high oxygen transfer rates 18 during start up a large part of the removed nutrients had probably been used for biomass growth as suggested by estimation of biomass yields and required nutrient availability in similar conditions 14 nutrient limitations have not been observed because the effluent of both columns still contained sufficient nitrogen and phosphorus compounds table 3 do concentration and orp was about 6 mg l and 90 mv respectively at the end of the start up period of both columns mean effluent bod5 ranged from 34 mg l vf1 to 42 mg l vf2 which are values above the discharge limit for municipal wastewater i e 25 mg l or even for industrial wastewater 40 mg l 26 this indicates that both columns were slightly overloaded the flow profile of each feeding pulse showed a mean retention time ranging from 5 to 10 min fig 2 however vf1 column suddenly increased the pulse mean retention time to approximately 30 min day 39 of operation indicating a risk of flow clogging to improve operation and reduce the risk of clogging the feeding regime was changed by introducing resting periods so the columns were fed 4 days a week from monday to friday remaining without feeding the other 3 days in addition the influent concentration was reduced as indicated in table 2 reducing the slr to 111 6 g cod m2 d and 67 4 g bod5 m2 d as mean values for both columns since the end of the start up period to the end of operation period in this way during periods ii to iv both columns received similar and constant hydraulic loading rate 70 8 4 1 l m2 d in vf1 and 70 1 l m2 d in vf2 and slr cod and bod5 which were only 1 0 higher in vf1 in comparison to vf2 table 2 effluent tss concentration was similar in both columns during the first three months of operation but onwards were different fig 3 a in overall effluent concentration of tss was higher than influent concentration and probably corresponded to the washout of active biomass washed tss were mainly volatile and contributed to an increase in cod and bod5 in the effluent fig 3b and c the flow profile was similar in both units throughout the entire period of operation fig 2 but tm increased steadily over the operation time after approximately 100 d of operation tm reached 40 min and the columns began to experience clogging episodes revealed by more prolonged flooding of the surface after a feeding event this situation coincided with a strong increase of suspended solids content in the effluent of both units fig 3a as shown in fig 3 a tss washout episode more intense but for less time in vf2 compensated for the delay with respect to biomass washout in vf1 thus a similar amount of tss was removed in both systems in addition a clear although limited decrease in do content took place fig 3d during biomass washout episodes biomass washing episodes are attributed to the short start up period and high slrs applied along with scarce plant development due to the short duration of the experiments this is due to the strategy followed for the study of the two objective factors ph and nutrient effects in laboratory scale systems but interference in this sense was not considered as both factors have a greater effect on microbial processes than on plant development in the case of full scale cws a low load start up is advisable that allows the development of the plants during almost a complete vegetative season prior to the periods of high load harvesting season in addition full scale systems use greater bed depth and larger particle size than those used in the laboratory simulation system all of these factors reduce the risk of clogging which is not usually a problem in wetlands treating winery effluents 27 3 2 the effect of nutrient shortage on the vf1 unit performance the shortage of nutrients in the influent reduced both the effluent concentration and the percentage removal of nitrogen and phosphorus but the effect on cod and bod5 was negligible table 3 ss concentration in effluent ranged from 10 to 30 mg l being not affected by the changes in nutrient content or ph but by the operation time as discussed in section 3 1 significant differences were not found for effluent cod from vf1 at period iii without nutrient addition with respect to period ii of both vf1 and vf2 nor with respect to period iii of vf2 although effluent cod from vf1 at period iii also without nutrient addition was higher than effluent cod from vf1 at period ii this can be attributed to the tss washout due to partial clogging of filtering media as discussed in section 3 1 and not to the effect of the lack of nutrients in fact effluent cod from vf1 at period iii was not statistically different from effluent cod of vf2 at period iv with nutrient addition and circa neutral influent ph in this way the mean cod and bod5 removal during an operation period of about 2 months with high organic load 1573 mg cod l 954 mg bod5 l approximately the length of peak loading of winery wastewater and very low nitrogen and phosphorus load below 3 mg n l and 1 mg p l remained above 93 and 97 respectively and very close to those of reference period the change of the influent with nutrients to the influent without nutrients had a reduced effect on the effluent concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds because this concentration was already very reduced due to the efficient removal in the reference period the effluent concentration of nutrient compounds still decrease during period iii and positive removal percentages were maintained however during period iv mainly during the last days of this period the increase in effluent tss fig 3a was accompanied by a slight increase in nutrient concentration which led to negative removal percentages during period iv of vf1 table 3 the positive effect of nutrient addition was demonstrated in two wetland systems treating a nutrient deficient waste stream aircraft deicing runoff in which the treatment performance improved in response to nutrient addition and operational problems such as foaming and slime formation were eliminated 12 14 these results are contradictory to those obtained in the present study and could be due to the different nature of the effluents treated in both studies murphy et al 14 pointed out that the metabolic response of heterotrophic bacteria growing under nutrient limited conditions is to produce an excess of polysaccharide slime which can result in reduced hydraulic performance in this situation an increase of viscosity occurs however in our study effluent viscosity was low being at period iv only 7 vf1 and 3 vf2 higher than that of distilled water richard 28 stated that checking for nutrient deficiency is to be sure that some ammonia or nitrate and ortho phosphate remain in the effluent at all times and recommended effluent total inorganic nitrogen ammonia plus nitrate and ortho phosphate concentrations of 1 2 mg l to ensure sufficient nutrients following these criteria nutrient deficiency did not occur in this study during the treatment of low nutrient wastewater in fact effluent concentration of inorganic nitrogen and ortho phosphate still increased during the last days of period iv vf1 probable due to nutrient recycling in the filtering bed on the other hand murphy et al 14 found high yield ratios 0 77 0 90 kg bacteria per kg bod5 which were typical of technologies with rapid growth of bacteria whilst technologies that rely on very stable and mature bacteria populations have lower yield ratios 13 cws are extensive systems in which the growth and accumulation of biomass should be low and then the need of nutrients should also be low 3 in this work a cod n p ratio of 250 7 1 was used for the start up and reference periods i and ii for vf1 which corresponded to a potential biomass yield of 0 66 g biomass g bod5 assuming bod5 cod ratio of 0 5 and 8 5 n of cell composition during low nutrient periods iii and iv the cod n p ratio increased up to 7500 7 2 5 potential yield of 0 02 although the cod tn ratio in the influent was very low the small amounts of nutrients available in the synthetic winery wastewater in combination with nutrient recycling in vf1 cw appear to be sufficient for efficient treatment on the other hand if nutrients had to be added the required amounts would be much lower than those proposed by murphy et al 14 for cws treating aircraft deicing runoff who indicate nutrient dosing for a yield of 1 0 the presence of nutrients in our study was even lower than that reported by holtman et al 25 for their long term study cod n p ratio of 1138 1 6 2 4 treating winery wastewater in biological sand filters without nutrient addition to explain why cod removal efficiency was high despite nutrient limitation in the influencer holtman et al 25 point out that bacterial fixation of n can take place in this type of systems 3 3 the effect of low ph on the vf2 unit performance the acidity of winery wastewater in particular during vintage can be considered as a factor influencing the performances even though in most of the experiences examined by masi et al 3 the need for chemical neutralization has not been considered this may be because the ph varies in a very wide range depending on the specific operating conditions of the winery due for example to the use or not of alkaline cleaning products the reported ph ranges from 2 5 to 12 9 4 while several authors have indicated mean values in the range of 4 4 to 6 8 3 11 29 which are not extremely acidic however very acidic ph values are also common especially during harvest when the highest contaminant loads are generated ioannou et al 29 reported that approximately half of the studies reviewed recorded ph values below 4 0 in this study the operation at low ph of 4 5 period iii vf2 did not reduce the cod bod5 and phosphate removal efficiency table 3 significant differences were not found for effluent cod from vf2 at period iii influent ph of 4 5 with respect to period ii influent ph of 6 5 of both vf1 and vf2 high percentage removals of 97 98 cod 99 bod5 and 61 68 po4 3 p were obtained at both influent ph values of 6 5 and 4 5 these results are in accordance with the suggestion of serrano et al 6 from multivariate analysis applied to a hybrid cw system treating winery wastewater on a field scale these authors found that the long term effect of low ph on the treatment efficiency cod and bod5 was insignificant ph effect on the performance of horizontal subsurface flow cws was also discarded by de la varga et al 27 however low ph clearly reduces ammonia and tn removal fig 3e effluent concentration of ammonia in vf2 showed a continuous increase during approximately 3 weeks after lowering the influent ph to 4 5 and then remained stable for the rest of period iii ammonia accumulated in the effluent even though the ph of the effluent remained above 5 4 during this period the large removal of cod and bod5 98 99 table 3 means the removal of most organic acids but this effect was not sufficient to maintain the near neutral effluent ph reached in previous periods tn followed the same trend of ammonia whilst nitrate suffered an initial increase up to 7 mg n l and progressively decreased to 3 5 mg n l in spite of the reduction of nitrification effluent nitrate during period iii was higher than during period ii and period iv table 3 in addition ammonia removal decrease from 90 to 21 and tn removal from 93 to 41 thus low influent ph impaired both nitrification and denitrification process nevertheless the effect on nitrification was stronger than the effect on denitrification if nitrified ammonia is considered to have been converted to nitrate i e 9 9 mg n l on average for period iii tables 2 and 3 the vf2 unit continued to remove 72 7 of the nitrate available during the period iii these effects of acidic influent ph occurred in spite that the effluent ph was kept above 5 4 mean value of 5 64 0 25 during period iii of vf2 unit table 3 this behaviour partial neutralization is typical of cw systems treating winery wastewaters cws have the capacity to increase the winery wastewater ph in some extension for example serrano et al 6 reported a ph increase from 5 0 1 2 to 6 0 0 9 when treating winery wastewater at high slr treating the wastewater from wineries in biological sand filters an effective ph neutralization was achieved for a ph influent above 4 6 average influential ph approximately 6 0 and volumetric loading rates of 152 g cod m3 d 25 as well as for a ph influent of 3 5 and volumetric loading rates of 46 g cod m3 d 24 these findings suggest that the application of a lower slr on vf cws would offer greater neutralizing capacity and thus maintain good ammonia removal rates ph increasing or decreasing during wastewater treatment depends not only on the ph of the influent but also on the nature and extent of conversion processes in the cw treating domestic wastewater vf cws clearly enhance nitrification in comparison to horizontal flow cws but nitrate trend to accumulate in the final effluent and limit tn removal limited nitrogen removal was due to the ph decrease to approximately 4 5 which impaired both nitrification and denitrification in a two step vf vf cws system 18 this is because the activity of nitrifying bacteria decreases rapidly when the ph drops below 6 5 30 torrijos et al 18 reported that maintaining effluent ph above 6 through alkalis addition clearly increased nitrification and tn removal in the present study the negative effects of low influent ph were progressively overcome in a short 10 day period after influent ph increase as indicated by the results of period iv vf2 table 3 as indicated by masi et al 3 potential effects of acidic influent ph on the efficiency of cws treating winery wastewater remained unknown reports on this subject for other kind high organic load wastewater are scarce similar to winery wastewater wood waste leachate was characterized by high oxygen demand tannin and lignin and volatile fatty acids vfas but low ph and nutrients during wood waste leachate treatment in cws nutrient addition and ph adjustments helped to improve contaminant removal 31 closer to neutral ph circumstances along with higher mean temperatures during the warmer period of year favoured microbial activity besides lattrie et al 32 reported that a cw treating multiple livestock wastewaters was not capable of reducing high levels of pollutants from the high strength silage leachate and its low ph however the results of the present study clearly indicate that an acidic influent of 4 5 ph did not impair the organic matter and phosphorus removal whilst nitrogen removal rates appeared clearly reduced 3 4 reviewing the strategy for separate or combined treatment of winery wastewater and nitrogen containing effluents the application of constructed wetland systems for the treatment of winery wastewater started in around 2000s in the usa france italy germany spain and south africa nowadays there are for instance about 100 cw systems operating in northern and central italy for winery wastewater 3 cws were recently reported to be the most common type of on site treatment in the niagara region 4 due to the high acidity and lack of nutrients the main trend was to combine the effluents from the wine production process with other effluents available in the vicinity that provided nutrients and contributed to the neutralization of the winery effluent as highlighted by masi et al 3 this is a frequent situation in many small wineries in europe however this may not be the best strategy as the results of this study show results that must be taken into account when designing and operating cw systems that treat combined winery and another type of wastewater containing large amounts of nitrogen according to de la varga et al 1 winery wastewater should not be diverted from other wastewater streams generated in the winery in order to guarantee a minimal level of nutrient availability in fact different kind of effluents can increase the level of nutrients in the treated wastewater 6 17 however the results of this research suggest the potential interest of a separate treatment of wastewater from the winery process when this is the main flow in this situation the incorporation of domestic wastewater and other nutrient containing streams may not be sufficient to neutralize the ph but may add a high level of nitrogen compounds which in turn are difficult to remove if the influent is no further neutralized considering that ph discharge limits are not always required 4 or are less restrictive than limits in n compounds ph range 5 5 9 5 26 this study indicates that winery wastewater with very low nutrient organic load can be treated at high surface loading rates in vf cw to meet tss cod and bod5 discharge limits the use of vf cw can avoid the addition of nutrients and ph adjustment needed for other biological treatment processes as reported by johnson and mehrvar 4 in addition this option limits the presence of pathogenic contamination in the treated effluent which is the main obstacle to meeting some reuse standards 11 as an option a separate pre treatment of the nitrogen rich effluent would be more successful this nitrification pre treatment is very effective in vf cw 33 34 in this case the pre nitrified effluent can then be combined with the winery effluent for final treatment including complete denitrification as the results indicate a lower effect of ph on denitrification than on nitrification alternatively nitrogen rich effluent can be maintained in an always independent cws treatment line using a fraction of the winery raw wastewater as an external carbon source to increase the c n ratio and favour complete denitrification 35 when the aim is to treat the effluent for reuse in irrigation it may always be of interest to keep the streams separate to avoid the presence of pathogens in the treated winery wastewater or to mix them only after their advanced treatment if the conditions of storage require it as the lower content of organic matter in the treated effluents would limit the growth of pathogens 36 4 conclusions one step vf cw units receiving influent cod concentration in the range of 1500 2100 mg l reached percentage removals of 88 98 cod 96 99 bod5 59 93 tn 87 90 ammonia and 59 76 phosphorus at high surface loading rate which ranged from 110 to 172 g cod m2 d typical nutrient shortage of winery effluents and low ph do not affect the removal efficiency of cod and bod5 the vf cw unit receiving an influent with a cod n p ratio 3500 7500 7 2 5 for a period of 2 months approximately the length of peak loading of winery wastewater maintained reduced but steady nutrient concentrations in the effluent due to the low biomass yield and nutrient recycling which contributed to maintain the high treatment efficiency however low ph clearly produced high ammonia effluent concentrations if nitrogen is present in the influent when the ph changed from 6 5 to 4 5 ammonia removal decreased from 90 to 21 and tn removal from 93 to 41 increasing the effluent concentration of both ammonia and nitrate thus low influent ph impaired both nitrification and denitrification processes in vf cws joint treatment of winery wastewater with domestic wastewater and other nutrient containing streams is an option to increase nutrient availability however this is not necessary for the efficient treatment of wastewater from wineries while creating the risk of partial nitrogen removal due to the negative effect of low ph the results indicate that the separate treatment of wastewater from the winery process can be carried out in vf cws at a higher rate without prior ph neutralization and more efficiently than in the case of its combination with other nutrient containing streams funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13421,winery wastewater is characterized by high organic content low nutrient content and low ph at least during vintage periods the effect of nutrient shortage and low ph on constructed wetlands cws operation was scarcely studied but early field studies indicate that some operational problems can arise this work aims to determine the effect of nutrient shortage and acidic ph during the treatment of high organic load wastewater in one step vertical subsurface flow vf cws two lab scale vf units at hydraulic loading rates over 70 l m2 d and surface loading rate in the range of 110 170 g cod m2 d were operated for periods with and without nutrients in the influent as well as with influent ph of 7 0 and 4 5 the results showed that neither low nutrient nor low ph impair organic matter removal whilst low ph decreased nitrogen removal rates at low ph the effluent concentration of ammonia and nitrate increased indicating deterioration in both nitrification and denitrification processes the paper discuss the implications of these findings for a better strategy in the treatment of winery process wastewater such as options for separate treatment or its combination with other nutrient containing streams keywords constructed wetlands winery wastewater high organic load low ph nutrient shortage 1 introduction in the last two decades constructed wetlands cws have been successfully applied to different kind of effluents including wastewater from petrochemical industry food industry meat processing dairy industry fruit and vegetable canning forestry winery and distillery textile tanning aquaculture metal finishing and mining among others 1 2 the wine industry produces wastewater throughout the different processes of wine production winery wastewater comes mainly from the washing waters of equipment and bottles and from the cooling processes and represents a serious environmental problem in wine producing countries this requires the adoption of measures ensuring that their potential environmental impacts are minimal and within an acceptable range 3 5 the characteristics of the effluents and the seasonal variability make the use of cw for the treatment of wastewater from wineries of special interest 3 4 6 winery wastewaters contain higher concentrations of soluble organic matter readily biodegradable and variable content of suspended solids chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations vary from 340 to 49 000 mg l total suspended solids tss from 12 to 18 300 mg l and biological oxygen demand bod5 is about 0 4 0 9 of the cod value 3 7 9 even higher concentration values were recorded 4 the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in winery wastewaters is usually low and the ph is acidic the recalcitrant constituents account for less than 10 of total cod 7 conventional biological treatment systems as well as co treatment in municipal wastewater treatment plants are not effective for effluents from the wine industry particularly for small scale wineries due to their cost and complexity 4 9 10 this is because the wastewater from these facilities is highly concentrated in terms of cod and have shown highly variable flows and loadings daily and seasonal nature based on site solutions like constructed wetlands cws have been taken into consideration 3 6 7 11 the surface loading rates slrs applied to the 13 cw systems reviewed by masi et al 3 ranged from about 30 up to about 5000 g cod m2 d with the 80th percentile of the reported values being below 297 g cod m2 d and the median at 164 g cod m2 d the highest slr values have in all cases been measured during the peak season vintage and often linked to lower surface removal rates srrs despite the high interest in recent years for this treatment alternative percentage removal rate showed a high variability ranging from 49 to 99 low removal efficiencies can affect both the removal of organic matter and nitrogen 3 6 among the main problems in processing winery wastewater masi et al 3 listed variable ph and low nutrient content and consequent unfavourable c n ratio for the microbial growth johnson and mehrvar 4 reported the addition of nutrients for the biological treatment of winery wastewater in conventional systems while other authors 12 14 reported the addition of nutrients during the treatment of other types of wastewater in cws in the case of winery wastewater this practice is based on theoretical considerations about bacterial growth in biological systems and not on empirical studies that demonstrate it 4 thus considering the large variability of treatment efficiency and surface removal rates in cw systems treating winery wastewater and the sudden increase in applied loading rates during the vintage period our first hypothesis is that a negative effect of nutrient shortage on the treatment efficiency of vf cw treating this kind of effluents may not be discarded on the other hand serrano et al 15 indicated the possibility of a negative effect caused by the low ph values registered which ranged from 3 3 to 7 2 and reported the use of sodium hydroxide addition to the inﬂuent arienzo et al 16 found winery wastewater toxic to wetland plant species and other biological tests species and prescribed ph neutralization in some cases the combination of different types of effluents may increase the level of nutrients in the treated wastewater but it is usually not enough to correct the ph 6 17 thus our second hypothesis is that low ph values can affect not only the removal of organic matter but also the processes of nitrogen transformation i e nitrification and denitrification whose microbial populations are generally more sensitive to unfavourable environmental conditions despite the evidence already mentioned no specific study has been found in the literature on the effect of nutrient level or ph on the performance of cws treating wastewater from wineries thus this work aims to determine the effect of nutrient shortage and acidic ph during the treatment of high organic load wastewater in vf cws to do this two laboratory scale vf cw units were operated in parallel under high load rates and varying the ph and nutrient content of the influent 2 material and methods 2 1 lab scale vf cw units two lab columns vf1 and vf2 units of 13 9 cm diameter were used as vf cw systems fig 1 the effective height was 50 cm consisting of an upper layer of 5 cm of 0 25 2 mm sand a main filtering layer of 35 cm of 4 8 mm gravel and a 10 cm drainage layer at the bottom of 8 16 mm gravel vf units were fed intermittently by pulses each 3 h for 4 days with rest periods of 3 days a week both columns were planted with phragmites australis 5 young seedlings about 30 cm tall and monitored during subsequent operational periods with and without nutrients in the influent vf1 as well as with an influent ph of 6 5 and 4 5 vf2 the influent entered the vf units over the filtering medium by means of a peristaltic pump dinko instruments d 21 v in an intermittent mode and drained by gravity to the bottom of the column and from there to a receiving tank the units were operated without resting 12 pulses per day during start up period and onwards with a weekly feeding regimen of 4 day on and 3 days resting 8 pulses per day following previously recommended feeding strategies 18 2 2 winery synthetic wastewater to prepare the synthetic feed red wine and white vinegar have been used as sources of organic matter whose cod concentrations were 203 g l and 71 g l respectively these components as well as sources of macro and micro nutrients were added as indicate in table 1 to prepare a concentrate stock solution from several considerations about the requirements of nitrogen n and phosphorus p for bacterial growth and typical biomass yields in cws 13 19 a cod n p ratio of 250 7 1 was used as reference for non limitation of nutrients the concentrated was first diluted with distilled water to the required concentration and the ph was regulated to circa neutral 6 5 7 0 or acidic 4 5 values as required by adding naoh or hcl on the other hand nutrients were not added to the vf1 unit during some operational periods 2 3 analysis and monitoring tss cod bod5 total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and phosphates po4 3 p were determined in composite samples collected weekly i e during the 4 day feeding period besides in situ measurement of ph dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp was carried out allylthiourea was used as a nitrification inhibitor in bod5 assays analytical methods were carried out in duplicated as described in standard methods 20 an integrated ph redox 26 crison electrode was used for ph and orp determination a selective electrode crison 9663 for ammonia and a ysi proodo electrode for do the determination of no3 n was made in a biochrom libra s6 spectrophotometer following the second derivative method of the uv absorption spectrum 20 to analyze tn samples were first digested with potassium persulfate to oxidize all the nitrogenous compounds to no3 and after that the nitrates were determined by spectrophotometry the viscosity of the effluents was measured using a cannon fenske viscometer with a glass capillary 0 42 mm in diameter the infiltration rate was periodically determined in both columns for this the effluent flow was measured for an entire dosing cycle in order to obtain the effluent flow profile and derived parameters particularly the mean retention time tm defined as the time required to drain off the 50 of the wastewater volume added in a feeding pulse 2 4 operational characteristics and surface loading rates the operational characteristics of the vf units are shown in table 2 the start up period lasted 43 days and was followed by a reference period of 2 3 weeks in which both columns operated in the same conditions subsequently vf1 unit was subjected to nutrient shortage and vf2 unit to low ph for about 2 months of operation table 2 the influent cod concentration was established in the range of 1500 2100 mg l which was considered representative of winery wastewater during harvesting and wine making periods 6 during the start up period both columns were fed with a high hydraulic loading rate and so with a high surface loading rate which averaged 133 13 and 172 44 g cod m2 d for vf1 and vf2 cw units respectively after start up slightly lower but similar slr were applied in both columns this type of down flow columns were used extensively to simulate actual high rate vf cws 18 vf cws fed intermittently with large pulses batch mode lead to flooding of the bed surface and then wastewater is gradually percolated down through the bed being collected by the drainage layer at the base 7 21 one of the features of unsaturated vf cws is that most of the pulse volume must be drained before the next pulse occurs which necessarily leads to a short retention time thus the very short retention time of discrete water pulses is typical of unsaturated vertical flow cws 21 23 while biological processes improve due to complex phenomena such as sorption and the transfer of compounds to the retained interstitial water after the pulse favoured by the large specific surface area of the filtering media on the other hand the rapid drainage of the water pulse allows oxygen to enter the filtering bed which greatly increases biomass activity and degradation processes 21 22 in the opposite situation non separation of drainage episodes and approach to continuous effluent flow would indicate hydraulic clogging of the vf cw and reduced oxygenation rates 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up and operation of vf units treating high strength winery wastewater the effluent characteristics and removal efficiency of the vf units are shown in table 3 the slrs applied table 2 were approximately the same as the median reported by masi et al 3 for field systems that treat wastewater from wineries while surface removal rates were higher in addition the volumetric load rates twice the slr due to the total bed height of 0 5 m and the resulting ratio of 0 5 m3 bed m2 bed were clearly higher than those applied by welz and le roes hill 24 and holtman et al 25 i e 46 and 152 g cod m3 d respectively for biological sand filters treating winery wastewater on the other hand the higher slr applied in vf2 in relation to vf1 can explain the higher effluent concentration in cod and bod5 and the slightly lower cod and bod5 percentage removal in vf2 in any case cod removal was high reaching 88 in vf2 and 95 in vf1 whilst bod5 removal was approximately 97 in both cases nutrient removal was high during the start up period reaching 86 89 removal of ammonia and tn and 60 76 of phosphorus taking into account the nitrogen slr and the removal percentage the columns removed about 3 5 4 5 g tn m2 d accounting up for cod and tn removal the performance of both vf units is indicative of high oxygen transfer rates 18 during start up a large part of the removed nutrients had probably been used for biomass growth as suggested by estimation of biomass yields and required nutrient availability in similar conditions 14 nutrient limitations have not been observed because the effluent of both columns still contained sufficient nitrogen and phosphorus compounds table 3 do concentration and orp was about 6 mg l and 90 mv respectively at the end of the start up period of both columns mean effluent bod5 ranged from 34 mg l vf1 to 42 mg l vf2 which are values above the discharge limit for municipal wastewater i e 25 mg l or even for industrial wastewater 40 mg l 26 this indicates that both columns were slightly overloaded the flow profile of each feeding pulse showed a mean retention time ranging from 5 to 10 min fig 2 however vf1 column suddenly increased the pulse mean retention time to approximately 30 min day 39 of operation indicating a risk of flow clogging to improve operation and reduce the risk of clogging the feeding regime was changed by introducing resting periods so the columns were fed 4 days a week from monday to friday remaining without feeding the other 3 days in addition the influent concentration was reduced as indicated in table 2 reducing the slr to 111 6 g cod m2 d and 67 4 g bod5 m2 d as mean values for both columns since the end of the start up period to the end of operation period in this way during periods ii to iv both columns received similar and constant hydraulic loading rate 70 8 4 1 l m2 d in vf1 and 70 1 l m2 d in vf2 and slr cod and bod5 which were only 1 0 higher in vf1 in comparison to vf2 table 2 effluent tss concentration was similar in both columns during the first three months of operation but onwards were different fig 3 a in overall effluent concentration of tss was higher than influent concentration and probably corresponded to the washout of active biomass washed tss were mainly volatile and contributed to an increase in cod and bod5 in the effluent fig 3b and c the flow profile was similar in both units throughout the entire period of operation fig 2 but tm increased steadily over the operation time after approximately 100 d of operation tm reached 40 min and the columns began to experience clogging episodes revealed by more prolonged flooding of the surface after a feeding event this situation coincided with a strong increase of suspended solids content in the effluent of both units fig 3a as shown in fig 3 a tss washout episode more intense but for less time in vf2 compensated for the delay with respect to biomass washout in vf1 thus a similar amount of tss was removed in both systems in addition a clear although limited decrease in do content took place fig 3d during biomass washout episodes biomass washing episodes are attributed to the short start up period and high slrs applied along with scarce plant development due to the short duration of the experiments this is due to the strategy followed for the study of the two objective factors ph and nutrient effects in laboratory scale systems but interference in this sense was not considered as both factors have a greater effect on microbial processes than on plant development in the case of full scale cws a low load start up is advisable that allows the development of the plants during almost a complete vegetative season prior to the periods of high load harvesting season in addition full scale systems use greater bed depth and larger particle size than those used in the laboratory simulation system all of these factors reduce the risk of clogging which is not usually a problem in wetlands treating winery effluents 27 3 2 the effect of nutrient shortage on the vf1 unit performance the shortage of nutrients in the influent reduced both the effluent concentration and the percentage removal of nitrogen and phosphorus but the effect on cod and bod5 was negligible table 3 ss concentration in effluent ranged from 10 to 30 mg l being not affected by the changes in nutrient content or ph but by the operation time as discussed in section 3 1 significant differences were not found for effluent cod from vf1 at period iii without nutrient addition with respect to period ii of both vf1 and vf2 nor with respect to period iii of vf2 although effluent cod from vf1 at period iii also without nutrient addition was higher than effluent cod from vf1 at period ii this can be attributed to the tss washout due to partial clogging of filtering media as discussed in section 3 1 and not to the effect of the lack of nutrients in fact effluent cod from vf1 at period iii was not statistically different from effluent cod of vf2 at period iv with nutrient addition and circa neutral influent ph in this way the mean cod and bod5 removal during an operation period of about 2 months with high organic load 1573 mg cod l 954 mg bod5 l approximately the length of peak loading of winery wastewater and very low nitrogen and phosphorus load below 3 mg n l and 1 mg p l remained above 93 and 97 respectively and very close to those of reference period the change of the influent with nutrients to the influent without nutrients had a reduced effect on the effluent concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds because this concentration was already very reduced due to the efficient removal in the reference period the effluent concentration of nutrient compounds still decrease during period iii and positive removal percentages were maintained however during period iv mainly during the last days of this period the increase in effluent tss fig 3a was accompanied by a slight increase in nutrient concentration which led to negative removal percentages during period iv of vf1 table 3 the positive effect of nutrient addition was demonstrated in two wetland systems treating a nutrient deficient waste stream aircraft deicing runoff in which the treatment performance improved in response to nutrient addition and operational problems such as foaming and slime formation were eliminated 12 14 these results are contradictory to those obtained in the present study and could be due to the different nature of the effluents treated in both studies murphy et al 14 pointed out that the metabolic response of heterotrophic bacteria growing under nutrient limited conditions is to produce an excess of polysaccharide slime which can result in reduced hydraulic performance in this situation an increase of viscosity occurs however in our study effluent viscosity was low being at period iv only 7 vf1 and 3 vf2 higher than that of distilled water richard 28 stated that checking for nutrient deficiency is to be sure that some ammonia or nitrate and ortho phosphate remain in the effluent at all times and recommended effluent total inorganic nitrogen ammonia plus nitrate and ortho phosphate concentrations of 1 2 mg l to ensure sufficient nutrients following these criteria nutrient deficiency did not occur in this study during the treatment of low nutrient wastewater in fact effluent concentration of inorganic nitrogen and ortho phosphate still increased during the last days of period iv vf1 probable due to nutrient recycling in the filtering bed on the other hand murphy et al 14 found high yield ratios 0 77 0 90 kg bacteria per kg bod5 which were typical of technologies with rapid growth of bacteria whilst technologies that rely on very stable and mature bacteria populations have lower yield ratios 13 cws are extensive systems in which the growth and accumulation of biomass should be low and then the need of nutrients should also be low 3 in this work a cod n p ratio of 250 7 1 was used for the start up and reference periods i and ii for vf1 which corresponded to a potential biomass yield of 0 66 g biomass g bod5 assuming bod5 cod ratio of 0 5 and 8 5 n of cell composition during low nutrient periods iii and iv the cod n p ratio increased up to 7500 7 2 5 potential yield of 0 02 although the cod tn ratio in the influent was very low the small amounts of nutrients available in the synthetic winery wastewater in combination with nutrient recycling in vf1 cw appear to be sufficient for efficient treatment on the other hand if nutrients had to be added the required amounts would be much lower than those proposed by murphy et al 14 for cws treating aircraft deicing runoff who indicate nutrient dosing for a yield of 1 0 the presence of nutrients in our study was even lower than that reported by holtman et al 25 for their long term study cod n p ratio of 1138 1 6 2 4 treating winery wastewater in biological sand filters without nutrient addition to explain why cod removal efficiency was high despite nutrient limitation in the influencer holtman et al 25 point out that bacterial fixation of n can take place in this type of systems 3 3 the effect of low ph on the vf2 unit performance the acidity of winery wastewater in particular during vintage can be considered as a factor influencing the performances even though in most of the experiences examined by masi et al 3 the need for chemical neutralization has not been considered this may be because the ph varies in a very wide range depending on the specific operating conditions of the winery due for example to the use or not of alkaline cleaning products the reported ph ranges from 2 5 to 12 9 4 while several authors have indicated mean values in the range of 4 4 to 6 8 3 11 29 which are not extremely acidic however very acidic ph values are also common especially during harvest when the highest contaminant loads are generated ioannou et al 29 reported that approximately half of the studies reviewed recorded ph values below 4 0 in this study the operation at low ph of 4 5 period iii vf2 did not reduce the cod bod5 and phosphate removal efficiency table 3 significant differences were not found for effluent cod from vf2 at period iii influent ph of 4 5 with respect to period ii influent ph of 6 5 of both vf1 and vf2 high percentage removals of 97 98 cod 99 bod5 and 61 68 po4 3 p were obtained at both influent ph values of 6 5 and 4 5 these results are in accordance with the suggestion of serrano et al 6 from multivariate analysis applied to a hybrid cw system treating winery wastewater on a field scale these authors found that the long term effect of low ph on the treatment efficiency cod and bod5 was insignificant ph effect on the performance of horizontal subsurface flow cws was also discarded by de la varga et al 27 however low ph clearly reduces ammonia and tn removal fig 3e effluent concentration of ammonia in vf2 showed a continuous increase during approximately 3 weeks after lowering the influent ph to 4 5 and then remained stable for the rest of period iii ammonia accumulated in the effluent even though the ph of the effluent remained above 5 4 during this period the large removal of cod and bod5 98 99 table 3 means the removal of most organic acids but this effect was not sufficient to maintain the near neutral effluent ph reached in previous periods tn followed the same trend of ammonia whilst nitrate suffered an initial increase up to 7 mg n l and progressively decreased to 3 5 mg n l in spite of the reduction of nitrification effluent nitrate during period iii was higher than during period ii and period iv table 3 in addition ammonia removal decrease from 90 to 21 and tn removal from 93 to 41 thus low influent ph impaired both nitrification and denitrification process nevertheless the effect on nitrification was stronger than the effect on denitrification if nitrified ammonia is considered to have been converted to nitrate i e 9 9 mg n l on average for period iii tables 2 and 3 the vf2 unit continued to remove 72 7 of the nitrate available during the period iii these effects of acidic influent ph occurred in spite that the effluent ph was kept above 5 4 mean value of 5 64 0 25 during period iii of vf2 unit table 3 this behaviour partial neutralization is typical of cw systems treating winery wastewaters cws have the capacity to increase the winery wastewater ph in some extension for example serrano et al 6 reported a ph increase from 5 0 1 2 to 6 0 0 9 when treating winery wastewater at high slr treating the wastewater from wineries in biological sand filters an effective ph neutralization was achieved for a ph influent above 4 6 average influential ph approximately 6 0 and volumetric loading rates of 152 g cod m3 d 25 as well as for a ph influent of 3 5 and volumetric loading rates of 46 g cod m3 d 24 these findings suggest that the application of a lower slr on vf cws would offer greater neutralizing capacity and thus maintain good ammonia removal rates ph increasing or decreasing during wastewater treatment depends not only on the ph of the influent but also on the nature and extent of conversion processes in the cw treating domestic wastewater vf cws clearly enhance nitrification in comparison to horizontal flow cws but nitrate trend to accumulate in the final effluent and limit tn removal limited nitrogen removal was due to the ph decrease to approximately 4 5 which impaired both nitrification and denitrification in a two step vf vf cws system 18 this is because the activity of nitrifying bacteria decreases rapidly when the ph drops below 6 5 30 torrijos et al 18 reported that maintaining effluent ph above 6 through alkalis addition clearly increased nitrification and tn removal in the present study the negative effects of low influent ph were progressively overcome in a short 10 day period after influent ph increase as indicated by the results of period iv vf2 table 3 as indicated by masi et al 3 potential effects of acidic influent ph on the efficiency of cws treating winery wastewater remained unknown reports on this subject for other kind high organic load wastewater are scarce similar to winery wastewater wood waste leachate was characterized by high oxygen demand tannin and lignin and volatile fatty acids vfas but low ph and nutrients during wood waste leachate treatment in cws nutrient addition and ph adjustments helped to improve contaminant removal 31 closer to neutral ph circumstances along with higher mean temperatures during the warmer period of year favoured microbial activity besides lattrie et al 32 reported that a cw treating multiple livestock wastewaters was not capable of reducing high levels of pollutants from the high strength silage leachate and its low ph however the results of the present study clearly indicate that an acidic influent of 4 5 ph did not impair the organic matter and phosphorus removal whilst nitrogen removal rates appeared clearly reduced 3 4 reviewing the strategy for separate or combined treatment of winery wastewater and nitrogen containing effluents the application of constructed wetland systems for the treatment of winery wastewater started in around 2000s in the usa france italy germany spain and south africa nowadays there are for instance about 100 cw systems operating in northern and central italy for winery wastewater 3 cws were recently reported to be the most common type of on site treatment in the niagara region 4 due to the high acidity and lack of nutrients the main trend was to combine the effluents from the wine production process with other effluents available in the vicinity that provided nutrients and contributed to the neutralization of the winery effluent as highlighted by masi et al 3 this is a frequent situation in many small wineries in europe however this may not be the best strategy as the results of this study show results that must be taken into account when designing and operating cw systems that treat combined winery and another type of wastewater containing large amounts of nitrogen according to de la varga et al 1 winery wastewater should not be diverted from other wastewater streams generated in the winery in order to guarantee a minimal level of nutrient availability in fact different kind of effluents can increase the level of nutrients in the treated wastewater 6 17 however the results of this research suggest the potential interest of a separate treatment of wastewater from the winery process when this is the main flow in this situation the incorporation of domestic wastewater and other nutrient containing streams may not be sufficient to neutralize the ph but may add a high level of nitrogen compounds which in turn are difficult to remove if the influent is no further neutralized considering that ph discharge limits are not always required 4 or are less restrictive than limits in n compounds ph range 5 5 9 5 26 this study indicates that winery wastewater with very low nutrient organic load can be treated at high surface loading rates in vf cw to meet tss cod and bod5 discharge limits the use of vf cw can avoid the addition of nutrients and ph adjustment needed for other biological treatment processes as reported by johnson and mehrvar 4 in addition this option limits the presence of pathogenic contamination in the treated effluent which is the main obstacle to meeting some reuse standards 11 as an option a separate pre treatment of the nitrogen rich effluent would be more successful this nitrification pre treatment is very effective in vf cw 33 34 in this case the pre nitrified effluent can then be combined with the winery effluent for final treatment including complete denitrification as the results indicate a lower effect of ph on denitrification than on nitrification alternatively nitrogen rich effluent can be maintained in an always independent cws treatment line using a fraction of the winery raw wastewater as an external carbon source to increase the c n ratio and favour complete denitrification 35 when the aim is to treat the effluent for reuse in irrigation it may always be of interest to keep the streams separate to avoid the presence of pathogens in the treated winery wastewater or to mix them only after their advanced treatment if the conditions of storage require it as the lower content of organic matter in the treated effluents would limit the growth of pathogens 36 4 conclusions one step vf cw units receiving influent cod concentration in the range of 1500 2100 mg l reached percentage removals of 88 98 cod 96 99 bod5 59 93 tn 87 90 ammonia and 59 76 phosphorus at high surface loading rate which ranged from 110 to 172 g cod m2 d typical nutrient shortage of winery effluents and low ph do not affect the removal efficiency of cod and bod5 the vf cw unit receiving an influent with a cod n p ratio 3500 7500 7 2 5 for a period of 2 months approximately the length of peak loading of winery wastewater maintained reduced but steady nutrient concentrations in the effluent due to the low biomass yield and nutrient recycling which contributed to maintain the high treatment efficiency however low ph clearly produced high ammonia effluent concentrations if nitrogen is present in the influent when the ph changed from 6 5 to 4 5 ammonia removal decreased from 90 to 21 and tn removal from 93 to 41 increasing the effluent concentration of both ammonia and nitrate thus low influent ph impaired both nitrification and denitrification processes in vf cws joint treatment of winery wastewater with domestic wastewater and other nutrient containing streams is an option to increase nutrient availability however this is not necessary for the efficient treatment of wastewater from wineries while creating the risk of partial nitrogen removal due to the negative effect of low ph the results indicate that the separate treatment of wastewater from the winery process can be carried out in vf cws at a higher rate without prior ph neutralization and more efficiently than in the case of its combination with other nutrient containing streams funding this

13422,the hydrothermal method was used to prepare flexible biocl bioi films on one stainless steel wire mesh nano flower like biocl bioi crystals consisted of nanoplates were formed and biocl was uniformly distributed the xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra confirm the formation of biocl bioi heterojunction which enhanced the visible light absorption of the bioi film the photocatalytic activity of the biocl bioi film in degrading rhb and mb was elevated by at most 8 7 and 2 4 times respectively comparing with the individual bioi film we designed and constructed a piezo photocatalytic platform in which the prepared biocl bioi films were fixed on a rotating shaft compared with the static state the photocatalytic activity of the biocl bioi film was increased by 1 4 times when the shaft was rotating we believe that the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity should be ascribed to the piezoelectric field by introducing bending deformation which accelerated the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes the improvement mechanism of the photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic performance was proposed and discussed the flexible biocl bioi heterojunction films show significant application potential in the pollution control of fluid fields such as rivers oceans waterfalls and air keywords biocl bioi heterojunction flexible films charge separation piezo photocatalytic dye degradation 1 introduction for more than ten years bismuth oxyhalides biox x cl br and i have been extensively studied as a promising photocatalyst owing to their unique tetragonal structure a layer structure characterized by bi2o2 slabs interleaved by double slabs of halogen atoms which results in the generation of plate morphology 1 3 this two dimensional nanostructure is conducive to separating and transferring of photogenerated electrons and holes improving their photocatalytic activity 4 5 their bandgap values are approximately 3 64 3 46 2 78 and 1 85 ev for biof biocl biobr and bioi respectively 5 9 bioi with the smallest bandgap energy shows the strongest visible light absorption however the photocatalytic efficiency of individual biox is still low limiting their practical applications owing to their inherent drawbacks large bandgap values low light harvesting few activity sites and so on 10 the heterojunction of biox such as biocl bioi may combine the merits of biocl and bioi simultaneously 3 therefore many researchers have prepared biocl bioi and studied its photocatalytic performance in particular bioi based heterojunction semiconductors exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than individual biox semiconductors because the heterojunction efficiently reduced the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and extend the lifetime of charge carriers 5 11 the hydrothermal method is an effective and facile way to prepare biocl bioi nanoparticles for example chen and his coworkers prepared biocl bioi composites by this method and evaluated their photocatalytic degradation of mb methylene blue and rhb rhodamine b dyes 3 zhu synthesized biocl bioi heterojunction with exposed 001 facet with highly enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance 10 zhong prepared bioi biocl heterojunction and studied the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge pairs 12 more scholars prefer to carry out the solvothermal method to prepare biocl bioi heterojunction for example nan and zhang prepared 3d biocl bioi composite microspheres which showed excellent photocatalytic degradation ability of bisphenol a 5 zhang and his coworkers fabricated pd biocl bioi flower like composites 13 zhu prepared in situ grown hierarchical biocl bioi hollow flower like microspheres on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and tested their photocatalytic degradation ability of rhb in solution 14 liu prepared biocl bioi composites which were used as the photocatalytic fuel cell s anode 15 some other methods including the chemical bath method 16 precipitation method 17 18 and ionic liquid assisted ultrasonic method 19 have also been used to prepared biocl bioi composites however all the existing studies have only focused on biocl bioi nanoparticles as far as we know there has been almost no report focusing on biocl bioi film which could be used in photocatalytic applications wang and his coworkers reported piezo potential enhanced photocatalytic degradation of organic dye using zno nanowires 20 which opened a new way of piezo photocatalysis research under the piezoelectric field s driving the photo induced electrons and holes will separate more quickly resulting in higher photocatalytic performance among all the semiconductor photocatalysts zno films 21 26 knbo3 27 28 nanbo3 29 batio3 30 and na0 5bi0 5tio3 31 33 have been tried to couple the piezoelectric effect and photocatalysis piezoelectric film is highly anticipated in the environmental and energy fields because of its high sensitivity to capturing moderately intermittent pressure 34 35 however the study of the piezoelectric effect for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of biocl bioi has not been reported so far we designed and prepared flexible biocl bioi films on sus304 a stainless steel wire mesh using a facile hydrothermal method in this work by adjusting the ratio of biocl to bioi we significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the bioi films we also designed and built a piezo photocatalytic system by introducing relative movement between the biocl bioi films and the organic pollutant solution the improvement mechanism of photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic activity was also discussed the improvement in the photocatalytic performance of biocl bioi films attributing to the piezoelectric effect provides us with a new approach for the practical application of photocatalytic technology 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of the biocl bioi films before preparing the biocl bioi films commercial stainless steel sus304 wire diameter 0 1 mm mesh number 100 mesh as the substrate of the biocl bioi films was cut into pieces of 40 mm 60 mm the sus304 mesh pieces were then ultrasonically cleaned in hcl solution 2 mol l absolute ethanol and deionized water in turn for 10 min individually they were taken out and left to dry naturally in the air for use second the reaction solution for the subsequent hydrothermal preparation was prepared as described below 120 ml of ethylene glycol eg purity 98 aladdin china 20 ml of deionized water and 7 77 g of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 3 5h2o purity 99 innochem china were mixed and thoroughly stirred using a magnetic stirrer until bi no3 3 was completely dissolved the concentration of the obtained bi no3 3 solution was 0 1 mol l 2 390 g of potassium iodide ki purity 99 innochem china and 0 119 g of potassium chloride kcl purity 99 8 aladdin china were added to the above bi no3 3 solution to prepare biocl bioi films to increase the prepared films adhesion on sus304 wire mesh we added 100 mg of polyvinyl pyrrolidone c6h9no n in the above solution and stirred the reaction solution for 15 min the prepared sample from the above reaction solution was named 10 biocl bioi as the nominal atomic ratio of bi i cl was 10 9 1 in the control experiment the added amounts of ki and kcl were adjusted to 2 125 g and 0 239 g respectively to prepare the 20 biocl bioi film to understand the effect of biocl we also prepared pure bioi film 0 biocl bioi with the adding amount 2 656 g of ki subsequently 80 ml of the prepared reaction solution and four cleaned pieces of sus304 mesh were put into a stainless steel reactor lined with ptfe poly tetra fluoroethylene with a volume of 100 ml it should be noted that the sus304 mesh needs to be placed vertically against the lining the reactor was then transferred to a muffle furnace heated to 413 k holding five hours with a 5 k min heating rate after cooling to room temperature the samples were taken out and washed in deionized water after there was no apparent powder falling off from the sus304 mesh the specimens were soaked in absolute ethanol for two hours and then took them out for drying naturally 2 2 characterization xrd x ray diffraction d8 advance bruker germany was used to confirm the prepared specimens crystal phases the surface morphology observation and element distribution analysis were performed with sem scanning electron microscopy apreo fei america equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy escalab 250xi thermo america carried out the surface element and their chemical valence analysis a uv vis ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 3600 plus shimadzu japan monitored the prepared samples optical properties 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic activity rhb and mb in aqueous solution were chosen as the target pollutants to evaluate the prepared specimens photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic activity a 300 w xe lamp beijing aulight technology co ltd china equipped with an optical filter to cut off the light with a wavelength less than 420 nm was used as the visible light source the optical power density reaching the prepared samples with a dimension of 40 mm 60 mm was approximately 45 mw cm2 the initial concentration and volume of the mb and rhb solution were 10 mg l and 300 ml respectively the mb and rhb solution concentrations were measured every 30 min using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr3900 hach america with the absorbance peaks at 664 and 553 nm respectively in the piezo photocatalytic degradation of mb and rhb organic dyes all the photocatalytic activity evaluation conditions were retained fig 1 shows the schematic diagram and the photo of our self made piezo photocatalytic platform in fig 1a the size of the samples submerged into the solution was 40 mm 30 mm two pieces of the samples were fixed on the acrylic rotating rod with a distance of 3 cm a speed regulating motor drove the rotating rod with a rotation speed of 30 rpm revolutions per minute the visible light from the xe lamp shined on the two pieces of the prepared films from the upper side we recorded a video of the testing process and uploaded it as an attachment fig s1 to understand the piezoelectric effect s degradation efficiency we turned off the xe lamp but let the motor continued to work in the control test the concentration of the mb or rhb solution was measured every 30 min using the above method 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of the prepared samples as shown all the peaks in the xrd pattern of the sample 0 biocl bioi pure bioi could be well indexed to the pure tetragonal bioi phase jcpds no 10 0445 the results are in good agreement with that in published work 36 for the sample 20 biocl bioi one intense diffraction peak approximately at 32 81 of 2θ corresponding to tetragonal biocl phase jcpds no 06 0249 was detected this crystal type of biocl photocatalyst is also prevalent in published studies 12 16 37 in the xrd pattern of the sample 10 biocl bioi several diffraction peaks corresponding to biocl were discovered which should be ascribed to its large loading amount of biocl on bioi film we confirm the formation of the bioi film and biocl bioi film on sus304 wire mesh from the xrd patterns fig 3 shows the sem images of the prepared samples surface morphology in fig 3a a flower like network film formed the flower like microstructure was assembled by plenty of nanosheets with dimensions of dozens of nanometers the micron sized flowers gathered and bonded together which can significantly increase its specific surface area here pvp was used as a stabilizer and a dispersing agent described in zhang s work 36 from the above xrd results and the following eds analysis we can determine that this flower like microstructure is bioi its flower like microstructure of bioi has been very common in published scientific papers 4 9 36 39 for the sample 10 biocl bioi flower like microstructures look more like spheres fig 3b more micron sized flowers with dimensions of approximately 2 μm bonded together which made the film thicker in some locations for the specimen 20 biocl bioi fig 3c the formed film was more uniform without apparent aggregation of micron sized flower like or spherical particles even if micron sized flower like particles appeared the agglomeration degree of the nanosheets that made up these flower like particles is not as high as the former two samples besides the eds analysis for the selective area was also performed with the element mapping shown in fig 4 element bi i cl and o were uniformly distributed in the selected area of the micron sized flower it indicates bioi and biocl formed in the hydrothermal process the element change in the chosen region analyzed by eds is shown in table 1 we can see that the amount of element cl increased when the amount of kcl was added doubled although the increased amount did not double it suggests that the amount of biocl in biocl bioi composite film increased fig 5 shows the xps spectra of all the as prepared specimens in fig 5a bi 4f spectra are illustrated in which two high peaks at 159 1 and 164 4 ev can be ascribed to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively they confirmed the bismuth species in the film were bi3 cations 12 in fig 5b two peaks with the binding energy of 618 9 and 630 5 ev should be ascribed to i 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 respectively which indicates the chemical valence of i in the film is 1 valence 13 in fig 5c there is no pronounced peak belonging to cl 2p for the sample 0 biocl bioi indicating there is no element cl in the film in other words the sample 0 biocl bioi consists of pure bioi after ki was added to the reaction solution twp peaks at the binding energies of 197 9 and 199 5 ev ascribing to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 with 1 of chemical valence were detected 40 it also confirmed the formation of the biocl bioi heterojunction it is worth noting that the peak heights corresponding to cl 2p increased when the additive amount of ki was increased indicating the amount of the formed biocl was also increased the result is well consistent with the eds results shown in table 1 besides the fermi level of biocl was lower than bioi 14 which caused the photogenerated electron transfer from bioi to biocl in other words the spatial separation of the photo induced electron hole pairs in biocl bioi film was achieved this is the reason why we decorated bioi film with biocl to form biocl bioi heterojunction the absorbance spectra of the as prepared biocl bioi films are shown in fig 6 for the pure bioi film 0 biocl bioi there is a steep shape of the absorption spectra decreasing around 600 nm which indicates that the absorption is due to the bandgap transition 37 after coupling with biocl the visible light absorption of the bioi based film became stronger in the wavelength of 600 nm however the absorption threshold shifted toward a smaller wavelength the absorption edges of the sample 0 biocl bioi 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi are 685 598 and 525 nm respectively the forbidden width bandgap value of the composite films can be estimated according to the following formula 40 1 eg 1240 λg where eg and λg are the bandgap value and the absorption threshold respectively with the formula he bandgap values of the sample 0 biocl bioi 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi are 1 81 2 07 and 2 36 ev respectively the pure bioi film s bandgap value prepared here 0 biocl bioi is close to the values reported in the literature 9 18 the bandgap increase should result from the formation of biocl bioi heterojunction the enhancement of visible light absorption should facilitate the utilization of visible light and thereby the improvement of visible light photocatalytic performance fig 7 represents the photocatalytic degradation of rhb and mb organic dyes in aqueous solutions we observed from fig 7a that the pure bioi film 0 biocl bioi only degraded no more than 20 rhb within 150 min of visible light irradiation however the sample 10 biocl bioi decomposed approximately 80 rhb with the same irradiation time fig 7b shows that the degradation rate constant k of the sample 0 biocl bioi was only 0 0015 min 1 on the other hand the k values of the sample 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi increased to 0 0099 and 0 0146 min 1 respectively it means the bioi film s photocatalytic activity increased by 8 7 times at most by coupling with biocl in other words coupling with biocl allows the photocatalytic activity of the prepared bioi film to be significantly improved the photocatalytic degradation of mb is shown in fig 7c and d in which the prepared samples exhibited higher photocatalytic performance in degrading mb compared with rhb the pure bioi film degraded more than 75 mb within 150 min of visible light irradiation on the other hand the biocl bioi films 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi completely decomposed mb within the same irradiation time from the perspective of the degradation rate constant we confirmed that in the photocatalytic degradation of mb the 20 biocl bioi film had a 2 4 times improvement in photocatalytic activity compared to the pure film therefore the biocl bioi heterojunction film s formation played a key role in improving the photocatalytic performance of bioi films fig 8 shows the photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic degradation of rhb when keeping in a dark place the prepared films absorbed a certain amount of rhb dye resulting in the rhb concentration decreased to some extent as shown in fig 8a in the evaluation of piezo photocatalytic performance the prepared specimens were rotating with the rotating shaft although the piezo photocatalytic platform was kept in a dark place as we imagined the concentration of the rhb solution was lower than that when the samples did not rotate the difference in rhb concentration is due to the piezoelectric catalytic effect in fig 8b the degradation rate constant k of rhb solution under photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic conditions were given we found that the k value for piezo photocatalysis is 2 4 times the value for photocatalysis it shows that the piezoelectric effect has played a key role in the improvement of photocatalytic performance semiconductors energy levels of their valence band vb and conduction band cb can be calculated according to the following equations 41 42 2 evb x ee 0 5eg 3 ecb evb eg where x ee and eg are the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor the free energy of electron in hydrogen scale about 4 5 ev and the bandgap value respectively the values of eg and x for bioi are 1 85 and 2 67 ev respectively therefore the ecb and evb of bioi were calculated to be 0 79 and 2 64 ev respectively on the other hand the ecb and evb of biocl were 0 42 and 3 88 ev respectively a possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism of rhb and mb by the biocl bioi film is proposed as shown in fig 9 a when the prepared biocl bioi heterojunction films are exposed under visible light irradiation bioi will be inspired by visible light but biocl could not since only the light with a wavelength smaller than 397 nm could excite the electrons in its valence band vb to its conduction band cb 14 the electrons excited by visible light in bioi would transfer from its vb to its cb subsequently the photogenerated electrons on the surface of bioi could migrate quickly to the cb of biocl through the interface of the biocl bioi heterojunction in this way the photo induced electron hole pairs are separated spatially thereby avoiding their recombination in other words more effective electrons and holes can take part in the photocatalytic redox therefore higher photocatalytic performance can be expected although biocl cannot be inspired by visible light e g 3 46 ev it can accept the electrons from organic dyes including rhb and mb due to dye sensitization 3 43 therefore biocl also exhibited photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of rhb and mb the inspired electrons transferred to biocl could react with oxygen to produce superoxide radicals o 2 which further oxidize the organic pollutants including rhb and mb to carbon dioxide and water besides the holes in the vb of bioi transferred to the surface of bioi and then oxidized organic pollutants directly the holes on the surface of bioi can also react with oh to generate hydroxyl radicals oh which can oxidize almost all organic substances the above analysis explains why the photocatalytic activity of 10 biocl bioi heterojunction film is more than 8 7 times higher than that of the pure bioi film fig 9b describes the influence of the piezoelectric field on the photogenerated electrons and holes when the specimen pieces rotated with the rotating shaft the relative motion between the samples and the rhb or mb solution occurred which exerted a small external force on the biocl bioi nanoplates under the action of the external force the biocl bioi nanoplates could experience a bending deformation the strain can generate positive piezoelectric charges at the tensile region and negative piezoelectric charges at the compressive region 25 an internal built in electric field was formed by the accumulation of the localized positive and negative polarization charges on opposite crystal surfaces 26 the electrons and holes separated by the piezoelectric field can react with o2 and oh to form o 2 and oh respectively these reactive oxidizing species can oxidize organic pollutants including rhb and mb it explains the concentration of rhb solution dropped rapidly when the samples rotated in the dark the decrease in dye concentration was attributed to pure piezoelectric degradation when the film is rotating and irradiated by visible light the coupling of the piezoelectric field and the heterojunction accelerated the separation of the photo induced electrons and holes thereby restraining the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes the above analysis explains the reason why piezo photocatalytic activity is higher than pure piezoelectric catalysis or photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes the flexible biocl bioi films show excellent potential prospects in terms of needs such as water purification rivers oceans and waterfalls and air treatment since they can provide fluid fields besides the films are light and thin allowing the films to float on the surface of the water thereby making full use of solar energy however the intensity influence of the piezoelectric field on the improvement of photocatalytic activity and the relationship between the external force field and the micro deformation of nanostructures need more in depth research 4 conclusions flexible biocl bioi films on sus304 wire mesh were prepared by the hydrothermal method the formed biocl and bioi were the tetragonal phase the nanoflower like biocl bioi consisted of nanoplates and biocl was evenly distributed the xps spectra confirm the formation of the biocl bioi heterojunction the biocl bioi heterojunction construction enhanced the visible light absorption of bioi film but increased the band gap value with the increase in the nominal loading amount of biocl the bandgap value was increased compared with the single bioi film prepared by the same method the photocatalytic activity of the biocl bioi film in degrading rhb and mb was increased by 8 7 and 2 4 times respectively we fixed the prepared biocl bioi films on a rotating shaft on the self made rotating photocatalytic platform and rotated them compared with the static state the photocatalytic activity was increased by 1 4 times we believe that the improvement should be ascribed to the piezoelectric field generated by a small strain which accelerated the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes the

13422,the hydrothermal method was used to prepare flexible biocl bioi films on one stainless steel wire mesh nano flower like biocl bioi crystals consisted of nanoplates were formed and biocl was uniformly distributed the xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra confirm the formation of biocl bioi heterojunction which enhanced the visible light absorption of the bioi film the photocatalytic activity of the biocl bioi film in degrading rhb and mb was elevated by at most 8 7 and 2 4 times respectively comparing with the individual bioi film we designed and constructed a piezo photocatalytic platform in which the prepared biocl bioi films were fixed on a rotating shaft compared with the static state the photocatalytic activity of the biocl bioi film was increased by 1 4 times when the shaft was rotating we believe that the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity should be ascribed to the piezoelectric field by introducing bending deformation which accelerated the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes the improvement mechanism of the photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic performance was proposed and discussed the flexible biocl bioi heterojunction films show significant application potential in the pollution control of fluid fields such as rivers oceans waterfalls and air keywords biocl bioi heterojunction flexible films charge separation piezo photocatalytic dye degradation 1 introduction for more than ten years bismuth oxyhalides biox x cl br and i have been extensively studied as a promising photocatalyst owing to their unique tetragonal structure a layer structure characterized by bi2o2 slabs interleaved by double slabs of halogen atoms which results in the generation of plate morphology 1 3 this two dimensional nanostructure is conducive to separating and transferring of photogenerated electrons and holes improving their photocatalytic activity 4 5 their bandgap values are approximately 3 64 3 46 2 78 and 1 85 ev for biof biocl biobr and bioi respectively 5 9 bioi with the smallest bandgap energy shows the strongest visible light absorption however the photocatalytic efficiency of individual biox is still low limiting their practical applications owing to their inherent drawbacks large bandgap values low light harvesting few activity sites and so on 10 the heterojunction of biox such as biocl bioi may combine the merits of biocl and bioi simultaneously 3 therefore many researchers have prepared biocl bioi and studied its photocatalytic performance in particular bioi based heterojunction semiconductors exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than individual biox semiconductors because the heterojunction efficiently reduced the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and extend the lifetime of charge carriers 5 11 the hydrothermal method is an effective and facile way to prepare biocl bioi nanoparticles for example chen and his coworkers prepared biocl bioi composites by this method and evaluated their photocatalytic degradation of mb methylene blue and rhb rhodamine b dyes 3 zhu synthesized biocl bioi heterojunction with exposed 001 facet with highly enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance 10 zhong prepared bioi biocl heterojunction and studied the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge pairs 12 more scholars prefer to carry out the solvothermal method to prepare biocl bioi heterojunction for example nan and zhang prepared 3d biocl bioi composite microspheres which showed excellent photocatalytic degradation ability of bisphenol a 5 zhang and his coworkers fabricated pd biocl bioi flower like composites 13 zhu prepared in situ grown hierarchical biocl bioi hollow flower like microspheres on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and tested their photocatalytic degradation ability of rhb in solution 14 liu prepared biocl bioi composites which were used as the photocatalytic fuel cell s anode 15 some other methods including the chemical bath method 16 precipitation method 17 18 and ionic liquid assisted ultrasonic method 19 have also been used to prepared biocl bioi composites however all the existing studies have only focused on biocl bioi nanoparticles as far as we know there has been almost no report focusing on biocl bioi film which could be used in photocatalytic applications wang and his coworkers reported piezo potential enhanced photocatalytic degradation of organic dye using zno nanowires 20 which opened a new way of piezo photocatalysis research under the piezoelectric field s driving the photo induced electrons and holes will separate more quickly resulting in higher photocatalytic performance among all the semiconductor photocatalysts zno films 21 26 knbo3 27 28 nanbo3 29 batio3 30 and na0 5bi0 5tio3 31 33 have been tried to couple the piezoelectric effect and photocatalysis piezoelectric film is highly anticipated in the environmental and energy fields because of its high sensitivity to capturing moderately intermittent pressure 34 35 however the study of the piezoelectric effect for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of biocl bioi has not been reported so far we designed and prepared flexible biocl bioi films on sus304 a stainless steel wire mesh using a facile hydrothermal method in this work by adjusting the ratio of biocl to bioi we significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the bioi films we also designed and built a piezo photocatalytic system by introducing relative movement between the biocl bioi films and the organic pollutant solution the improvement mechanism of photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic activity was also discussed the improvement in the photocatalytic performance of biocl bioi films attributing to the piezoelectric effect provides us with a new approach for the practical application of photocatalytic technology 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of the biocl bioi films before preparing the biocl bioi films commercial stainless steel sus304 wire diameter 0 1 mm mesh number 100 mesh as the substrate of the biocl bioi films was cut into pieces of 40 mm 60 mm the sus304 mesh pieces were then ultrasonically cleaned in hcl solution 2 mol l absolute ethanol and deionized water in turn for 10 min individually they were taken out and left to dry naturally in the air for use second the reaction solution for the subsequent hydrothermal preparation was prepared as described below 120 ml of ethylene glycol eg purity 98 aladdin china 20 ml of deionized water and 7 77 g of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 3 5h2o purity 99 innochem china were mixed and thoroughly stirred using a magnetic stirrer until bi no3 3 was completely dissolved the concentration of the obtained bi no3 3 solution was 0 1 mol l 2 390 g of potassium iodide ki purity 99 innochem china and 0 119 g of potassium chloride kcl purity 99 8 aladdin china were added to the above bi no3 3 solution to prepare biocl bioi films to increase the prepared films adhesion on sus304 wire mesh we added 100 mg of polyvinyl pyrrolidone c6h9no n in the above solution and stirred the reaction solution for 15 min the prepared sample from the above reaction solution was named 10 biocl bioi as the nominal atomic ratio of bi i cl was 10 9 1 in the control experiment the added amounts of ki and kcl were adjusted to 2 125 g and 0 239 g respectively to prepare the 20 biocl bioi film to understand the effect of biocl we also prepared pure bioi film 0 biocl bioi with the adding amount 2 656 g of ki subsequently 80 ml of the prepared reaction solution and four cleaned pieces of sus304 mesh were put into a stainless steel reactor lined with ptfe poly tetra fluoroethylene with a volume of 100 ml it should be noted that the sus304 mesh needs to be placed vertically against the lining the reactor was then transferred to a muffle furnace heated to 413 k holding five hours with a 5 k min heating rate after cooling to room temperature the samples were taken out and washed in deionized water after there was no apparent powder falling off from the sus304 mesh the specimens were soaked in absolute ethanol for two hours and then took them out for drying naturally 2 2 characterization xrd x ray diffraction d8 advance bruker germany was used to confirm the prepared specimens crystal phases the surface morphology observation and element distribution analysis were performed with sem scanning electron microscopy apreo fei america equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy escalab 250xi thermo america carried out the surface element and their chemical valence analysis a uv vis ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 3600 plus shimadzu japan monitored the prepared samples optical properties 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic activity rhb and mb in aqueous solution were chosen as the target pollutants to evaluate the prepared specimens photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic activity a 300 w xe lamp beijing aulight technology co ltd china equipped with an optical filter to cut off the light with a wavelength less than 420 nm was used as the visible light source the optical power density reaching the prepared samples with a dimension of 40 mm 60 mm was approximately 45 mw cm2 the initial concentration and volume of the mb and rhb solution were 10 mg l and 300 ml respectively the mb and rhb solution concentrations were measured every 30 min using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr3900 hach america with the absorbance peaks at 664 and 553 nm respectively in the piezo photocatalytic degradation of mb and rhb organic dyes all the photocatalytic activity evaluation conditions were retained fig 1 shows the schematic diagram and the photo of our self made piezo photocatalytic platform in fig 1a the size of the samples submerged into the solution was 40 mm 30 mm two pieces of the samples were fixed on the acrylic rotating rod with a distance of 3 cm a speed regulating motor drove the rotating rod with a rotation speed of 30 rpm revolutions per minute the visible light from the xe lamp shined on the two pieces of the prepared films from the upper side we recorded a video of the testing process and uploaded it as an attachment fig s1 to understand the piezoelectric effect s degradation efficiency we turned off the xe lamp but let the motor continued to work in the control test the concentration of the mb or rhb solution was measured every 30 min using the above method 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of the prepared samples as shown all the peaks in the xrd pattern of the sample 0 biocl bioi pure bioi could be well indexed to the pure tetragonal bioi phase jcpds no 10 0445 the results are in good agreement with that in published work 36 for the sample 20 biocl bioi one intense diffraction peak approximately at 32 81 of 2θ corresponding to tetragonal biocl phase jcpds no 06 0249 was detected this crystal type of biocl photocatalyst is also prevalent in published studies 12 16 37 in the xrd pattern of the sample 10 biocl bioi several diffraction peaks corresponding to biocl were discovered which should be ascribed to its large loading amount of biocl on bioi film we confirm the formation of the bioi film and biocl bioi film on sus304 wire mesh from the xrd patterns fig 3 shows the sem images of the prepared samples surface morphology in fig 3a a flower like network film formed the flower like microstructure was assembled by plenty of nanosheets with dimensions of dozens of nanometers the micron sized flowers gathered and bonded together which can significantly increase its specific surface area here pvp was used as a stabilizer and a dispersing agent described in zhang s work 36 from the above xrd results and the following eds analysis we can determine that this flower like microstructure is bioi its flower like microstructure of bioi has been very common in published scientific papers 4 9 36 39 for the sample 10 biocl bioi flower like microstructures look more like spheres fig 3b more micron sized flowers with dimensions of approximately 2 μm bonded together which made the film thicker in some locations for the specimen 20 biocl bioi fig 3c the formed film was more uniform without apparent aggregation of micron sized flower like or spherical particles even if micron sized flower like particles appeared the agglomeration degree of the nanosheets that made up these flower like particles is not as high as the former two samples besides the eds analysis for the selective area was also performed with the element mapping shown in fig 4 element bi i cl and o were uniformly distributed in the selected area of the micron sized flower it indicates bioi and biocl formed in the hydrothermal process the element change in the chosen region analyzed by eds is shown in table 1 we can see that the amount of element cl increased when the amount of kcl was added doubled although the increased amount did not double it suggests that the amount of biocl in biocl bioi composite film increased fig 5 shows the xps spectra of all the as prepared specimens in fig 5a bi 4f spectra are illustrated in which two high peaks at 159 1 and 164 4 ev can be ascribed to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively they confirmed the bismuth species in the film were bi3 cations 12 in fig 5b two peaks with the binding energy of 618 9 and 630 5 ev should be ascribed to i 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 respectively which indicates the chemical valence of i in the film is 1 valence 13 in fig 5c there is no pronounced peak belonging to cl 2p for the sample 0 biocl bioi indicating there is no element cl in the film in other words the sample 0 biocl bioi consists of pure bioi after ki was added to the reaction solution twp peaks at the binding energies of 197 9 and 199 5 ev ascribing to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 with 1 of chemical valence were detected 40 it also confirmed the formation of the biocl bioi heterojunction it is worth noting that the peak heights corresponding to cl 2p increased when the additive amount of ki was increased indicating the amount of the formed biocl was also increased the result is well consistent with the eds results shown in table 1 besides the fermi level of biocl was lower than bioi 14 which caused the photogenerated electron transfer from bioi to biocl in other words the spatial separation of the photo induced electron hole pairs in biocl bioi film was achieved this is the reason why we decorated bioi film with biocl to form biocl bioi heterojunction the absorbance spectra of the as prepared biocl bioi films are shown in fig 6 for the pure bioi film 0 biocl bioi there is a steep shape of the absorption spectra decreasing around 600 nm which indicates that the absorption is due to the bandgap transition 37 after coupling with biocl the visible light absorption of the bioi based film became stronger in the wavelength of 600 nm however the absorption threshold shifted toward a smaller wavelength the absorption edges of the sample 0 biocl bioi 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi are 685 598 and 525 nm respectively the forbidden width bandgap value of the composite films can be estimated according to the following formula 40 1 eg 1240 λg where eg and λg are the bandgap value and the absorption threshold respectively with the formula he bandgap values of the sample 0 biocl bioi 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi are 1 81 2 07 and 2 36 ev respectively the pure bioi film s bandgap value prepared here 0 biocl bioi is close to the values reported in the literature 9 18 the bandgap increase should result from the formation of biocl bioi heterojunction the enhancement of visible light absorption should facilitate the utilization of visible light and thereby the improvement of visible light photocatalytic performance fig 7 represents the photocatalytic degradation of rhb and mb organic dyes in aqueous solutions we observed from fig 7a that the pure bioi film 0 biocl bioi only degraded no more than 20 rhb within 150 min of visible light irradiation however the sample 10 biocl bioi decomposed approximately 80 rhb with the same irradiation time fig 7b shows that the degradation rate constant k of the sample 0 biocl bioi was only 0 0015 min 1 on the other hand the k values of the sample 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi increased to 0 0099 and 0 0146 min 1 respectively it means the bioi film s photocatalytic activity increased by 8 7 times at most by coupling with biocl in other words coupling with biocl allows the photocatalytic activity of the prepared bioi film to be significantly improved the photocatalytic degradation of mb is shown in fig 7c and d in which the prepared samples exhibited higher photocatalytic performance in degrading mb compared with rhb the pure bioi film degraded more than 75 mb within 150 min of visible light irradiation on the other hand the biocl bioi films 10 biocl bioi and 20 biocl bioi completely decomposed mb within the same irradiation time from the perspective of the degradation rate constant we confirmed that in the photocatalytic degradation of mb the 20 biocl bioi film had a 2 4 times improvement in photocatalytic activity compared to the pure film therefore the biocl bioi heterojunction film s formation played a key role in improving the photocatalytic performance of bioi films fig 8 shows the photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic degradation of rhb when keeping in a dark place the prepared films absorbed a certain amount of rhb dye resulting in the rhb concentration decreased to some extent as shown in fig 8a in the evaluation of piezo photocatalytic performance the prepared specimens were rotating with the rotating shaft although the piezo photocatalytic platform was kept in a dark place as we imagined the concentration of the rhb solution was lower than that when the samples did not rotate the difference in rhb concentration is due to the piezoelectric catalytic effect in fig 8b the degradation rate constant k of rhb solution under photocatalytic and piezo photocatalytic conditions were given we found that the k value for piezo photocatalysis is 2 4 times the value for photocatalysis it shows that the piezoelectric effect has played a key role in the improvement of photocatalytic performance semiconductors energy levels of their valence band vb and conduction band cb can be calculated according to the following equations 41 42 2 evb x ee 0 5eg 3 ecb evb eg where x ee and eg are the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor the free energy of electron in hydrogen scale about 4 5 ev and the bandgap value respectively the values of eg and x for bioi are 1 85 and 2 67 ev respectively therefore the ecb and evb of bioi were calculated to be 0 79 and 2 64 ev respectively on the other hand the ecb and evb of biocl were 0 42 and 3 88 ev respectively a possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism of rhb and mb by the biocl bioi film is proposed as shown in fig 9 a when the prepared biocl bioi heterojunction films are exposed under visible light irradiation bioi will be inspired by visible light but biocl could not since only the light with a wavelength smaller than 397 nm could excite the electrons in its valence band vb to its conduction band cb 14 the electrons excited by visible light in bioi would transfer from its vb to its cb subsequently the photogenerated electrons on the surface of bioi could migrate quickly to the cb of biocl through the interface of the biocl bioi heterojunction in this way the photo induced electron hole pairs are separated spatially thereby avoiding their recombination in other words more effective electrons and holes can take part in the photocatalytic redox therefore higher photocatalytic performance can be expected although biocl cannot be inspired by visible light e g 3 46 ev it can accept the electrons from organic dyes including rhb and mb due to dye sensitization 3 43 therefore biocl also exhibited photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of rhb and mb the inspired electrons transferred to biocl could react with oxygen to produce superoxide radicals o 2 which further oxidize the organic pollutants including rhb and mb to carbon dioxide and water besides the holes in the vb of bioi transferred to the surface of bioi and then oxidized organic pollutants directly the holes on the surface of bioi can also react with oh to generate hydroxyl radicals oh which can oxidize almost all organic substances the above analysis explains why the photocatalytic activity of 10 biocl bioi heterojunction film is more than 8 7 times higher than that of the pure bioi film fig 9b describes the influence of the piezoelectric field on the photogenerated electrons and holes when the specimen pieces rotated with the rotating shaft the relative motion between the samples and the rhb or mb solution occurred which exerted a small external force on the biocl bioi nanoplates under the action of the external force the biocl bioi nanoplates could experience a bending deformation the strain can generate positive piezoelectric charges at the tensile region and negative piezoelectric charges at the compressive region 25 an internal built in electric field was formed by the accumulation of the localized positive and negative polarization charges on opposite crystal surfaces 26 the electrons and holes separated by the piezoelectric field can react with o2 and oh to form o 2 and oh respectively these reactive oxidizing species can oxidize organic pollutants including rhb and mb it explains the concentration of rhb solution dropped rapidly when the samples rotated in the dark the decrease in dye concentration was attributed to pure piezoelectric degradation when the film is rotating and irradiated by visible light the coupling of the piezoelectric field and the heterojunction accelerated the separation of the photo induced electrons and holes thereby restraining the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes the above analysis explains the reason why piezo photocatalytic activity is higher than pure piezoelectric catalysis or photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes the flexible biocl bioi films show excellent potential prospects in terms of needs such as water purification rivers oceans and waterfalls and air treatment since they can provide fluid fields besides the films are light and thin allowing the films to float on the surface of the water thereby making full use of solar energy however the intensity influence of the piezoelectric field on the improvement of photocatalytic activity and the relationship between the external force field and the micro deformation of nanostructures need more in depth research 4 conclusions flexible biocl bioi films on sus304 wire mesh were prepared by the hydrothermal method the formed biocl and bioi were the tetragonal phase the nanoflower like biocl bioi consisted of nanoplates and biocl was evenly distributed the xps spectra confirm the formation of the biocl bioi heterojunction the biocl bioi heterojunction construction enhanced the visible light absorption of bioi film but increased the band gap value with the increase in the nominal loading amount of biocl the bandgap value was increased compared with the single bioi film prepared by the same method the photocatalytic activity of the biocl bioi film in degrading rhb and mb was increased by 8 7 and 2 4 times respectively we fixed the prepared biocl bioi films on a rotating shaft on the self made rotating photocatalytic platform and rotated them compared with the static state the photocatalytic activity was increased by 1 4 times we believe that the improvement should be ascribed to the piezoelectric field generated by a small strain which accelerated the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes the excellent piezo photocatalytic activity of biocl bioi film is ascribed to the coupling of piezoelectric field and biocl bioi heterojunction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13423,with the rapid development of industrialization and globalization in recent years an increasing amount of textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater has been discharged into the environment current wastewater treatment technology has difficulty meeting all the practical requirements of harmless wastewater discharge and therefore the exploration and development of new technologies to treat various types of wastewater is urgently needed advanced oxidation processes aops have the advantages of strong oxidation ability complete decomposition of organic pollutants and no secondary pollution and scientists have found that the introduction of nanocatalysts with good performance into aops can achieve excellent treatment effects numerous studies have shown that the introduction of catalysts to aops can greatly improve the treatment effect these results demonstrate that aops may be an efficient approach for the large scale treatment of wastewater however there are very few systematic reviews that address the treatment of textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater by aops this study provides a unique focus on the advantages and disadvantages of single aops aops combined with nanocatalsyts and other technologies for the treatment of textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residual wastewater and several critical mechanisms of the degradation of pollutants have been summarized and analyzed finally the challenges and prospects of aops in wastewater treatment are summarized this study provides a useful theoretical foundation and practical guidance for scientists in the fields of environmental science environmental engineering and environmental health keywords advanced oxidation processes water treatment textile dye wastewater pharmaceutical residual wastewater catalysts 1 introduction with population increase and the acceleration of urbanization industrialization is rapidly developing globally to meet the needs of people as a result a large amount of wastewater and solid waste is generated causing serious environmental pollution water pollution is one of the most serious environmental issues worldwide 1 2 and industrial wastewater is an important source of water pollution industrial wastewater can have an immense impact on ecosystems because of its complex composition poor biodegradability and high toxicity textile wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater have become examples of industrial wastewater that are difficult to degrade because of their prodigious output and highly stable contained organic compounds various physical chemical and biological treatment technologies have been developed to eliminate the toxicity of these wastewaters in the environment coagulation and biological treatment are the most widely used traditional treatment methods 3 6 although these technologies have advantages they cannot completely decompose organic pollutants in industrial wastewater 7 10 and therefore there is a pressing need to explore and develop new technologies to treat refractory industrial wastewater advanced oxidation processes aops are technologies that treat toxic pollutants and were developed in the 1980s aops can generate oxidation active radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh through a series of complex physical and chemical processes oh can effectively decompose organic pollutants because of its strong oxidation capability and can completely convert refractory organic pollutants into harmless inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide and water 11 in addition oh radicals can rapidly react with organic substances the reaction rate constant can reach as high as 109 l mol s 12 13 recently sulfate radicals so4 and superoxide radicals o2 have been found to have strong oxidation ability and can degrade organic pollutants 14 15 they are also important components of aops it has been confirmed that there are three key types of reactions in the degradation of organic compounds through free radicals namely addition reaction hydrogen abstraction reaction and electron transfer oh is prone to the addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions and so4 is prone to the electron transfer reaction 16 17 compared with traditional treatment technologies aops have a stronger oxidation capacity faster reaction speed less secondary pollution milder reaction conditions and wider applications in the field of water treatment 18 19 scientists have conducted numerous studies that address the theory and application of aops and have made significant progress some basic reaction principles of aops have been gradually disclosed and new catalysts have been synthesized to overcome the shortcomings of traditional catalysts in aops applications the basic principles are introduced and summarized in detail in many reviews 20 25 however there are few systematic reviews that address the treatment and latest advancements in aops in industrial dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater this may limit the rapid development of aops and their large scale application in the treatment of industrial wastewater and as such this mini review focuses on the application of aops and their combination with catalysts in industrial textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater new technologies and their applications of aops in these fields are also discussed and in particular the improvement of the aops degradation effect and its degradation mechanism with different catalysts are systemically analyzed the challenges and prospects are summarized based on the existing development of aops for the treatment of dye wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater this work provides useful guidance and a robust foundation for further studies and applications in the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater 2 treatment of industrial textile dye wastewater textile dye wastewater is an important component of industrial wastewater it is estimated that approximately 70 000 tons of dye are used in the textile industry each year and approximately 40 will eventually become pollutants and endanger environmental health 26 wastewater from the textile dye industry accounts for 17 20 of total industrial wastewater 27 chemical textile dyestuffs have complex compositions easy synthesis stable chemical structures and difficult decomposition characteristics 28 most textile dyestuffs have biological toxicity carcinogenicity and teratogenicity among industrial wastewater textile dyestuff wastewater is one of the most difficult to decompose 29 and has high chroma high biochemical oxygen demand and a high content of dissolved solids 30 most dyes are highly resistant to biodegradation because of the need to maintain color and structural integrity in the application and in particular azo dyes are easily converted into dangerous aromatic amines under hypoxic conditions 31 32 the treatment methods for textile wastewater include physical treatment oxidation and biological treatment 33 currently most textile dye wastewater treatments use a secondary treatment process which is mainly composed of a biochemical process anaerobic aerobic system 34 and a physicochemical process coagulation sedimentation or air flotation 35 36 however new dyes and technologies have significantly changed the composition and properties of wastewater and increased textile wastewater treatment difficulties the degradation efficiency of traditional wastewater treatment decreases markedly 37 and there is a pressing need to explore high efficiency wastewater treatment technologies aops are widely used in wastewater treatment because of their advantages in this section four representative aops are selected and their textile wastewater research progress is discussed table 1 2 1 application of fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation in textile dye wastewater treatment fenton oxidation was the first aop discovered and is considered to be a powerful oxidation process that destroys refractory organics many reviews have introduced the basic principle of fenton oxidation 20 22 in the fenton oxidation process the ph value of the reaction system is a problem but in real industrial textile wastewater the ph is generally 7 8 this means that the ph of wastewater requires adjustment before the application of fenton oxidation which will greatly increase the cost of wastewater treatment therefore current research on the fenton process focuses on the introduction of light electricity or the development of new green and efficient catalysts to broaden the application range of this process light and electricity were introduced into the fenton oxidation process and the degradation rate of the pollutants increased significantly in addition the use of a catalyst has achieved excellent results the combination of photo fenton oxidation with a new catalyst has an excellent removal effect of more than 90 for many kinds of dye wastewater the introduction of light further improves the catalytic effect khataee et al 38 found that the introduction of light increased dye removal efficiency by approximately 45 with the same catalyst many research groups have made substantial progress in the synthesis of new catalysts and are committed to using simple methods to synthesize green efficient and stable catalysts in recent years transition metal compounds and metal organic frameworks mofs have received widespread attention because of their excellent performance in heterogeneous fenton processes liu et al 39 prepared silica and carbon coated fe3o4 fe3o4 sio2 c they found that fe3o4 sio2 c is composed of nanospheres formed by fe3o4 nanoparticles and a graphite layer coated on the outside with a diameter of 50 100 nm the catalyst has a high degradation effect over a wide ph range ph 4 9 after eight cycles the degradation effect of fe3o4 sio2 c on methylene blue mb remained above 65 fig 1 a b yang et al 40 synthesized cu2cl oh 3 nanoflowers using a simple h2o2 assisted hydrothermal method and demonstrated that with the increase in vh2o2 vh2o the particles were assembled into a nanoflower like structure with a size of approximately 4 μm fig 1 c the material overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional fenton oxidation to a certain extent and has a good degradation effect between ph 5 7 fig 1 d wang et al 41 synthesized copper cobalt mofs cu4co6 cnc with different ratios using the direct carbonization method and found that that the solid nanocubes and metal nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the carbon framework their experiments demonstrated that when the ratio of cu co was 4 6 because of the best ratio of bimetallic high specific surface area and synergistic effect with the graphitized carbon skeleton the material exhibited the best degradation effect on acid orange ii aoii 95 3 fig 1 e f it should be noted that the dye solutions used in these studies were all prepared solutions of the dyes a large gap between the prepared solution and the real dye wastewater which is one of the key factors affecting the treatment process remains to verify the effect of the fenton oxidation process on the treatment of real dye wastewater some research has examined real dye wastewater treatment in the laboratory both photo fenton oxidation and electro fenton oxidation have achieved good effects in real wastewater treatment and they are one of the treatment methods with application prospects in textile wastewater treatment in real printing and dyeing industrial wastewater there are many kinds of ions such as chloride ions sulfide ions and uv quenching substances or free radical scavengers that can affect the oxidative degradation process this is one of the unavoidable challenges in the practical application of fenton or fenton like oxidation researchers focus on this problem and start from the oxidation degradation process and the influence of different ions on the quenching of free radicals the effect of fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation can be improved in wastewater treatment only when the influence of multiple substances is overcome in real wastewater 2 2 application of ozonation in textile dye wastewater treatment as a treatment method for refractory wastewater using ozone as an oxidant ozonation is an encouraging degradation method because it can convert refractory organics into intermediate products to improve the biodegradability of wastewater however ozonation cannot achieve complete mineralization which has become an unavoidable limiting factor in its application 42 43 studies by dias et al and sun et al showed that ozonation had a good effect on the treatment of chroma up to 99 but the removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod was unsatisfactory 44 45 the addition of a catalyst can promote the decomposition of ozone to form oh on the surface of the catalyst which can overcome the defect that ozone cannot be completely mineralized and also improves degradation efficiency several studies have shown that the system of adding h2o2 as a catalyst and introducing uv into the process of ozonation had a good degradation effect on textile wastewater 46 48 if after the chroma and organic pollutants are removed the treated wastewater can be recycled in the textile industry then this will be one of the most optimal treatment results hu et al 49 supported mnfe2o4 on carbon aerogel ca to obtain a new catalyst mnfe2o4 ca and showed that mnfe2o4 had an irregular rectangular structure without ca fig 2 a and the shape of mnfe2o4 prepared on ca was more regular which is a typical octahedral nanostructure fig 2 b the catalyst had a good effect on the decolorization and mineralization of dye wastewater compared with single ozonation the removal rate of cod in this process increased by 25 and the treated wastewater was then used for fabric production after a series of evaluations the dyeing reproducibility color fastness and color uniformity of the fabric were within the standard range which provided a significant possibility for wastewater recycling bilinska et al achieved similar results 50 kamarehei et al 51 coated γ fe2o3 on activated carbon powder pac for the degradation of alizarin red s ars and found that the maximum removal rate was observed when the catalyst dosage was 1 1 g l 1 and the comparison showed that the mineralization rate of ars increased by 27 with the addition of the catalyst asgari et al 52 prepared carbon doped magnesium oxide doped on an eggshell membrane powder catalyst to treat textile wastewater and found that the catalyst achieved a 93 decolorization rate and 78 total organic carbon toc removal rate the mineralization efficiency of the catalyst was 9 05 times higher than that of commercial activated carbon notably a large number of studies have shown that cl which is ubiquitous in textile wastewater can be oxidized to chlorine and bromine in the process of degrading textile wastewater by ozonation and can then produce halogenated organic inorganic by products such as adsorbable organic halogens aox 53 54 most of these substances have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects which is a concern in addition cl can be used as a free radical trap to interfere with the degradation of oh 55 oktem et al 56 investigated the treatment of chlorinated textile wastewater by ozonation and found that the formation of aox increased the toxicity of the wastewater the wastewater toxicity was significantly reduced after the chloride in the production process was replaced by sulfate therefore the substitution of chloride may be a method for textile wastewater treatment 2 3 application of photocatalytic oxidation in textile dye wastewater treatment photocatalytic oxidation has become one of the most important wastewater treatment technologies in recent years the utilization of light in the reaction is a unique advantage but it is also one of the reaction constraints taking the most commonly used tio2 as an example it performs well in photocatalytic and hydrogen evolution reactions but its disadvantages are also very clear such as a large band gap energy 3 2 ev low utilization of visible light and high electron hole recombination efficiency 57 therefore much research is focused on improving the utilization and degradation efficiency of catalysts the main strategies are to shift the absorption spectrum of the catalyst to the visible light region and reduce the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron holes studies have shown that these effects can be achieved to a certain extent by using element doping and multiple material compounding in recent years carbon based materials have attracted significant interest in the field of catalysis and researchers have attempted to deposit catalytic materials on the surface of carbon nanotubes cnts to produce better catalytic effects zhao et al 58 deposited tio2 on the surface of cnts and introduced silver to form a new nanocomposite material cat which was used to catalyze mb dye under visible light they found that the absorption of the material in the visible light region was significantly enhanced fig 3 a the catalyst could degrade 80 8 of mb dye under visible light irradiation for 3 h and the degradation rate was 16 5 times higher than that of pure tio2 fig 3 b ahmad et al 59 compared the degradation effects of mg doped zno cnts mzc and mg doped zno graphene mzg and demonstrated that the degradation rate of mzg was twice that of mzc this was due to the strong synergistic effect between graphene and mg doped zno which reduced the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron holes and improved the photocatalytic ability rahman et al 60 found that on graphene supported cerium substituted nickel ferrite the formation of heterojunctions in the composite structure contributed to photogenerated carrier separation while having a strong redox capacity thereby improving the photocatalytic performance several other studies have demonstrated that the formation of heterojunctions plays an important role in photocatalytic activity 61 65 in addition to these mechanisms the morphology and specific surface area of the catalyst also have a significant influence on photocatalytic performance wang et al 66 synthesized g c3n4 graphene oxide and polyacrylonitrile composites with a nested structure and found that the composite had a good photocatalytic effect because of its special network structure and pore structure chen et al 67 synthesized a new polyxmetalate based mof composite which exhibited a 3d 2 fold interpenetrating scu type network the structure was stable and had a good catalytic degradation effect with the ability to degrade 97 of rhb under visible light shen et al 68 synthesized three dimensional flower like bi2s3 nanocrystals on the basis of 2d bi2s3 nanosheets using a hydrothermal method and demonstrated that the flower like structure was composed of nanosheets with an average particle size of approximately 2 μm fig 3 c d e their results indicated that the unique morphology and structure were beneficial to the capture of visible light and electron transfer without the need to adjust the ph value thereby improving its catalytic ability 2 4 application of sulfate based advanced oxidation processes sr aops in textile dye wastewater treatment sr aops have developed rapidly in recent years because of their high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v long half life 3 4 10 5 s and wide application of ph 14 the best activation mode optimal operation conditions and the possibility of application in real wastewater have continued to be the focus of research the difference in the activation mode and operation conditions will have a significant impact on the degradation effect which is also a practical research focus in the investigation of sr aop degradation of textile dye wastewater the different components in the solution have different effects on the degradation system huang et al 69 found that an appropriate amount of metal ions could promote the degradation of crystal violet cv during the study of uv persulfate ps on cv and luo et al 70 used heat activated ps to degrade congo red dye and found that natural organic matter may inhibit the degradation process due to the removal of so4 notably the presence of cl concentrations 1 0 mm could accelerate the degradation process however previous studies have discovered the dual effect of cl on so4 71 73 which means that the significant influence of cl on the entire degradation system must be considered in practical applications in recent years carbon based materials have been widely used in the field of catalytic materials because of their unique advantages for example biochar offers easy access and low cost while graphene materials have excellent electrical conductivity and large specific surface areas li et al 74 used sawdust biochar to activate ps to degrade dyes and because of the abundant oxygen functional groups on the surface of the material a good removal effect was achieved du et al 75 synthesized a carbon based modified catalyst carbon based mnfe2o4 that also performed well during the activation of ps in addition lu et al 76 synthesized graphene aerogels and fe3o4 composites and verified their degradation mechanism confirming that the strong electron conduction between fe3o4 and graphene improved the cycle between fe2 and fe3 the catalyst could have a good activation effect in the ph range of ph 3 9 among the various catalyst structures 3d spherical structures have also received much attention because of their large specific surface area and excellent catalytic performances meng et al 77 and zhu et al 78 prepared porous α fe2o3 fig 4 a and 3d microspheres of bi2moo6 fig 4 b respectively and found that the diameters of the microspheres synthesized by the two methods were 200 nm and 2 3 μm respectively with a uniform shape and a large specific surface area after evaluation both materials showed excellent catalytic performance and good stability providing a new choice for dye degradation in addition to studies on single dye wastewater sr aops have also achieved good results in the degradation of real textile wastewater guan et al 79 and pervez et al 80 examined the effect of a new catalyst activated by different new catalysts for real wastewater treatment both groups obtained extremely high degradation rates of 90 and 89 respectively this indicates that the catalytic system has good prospects for application to practical wastewater treatment 3 treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater among the many emerging water pollutants drugs are the most important category they include antibiotics analgesics steroids antidepressants antipyretics stimulants antibacterial drugs analgesics hormones anti inflammatory drugs β blockers lipid regulators contrast agents and impotence drugs 102 103 currently drug residues are found in almost all environmental substrates on every continent including surface water lakes rivers streams estuaries and sea water 104 105 groundwater 106 sewage treatment plant effluent and sludge 107 108 the persistence and potentially toxic effects of these residual drugs as well as their continuous discharge from wastewater to water sources poses long term potential risks to aquatic and terrestrial organisms for example as one of the most commonly used drugs antibiotics in the environment have received particular attention since the 1990s antibiotics are natural or synthetic compounds with antibacterial activities according to a recent report 100 000 200 000 tons of antibiotics are used worldwide every year 109 resulting in a large number of antibiotic residues in water antibiotics may cause long term irreversible changes to the microbial genome and make the microbes resistant even at low concentrations 110 therefore it is important to treat residual pharmaceutical wastewater aops have been extensively studied as a competitive option and some significant developments are listed in table 2 3 1 application of fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation in pharmaceutical residues wastewater treatment the wastewater of the pharmaceutical industry has always been a pressing issue for enterprises and governments because of its complex composition high emissions and deep chroma the methods for treating and decoloring wastewater in the pharmaceutical industry are diverse and all have their own characteristics and significant differences this has led to difficulties in the practical applications of pharmaceutical companies and therefore the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is essential many researchers have begun to apply aops to the treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater and have made good progress much research regarding fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidative degradation drugs has been conducted the results of these studies have shown that fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation had good effects on the degradation of drug residue in wastewater in addition toxicity tests have shown that the toxicity of degraded wastewater was further reduced which had an extremely important impact on its subsequent discharge 111 the main mechanism of degradation is different for different catalysts and degradation products the coral like zn fe cnts synthesized by liu et al 112 achieved a good degradation effect because of the larger specific surface area and improved adsorption capacity of the catalyst tang and wang 113 synthesized mof mil 100 fe with feii feiii mixed valence coordinatively unsaturated iron center cus mil 100 fe and demonstrated that both have a cubic octahedral structure but compared with mil 100 fe the surface of cus mil 100 fe became rough and the specific surface area increased with the appearance of uniformly distributed pores fig 5 a b they demonstrated that the increased catalytic activity was not only attributed to the increase in specific surface area but also to the formation of coordination unsaturated metal sites in another study 114 a porous flower like carbon matrix catalytic material was synthesized fecu c fecu c presents a 3d structure self assembled from microrods with a width of 100 300 nm and a length of 1 2 5 micrometers fig 5 c these results show that the introduction of bimetallic nanoparticles as effective active sites for the fenton reaction could additionally increase the generation of oh and promote the degradation process both catalysts have achieved excellent effects on the treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater furthermore the synthesized new nanocatalysts can not only promote degradation efficiency but also improve the adaptability of the reaction system to ph the ph range of many catalysts is extended to neutral even reaching alkaline conditions such as zno 115 and iron dipicolinamide complexes on silica particles 116 in addition yu et al 117 and huang et al 118 improved the cycle of fe2 fe3 by generating active oxygen and the synergistic effect of ce3 ce4 to further increase the reaction rate the progress discussed here for fenton oxidation will ultimately be implemented in large scale industrial treatments research has also involved the degradation of catalysts in real pharmaceutical wastewater huang et al 118 verified the degradation effect of a catalyst on real pharmaceutical wastewater they illustrated that the catalyst could degrade tetracycline tc present in urban river water at the natural ph value and decompose a variety of organic substances simultaneously a study by wang et al 119 also demonstrated good results in degrading a variety of real water samples notably because of the complexity of different catalytic reactions the optimal catalyst and the most suitable conditions must be selected based on the different types of wastewater and the substances contained in practice this will be the theoretical basis for its subsequent large scale application 3 2 application of ozonation and catalytic ozonation in wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical residues ozonation and catalytic ozonation are highly capable of decomposing pollutants ozone molecules can oxidize aromatic rings into intermediates such as carboxylic acids aldehydes and carboxylic acids but cannot completely mineralize them into co2 and h2o the complete mineralization of pollutants can be achieved only when ozone is converted into oh 24 120 121 however aldehydes and carboxylic acids are common residues in pharmaceutical wastewater presenting a new challenge for the degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater by ozonation several studies have shown that ozonation alone cannot achieve ideal results for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater wang et al 122 degraded tc by ozonation and the results showed that the cod removal rate was 35 in 90 min and when treating clofibric acid ibuprofen and diclofenac dcf with ozonation zwiener et al 123 also did not achieve good results only dcf was degraded by ozone to approximately 3 of its initial concentration however in an o3 h2o2 system the mineralization of these drugs could reach 98 rosal et al 124 used ozone and hydrogen peroxide to treat wastewater containing drugs the results confirmed that ozone could only achieve medium intensity mineralization of the wastewater after the addition of h2o2 the mineralization reached almost 100 this phenomenon can be attributed to the combined use of o3 and h2o2 which leads to the generation of oh radicals with higher catalytic activity improving the mineralization effect of the reaction this result was further confirmed in another study 125 catalytic ozonation introduces various heterogeneous catalysts in the ozone oxidation process to enhance the catalytic degradation activity of the reaction system the synthesis of various catalysts has also become a major driving force for the development of catalytic ozonation due to the different mechanisms of catalysis different research on the same substance may produce different conclusions krakstrom et al 126 and pelalak et al 127 used different catalysts to study the degradation of sulfasalazine both of which achieved excellent removal efficiencies 100 and 96 05 respectively pelalak et al investigated the catalytic mechanism and confirmed that a catalyst with a large specific surface area provided more active sites for the decomposition of ozone which produced more oh and superoxide free radicals moreover more free radicals and a large specific surface area were critical to improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst this is also one of the mechanisms by which most catalytic ozonation improves catalytic activity krakstrom et al found that the presence of the catalyst did not promote the conversion of sulfasalazine but it could affect the concentration of certain degradation products to a certain extent in another study saeid et al 128 found that although dcf was degraded by ozonation in a relatively short time more refractory by products were produced and this is an undesirable phenomenon however this was changed by the addition of pt mesoporous molecular sieves mcm the mcm catalyst with 2 pt loading 2 wt pt mcm 22 100 eim showed the best degradation effect fig 5 d in addition the catalyst also exhibited a good effect on the degradation of 5 hydroxy dcf 5 oh a byproduct of dcf degradation fig 5 e huang et al 129 achieved good results when using iron foam catalytic ozonation to degrade real pharmaceutical wastewater this method performed exceptionally well in improving the biodegradability of wastewater and provides a theoretical basis for catalytic ozonation in actual wastewater degradation 3 3 application of photocatalytic oxidation in treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater given the challenges in the field of wastewater treatment worldwide photocatalytic oxidation has become a focus of research because of its green and efficient advantages however simple semiconductor materials can no longer meet the challenges of wastewater treatment the current emerging research strategy is to optimize the optical properties of simple semiconductor materials such as tio2 and zno through a variety of ways to obtain new semiconductor materials with broader absorption spectra lower electron hole recombination rates and higher photocatalytic activities 130 significant progress has been made in this field as one of the most implemented photocatalysts zno has performed very well in the removal of many substances chavoshan et al 131 prepared zno nanoparticles to treat penicillin g and achieved good degradation effects 74 65 a significant breakthrough has been made in the photocatalytic performance of new catalytic materials formed by composite optimization based on zno many studies have shown that zno can be combined with other substances to obtain a porous structure with high cleanliness which could promote its photocatalytic ability doping metal ions can increase the photosensitivity of zno and reduce its band gap energy it has been shown to have a good removal effect on norfloxacin nor 132 studies have demonstrated that the sp2 hybrid arrangement of carbon in graphene composites has a good effect on reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and sharma et al 133 synthesized a composite structure of zno and reduced graphene oxide rgo zno the catalyst has a porous flower like structure with an average size of approximately 1 μm fig 6 a b at higher magnification fig 6 c these flowers are composed of rods of approximately 200 nm the experiments have verified that the synergy between the two and the porous structure that effectively separates photo generated carriers could improve the light capture ability and achieve the effective removal of ofloxacin as representative heterogeneous catalysts mofs have been widely used in photocatalytic oxidation samy et al 134 compounded mof mil 53 al with zno and applied it to a photocatalytic reactor chen et al 135 evaluated the photocatalytic performance of mil 125 ti after calcining at an appropriate temperature it was confirmed that the materials obtained by these two methods had better photocatalytic activity and stability than those of the original materials and had excellent degradation effects for different target degradation products graphite carbon nitride g c3n4 has attracted wide attention because of its suitable band gap low cost simple and convenient preparation environmental friendliness and high chemical stability however it is undisputable that the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs limits the photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 therefore many efforts have been made to overcome this shortcoming among them tio2 has been widely studied because of its energy level matching characteristics with g c3n4 yu et al 136 synthesized hollow tio2 g c3n4 co3o4 core shell microspheres fig 6 d e showing that the catalyst maintains a hollow nanosphere structure the thickness of the shell structure is approximately 20 nm fig 6 f g the investigation of the photocatalytic degradation mechanism illustrated that the core shell structure improved the separation of photogenerated carriers and made the photo generated holes aggregate on the outer surface to form an oxidized surface the cocatalyst co3o4 on the outer surface could further extend the life of the photocatalyst and provide more reaction sites kumar et al 137 investigated tio2 g c3n4 composite structure and also found that the structure had a good degradation effect for a variety of drugs wang et al 138 successfully prepared a novel magnetic g c3n4 mnfe2o4 graphene c3n4 mnfe2o4 g composite with enhanced photocatalytic activity using ps as an oxidant they studied the photocatalytic capability of the prepared photocatalyst under visible light irradiation the removal rate of metronidazole by the c3n4 mnfe2o4 g composites was 94 5 which was 3 5 times higher than that of pure g c3n4 research is no longer limited to doping and compounding methods to improve the performance of semiconductor catalysts a variety of new catalysts have gradually been prepared such as biox 139 polypyrrole 140 and chitosan 141 the scientific research is not only to improve pure oxidation performance the availability and cost of catalysts are the main limits for their final industrial application 3 4 application of sr aops in pharmaceutical residues wastewater treatment pharmaceutical wastewater generally has a strong anti degradation capability sr aops have an excellent ability to degrade organics in addition to degrading most refractory organics they can also degrade some organics that are difficult to degrade by oh therefore sr aops have unique advantages in the degradation of drug residue wastewater table 2 summarizes the detailed data of the different ps activation methods used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater as the most economical and easily available activation method ultraviolet light has achieved excellent results in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater chen et al 142 and al hakim et al 143 achieved good results in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater al hakim et al also evaluated the effect of uv ps on the actual wastewater treatment effect they found that theophylline 160 mg l 1 could be completely degraded after 3 h of reaction time transition metals play an important role in the activation of ps compared with homogeneous metal ion activation heterogeneous catalyst activation has attracted wide attention because of its low secondary pollution and good repeatability it is the key point for scientists to find a catalyst with high efficiency stability and good economic benefit hao et al 144 prepared cufe2o4 rgo simply and then used it to activate ps to degrade methylparaben mep cufe2o4 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the rgo surface cufe2o4 rgo had a large specific surface area and the applicable ph range increased fig 7 a moreover cufe2o4 and rgo had a synergistic effect in activating ps resulting in more than 95 mep degradation among the various catalytic systems the application of diatomite in catalytic systems is of interest diatomite was used as a catalyst carrier because of its porous structure low density and large specific surface area 145 niu et al 146 prepared a novel diatomite supported mnceox complex mnceox nanospheres were loaded on the surface of diatomite and had good dispersion fig 7 b compared with diatomite the surface area was increased by approximately 19 times the composite structure had good dispersibility stability and repeatability and had high catalytic ability which could degrade 73 of ciprofloxacin cip silva rackov et al 147 introduced iron ions to modify diatomite the activated effect of the modified diatomite on ps was better than that of the traditional activation method it is an economical efficient and promising catalyst 4 challenges and prospects of application of aops in wastewater treatment aops have unique advantages in wastewater treatment with ongoing research an increasing number of new catalysts that have been investigated to treat refractory organic pollutants have achieved excellent results although these single aops are highly capable of treating wastewater the current aops still have disadvantages such as low energy utilization rate possible secondary pollution high requirements for catalysts and electrode materials and high costs the combination of aops and the combination of aops with traditional technologies have made progress in many aspects such as economic efficiency environmental friendliness and operability they not only overcome the shortcomings of a single aop but also greatly expand their application scope they have promising prospects in practical industrial applications however the following challenges should be resolved prior to the large scale application of aops 1 more attention should be paid to the basic principles and degradation mechanisms of aops for the treatment of refractory organic wastewater the aops reaction conditions should be optimized continuously many substances present in real industrial wastewater can inhibit the progress of degradation reactions by scavenging free radicals forming complexes or depositing on catalysts however most studies were limited to the treatment of specific target degradation solutions in the laboratory and only a few have conducted degradation experiments on real industrial wastewater and explored the mechanisms of interactions between substances in wastewater and free radicals in subsequent studies researchers should focus on the degradation treatment process of real industrial wastewater and promote the large scale application of aops in industrial wastewater treatment 2 in the process of investigating aops the development of new catalysts and electrodes is a major driving force for their development metal non metal doped catalysts three dimensional and multi element composite structure catalysts mofs and electrode materials have been extensively studied excellent effects have also been observed in degradation studies however there is a conflict in the preparation process of new catalysts whereby noble metal catalysts have good catalytic activity and leaching resistance in application but they are expensive and non noble metals that are inexpensive but have low catalytic activity and produced secondary pollution easily therefore overcoming these two shortcomings and synthesizing new catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and stability will become a focus of research 3 studies on catalysts have been extensively conducted worldwide but research on the catalytic mechanisms and by product control is relatively rare this study demonstrates that investigating the catalytic mechanism can significantly promote the development of aops according to different reaction principles aops can be combined with biological oxidation or coagulation flocculation processes to design a more efficient multi stage treatment process this will promote the application of aops in the large scale treatment of industrial wastewater based on present technologies in addition researchers should comprehensively consider the cost of aops and the control of by products and then design environmentally friendly and economically viable wastewater treatment approaches 4 studies on the economic costs and benefits of aops in the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater are scarce although several research groups accurately estimated the operating costs of their own treatment system the operating costs obtained by different research groups differed because of the different types of wastewater treated and the applicable models as a result the operating costs obtained by different research teams were not comparable furthermore most studies have focused on the performance of catalysts and their degradation mechanisms and reports on the comprehensive evaluation of the economic benefits of aops are absent in future studies of aops investigations on the degradation mechanisms and other aspects should continue to be pursued while simultaneously evaluating the economic cost and benefit of specific industrial wastewater treatments this may create a significant breakthrough for aop technology in terms of production cost competitiveness in conclusion aops have great advantages in the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater currently researchers have produced significant achievements in terms of the degradation efficiency operation cost and secondary pollutant control of aops however major barriers remain before aops can practically become large scale applications in the treatment of industrial textile wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater in a practical application environment many factors can influence the treatment process of aops such as the types and amounts of organic compounds and inorganic ions in the wastewater in most situations aops can effectively decompose organic pollutants into low toxic and non toxic substances and transfer harmful inorganic compounds into deposition to remove them from wastewater however under some conditions organic and inorganic contaminants may be converted into more toxic pollutants considerable attention must be paid to the practical application of aops furthermore other elements of an entire aops treatment system such as the optimization procedure economic benefits by product analysis and environmental safety evaluations must be seriously considered before aops are applied at a large scale for the treatment of industrial textile wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater credit authorship contribution statement lumin liu

13423,with the rapid development of industrialization and globalization in recent years an increasing amount of textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater has been discharged into the environment current wastewater treatment technology has difficulty meeting all the practical requirements of harmless wastewater discharge and therefore the exploration and development of new technologies to treat various types of wastewater is urgently needed advanced oxidation processes aops have the advantages of strong oxidation ability complete decomposition of organic pollutants and no secondary pollution and scientists have found that the introduction of nanocatalysts with good performance into aops can achieve excellent treatment effects numerous studies have shown that the introduction of catalysts to aops can greatly improve the treatment effect these results demonstrate that aops may be an efficient approach for the large scale treatment of wastewater however there are very few systematic reviews that address the treatment of textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater by aops this study provides a unique focus on the advantages and disadvantages of single aops aops combined with nanocatalsyts and other technologies for the treatment of textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residual wastewater and several critical mechanisms of the degradation of pollutants have been summarized and analyzed finally the challenges and prospects of aops in wastewater treatment are summarized this study provides a useful theoretical foundation and practical guidance for scientists in the fields of environmental science environmental engineering and environmental health keywords advanced oxidation processes water treatment textile dye wastewater pharmaceutical residual wastewater catalysts 1 introduction with population increase and the acceleration of urbanization industrialization is rapidly developing globally to meet the needs of people as a result a large amount of wastewater and solid waste is generated causing serious environmental pollution water pollution is one of the most serious environmental issues worldwide 1 2 and industrial wastewater is an important source of water pollution industrial wastewater can have an immense impact on ecosystems because of its complex composition poor biodegradability and high toxicity textile wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater have become examples of industrial wastewater that are difficult to degrade because of their prodigious output and highly stable contained organic compounds various physical chemical and biological treatment technologies have been developed to eliminate the toxicity of these wastewaters in the environment coagulation and biological treatment are the most widely used traditional treatment methods 3 6 although these technologies have advantages they cannot completely decompose organic pollutants in industrial wastewater 7 10 and therefore there is a pressing need to explore and develop new technologies to treat refractory industrial wastewater advanced oxidation processes aops are technologies that treat toxic pollutants and were developed in the 1980s aops can generate oxidation active radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh through a series of complex physical and chemical processes oh can effectively decompose organic pollutants because of its strong oxidation capability and can completely convert refractory organic pollutants into harmless inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide and water 11 in addition oh radicals can rapidly react with organic substances the reaction rate constant can reach as high as 109 l mol s 12 13 recently sulfate radicals so4 and superoxide radicals o2 have been found to have strong oxidation ability and can degrade organic pollutants 14 15 they are also important components of aops it has been confirmed that there are three key types of reactions in the degradation of organic compounds through free radicals namely addition reaction hydrogen abstraction reaction and electron transfer oh is prone to the addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions and so4 is prone to the electron transfer reaction 16 17 compared with traditional treatment technologies aops have a stronger oxidation capacity faster reaction speed less secondary pollution milder reaction conditions and wider applications in the field of water treatment 18 19 scientists have conducted numerous studies that address the theory and application of aops and have made significant progress some basic reaction principles of aops have been gradually disclosed and new catalysts have been synthesized to overcome the shortcomings of traditional catalysts in aops applications the basic principles are introduced and summarized in detail in many reviews 20 25 however there are few systematic reviews that address the treatment and latest advancements in aops in industrial dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater this may limit the rapid development of aops and their large scale application in the treatment of industrial wastewater and as such this mini review focuses on the application of aops and their combination with catalysts in industrial textile dye wastewater and pharmaceutical residue wastewater new technologies and their applications of aops in these fields are also discussed and in particular the improvement of the aops degradation effect and its degradation mechanism with different catalysts are systemically analyzed the challenges and prospects are summarized based on the existing development of aops for the treatment of dye wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater this work provides useful guidance and a robust foundation for further studies and applications in the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater 2 treatment of industrial textile dye wastewater textile dye wastewater is an important component of industrial wastewater it is estimated that approximately 70 000 tons of dye are used in the textile industry each year and approximately 40 will eventually become pollutants and endanger environmental health 26 wastewater from the textile dye industry accounts for 17 20 of total industrial wastewater 27 chemical textile dyestuffs have complex compositions easy synthesis stable chemical structures and difficult decomposition characteristics 28 most textile dyestuffs have biological toxicity carcinogenicity and teratogenicity among industrial wastewater textile dyestuff wastewater is one of the most difficult to decompose 29 and has high chroma high biochemical oxygen demand and a high content of dissolved solids 30 most dyes are highly resistant to biodegradation because of the need to maintain color and structural integrity in the application and in particular azo dyes are easily converted into dangerous aromatic amines under hypoxic conditions 31 32 the treatment methods for textile wastewater include physical treatment oxidation and biological treatment 33 currently most textile dye wastewater treatments use a secondary treatment process which is mainly composed of a biochemical process anaerobic aerobic system 34 and a physicochemical process coagulation sedimentation or air flotation 35 36 however new dyes and technologies have significantly changed the composition and properties of wastewater and increased textile wastewater treatment difficulties the degradation efficiency of traditional wastewater treatment decreases markedly 37 and there is a pressing need to explore high efficiency wastewater treatment technologies aops are widely used in wastewater treatment because of their advantages in this section four representative aops are selected and their textile wastewater research progress is discussed table 1 2 1 application of fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation in textile dye wastewater treatment fenton oxidation was the first aop discovered and is considered to be a powerful oxidation process that destroys refractory organics many reviews have introduced the basic principle of fenton oxidation 20 22 in the fenton oxidation process the ph value of the reaction system is a problem but in real industrial textile wastewater the ph is generally 7 8 this means that the ph of wastewater requires adjustment before the application of fenton oxidation which will greatly increase the cost of wastewater treatment therefore current research on the fenton process focuses on the introduction of light electricity or the development of new green and efficient catalysts to broaden the application range of this process light and electricity were introduced into the fenton oxidation process and the degradation rate of the pollutants increased significantly in addition the use of a catalyst has achieved excellent results the combination of photo fenton oxidation with a new catalyst has an excellent removal effect of more than 90 for many kinds of dye wastewater the introduction of light further improves the catalytic effect khataee et al 38 found that the introduction of light increased dye removal efficiency by approximately 45 with the same catalyst many research groups have made substantial progress in the synthesis of new catalysts and are committed to using simple methods to synthesize green efficient and stable catalysts in recent years transition metal compounds and metal organic frameworks mofs have received widespread attention because of their excellent performance in heterogeneous fenton processes liu et al 39 prepared silica and carbon coated fe3o4 fe3o4 sio2 c they found that fe3o4 sio2 c is composed of nanospheres formed by fe3o4 nanoparticles and a graphite layer coated on the outside with a diameter of 50 100 nm the catalyst has a high degradation effect over a wide ph range ph 4 9 after eight cycles the degradation effect of fe3o4 sio2 c on methylene blue mb remained above 65 fig 1 a b yang et al 40 synthesized cu2cl oh 3 nanoflowers using a simple h2o2 assisted hydrothermal method and demonstrated that with the increase in vh2o2 vh2o the particles were assembled into a nanoflower like structure with a size of approximately 4 μm fig 1 c the material overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional fenton oxidation to a certain extent and has a good degradation effect between ph 5 7 fig 1 d wang et al 41 synthesized copper cobalt mofs cu4co6 cnc with different ratios using the direct carbonization method and found that that the solid nanocubes and metal nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the carbon framework their experiments demonstrated that when the ratio of cu co was 4 6 because of the best ratio of bimetallic high specific surface area and synergistic effect with the graphitized carbon skeleton the material exhibited the best degradation effect on acid orange ii aoii 95 3 fig 1 e f it should be noted that the dye solutions used in these studies were all prepared solutions of the dyes a large gap between the prepared solution and the real dye wastewater which is one of the key factors affecting the treatment process remains to verify the effect of the fenton oxidation process on the treatment of real dye wastewater some research has examined real dye wastewater treatment in the laboratory both photo fenton oxidation and electro fenton oxidation have achieved good effects in real wastewater treatment and they are one of the treatment methods with application prospects in textile wastewater treatment in real printing and dyeing industrial wastewater there are many kinds of ions such as chloride ions sulfide ions and uv quenching substances or free radical scavengers that can affect the oxidative degradation process this is one of the unavoidable challenges in the practical application of fenton or fenton like oxidation researchers focus on this problem and start from the oxidation degradation process and the influence of different ions on the quenching of free radicals the effect of fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation can be improved in wastewater treatment only when the influence of multiple substances is overcome in real wastewater 2 2 application of ozonation in textile dye wastewater treatment as a treatment method for refractory wastewater using ozone as an oxidant ozonation is an encouraging degradation method because it can convert refractory organics into intermediate products to improve the biodegradability of wastewater however ozonation cannot achieve complete mineralization which has become an unavoidable limiting factor in its application 42 43 studies by dias et al and sun et al showed that ozonation had a good effect on the treatment of chroma up to 99 but the removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod was unsatisfactory 44 45 the addition of a catalyst can promote the decomposition of ozone to form oh on the surface of the catalyst which can overcome the defect that ozone cannot be completely mineralized and also improves degradation efficiency several studies have shown that the system of adding h2o2 as a catalyst and introducing uv into the process of ozonation had a good degradation effect on textile wastewater 46 48 if after the chroma and organic pollutants are removed the treated wastewater can be recycled in the textile industry then this will be one of the most optimal treatment results hu et al 49 supported mnfe2o4 on carbon aerogel ca to obtain a new catalyst mnfe2o4 ca and showed that mnfe2o4 had an irregular rectangular structure without ca fig 2 a and the shape of mnfe2o4 prepared on ca was more regular which is a typical octahedral nanostructure fig 2 b the catalyst had a good effect on the decolorization and mineralization of dye wastewater compared with single ozonation the removal rate of cod in this process increased by 25 and the treated wastewater was then used for fabric production after a series of evaluations the dyeing reproducibility color fastness and color uniformity of the fabric were within the standard range which provided a significant possibility for wastewater recycling bilinska et al achieved similar results 50 kamarehei et al 51 coated γ fe2o3 on activated carbon powder pac for the degradation of alizarin red s ars and found that the maximum removal rate was observed when the catalyst dosage was 1 1 g l 1 and the comparison showed that the mineralization rate of ars increased by 27 with the addition of the catalyst asgari et al 52 prepared carbon doped magnesium oxide doped on an eggshell membrane powder catalyst to treat textile wastewater and found that the catalyst achieved a 93 decolorization rate and 78 total organic carbon toc removal rate the mineralization efficiency of the catalyst was 9 05 times higher than that of commercial activated carbon notably a large number of studies have shown that cl which is ubiquitous in textile wastewater can be oxidized to chlorine and bromine in the process of degrading textile wastewater by ozonation and can then produce halogenated organic inorganic by products such as adsorbable organic halogens aox 53 54 most of these substances have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects which is a concern in addition cl can be used as a free radical trap to interfere with the degradation of oh 55 oktem et al 56 investigated the treatment of chlorinated textile wastewater by ozonation and found that the formation of aox increased the toxicity of the wastewater the wastewater toxicity was significantly reduced after the chloride in the production process was replaced by sulfate therefore the substitution of chloride may be a method for textile wastewater treatment 2 3 application of photocatalytic oxidation in textile dye wastewater treatment photocatalytic oxidation has become one of the most important wastewater treatment technologies in recent years the utilization of light in the reaction is a unique advantage but it is also one of the reaction constraints taking the most commonly used tio2 as an example it performs well in photocatalytic and hydrogen evolution reactions but its disadvantages are also very clear such as a large band gap energy 3 2 ev low utilization of visible light and high electron hole recombination efficiency 57 therefore much research is focused on improving the utilization and degradation efficiency of catalysts the main strategies are to shift the absorption spectrum of the catalyst to the visible light region and reduce the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron holes studies have shown that these effects can be achieved to a certain extent by using element doping and multiple material compounding in recent years carbon based materials have attracted significant interest in the field of catalysis and researchers have attempted to deposit catalytic materials on the surface of carbon nanotubes cnts to produce better catalytic effects zhao et al 58 deposited tio2 on the surface of cnts and introduced silver to form a new nanocomposite material cat which was used to catalyze mb dye under visible light they found that the absorption of the material in the visible light region was significantly enhanced fig 3 a the catalyst could degrade 80 8 of mb dye under visible light irradiation for 3 h and the degradation rate was 16 5 times higher than that of pure tio2 fig 3 b ahmad et al 59 compared the degradation effects of mg doped zno cnts mzc and mg doped zno graphene mzg and demonstrated that the degradation rate of mzg was twice that of mzc this was due to the strong synergistic effect between graphene and mg doped zno which reduced the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron holes and improved the photocatalytic ability rahman et al 60 found that on graphene supported cerium substituted nickel ferrite the formation of heterojunctions in the composite structure contributed to photogenerated carrier separation while having a strong redox capacity thereby improving the photocatalytic performance several other studies have demonstrated that the formation of heterojunctions plays an important role in photocatalytic activity 61 65 in addition to these mechanisms the morphology and specific surface area of the catalyst also have a significant influence on photocatalytic performance wang et al 66 synthesized g c3n4 graphene oxide and polyacrylonitrile composites with a nested structure and found that the composite had a good photocatalytic effect because of its special network structure and pore structure chen et al 67 synthesized a new polyxmetalate based mof composite which exhibited a 3d 2 fold interpenetrating scu type network the structure was stable and had a good catalytic degradation effect with the ability to degrade 97 of rhb under visible light shen et al 68 synthesized three dimensional flower like bi2s3 nanocrystals on the basis of 2d bi2s3 nanosheets using a hydrothermal method and demonstrated that the flower like structure was composed of nanosheets with an average particle size of approximately 2 μm fig 3 c d e their results indicated that the unique morphology and structure were beneficial to the capture of visible light and electron transfer without the need to adjust the ph value thereby improving its catalytic ability 2 4 application of sulfate based advanced oxidation processes sr aops in textile dye wastewater treatment sr aops have developed rapidly in recent years because of their high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v long half life 3 4 10 5 s and wide application of ph 14 the best activation mode optimal operation conditions and the possibility of application in real wastewater have continued to be the focus of research the difference in the activation mode and operation conditions will have a significant impact on the degradation effect which is also a practical research focus in the investigation of sr aop degradation of textile dye wastewater the different components in the solution have different effects on the degradation system huang et al 69 found that an appropriate amount of metal ions could promote the degradation of crystal violet cv during the study of uv persulfate ps on cv and luo et al 70 used heat activated ps to degrade congo red dye and found that natural organic matter may inhibit the degradation process due to the removal of so4 notably the presence of cl concentrations 1 0 mm could accelerate the degradation process however previous studies have discovered the dual effect of cl on so4 71 73 which means that the significant influence of cl on the entire degradation system must be considered in practical applications in recent years carbon based materials have been widely used in the field of catalytic materials because of their unique advantages for example biochar offers easy access and low cost while graphene materials have excellent electrical conductivity and large specific surface areas li et al 74 used sawdust biochar to activate ps to degrade dyes and because of the abundant oxygen functional groups on the surface of the material a good removal effect was achieved du et al 75 synthesized a carbon based modified catalyst carbon based mnfe2o4 that also performed well during the activation of ps in addition lu et al 76 synthesized graphene aerogels and fe3o4 composites and verified their degradation mechanism confirming that the strong electron conduction between fe3o4 and graphene improved the cycle between fe2 and fe3 the catalyst could have a good activation effect in the ph range of ph 3 9 among the various catalyst structures 3d spherical structures have also received much attention because of their large specific surface area and excellent catalytic performances meng et al 77 and zhu et al 78 prepared porous α fe2o3 fig 4 a and 3d microspheres of bi2moo6 fig 4 b respectively and found that the diameters of the microspheres synthesized by the two methods were 200 nm and 2 3 μm respectively with a uniform shape and a large specific surface area after evaluation both materials showed excellent catalytic performance and good stability providing a new choice for dye degradation in addition to studies on single dye wastewater sr aops have also achieved good results in the degradation of real textile wastewater guan et al 79 and pervez et al 80 examined the effect of a new catalyst activated by different new catalysts for real wastewater treatment both groups obtained extremely high degradation rates of 90 and 89 respectively this indicates that the catalytic system has good prospects for application to practical wastewater treatment 3 treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater among the many emerging water pollutants drugs are the most important category they include antibiotics analgesics steroids antidepressants antipyretics stimulants antibacterial drugs analgesics hormones anti inflammatory drugs β blockers lipid regulators contrast agents and impotence drugs 102 103 currently drug residues are found in almost all environmental substrates on every continent including surface water lakes rivers streams estuaries and sea water 104 105 groundwater 106 sewage treatment plant effluent and sludge 107 108 the persistence and potentially toxic effects of these residual drugs as well as their continuous discharge from wastewater to water sources poses long term potential risks to aquatic and terrestrial organisms for example as one of the most commonly used drugs antibiotics in the environment have received particular attention since the 1990s antibiotics are natural or synthetic compounds with antibacterial activities according to a recent report 100 000 200 000 tons of antibiotics are used worldwide every year 109 resulting in a large number of antibiotic residues in water antibiotics may cause long term irreversible changes to the microbial genome and make the microbes resistant even at low concentrations 110 therefore it is important to treat residual pharmaceutical wastewater aops have been extensively studied as a competitive option and some significant developments are listed in table 2 3 1 application of fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation in pharmaceutical residues wastewater treatment the wastewater of the pharmaceutical industry has always been a pressing issue for enterprises and governments because of its complex composition high emissions and deep chroma the methods for treating and decoloring wastewater in the pharmaceutical industry are diverse and all have their own characteristics and significant differences this has led to difficulties in the practical applications of pharmaceutical companies and therefore the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is essential many researchers have begun to apply aops to the treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater and have made good progress much research regarding fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidative degradation drugs has been conducted the results of these studies have shown that fenton oxidation and fenton like oxidation had good effects on the degradation of drug residue in wastewater in addition toxicity tests have shown that the toxicity of degraded wastewater was further reduced which had an extremely important impact on its subsequent discharge 111 the main mechanism of degradation is different for different catalysts and degradation products the coral like zn fe cnts synthesized by liu et al 112 achieved a good degradation effect because of the larger specific surface area and improved adsorption capacity of the catalyst tang and wang 113 synthesized mof mil 100 fe with feii feiii mixed valence coordinatively unsaturated iron center cus mil 100 fe and demonstrated that both have a cubic octahedral structure but compared with mil 100 fe the surface of cus mil 100 fe became rough and the specific surface area increased with the appearance of uniformly distributed pores fig 5 a b they demonstrated that the increased catalytic activity was not only attributed to the increase in specific surface area but also to the formation of coordination unsaturated metal sites in another study 114 a porous flower like carbon matrix catalytic material was synthesized fecu c fecu c presents a 3d structure self assembled from microrods with a width of 100 300 nm and a length of 1 2 5 micrometers fig 5 c these results show that the introduction of bimetallic nanoparticles as effective active sites for the fenton reaction could additionally increase the generation of oh and promote the degradation process both catalysts have achieved excellent effects on the treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater furthermore the synthesized new nanocatalysts can not only promote degradation efficiency but also improve the adaptability of the reaction system to ph the ph range of many catalysts is extended to neutral even reaching alkaline conditions such as zno 115 and iron dipicolinamide complexes on silica particles 116 in addition yu et al 117 and huang et al 118 improved the cycle of fe2 fe3 by generating active oxygen and the synergistic effect of ce3 ce4 to further increase the reaction rate the progress discussed here for fenton oxidation will ultimately be implemented in large scale industrial treatments research has also involved the degradation of catalysts in real pharmaceutical wastewater huang et al 118 verified the degradation effect of a catalyst on real pharmaceutical wastewater they illustrated that the catalyst could degrade tetracycline tc present in urban river water at the natural ph value and decompose a variety of organic substances simultaneously a study by wang et al 119 also demonstrated good results in degrading a variety of real water samples notably because of the complexity of different catalytic reactions the optimal catalyst and the most suitable conditions must be selected based on the different types of wastewater and the substances contained in practice this will be the theoretical basis for its subsequent large scale application 3 2 application of ozonation and catalytic ozonation in wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical residues ozonation and catalytic ozonation are highly capable of decomposing pollutants ozone molecules can oxidize aromatic rings into intermediates such as carboxylic acids aldehydes and carboxylic acids but cannot completely mineralize them into co2 and h2o the complete mineralization of pollutants can be achieved only when ozone is converted into oh 24 120 121 however aldehydes and carboxylic acids are common residues in pharmaceutical wastewater presenting a new challenge for the degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater by ozonation several studies have shown that ozonation alone cannot achieve ideal results for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater wang et al 122 degraded tc by ozonation and the results showed that the cod removal rate was 35 in 90 min and when treating clofibric acid ibuprofen and diclofenac dcf with ozonation zwiener et al 123 also did not achieve good results only dcf was degraded by ozone to approximately 3 of its initial concentration however in an o3 h2o2 system the mineralization of these drugs could reach 98 rosal et al 124 used ozone and hydrogen peroxide to treat wastewater containing drugs the results confirmed that ozone could only achieve medium intensity mineralization of the wastewater after the addition of h2o2 the mineralization reached almost 100 this phenomenon can be attributed to the combined use of o3 and h2o2 which leads to the generation of oh radicals with higher catalytic activity improving the mineralization effect of the reaction this result was further confirmed in another study 125 catalytic ozonation introduces various heterogeneous catalysts in the ozone oxidation process to enhance the catalytic degradation activity of the reaction system the synthesis of various catalysts has also become a major driving force for the development of catalytic ozonation due to the different mechanisms of catalysis different research on the same substance may produce different conclusions krakstrom et al 126 and pelalak et al 127 used different catalysts to study the degradation of sulfasalazine both of which achieved excellent removal efficiencies 100 and 96 05 respectively pelalak et al investigated the catalytic mechanism and confirmed that a catalyst with a large specific surface area provided more active sites for the decomposition of ozone which produced more oh and superoxide free radicals moreover more free radicals and a large specific surface area were critical to improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst this is also one of the mechanisms by which most catalytic ozonation improves catalytic activity krakstrom et al found that the presence of the catalyst did not promote the conversion of sulfasalazine but it could affect the concentration of certain degradation products to a certain extent in another study saeid et al 128 found that although dcf was degraded by ozonation in a relatively short time more refractory by products were produced and this is an undesirable phenomenon however this was changed by the addition of pt mesoporous molecular sieves mcm the mcm catalyst with 2 pt loading 2 wt pt mcm 22 100 eim showed the best degradation effect fig 5 d in addition the catalyst also exhibited a good effect on the degradation of 5 hydroxy dcf 5 oh a byproduct of dcf degradation fig 5 e huang et al 129 achieved good results when using iron foam catalytic ozonation to degrade real pharmaceutical wastewater this method performed exceptionally well in improving the biodegradability of wastewater and provides a theoretical basis for catalytic ozonation in actual wastewater degradation 3 3 application of photocatalytic oxidation in treatment of pharmaceutical residues in wastewater given the challenges in the field of wastewater treatment worldwide photocatalytic oxidation has become a focus of research because of its green and efficient advantages however simple semiconductor materials can no longer meet the challenges of wastewater treatment the current emerging research strategy is to optimize the optical properties of simple semiconductor materials such as tio2 and zno through a variety of ways to obtain new semiconductor materials with broader absorption spectra lower electron hole recombination rates and higher photocatalytic activities 130 significant progress has been made in this field as one of the most implemented photocatalysts zno has performed very well in the removal of many substances chavoshan et al 131 prepared zno nanoparticles to treat penicillin g and achieved good degradation effects 74 65 a significant breakthrough has been made in the photocatalytic performance of new catalytic materials formed by composite optimization based on zno many studies have shown that zno can be combined with other substances to obtain a porous structure with high cleanliness which could promote its photocatalytic ability doping metal ions can increase the photosensitivity of zno and reduce its band gap energy it has been shown to have a good removal effect on norfloxacin nor 132 studies have demonstrated that the sp2 hybrid arrangement of carbon in graphene composites has a good effect on reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and sharma et al 133 synthesized a composite structure of zno and reduced graphene oxide rgo zno the catalyst has a porous flower like structure with an average size of approximately 1 μm fig 6 a b at higher magnification fig 6 c these flowers are composed of rods of approximately 200 nm the experiments have verified that the synergy between the two and the porous structure that effectively separates photo generated carriers could improve the light capture ability and achieve the effective removal of ofloxacin as representative heterogeneous catalysts mofs have been widely used in photocatalytic oxidation samy et al 134 compounded mof mil 53 al with zno and applied it to a photocatalytic reactor chen et al 135 evaluated the photocatalytic performance of mil 125 ti after calcining at an appropriate temperature it was confirmed that the materials obtained by these two methods had better photocatalytic activity and stability than those of the original materials and had excellent degradation effects for different target degradation products graphite carbon nitride g c3n4 has attracted wide attention because of its suitable band gap low cost simple and convenient preparation environmental friendliness and high chemical stability however it is undisputable that the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs limits the photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 therefore many efforts have been made to overcome this shortcoming among them tio2 has been widely studied because of its energy level matching characteristics with g c3n4 yu et al 136 synthesized hollow tio2 g c3n4 co3o4 core shell microspheres fig 6 d e showing that the catalyst maintains a hollow nanosphere structure the thickness of the shell structure is approximately 20 nm fig 6 f g the investigation of the photocatalytic degradation mechanism illustrated that the core shell structure improved the separation of photogenerated carriers and made the photo generated holes aggregate on the outer surface to form an oxidized surface the cocatalyst co3o4 on the outer surface could further extend the life of the photocatalyst and provide more reaction sites kumar et al 137 investigated tio2 g c3n4 composite structure and also found that the structure had a good degradation effect for a variety of drugs wang et al 138 successfully prepared a novel magnetic g c3n4 mnfe2o4 graphene c3n4 mnfe2o4 g composite with enhanced photocatalytic activity using ps as an oxidant they studied the photocatalytic capability of the prepared photocatalyst under visible light irradiation the removal rate of metronidazole by the c3n4 mnfe2o4 g composites was 94 5 which was 3 5 times higher than that of pure g c3n4 research is no longer limited to doping and compounding methods to improve the performance of semiconductor catalysts a variety of new catalysts have gradually been prepared such as biox 139 polypyrrole 140 and chitosan 141 the scientific research is not only to improve pure oxidation performance the availability and cost of catalysts are the main limits for their final industrial application 3 4 application of sr aops in pharmaceutical residues wastewater treatment pharmaceutical wastewater generally has a strong anti degradation capability sr aops have an excellent ability to degrade organics in addition to degrading most refractory organics they can also degrade some organics that are difficult to degrade by oh therefore sr aops have unique advantages in the degradation of drug residue wastewater table 2 summarizes the detailed data of the different ps activation methods used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater as the most economical and easily available activation method ultraviolet light has achieved excellent results in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater chen et al 142 and al hakim et al 143 achieved good results in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater al hakim et al also evaluated the effect of uv ps on the actual wastewater treatment effect they found that theophylline 160 mg l 1 could be completely degraded after 3 h of reaction time transition metals play an important role in the activation of ps compared with homogeneous metal ion activation heterogeneous catalyst activation has attracted wide attention because of its low secondary pollution and good repeatability it is the key point for scientists to find a catalyst with high efficiency stability and good economic benefit hao et al 144 prepared cufe2o4 rgo simply and then used it to activate ps to degrade methylparaben mep cufe2o4 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the rgo surface cufe2o4 rgo had a large specific surface area and the applicable ph range increased fig 7 a moreover cufe2o4 and rgo had a synergistic effect in activating ps resulting in more than 95 mep degradation among the various catalytic systems the application of diatomite in catalytic systems is of interest diatomite was used as a catalyst carrier because of its porous structure low density and large specific surface area 145 niu et al 146 prepared a novel diatomite supported mnceox complex mnceox nanospheres were loaded on the surface of diatomite and had good dispersion fig 7 b compared with diatomite the surface area was increased by approximately 19 times the composite structure had good dispersibility stability and repeatability and had high catalytic ability which could degrade 73 of ciprofloxacin cip silva rackov et al 147 introduced iron ions to modify diatomite the activated effect of the modified diatomite on ps was better than that of the traditional activation method it is an economical efficient and promising catalyst 4 challenges and prospects of application of aops in wastewater treatment aops have unique advantages in wastewater treatment with ongoing research an increasing number of new catalysts that have been investigated to treat refractory organic pollutants have achieved excellent results although these single aops are highly capable of treating wastewater the current aops still have disadvantages such as low energy utilization rate possible secondary pollution high requirements for catalysts and electrode materials and high costs the combination of aops and the combination of aops with traditional technologies have made progress in many aspects such as economic efficiency environmental friendliness and operability they not only overcome the shortcomings of a single aop but also greatly expand their application scope they have promising prospects in practical industrial applications however the following challenges should be resolved prior to the large scale application of aops 1 more attention should be paid to the basic principles and degradation mechanisms of aops for the treatment of refractory organic wastewater the aops reaction conditions should be optimized continuously many substances present in real industrial wastewater can inhibit the progress of degradation reactions by scavenging free radicals forming complexes or depositing on catalysts however most studies were limited to the treatment of specific target degradation solutions in the laboratory and only a few have conducted degradation experiments on real industrial wastewater and explored the mechanisms of interactions between substances in wastewater and free radicals in subsequent studies researchers should focus on the degradation treatment process of real industrial wastewater and promote the large scale application of aops in industrial wastewater treatment 2 in the process of investigating aops the development of new catalysts and electrodes is a major driving force for their development metal non metal doped catalysts three dimensional and multi element composite structure catalysts mofs and electrode materials have been extensively studied excellent effects have also been observed in degradation studies however there is a conflict in the preparation process of new catalysts whereby noble metal catalysts have good catalytic activity and leaching resistance in application but they are expensive and non noble metals that are inexpensive but have low catalytic activity and produced secondary pollution easily therefore overcoming these two shortcomings and synthesizing new catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and stability will become a focus of research 3 studies on catalysts have been extensively conducted worldwide but research on the catalytic mechanisms and by product control is relatively rare this study demonstrates that investigating the catalytic mechanism can significantly promote the development of aops according to different reaction principles aops can be combined with biological oxidation or coagulation flocculation processes to design a more efficient multi stage treatment process this will promote the application of aops in the large scale treatment of industrial wastewater based on present technologies in addition researchers should comprehensively consider the cost of aops and the control of by products and then design environmentally friendly and economically viable wastewater treatment approaches 4 studies on the economic costs and benefits of aops in the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater are scarce although several research groups accurately estimated the operating costs of their own treatment system the operating costs obtained by different research groups differed because of the different types of wastewater treated and the applicable models as a result the operating costs obtained by different research teams were not comparable furthermore most studies have focused on the performance of catalysts and their degradation mechanisms and reports on the comprehensive evaluation of the economic benefits of aops are absent in future studies of aops investigations on the degradation mechanisms and other aspects should continue to be pursued while simultaneously evaluating the economic cost and benefit of specific industrial wastewater treatments this may create a significant breakthrough for aop technology in terms of production cost competitiveness in conclusion aops have great advantages in the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater currently researchers have produced significant achievements in terms of the degradation efficiency operation cost and secondary pollutant control of aops however major barriers remain before aops can practically become large scale applications in the treatment of industrial textile wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater in a practical application environment many factors can influence the treatment process of aops such as the types and amounts of organic compounds and inorganic ions in the wastewater in most situations aops can effectively decompose organic pollutants into low toxic and non toxic substances and transfer harmful inorganic compounds into deposition to remove them from wastewater however under some conditions organic and inorganic contaminants may be converted into more toxic pollutants considerable attention must be paid to the practical application of aops furthermore other elements of an entire aops treatment system such as the optimization procedure economic benefits by product analysis and environmental safety evaluations must be seriously considered before aops are applied at a large scale for the treatment of industrial textile wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater credit authorship contribution statement lumin liu

13424,the effects of chloramphenicol cap on the performance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd as well as on the bacterial community were evaluated in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr the chemical oxygen demand cod removal decreased as the cap concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg l but cap had different effects on nitrification and denitrification in contrast to continuously inhibiting nitrification 15 mg l cap slightly promoted denitrification besides the specific oxygen utilization rate declined with increasing cap concentration and the nitrifying and denitrifying rates initially displayed a trend of decreasing and then increasing and finally decreasing with increases in cap concentration in addition the sbbr process exhibited an excellent ability to degrade cap especially when its concentration was 20 mg l the high throughput sequencing results indicated that some obvious variations in the bacterial community at different cap concentrations in particular relative abundance changes in the dominant bacterial species at the phylum class and genus levels overall this study reveals that the effects of cap on the nitrogen n removal performance in sbbr provides a theoretical guide for sbbr treatment of practical wastewater keywords simultaneous nitrification and denitrification chloramphenicol biodegradation bacterial community structure 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the main causes of eutrophication which leads to the deterioration of water sources 1 to reduce the amount of n transported into the aquatic environment many removal methods and technologies have been applied in the wastewater treatment process by comparison with abiotic n removal biological n removal is more widely employed in wastewater treatment plants due to its low cost high efficiency and superior adaptability 2 among biological n removal technologies simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd has drawn broad attention since nitrification and denitrification are performed in the same reactor although the two processes require antipodal environmental conditions 3 in general nitrification is considered an aerobic process carried out by autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in contrast the denitrification process is usually considered an anaerobic respiration pathway for diverse facultative anaerobic bacteria and archaea 4 consequently the snd process relies on harmonious and balanced cooperation between the aerobic nitrifier and the anaerobic denitrifier 5 which suggests that control of the oxygen concentration is a critical factor for snd 6 one mechanism of snd involves intermittent aeration that causes a spatial dissolved oxygen do concentration gradient between the surface and the interior of the biofilm flocs or granular sludge then nitrification and denitrification can occur simultaneously on the aerobic surface and anaerobic interior respectively under this mechanism a sbbr has been considered more conducive to efficient snd performance compared with other bioreactors such as a sequencing batch reactor sbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr or membrane bioreactor mbr 7 8 with its advantages of high effluent quality and low sludge yield the snd sbbr process offers simplified processing units and reduced aeration which can cut energy consumption and inhibit nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 accumulation 9 10 many relevant studies have reported that an snd sbbr can realize high n removal efficiency wang et al found that an snd sbbr achieved average total n removal efficiencies of 97 15 63 94 and 94 99 during 120 days of operation by applying acetate glucose and an organic mixture as organic sources respectively 11 in addition to reducing n pollution the snd sbbr process is also widely applied to other practical wastewater treatments during wastewater treatment residual antibiotics which are inevitably transported into biological treatment plants 12 have caused extensive environmental pollution due to the associated antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in the effluent 13 among such antibiotics cap is an effective nitroaromatic broad spectrum antibiotic which is used in the treatment of livestock diseases on a large scale due to its cost effectiveness 14 however it can be cancerogenic and genotoxic in humans 15 16 although the use of cap has been banned by many countries based on the flux estimation approximately 79 2 tons of chloramphenicols were discharged into the yangtze estuary in china from june 2013 to may 2014 and the concentration is especially high in autumn and winter 17 in hospital wastewater the cap concentration could be up to μg l or even mg l and even higher in pharmaceutical wastewater 18 therefore the study on the removal of high concentration cap mg l is also significant and widely carried out there have been many studies on the effects of cap on the performance of various biological n removal processes for example in a continuous nitrifying system when the cap concentration ranged from 10 mg l to 250 mg l it barely had any impact on biofilm stability or the performance of nitrification 19 however cap displayed a significant inhibitory effect on the denitrification performance of a denitrifying granular sludge whose half inhibitory concentration was 162 mg l 20 thus far the effect of cap on the n removal performance of an snd sbbr has not been reported owing to its biotoxic and antibacterial properties cap also exhibits strong inhibitory effects on many prokaryotic cells as well as some eukaryotic cells 21 it can engender changes in the bacterial community structure within a bioreactor thus an analysis of the microbial population structure in an snd sbbr is also of great significance this study aimed to explore the effects of different cap concentrations on the performance and bacterial community structure of a snd sbbr to achieve this objective an snd sbbr was established and operated for 161 days during the experiment chemical analyses were implemented periodically to obtain the indexes for evaluating the performance of the snd sbbr process for n pollutant removal and the degradation effects of different concentrations of cap were explored finally illumina high throughput sequencing technology was used to estimate the corresponding microbial community shifts at each cap concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the reactor was depicted in a previous paper studying the effects of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol on snd 22 briefly it was a laboratory scale sbbr with an effective volume of 7 l fig 1 the carrier had a specific surface area of 800 m 2 m3 and was composed of braided fibers that filled the sbbr 23 and the exchange volume ratio of the sbbr was 85 during the experiment the sbbr was operated for two 12 h cycles per day each operating cycle of the sbbr was composed of the following an influent phase 30 min aerobic phase 240 min anoxic phase 120 min aerobic phase 180 min anoxic phase 120 min settling phase 20 min and effluent phase 10 min the entire reactor was controlled by a time controller to achieve automatic operation an aeration pump and a stirring device were used to supply oxygen and aerate evenly during the aerobic phase the do concentration in the reactor was 3 5 mg l during the aerobic phase and 0 5 mg l during the anoxic phase 2 2 synthetic wastewater and seed sludge the components of the synthetic wastewater sample were as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 1000 0 17 7 mg l ammonium nh4 n 100 0 3 9 mg l phosphates 18 0 0 3 mg l ph 7 5 0 4 a total of 0 5 mg l trace elements were added to the wastewater 24 the cap was obtained at 98 purity from aladdin shanghai china its concentrations were 0 10 15 and 20 mg l corresponding to stage i 1 75 d stage ii 76 115 d stage iii 116 129 d and stage iv 130 161 d respectively the seed sludge was gathered from the secondary sedimentation tank of the guangzhou lijiao sewage treatment plant 2 3 analytical methods according to standard methods 25 the concentrations of cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were determined daily every other cycle with a uv visible spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee company at wavelengths of 440 420 220 and 540 nm respectively then certain indexes were used to represent the efficiencies of processing these pollutants such as the cod removal in one cycle cr nh4 n removal in one cycle ar no3 n accumulation in one cycle naa and no2 n accumulation in one cycle nia according to the description in a previous study 26 the specific oxygen utilizing rates sour specific ammonia oxidizing rates saor specific nitrite oxidizing rates snor specific nitrite reducing rates snirr and specific nitrate reducing rates snrr were determined to estimate the index cap removal in one cycle cpr all water samples were pretreated and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter afterward the shimadzu dgu 20as instrument equipped with an agilent 5 hc c18 2 column 250 mm 4 6 mm was used to analyze the cap concentration at 277 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and pure water at a ratio of 35 65 v v and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 2 4 bacterial analysis using high throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of different cap concentrations on the bacterial community samples were collected from the sbbr at the end of a relatively stable operating stage the seed sludge samples were named seed after each addition of cap the sludge samples were named acclimation 10 15 and 20 corresponding to concentrations of 0 10 15 and 20 mg l dna extraction and pcr amplification were performed according to the methods described in a previous study 27 and detailed operating conditions and primers information are presented in the supplementary material high throughput gene sequencing was performed by sangon biotechnology co ltd shanghai china on the illumina miseq platform the raw sequence data were mass filtered and analyzed using qiime version 1 8 0 a high quality representative sequence for each operational taxonomic unit otu was assigned using usearch version 5 2 236 with 97 sequence identity 3 results and discussion 3 1 target pollutants removal performance 3 1 1 cod removal at different cap concentrations according to fig 2a the average cr was about 913 1 mg l in the stable phase of stage i which was similar to another report on treating high concentration organic wastewater 28 the high cr indicated the strong cod removal capacity of the snd sbbr the cod concentration in the influent water was also affected as it increased from 1003 97 to 1078 62 mg l when cap increased from 0 to 20 mg l as the cap concentration increased the cod in the effluent displayed a trend of first increasing then decreasing and finally increasing and the trend for cr was the opposite and this trend could be regarded as the incubation stage before the system reached the stable phase the average crs in the stable phases stable cr of stages ⅰ ⅳ were 913 06 806 10 836 44 and 738 93 mg l respectively compared with stage i the average stable cr decreased by 106 96 mg l due to the addition of 10 mg l cap in stage ii when the concentration of cap increased to 15 mg l stage iii the average stable cr decreased by 76 62 mg l these decreases in average stable cr indicated that cap inhibited the removal of cod this consequence was consistent with a previous report which showed that tetracycline also an antibiotic had an evident inhibitory effect on the removal of cod 28 due to the adaptability of the biofilm to cap toxicity the average stable cr in stage iii displayed a slightly increasing trend and the inhibition of the removal of cod by cap was alleviated however when the cap concentration increased to 20 mg l stage iv the average stable cr significantly decreased by 174 13 mg l which was the largest decrease in cr obviously the average crs generally decreased with the increase of cap concentration means that the toxicity of cap increased with increasing concentration and it had obvious effects on the activity of the biofilm which led to the strongest inhibition by cap of the removal of cod in stage iv with the addition of cap at each stage initially the cod in the effluent increased sharply accordingly the cr decreased significantly but as the system continued to operate steadily the adaptation and recovery times changed at stage ii the biofilm took 39 days to adapt to the toxic wastewater after the first addition of cap when the addition of cap increased by another 5 mg l stage iii the recovery time shortened to only 14 days when the cap concentration was 20 mg l stage iv the recovery time extended to 32 days which was 7 days less than the recovery time of stage ii these results suggested that 20 mg l cap was the most toxic however the recovery time was slightly shortened at stage iv due to the continuous adaptation of the biofilm to the wastewater 3 1 2 nh4 n removal at different cap concentrations fig 2b depicts the variations in nh4 n concentration and removal efficiency in stages i iv of the snd sbbr at stage i the ar was 84 41 mg l when the process was stable stable ar which implied that the snd sbbr could achieve a good nh4 removal performance with the addition of different concentrations of cap the average stable ars of stages ii iv were 80 15 79 27 and 75 35 mg l respectively indicating that cap inhibited nitrification in the snd sbbr similarly an earlier study found that florfenicol a widely applied antibiotic also affected nitrification in the snd sbbr when the concentration exceeded 6 mg l it significantly inhibited the removal of nh4 29 from previous reports on the one hand the sour of the bacteria in the activated sludge or biofilm could be affected harmfully by some antibiotics so that the activities of the aerobic bacteria including nitrifiers were inhibited 26 30 on the other hand the biofilm could rapidly store a high concentration carbon source from wastewater which led to continuous inhibition on the activity of the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 31 all of these factors might contribute to the decline in ar as shown in fig 2b when the cap concentrations were 10 mg l and 20 mg l the average stable ars both decreased by about 4 mg l compared with their respective previous stage that is to say the degrees of inhibition of nitrification at stages ii and iv were similar however the average stable ar at stage iii compared to that at stage ii only decreased by 1 mg l which represented a weak inhibitory effect on nitrification and this was the result of the adaptation of the biofilm to the toxic wastewater 3 1 3 no3 and no2 accumulations at different cap concentrations during the process of snd the accumulations of no2 and no3 the intermediate products were also important indicators in particular no2 accumulation is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms and is poisonous in the human body 32 from stage i to stage iv the average naas in the stable phase stable naa were 2 62 6 56 3 27 and 4 77 mg l and the average nias in the stable phase stable nia were 0 035 0 0 02 and 0 03 mg l respectively fig 3 stable naa improved significantly after the first addition of cap but no 2 was almost not detected in the effluent in stage ii with increasing cap concentration the average stable naa displayed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing in contrast the average stable nia displayed a continuous increasing trend from stage iii to stage iv we found that the cap concentrations with the greatest and smallest influence on the accumulations of no3 n and no2 n were the same the maximum variations in naa and nia were 3 95 mg l and 0 35 mg l when the cap concentration was 10 mg l and the minimum variations of naa and nia were 1 50 mg l and 0 1 mg l when the cap concentration was 20 mg l the disparity between the average maximum variation of naa 3 95 mg l and the maximum variation of nia 0 35 mg l showed that the effect of cap on nia was weaker than that on naa this indicated that the effect of cap on the activity of nitrate reducing bacteria was more significant than that of nitrite reducing bacteria in the snd sbbr system at stage i no2 and no3 accumulated simultaneously when most of the nh4 was removed which confirmed not all of the nitrified nh4 was converted into nitrogen generally speaking the rate of nitrification is higher than that of denitrification throughout the entire snd process 33 thus the naa ought to be higher than the nia during the stable operation of snd sbbr which is consistent with the results of this study fig 3 after the initial addition of cap stage ii naa did not decrease but increased with decreasing ar this result suggested that 10 mg l cap inhibited the denitrification so that no3 obtained by nitrification further accumulated rather than being removed according to a literature report the electron turnover rate of no3 reductase was higher than that of no2 reductase hence the reduction of no2 was the rate limiting step in denitrification and rapid reduction of no3 was a common phenomenon 34 generally no2 accumulation was the result of incomplete denitrification thus denitrification was strongly inhibited during stage ii and nia decreased significantly at stage iii naa and nia showed opposite trends specifically naa decreased by about 3 mg l and nia increased by about 0 02 mg l on the one hand the biofilm gradually adapted to wastewater containing cap so the inhibition by cap of denitrification was alleviated on the other hand in an environment of intermittent aeration cap could act as an electron donor and carbon source during the nitrogen removal process which would promote no3 removal and cause naa to decrease 35 as the denitrification increased no2 as the intermediate correspondingly appeared to accumulate when the cap concentration was 20 mg l stage iv the toxicity increased and its effect on snd sbbr exceeded the adaptability of the biofilm the naa and nia increased by 1 5 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively that may also be due to high concentration cap stimulating further growth of cap degrading functional bacteria that competed with the denitrifiers and despoiled more nutrients in snd sbbr consequently carbon sources were inadequate for complete denitrification and a slight accumulation of no2 occurred feng et al reported that florfenicol was also beneficial to the accumulation of no3 in snd sbbr which was similar to the findings in this study whereas florfenicol promoted no2 accumulation at the same time 29 which was the opposite to the results found in this study it can be seen that the effect of florfenicol on snd sbbr was not completely the same as that of cap in this study which may be caused by different types of antibiotics and differences in bacterial community structure 3 2 variations in sour nitrifying rate and denitrifying rate under cap stress sour can intuitively reflect the activities of aerobes in aerobic wastewater treatment technologies thereby demonstrating the nitrification activity and organic oxidization process 12 as shown in fig 4a sour displayed a gradual decline with the gradual increase in cap concentration which was 38 2 30 1 27 9 23 3 mg o 2 g 1mlss h 1 at 0 10 15 20 mg l cap stage respectively by comparison with 0 mg l cap stage i there was a reduction of 14 9 mg o2 g 1mlss h 1 for sour at 20 mg l which proved that cap inhibited the activities of aerobes in the snd sbbr that is to say the activities of heterotrophic microbes and nitrifiers were both inhibited and the removal of organics and nitrification weakened the extent of the sour decline from stage i to stage ii was much larger than that of later stages mostly because the biofilm had adapted to an environment containing cap after the addition of cap at the beginning of stage ii so that cap degrading bacteria were present in the microbial community which weakened the impact of increasing cap concentrations on the aerobes similar to cap other antibiotics such as tetracycline 26 36 sulfadiazine 30 and fluprofen also exhibited inhibition of sour in the biofilm and activated sludge 29 from stage i to stage iv saor decreased from 5 5 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 4 6 mg n g 1mlss h 1 and snor decreased from 6 2 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 5 0 mg n g 1mlss h 1 fig 4b which indicated cap inhibited the activities of both aob and nob in the sbbr this was consistent with the above result that the average stable ar decreased with increasing cap concentration likewise due to the biofilm adaptability to cap the extents of decline of snor and saor from stage i to stage ii were the steepest wang et al showed that tetracycline also reduced saor and snor in the anoxic aerobic sequencing batch reactor and inhibited the activities of aob and nob 26 by comparison with 0 mg l when the concentration of cap was 20 mg l saor and snor decreased by 16 4 and 19 4 respectively this suggested the inhibitory effect of cap on nob was slightly stronger than that on aob snrr and snirr also decreased with increasing cap concentration fig 4c from stage i to stage iv snrr decreased from 14 8 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 9 1 mg n g 1mlss h 1 and snirr decreased from 16 7 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 10 8 mg n g 1mlss h 1 which indicated that cap had an inhibitory effect on denitrification and denitrifiers no3 reducing bacteria and no2 reducing bacteria in the snd sbbr when the cap concentration was 15 mg l there was less inhibition compared with 10 mg l the reason for this phenomenon may be that as the sbbr running time increased the abundances and expression levels of cap resistance genes in denitrifying bacteria increased thus the denitrifiers exhibited adaptability to cap furthermore when the cap concentration further increased to 20 mg l the inhibition by cap of denitrifiers further intensified therefore snrr and snirr were further reduced in addition both snrr and snirr were much higher than saor and snor at all cap concentrations and this was consistent with the fact that there was no excess no3 n or no2 n accumulation in the system at any stage moreover snirr was always higher than snrr which indicates that no2 n accumulation was always lower than no3 n accumulation in the snd sbbr 3 3 degradation efficiency of cap cap was degraded efficiently after being added to the snd sbbr in stages ii to iv fig 5 a portion of cap was degraded when it was added initially suggesting that some bacteria attached to the biofilm probably had the ability to degrade organics with the continuous operation of the snd sbbr at stage ii the cpr increased constantly and gradually stabilized at 9 58 mg l 32 days later the average stable cprs were 12 95 and 19 47 mg l at stages iii and iv respectively which implied that the snd sbbr exhibited the best degradation performance in degrading 20 mg l cap thus wastewater containing 20 mg l cap might be the optimum environment for culturing cap degrading bacteria whenever the cap concentration altered in the initial phases of stages iii and iv cpr decreased abruptly which demonstrated that the activities of cap degrading bacteria were inhibited temporarily when the cap concentration increased nevertheless as the functional bacteria adapted to the cap concentration cpr increased gradually and steadily the average stable cpr increased by 3 38 mg l approximately from stage ii to stage iii and from stage iii to stage iv it increased by 6 52 mg l the latter increase exceeded 5 mg l which was the variation in the influent cap concentration this phenomenon might be caused by the functional bacteria cap degrading bacteria being enriched over the course of stage ii and stage iii which resulted in better adaptability of the biofilm to 20 mg l cap at stage iv thus the snd sbbr achieved the best cap degradation performance and cpr reached a peak at stage iv generally in cap degradation system the cap degradation process was supposed to occur nitro reduction and dichlorination successively 37 39 the former is achieved in the presence of nitro reductase catalytic system while the latter is carried out in the presence of microbial reductive dehalogenases or other terminal oxidoreductases 39 due to the fact that the antibiotic properties are heavily influenced by the no2 functional group on the cap molecule 40 the nitro reduction can convert the nitroaromatics to aromatic amines which have less toxicity 40 thus the degradation process in sbbr can significantly alleviate the antibacterial activity and biotoxicity of cap 3 4 microbial community analysis 3 4 1 microbial community richness diversity and similarity the shannon diversity abundance based coverage estimator ace simpson index and chao 1 richness are listed in table 1 these indices demonstrate the microbial richness and diversity at different cap concentrations in the snd sbbr generally low simpson and high shannon indices indicate an increase in α diversity 41 and richness increases with increases in the ace and chao 1 indices as table 1 shows the richness of the acclimation sludge increased over time but its diversity decreased and this indicated that some functional bacteria were enriched so that the snd sbbr possessed an excellent ability to remove target pollutants next the α diversity first increased stage ii then decreased stage iii and finally increased stage iv but the richness showed the opposite trend the variations in richness and diversity depended on the relationship between the toxicity of cap and the adaptability of the bacteria to the wastewater during these stages the toxicity of cap inhibited the activity of functional bacteria which led to the decrease in microbial richness but it could also stimulate the growth of some new bacteria and increase the biodiversity as the bacteria gradually adapted to the cap toxicity the richness increased but some bacteria that were not able to adapt to cap were eliminated so that the α diversity decreased among these samples sample 20 displayed the highest shannon index and lowest simpson index which showed that the bacteria in stage iv were associated with the best capability of degrading cap this demonstrated that high biodiversity and low microbial richness were conducive to dechlorination this result was inconsistent with a previous study 42 which may have been caused by differences in various operating conditions such as reactor type inoculated sludge and influent water composition the total numbers of otus detected in the five samples of seed acclimation 10 15 and 20 were 5626 4057 3462 4952 and 4576 respectively table 1 a venn diagram fig 6a was used to count the numbers of common and unique otus in the five samples approximately 99 otus were shared among the five samples which was less than 10 of the total otus this meant that the number of bacteria not affected by cap toxicity was small besides the cap concentration caused differences in the microbial community structure resulting in significant quantitative changes in the unique otus in each sample the non metric multi dimensional scale nmds can describe the otherness between different samples as shown in fig 6b compared with seed acclimation and 20 10 and 15 displayed a high similarity in other words as the cap concentration increased from 10 mg l to 15 mg l the microbial community structure changed little in contrast an increase in cap either from zero or to high concentration 20 mg l significantly changed the microbial community structure 3 4 2 microbial community structure analysis fig 7 presents the taxonomic analysis of the five samples at the levels of phylum class and genus the most abundant phyla were proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria ignavibacteriae and chloroflexi this result was consistent with a previous report showing that proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes were dominant phyla in the same type of amide alcohol antibiotics wastewater 29 and the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria 45 08 61 09 34 93 52 22 38 98 in seed acclimation 10 15 20 respectively which plays a key role in removing nh4 n 43 this was also reflected in the decrease in the relative abundance of proteobacteria leading to a decline in ar however as the cap concentration increased the abundance of bacteroidetes with the same n removal function as proteobacteria first increased and then decreased and its relative abundances were 15 15 12 28 15 62 12 97 7 93 in the five stages respectively this consequence suggested that a low concentration of cap 10 mg l could slightly promote the growth of bacteroidetes but a high concentration of cap with higher toxicity could inhibit the activity of bacteroidetes and reduce its relative abundance so that naa and nia increased and the n removal effect of the snd sbbr was influenced in addition to the above mentioned phyla the relative abundances of other phyla also changed significantly the relative abundance of firmicutesfirmicutes was significantly increased under the influence of cap toxicity that might be because bacteria belonging to firmicutes had acquired antibiotic resistance genes or the ability to degrade the cap so that they could better adapt to the cap environment meanwhile this was in line with a previous report which stated that could resist some extreme environments and enable a reactor to operate stably 44 it is worth noting that cap inhibited actinobacteria and ignavibacteriae substantially as shown by the decreases in their relative abundances however their relative abundances were still high under high cap concentration actinobacteria can synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites and carry antibiotic resistance genes which would help to better degrade cap and adapt to an antibiotic environment compared with other bacteria 45 moreover ignavibacteriae were also found to degrade high molecular weight compounds to reduce no3 in the anaerobic denitrification process 45 in contrast the populations of candidatus saccharibacteria and chloroflexi were enhanced by cap their relative abundances were 2 36 0 52 9 36 2 39 0 91 and 5 53 0 3 1 22 0 44 0 88 in the five stages respectively to date information about the ecological role of candidatus saccharibacteria in ecosystems is limited nevertheless some studies have shown that it has become the dominant phylum in many wastewater biological treatment processes especially during the treatment of chlorinated organic wastewater 46 moreover it was reported that chloroflexi is a facultative anaerobe that can decompose organics and participate in the n removal process 47 as shown in fig 7b betaproteobacteria bacteroidia negativicutes clostridia deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria ignavibacteria sphingobacteria and bacilli were the most abundant classes among these betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria all belong to proteobacteria as these classes contain many nitrifying genera aob nob 46 their decreasing relative abundances under the influence of cap led to the inhibition of the removal of nh4 and a decrease in ar the betaproteobacteria also have excellent no3 removal capability because they contain a number of denitrifying and other n removing functional bacteria 48 its relative abundance was 10 13 53 08 20 67 41 24 and 24 42 in the five stages the addition of cap inhibited the activity of betaproteobacteria but these bacteria quickly adapted to the wastewater displaying significant increases in relative abundance when the cap concentration was 15 mg l this could also explain why the recovery time of the biofilm at stage ⅲ was significantly shortened overall the variations in relative abundance of betaproteobacteria were completely consistent with the trend of the cap effect on denitrification of the snd sbbr as reflected by the variations in the naa cap reduced the relative abundances of ignavibacteria and sphingobacteria which was consistent with previous research on florfenicol 29 it could be concluded that these two classes could not tolerate and adapt to antibiotic toxicity thus affecting the n removal performance according to previous reports bacteroidia 0 46 11 81 15 21 12 3 8 99 and clostridia 0 76 2 04 11 17 7 44 6 01 in the five stages are closely related to the degradation of organics 29 they could not perform their functions better in a high cap concentration environment owing to the variations in their relative abundances in contrast negativicutes and bacilli both belonging to firmicutes showed continuous increases in their relative abundances which were 0 6 0 96 4 81 5 28 20 13 and 0 15 0 4 0 41 1 47 5 07 in the five samples respectively previous reports had mentioned that negativicutes and bacilli are dechlorinated classes 49 the variations in their relative abundances explained why the cpre was highest at stage iv as their relative abundances were highest in sample 20 the detailed analysis of the microbial community structures in the five samples at genus level is presented in fig 7c similar to the analysis at class level the relative abundances of the dominant bacteria at genus level were significantly diverse and the dominant genera included brachymonas megasphaera desulfovibrio actinomyces saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis paludibacter lactococcus treponema and anaeroarcus brachymonas 0 02 51 52 19 66 37 71 22 7 in the five samples is a denitrifier 29 and its variations in abundance caused by the different cap concentrations led to the trend of naa first increasing and then decreasing in addition to brachymonas paludibacter and saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis also play important roles in denitrification and the latter was the key bacterial genus for the conversion of no3 to no2 in some biological nitrogen removal reactors 48 50 according to a previous report megasphaera contributed to hydrogen fermentation while the biofilm could use hydrogen as an electronic intermediary to degrade cap 51 moreover desulfovibrio 0 02 0 96 7 83 4 19 7 77 lactococcus 0 08 0 4 0 41 1 45 5 03 and anaeroarcus 0 01 0 07 0 66 0 75 2 13 in the five samples are all commonly identified dechlorinating bacteria 52 54 their relative abundances were highest when the cap concentration was 20 mg l which could also explain the peak in cpr at stage iv both actinomyces and treponema had been reported as organics removing bacteria 55 56 and their activities were inhibited by cap toxicity which was manifested by the decreasing trend in their relative abundances that might also be the reason for the gradual decline of cr it should be noted that the additions of cap increased the proportions of the unclassified microbes at three different taxonomic levels nevertheless the abundances of the unclassified microbes decreased with increases in the cap concentration which was also reported by 57 these unclassified bacteria might be new bacteria that have not been identified or fully studied hence it would be of great significance to explore the taxonomic composition of these bacteria at the genetic level and the influence of antibiotics on them 58 4 conclusion cap inhibited the cod removal performance and nitrification in the snd sbbr in this study for denitrification however 10 and 20 mg l cap had an inhibitory effect while 15 mg l cap showed a weak inhibition due to the adaptability of biofilm to cap toxicity in addition the adaptation and recovery time of the reactor was the shortest after adding 15 mg l cap and the degradation of cap was the highest at 20 mg l concentration overall the sour of the biofilm declined under cap stress but the nitrifying rate and denitrifying rate initially displayed a trend of decreasing and then increasing and finally decreasing moreover cap obviously affected the bacterial community and the relative abundances of the dominant bacteria were different at different cap concentrations declaration of competing interest

13424,the effects of chloramphenicol cap on the performance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd as well as on the bacterial community were evaluated in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr the chemical oxygen demand cod removal decreased as the cap concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg l but cap had different effects on nitrification and denitrification in contrast to continuously inhibiting nitrification 15 mg l cap slightly promoted denitrification besides the specific oxygen utilization rate declined with increasing cap concentration and the nitrifying and denitrifying rates initially displayed a trend of decreasing and then increasing and finally decreasing with increases in cap concentration in addition the sbbr process exhibited an excellent ability to degrade cap especially when its concentration was 20 mg l the high throughput sequencing results indicated that some obvious variations in the bacterial community at different cap concentrations in particular relative abundance changes in the dominant bacterial species at the phylum class and genus levels overall this study reveals that the effects of cap on the nitrogen n removal performance in sbbr provides a theoretical guide for sbbr treatment of practical wastewater keywords simultaneous nitrification and denitrification chloramphenicol biodegradation bacterial community structure 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the main causes of eutrophication which leads to the deterioration of water sources 1 to reduce the amount of n transported into the aquatic environment many removal methods and technologies have been applied in the wastewater treatment process by comparison with abiotic n removal biological n removal is more widely employed in wastewater treatment plants due to its low cost high efficiency and superior adaptability 2 among biological n removal technologies simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd has drawn broad attention since nitrification and denitrification are performed in the same reactor although the two processes require antipodal environmental conditions 3 in general nitrification is considered an aerobic process carried out by autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in contrast the denitrification process is usually considered an anaerobic respiration pathway for diverse facultative anaerobic bacteria and archaea 4 consequently the snd process relies on harmonious and balanced cooperation between the aerobic nitrifier and the anaerobic denitrifier 5 which suggests that control of the oxygen concentration is a critical factor for snd 6 one mechanism of snd involves intermittent aeration that causes a spatial dissolved oxygen do concentration gradient between the surface and the interior of the biofilm flocs or granular sludge then nitrification and denitrification can occur simultaneously on the aerobic surface and anaerobic interior respectively under this mechanism a sbbr has been considered more conducive to efficient snd performance compared with other bioreactors such as a sequencing batch reactor sbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr or membrane bioreactor mbr 7 8 with its advantages of high effluent quality and low sludge yield the snd sbbr process offers simplified processing units and reduced aeration which can cut energy consumption and inhibit nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 accumulation 9 10 many relevant studies have reported that an snd sbbr can realize high n removal efficiency wang et al found that an snd sbbr achieved average total n removal efficiencies of 97 15 63 94 and 94 99 during 120 days of operation by applying acetate glucose and an organic mixture as organic sources respectively 11 in addition to reducing n pollution the snd sbbr process is also widely applied to other practical wastewater treatments during wastewater treatment residual antibiotics which are inevitably transported into biological treatment plants 12 have caused extensive environmental pollution due to the associated antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in the effluent 13 among such antibiotics cap is an effective nitroaromatic broad spectrum antibiotic which is used in the treatment of livestock diseases on a large scale due to its cost effectiveness 14 however it can be cancerogenic and genotoxic in humans 15 16 although the use of cap has been banned by many countries based on the flux estimation approximately 79 2 tons of chloramphenicols were discharged into the yangtze estuary in china from june 2013 to may 2014 and the concentration is especially high in autumn and winter 17 in hospital wastewater the cap concentration could be up to μg l or even mg l and even higher in pharmaceutical wastewater 18 therefore the study on the removal of high concentration cap mg l is also significant and widely carried out there have been many studies on the effects of cap on the performance of various biological n removal processes for example in a continuous nitrifying system when the cap concentration ranged from 10 mg l to 250 mg l it barely had any impact on biofilm stability or the performance of nitrification 19 however cap displayed a significant inhibitory effect on the denitrification performance of a denitrifying granular sludge whose half inhibitory concentration was 162 mg l 20 thus far the effect of cap on the n removal performance of an snd sbbr has not been reported owing to its biotoxic and antibacterial properties cap also exhibits strong inhibitory effects on many prokaryotic cells as well as some eukaryotic cells 21 it can engender changes in the bacterial community structure within a bioreactor thus an analysis of the microbial population structure in an snd sbbr is also of great significance this study aimed to explore the effects of different cap concentrations on the performance and bacterial community structure of a snd sbbr to achieve this objective an snd sbbr was established and operated for 161 days during the experiment chemical analyses were implemented periodically to obtain the indexes for evaluating the performance of the snd sbbr process for n pollutant removal and the degradation effects of different concentrations of cap were explored finally illumina high throughput sequencing technology was used to estimate the corresponding microbial community shifts at each cap concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the reactor was depicted in a previous paper studying the effects of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol on snd 22 briefly it was a laboratory scale sbbr with an effective volume of 7 l fig 1 the carrier had a specific surface area of 800 m 2 m3 and was composed of braided fibers that filled the sbbr 23 and the exchange volume ratio of the sbbr was 85 during the experiment the sbbr was operated for two 12 h cycles per day each operating cycle of the sbbr was composed of the following an influent phase 30 min aerobic phase 240 min anoxic phase 120 min aerobic phase 180 min anoxic phase 120 min settling phase 20 min and effluent phase 10 min the entire reactor was controlled by a time controller to achieve automatic operation an aeration pump and a stirring device were used to supply oxygen and aerate evenly during the aerobic phase the do concentration in the reactor was 3 5 mg l during the aerobic phase and 0 5 mg l during the anoxic phase 2 2 synthetic wastewater and seed sludge the components of the synthetic wastewater sample were as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 1000 0 17 7 mg l ammonium nh4 n 100 0 3 9 mg l phosphates 18 0 0 3 mg l ph 7 5 0 4 a total of 0 5 mg l trace elements were added to the wastewater 24 the cap was obtained at 98 purity from aladdin shanghai china its concentrations were 0 10 15 and 20 mg l corresponding to stage i 1 75 d stage ii 76 115 d stage iii 116 129 d and stage iv 130 161 d respectively the seed sludge was gathered from the secondary sedimentation tank of the guangzhou lijiao sewage treatment plant 2 3 analytical methods according to standard methods 25 the concentrations of cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were determined daily every other cycle with a uv visible spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee company at wavelengths of 440 420 220 and 540 nm respectively then certain indexes were used to represent the efficiencies of processing these pollutants such as the cod removal in one cycle cr nh4 n removal in one cycle ar no3 n accumulation in one cycle naa and no2 n accumulation in one cycle nia according to the description in a previous study 26 the specific oxygen utilizing rates sour specific ammonia oxidizing rates saor specific nitrite oxidizing rates snor specific nitrite reducing rates snirr and specific nitrate reducing rates snrr were determined to estimate the index cap removal in one cycle cpr all water samples were pretreated and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter afterward the shimadzu dgu 20as instrument equipped with an agilent 5 hc c18 2 column 250 mm 4 6 mm was used to analyze the cap concentration at 277 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and pure water at a ratio of 35 65 v v and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 2 4 bacterial analysis using high throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of different cap concentrations on the bacterial community samples were collected from the sbbr at the end of a relatively stable operating stage the seed sludge samples were named seed after each addition of cap the sludge samples were named acclimation 10 15 and 20 corresponding to concentrations of 0 10 15 and 20 mg l dna extraction and pcr amplification were performed according to the methods described in a previous study 27 and detailed operating conditions and primers information are presented in the supplementary material high throughput gene sequencing was performed by sangon biotechnology co ltd shanghai china on the illumina miseq platform the raw sequence data were mass filtered and analyzed using qiime version 1 8 0 a high quality representative sequence for each operational taxonomic unit otu was assigned using usearch version 5 2 236 with 97 sequence identity 3 results and discussion 3 1 target pollutants removal performance 3 1 1 cod removal at different cap concentrations according to fig 2a the average cr was about 913 1 mg l in the stable phase of stage i which was similar to another report on treating high concentration organic wastewater 28 the high cr indicated the strong cod removal capacity of the snd sbbr the cod concentration in the influent water was also affected as it increased from 1003 97 to 1078 62 mg l when cap increased from 0 to 20 mg l as the cap concentration increased the cod in the effluent displayed a trend of first increasing then decreasing and finally increasing and the trend for cr was the opposite and this trend could be regarded as the incubation stage before the system reached the stable phase the average crs in the stable phases stable cr of stages ⅰ ⅳ were 913 06 806 10 836 44 and 738 93 mg l respectively compared with stage i the average stable cr decreased by 106 96 mg l due to the addition of 10 mg l cap in stage ii when the concentration of cap increased to 15 mg l stage iii the average stable cr decreased by 76 62 mg l these decreases in average stable cr indicated that cap inhibited the removal of cod this consequence was consistent with a previous report which showed that tetracycline also an antibiotic had an evident inhibitory effect on the removal of cod 28 due to the adaptability of the biofilm to cap toxicity the average stable cr in stage iii displayed a slightly increasing trend and the inhibition of the removal of cod by cap was alleviated however when the cap concentration increased to 20 mg l stage iv the average stable cr significantly decreased by 174 13 mg l which was the largest decrease in cr obviously the average crs generally decreased with the increase of cap concentration means that the toxicity of cap increased with increasing concentration and it had obvious effects on the activity of the biofilm which led to the strongest inhibition by cap of the removal of cod in stage iv with the addition of cap at each stage initially the cod in the effluent increased sharply accordingly the cr decreased significantly but as the system continued to operate steadily the adaptation and recovery times changed at stage ii the biofilm took 39 days to adapt to the toxic wastewater after the first addition of cap when the addition of cap increased by another 5 mg l stage iii the recovery time shortened to only 14 days when the cap concentration was 20 mg l stage iv the recovery time extended to 32 days which was 7 days less than the recovery time of stage ii these results suggested that 20 mg l cap was the most toxic however the recovery time was slightly shortened at stage iv due to the continuous adaptation of the biofilm to the wastewater 3 1 2 nh4 n removal at different cap concentrations fig 2b depicts the variations in nh4 n concentration and removal efficiency in stages i iv of the snd sbbr at stage i the ar was 84 41 mg l when the process was stable stable ar which implied that the snd sbbr could achieve a good nh4 removal performance with the addition of different concentrations of cap the average stable ars of stages ii iv were 80 15 79 27 and 75 35 mg l respectively indicating that cap inhibited nitrification in the snd sbbr similarly an earlier study found that florfenicol a widely applied antibiotic also affected nitrification in the snd sbbr when the concentration exceeded 6 mg l it significantly inhibited the removal of nh4 29 from previous reports on the one hand the sour of the bacteria in the activated sludge or biofilm could be affected harmfully by some antibiotics so that the activities of the aerobic bacteria including nitrifiers were inhibited 26 30 on the other hand the biofilm could rapidly store a high concentration carbon source from wastewater which led to continuous inhibition on the activity of the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 31 all of these factors might contribute to the decline in ar as shown in fig 2b when the cap concentrations were 10 mg l and 20 mg l the average stable ars both decreased by about 4 mg l compared with their respective previous stage that is to say the degrees of inhibition of nitrification at stages ii and iv were similar however the average stable ar at stage iii compared to that at stage ii only decreased by 1 mg l which represented a weak inhibitory effect on nitrification and this was the result of the adaptation of the biofilm to the toxic wastewater 3 1 3 no3 and no2 accumulations at different cap concentrations during the process of snd the accumulations of no2 and no3 the intermediate products were also important indicators in particular no2 accumulation is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms and is poisonous in the human body 32 from stage i to stage iv the average naas in the stable phase stable naa were 2 62 6 56 3 27 and 4 77 mg l and the average nias in the stable phase stable nia were 0 035 0 0 02 and 0 03 mg l respectively fig 3 stable naa improved significantly after the first addition of cap but no 2 was almost not detected in the effluent in stage ii with increasing cap concentration the average stable naa displayed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing in contrast the average stable nia displayed a continuous increasing trend from stage iii to stage iv we found that the cap concentrations with the greatest and smallest influence on the accumulations of no3 n and no2 n were the same the maximum variations in naa and nia were 3 95 mg l and 0 35 mg l when the cap concentration was 10 mg l and the minimum variations of naa and nia were 1 50 mg l and 0 1 mg l when the cap concentration was 20 mg l the disparity between the average maximum variation of naa 3 95 mg l and the maximum variation of nia 0 35 mg l showed that the effect of cap on nia was weaker than that on naa this indicated that the effect of cap on the activity of nitrate reducing bacteria was more significant than that of nitrite reducing bacteria in the snd sbbr system at stage i no2 and no3 accumulated simultaneously when most of the nh4 was removed which confirmed not all of the nitrified nh4 was converted into nitrogen generally speaking the rate of nitrification is higher than that of denitrification throughout the entire snd process 33 thus the naa ought to be higher than the nia during the stable operation of snd sbbr which is consistent with the results of this study fig 3 after the initial addition of cap stage ii naa did not decrease but increased with decreasing ar this result suggested that 10 mg l cap inhibited the denitrification so that no3 obtained by nitrification further accumulated rather than being removed according to a literature report the electron turnover rate of no3 reductase was higher than that of no2 reductase hence the reduction of no2 was the rate limiting step in denitrification and rapid reduction of no3 was a common phenomenon 34 generally no2 accumulation was the result of incomplete denitrification thus denitrification was strongly inhibited during stage ii and nia decreased significantly at stage iii naa and nia showed opposite trends specifically naa decreased by about 3 mg l and nia increased by about 0 02 mg l on the one hand the biofilm gradually adapted to wastewater containing cap so the inhibition by cap of denitrification was alleviated on the other hand in an environment of intermittent aeration cap could act as an electron donor and carbon source during the nitrogen removal process which would promote no3 removal and cause naa to decrease 35 as the denitrification increased no2 as the intermediate correspondingly appeared to accumulate when the cap concentration was 20 mg l stage iv the toxicity increased and its effect on snd sbbr exceeded the adaptability of the biofilm the naa and nia increased by 1 5 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively that may also be due to high concentration cap stimulating further growth of cap degrading functional bacteria that competed with the denitrifiers and despoiled more nutrients in snd sbbr consequently carbon sources were inadequate for complete denitrification and a slight accumulation of no2 occurred feng et al reported that florfenicol was also beneficial to the accumulation of no3 in snd sbbr which was similar to the findings in this study whereas florfenicol promoted no2 accumulation at the same time 29 which was the opposite to the results found in this study it can be seen that the effect of florfenicol on snd sbbr was not completely the same as that of cap in this study which may be caused by different types of antibiotics and differences in bacterial community structure 3 2 variations in sour nitrifying rate and denitrifying rate under cap stress sour can intuitively reflect the activities of aerobes in aerobic wastewater treatment technologies thereby demonstrating the nitrification activity and organic oxidization process 12 as shown in fig 4a sour displayed a gradual decline with the gradual increase in cap concentration which was 38 2 30 1 27 9 23 3 mg o 2 g 1mlss h 1 at 0 10 15 20 mg l cap stage respectively by comparison with 0 mg l cap stage i there was a reduction of 14 9 mg o2 g 1mlss h 1 for sour at 20 mg l which proved that cap inhibited the activities of aerobes in the snd sbbr that is to say the activities of heterotrophic microbes and nitrifiers were both inhibited and the removal of organics and nitrification weakened the extent of the sour decline from stage i to stage ii was much larger than that of later stages mostly because the biofilm had adapted to an environment containing cap after the addition of cap at the beginning of stage ii so that cap degrading bacteria were present in the microbial community which weakened the impact of increasing cap concentrations on the aerobes similar to cap other antibiotics such as tetracycline 26 36 sulfadiazine 30 and fluprofen also exhibited inhibition of sour in the biofilm and activated sludge 29 from stage i to stage iv saor decreased from 5 5 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 4 6 mg n g 1mlss h 1 and snor decreased from 6 2 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 5 0 mg n g 1mlss h 1 fig 4b which indicated cap inhibited the activities of both aob and nob in the sbbr this was consistent with the above result that the average stable ar decreased with increasing cap concentration likewise due to the biofilm adaptability to cap the extents of decline of snor and saor from stage i to stage ii were the steepest wang et al showed that tetracycline also reduced saor and snor in the anoxic aerobic sequencing batch reactor and inhibited the activities of aob and nob 26 by comparison with 0 mg l when the concentration of cap was 20 mg l saor and snor decreased by 16 4 and 19 4 respectively this suggested the inhibitory effect of cap on nob was slightly stronger than that on aob snrr and snirr also decreased with increasing cap concentration fig 4c from stage i to stage iv snrr decreased from 14 8 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 9 1 mg n g 1mlss h 1 and snirr decreased from 16 7 mg n g 1mlss h 1 to 10 8 mg n g 1mlss h 1 which indicated that cap had an inhibitory effect on denitrification and denitrifiers no3 reducing bacteria and no2 reducing bacteria in the snd sbbr when the cap concentration was 15 mg l there was less inhibition compared with 10 mg l the reason for this phenomenon may be that as the sbbr running time increased the abundances and expression levels of cap resistance genes in denitrifying bacteria increased thus the denitrifiers exhibited adaptability to cap furthermore when the cap concentration further increased to 20 mg l the inhibition by cap of denitrifiers further intensified therefore snrr and snirr were further reduced in addition both snrr and snirr were much higher than saor and snor at all cap concentrations and this was consistent with the fact that there was no excess no3 n or no2 n accumulation in the system at any stage moreover snirr was always higher than snrr which indicates that no2 n accumulation was always lower than no3 n accumulation in the snd sbbr 3 3 degradation efficiency of cap cap was degraded efficiently after being added to the snd sbbr in stages ii to iv fig 5 a portion of cap was degraded when it was added initially suggesting that some bacteria attached to the biofilm probably had the ability to degrade organics with the continuous operation of the snd sbbr at stage ii the cpr increased constantly and gradually stabilized at 9 58 mg l 32 days later the average stable cprs were 12 95 and 19 47 mg l at stages iii and iv respectively which implied that the snd sbbr exhibited the best degradation performance in degrading 20 mg l cap thus wastewater containing 20 mg l cap might be the optimum environment for culturing cap degrading bacteria whenever the cap concentration altered in the initial phases of stages iii and iv cpr decreased abruptly which demonstrated that the activities of cap degrading bacteria were inhibited temporarily when the cap concentration increased nevertheless as the functional bacteria adapted to the cap concentration cpr increased gradually and steadily the average stable cpr increased by 3 38 mg l approximately from stage ii to stage iii and from stage iii to stage iv it increased by 6 52 mg l the latter increase exceeded 5 mg l which was the variation in the influent cap concentration this phenomenon might be caused by the functional bacteria cap degrading bacteria being enriched over the course of stage ii and stage iii which resulted in better adaptability of the biofilm to 20 mg l cap at stage iv thus the snd sbbr achieved the best cap degradation performance and cpr reached a peak at stage iv generally in cap degradation system the cap degradation process was supposed to occur nitro reduction and dichlorination successively 37 39 the former is achieved in the presence of nitro reductase catalytic system while the latter is carried out in the presence of microbial reductive dehalogenases or other terminal oxidoreductases 39 due to the fact that the antibiotic properties are heavily influenced by the no2 functional group on the cap molecule 40 the nitro reduction can convert the nitroaromatics to aromatic amines which have less toxicity 40 thus the degradation process in sbbr can significantly alleviate the antibacterial activity and biotoxicity of cap 3 4 microbial community analysis 3 4 1 microbial community richness diversity and similarity the shannon diversity abundance based coverage estimator ace simpson index and chao 1 richness are listed in table 1 these indices demonstrate the microbial richness and diversity at different cap concentrations in the snd sbbr generally low simpson and high shannon indices indicate an increase in α diversity 41 and richness increases with increases in the ace and chao 1 indices as table 1 shows the richness of the acclimation sludge increased over time but its diversity decreased and this indicated that some functional bacteria were enriched so that the snd sbbr possessed an excellent ability to remove target pollutants next the α diversity first increased stage ii then decreased stage iii and finally increased stage iv but the richness showed the opposite trend the variations in richness and diversity depended on the relationship between the toxicity of cap and the adaptability of the bacteria to the wastewater during these stages the toxicity of cap inhibited the activity of functional bacteria which led to the decrease in microbial richness but it could also stimulate the growth of some new bacteria and increase the biodiversity as the bacteria gradually adapted to the cap toxicity the richness increased but some bacteria that were not able to adapt to cap were eliminated so that the α diversity decreased among these samples sample 20 displayed the highest shannon index and lowest simpson index which showed that the bacteria in stage iv were associated with the best capability of degrading cap this demonstrated that high biodiversity and low microbial richness were conducive to dechlorination this result was inconsistent with a previous study 42 which may have been caused by differences in various operating conditions such as reactor type inoculated sludge and influent water composition the total numbers of otus detected in the five samples of seed acclimation 10 15 and 20 were 5626 4057 3462 4952 and 4576 respectively table 1 a venn diagram fig 6a was used to count the numbers of common and unique otus in the five samples approximately 99 otus were shared among the five samples which was less than 10 of the total otus this meant that the number of bacteria not affected by cap toxicity was small besides the cap concentration caused differences in the microbial community structure resulting in significant quantitative changes in the unique otus in each sample the non metric multi dimensional scale nmds can describe the otherness between different samples as shown in fig 6b compared with seed acclimation and 20 10 and 15 displayed a high similarity in other words as the cap concentration increased from 10 mg l to 15 mg l the microbial community structure changed little in contrast an increase in cap either from zero or to high concentration 20 mg l significantly changed the microbial community structure 3 4 2 microbial community structure analysis fig 7 presents the taxonomic analysis of the five samples at the levels of phylum class and genus the most abundant phyla were proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria ignavibacteriae and chloroflexi this result was consistent with a previous report showing that proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes were dominant phyla in the same type of amide alcohol antibiotics wastewater 29 and the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria 45 08 61 09 34 93 52 22 38 98 in seed acclimation 10 15 20 respectively which plays a key role in removing nh4 n 43 this was also reflected in the decrease in the relative abundance of proteobacteria leading to a decline in ar however as the cap concentration increased the abundance of bacteroidetes with the same n removal function as proteobacteria first increased and then decreased and its relative abundances were 15 15 12 28 15 62 12 97 7 93 in the five stages respectively this consequence suggested that a low concentration of cap 10 mg l could slightly promote the growth of bacteroidetes but a high concentration of cap with higher toxicity could inhibit the activity of bacteroidetes and reduce its relative abundance so that naa and nia increased and the n removal effect of the snd sbbr was influenced in addition to the above mentioned phyla the relative abundances of other phyla also changed significantly the relative abundance of firmicutesfirmicutes was significantly increased under the influence of cap toxicity that might be because bacteria belonging to firmicutes had acquired antibiotic resistance genes or the ability to degrade the cap so that they could better adapt to the cap environment meanwhile this was in line with a previous report which stated that could resist some extreme environments and enable a reactor to operate stably 44 it is worth noting that cap inhibited actinobacteria and ignavibacteriae substantially as shown by the decreases in their relative abundances however their relative abundances were still high under high cap concentration actinobacteria can synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites and carry antibiotic resistance genes which would help to better degrade cap and adapt to an antibiotic environment compared with other bacteria 45 moreover ignavibacteriae were also found to degrade high molecular weight compounds to reduce no3 in the anaerobic denitrification process 45 in contrast the populations of candidatus saccharibacteria and chloroflexi were enhanced by cap their relative abundances were 2 36 0 52 9 36 2 39 0 91 and 5 53 0 3 1 22 0 44 0 88 in the five stages respectively to date information about the ecological role of candidatus saccharibacteria in ecosystems is limited nevertheless some studies have shown that it has become the dominant phylum in many wastewater biological treatment processes especially during the treatment of chlorinated organic wastewater 46 moreover it was reported that chloroflexi is a facultative anaerobe that can decompose organics and participate in the n removal process 47 as shown in fig 7b betaproteobacteria bacteroidia negativicutes clostridia deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria ignavibacteria sphingobacteria and bacilli were the most abundant classes among these betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria all belong to proteobacteria as these classes contain many nitrifying genera aob nob 46 their decreasing relative abundances under the influence of cap led to the inhibition of the removal of nh4 and a decrease in ar the betaproteobacteria also have excellent no3 removal capability because they contain a number of denitrifying and other n removing functional bacteria 48 its relative abundance was 10 13 53 08 20 67 41 24 and 24 42 in the five stages the addition of cap inhibited the activity of betaproteobacteria but these bacteria quickly adapted to the wastewater displaying significant increases in relative abundance when the cap concentration was 15 mg l this could also explain why the recovery time of the biofilm at stage ⅲ was significantly shortened overall the variations in relative abundance of betaproteobacteria were completely consistent with the trend of the cap effect on denitrification of the snd sbbr as reflected by the variations in the naa cap reduced the relative abundances of ignavibacteria and sphingobacteria which was consistent with previous research on florfenicol 29 it could be concluded that these two classes could not tolerate and adapt to antibiotic toxicity thus affecting the n removal performance according to previous reports bacteroidia 0 46 11 81 15 21 12 3 8 99 and clostridia 0 76 2 04 11 17 7 44 6 01 in the five stages are closely related to the degradation of organics 29 they could not perform their functions better in a high cap concentration environment owing to the variations in their relative abundances in contrast negativicutes and bacilli both belonging to firmicutes showed continuous increases in their relative abundances which were 0 6 0 96 4 81 5 28 20 13 and 0 15 0 4 0 41 1 47 5 07 in the five samples respectively previous reports had mentioned that negativicutes and bacilli are dechlorinated classes 49 the variations in their relative abundances explained why the cpre was highest at stage iv as their relative abundances were highest in sample 20 the detailed analysis of the microbial community structures in the five samples at genus level is presented in fig 7c similar to the analysis at class level the relative abundances of the dominant bacteria at genus level were significantly diverse and the dominant genera included brachymonas megasphaera desulfovibrio actinomyces saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis paludibacter lactococcus treponema and anaeroarcus brachymonas 0 02 51 52 19 66 37 71 22 7 in the five samples is a denitrifier 29 and its variations in abundance caused by the different cap concentrations led to the trend of naa first increasing and then decreasing in addition to brachymonas paludibacter and saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis also play important roles in denitrification and the latter was the key bacterial genus for the conversion of no3 to no2 in some biological nitrogen removal reactors 48 50 according to a previous report megasphaera contributed to hydrogen fermentation while the biofilm could use hydrogen as an electronic intermediary to degrade cap 51 moreover desulfovibrio 0 02 0 96 7 83 4 19 7 77 lactococcus 0 08 0 4 0 41 1 45 5 03 and anaeroarcus 0 01 0 07 0 66 0 75 2 13 in the five samples are all commonly identified dechlorinating bacteria 52 54 their relative abundances were highest when the cap concentration was 20 mg l which could also explain the peak in cpr at stage iv both actinomyces and treponema had been reported as organics removing bacteria 55 56 and their activities were inhibited by cap toxicity which was manifested by the decreasing trend in their relative abundances that might also be the reason for the gradual decline of cr it should be noted that the additions of cap increased the proportions of the unclassified microbes at three different taxonomic levels nevertheless the abundances of the unclassified microbes decreased with increases in the cap concentration which was also reported by 57 these unclassified bacteria might be new bacteria that have not been identified or fully studied hence it would be of great significance to explore the taxonomic composition of these bacteria at the genetic level and the influence of antibiotics on them 58 4 conclusion cap inhibited the cod removal performance and nitrification in the snd sbbr in this study for denitrification however 10 and 20 mg l cap had an inhibitory effect while 15 mg l cap showed a weak inhibition due to the adaptability of biofilm to cap toxicity in addition the adaptation and recovery time of the reactor was the shortest after adding 15 mg l cap and the degradation of cap was the highest at 20 mg l concentration overall the sour of the biofilm declined under cap stress but the nitrifying rate and denitrifying rate initially displayed a trend of decreasing and then increasing and finally decreasing moreover cap obviously affected the bacterial community and the relative abundances of the dominant bacteria were different at different cap concentrations declaration of competing interest
